0,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/11/us/politics/national-emergency-risks-trump.html,"WASHINGTON -- President Trump has stepped back from declaring a national emergency to pay for a border wall, under pressure from congressional Republicans, his own lawyers and advisers, who say using it as a way out of the government shutdown does not justify the precedent it would set and the legal questions it could raise.

""If today the national emergency is border security, tomorrow the national emergency might be climate change,"" Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, one of the idea's critics, said this week. Another Republican, Senator Mitt Romney of Utah, told an interviewer that declaring a national emergency should be reserved for ""the most extreme circumstances.""

Mr. Trump, who according to aides has grown increasingly frustrated over the refusal of Democrats to bend and sees the shutdown as a road with no off-ramp in sight, hinted on Friday that the warnings were having an effect.

""What we're not looking to do right now is national emergency,"" he told reporters gathered in the Cabinet Room as the shutdown approached its fourth week. Minutes later he contradicted himself, saying that he would declare a state of emergency if he had to.

As Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senator Chuck Schumer, the minority leader, have proved immune to Mr. Trump's threats, the idea of using the president's constitutional powers to declare an emergency has received close scrutiny in the White House because it would enable Mr. Trump to obtain the $5.7 billion he has sought for construction of a wall without the approval of Congress.

Instead, Mr. Trump would use his authority to transfer funds to the wall that were appropriated by Congress for other purposes. Toward that end, the Army Corps of Engineers has been directed to study whether it can divert about $13.9 million in emergency aide set aside for Puerto Rico, Florida, Texas and California. And with the money secured, the president could drop his opposition to the appropriations bills whose passage would end the shutdown.

That would allow Mr. Trump to say he had never backed down from his fight with congressional Democrats or abandoned his pledge to build the wall even if the construction became tied up in legal challenges.

Former White House aides, who noted that Mr. Trump did not focus on the wall during the first two years of his presidency, said the optics of fighting for the wall were more important to the president than erecting it.

But opposition has come from many Republican quarters. Some conservatives see it as an unacceptable extension of executive power. Kellyanne Conway, a White House aide, has said it would essentially give Congress a pass. Representative Mike Simpson, Republican of Idaho and a member of the House Appropriations Committee, said it was not clear to him that an emergency declaration would even lead to the prompt reopening of the government.

He called it ""a bad escape hatch"" that was ""going to piss off a lot of members.""

Mr. Trump's reluctance is also frustrating allies ginning him up to take action. ""If it's a crisis, treat it like a crisis,"" Stephen K. Bannon, the former chief White House strategist, said in an interview. ""His best option now is to declare a national security emergency and get on with it.""

On Thursday, Mr. Trump traveled to the border in Texas to dramatize his support for a wall but used a photo-op along the banks of the Rio Grande on Thursday only to repeat his familiar arguments for building it. He sidestepped the issue when Sean Hannity, the Fox News host, asked him in an interview that night to detail what a national emergency would look like.

""There's some compromise needed,"" Mr. Trump said.

But Mr. Trump, who allies said was eager to spend time at his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida and resented the advice of aides to deliver an Oval Office address and travel to Texas on Thursday, is left with few good options.

As he searches for a way to end the political stalemate with Democratic lawmakers, Mr. Trump is finding himself boxed in, in a familiar position when it comes to immigration issues. Former aides say that is because he conflates legal and policy issues with public relations campaigns and does not anticipate an endgame.

In March, Mr. Trump was facing pressure to meet a deadline on a decision about what to do with immigrants who were part of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which allowed young adults brought to the United States illegally as children to avoid deportation and become eligible for a work permit.

Racked by anxiety as he quizzed aides for advice, Mr. Trump turned to an adviser and asked, ""How do I get out of this?""

In the end, Mr. Trump was saved, at least temporarily, by a federal appeals court ruling last year that he could not immediately end the program. Mr. Trump moved on.

In the opening weeks of his presidency, Mr. Trump issued an executive order banning citizens from seven majority-Muslim countries from entering the United States. That ban was almost immediately halted in court. A second, rewritten version, however, was upheld by the Supreme Court and was seen as at least a partial victory for the administration.

But Mr. Trump vented, privately and publicly, that the version that passed legal muster was ""watered down"" and ""P.C.,"" and made him look ""weak.""

How Mr. Trump found himself in his most recent predicament can be traced back to September, when White House aides and conservative lawmakers urged the president to engage in a fight for wall funding. But he was told to postpone the fight until after the election, to avoid forcing vulnerable Republicans in swing districts to take a politically perilous stance on the wall.

When he looked like he might compromise and support a bill that provided far less money for the wall than he asked for, conservatives like Ann Coulter excoriated him, describing him as ""gutless,"" and he backed down. Soon he was telling Mr. Schumer and Ms. Pelosi during a televised Oval Office meeting last month that he would proudly ""own the shutdown,"" thrilling conservatives.

Buoyed by the praise, and encouraged by the acting White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, Mr. Trump decided to keep digging in.

But that encouragement for what played well in a viral television moment never led to a coherent strategy for a prolonged stalemate, according to a half-dozen people in the White House or working with the administration on a way to end the shutdown.

Mr. Trump's allies insist that he is winning the political battle.

""Democrats are boxed in,"" said Greg Mueller, a conservative strategist. ""Every time the president and G.O.P. go to the Democrats with a fix, they say no, which positions them as obstructionists ignoring the problem, and opening themselves up for major troubles in 2020.""

Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, who had tried and failed to find an alternative to reopen the government earlier in the week, emerged from a meeting with Mr. Trump on Friday declaring that it was clear Democrats ""don't want to make a deal and will never support border wall/barriers.""

And he encouraged the exact action many of his colleagues were warning against. ""Mr. President, declare a national emergency now,"" he said. ""Build a wall now.""

Mr. Trump's aides said they expected the stalemate over the wall funding to be resolved by the time he delivers the State of the Union address on Jan. 29. But the White House also has drafts based on the shutdown being over -- or well into its sixth week."
1,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/27/us/politics/trump-troops-iraq-germany.html,"WASHINGTON -- During his surprise visit to American troops in Iraq and Germany this week, President Trump singled out red ""Make America Great Again"" caps in a sea of military fatigues, signed a ""Trump 2020"" patch and accused Representative Nancy Pelosi and other leading Democrats of being weak on border security.

Now the president is facing accusations that he was playing politics with the military.

""When that starts happening, it's like the politicalization of the judicial branch,"" said Mark Hertling, a retired three-star Army lieutenant general.

Visiting troops abroad is a presidential tradition in which the commander in chief puts aside politics to thank a military that represents a broad spectrum of the country. But Mr. Trump's political comments and his encouragement of supporters in the crowd shattered those norms.

""He has to understand that there exist some audiences that should not be addressed as part of his base, because they are not,"" Mr. Hertling said. ""It's a violation of protocol by the president.""

Then there was the president's boast, which was incorrect, that the troops would be getting their first raise in more than a decade thanks to his leadership.

""You haven't gotten one in more than 10 years -- more than 10 years,"" he told about 100 uniformed troops at Al Asad Air Base in Iraq. ""And we got you a big one. I got you a big one."" In fact, the military has received steady pay increases for decades.

Mr. Trump also turned a customary Christmas greeting into a broadside against Democrats, who are refusing to fund a wall along the southern border. The stalemate over the wall, Mr. Trump's signature campaign promise, has resulted in a partial government shutdown.

""I don't know if you folks are aware of what's happening,"" Mr. Trump said. ""We want to have strong borders in the United States. The Democrats don't want to let us have strong borders.""

""You know why?"" he added. ""Because I want it.""

Mr. Trump joked that his solution to obtaining funding for a wall was to claim that he did not want one anymore. ""Tell Nancy Pelosi I don't want the wall,"" he said, adding: ""And then we get the wall. That's another way of doing it.""

""You're fighting for borders in other countries, and they don't want to fight, the Democrats, for the border of our country,"" he added. ""It doesn't make a lot of sense.""

Ms. Pelosi's deputy chief of staff, Drew Hammill, accused Mr. Trump of turning uniformed troops into scenery for a campaign speech. ""He offered our brave men and women in uniform the bitter insult of using them as political pawns to push his radical right-wing, anti-immigrant agenda,"" Mr. Hammill said. ""The president turned his first visit to our troops into another cringe-worthy Donald Trump reality-show special.""

Some commentators on Fox News also criticized the president for injecting politics into the event.

""He talked about the border wall as well, which didn't have a place there,"" Julie Banderas, a Fox News contributor, said on the show ""Outnumbered."" Another Fox News contributor on the show, Jessica Tarlov, criticized the president for using the visit ""as a campaign rally.""

The political paraphernalia on display, which Mr. Trump appeared to encourage during his speech by referencing the caps he had signed, has raised questions at the Defense Department about violations of military protocol by the troops who greeted him. One woman in uniform at Ramstein Air Base in Germany, for instance, welcomed Mr. Trump with a ""Make America Great Again"" flag, according to a photograph posted on Twitter by a Bloomberg News reporter who accompanied Mr. Trump on the trip.

A directive from the department prohibits active-duty personnel from engaging in ""partisan political activities"" and advises that ""all military personnel should avoid the inference that their political activities imply or appear to imply DoD sponsorship, approval or endorsement of a political candidate, campaign or cause."" Defense Department and Army regulations also prohibit military personnel from showing any political leanings while in uniform, Mr. Hertling said.

An official said the department was aware of the situation and ""trying to figure it out"" by tracking down photographs of troops holding red caps and campaign flags, and piecing together where the campaign paraphernalia came from.

Mr. Trump said on Thursday that he could not turn down any requests from the soldiers. ""If these brave young people ask me to sign their hat, I will sign,"" he tweeted. ""Can you imagine my saying NO? We brought or gave NO hats as the Fake News first reported!""

The White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, said administration officials did not distribute any campaign gear to the troops, and noted that ""these were their personal belongings.""

On her Twitter feed, Ms. Sanders addressed a CNN.com report that raised questions about whether the red caps displayed for Mr. Trump to sign may have violated a military rule.

""CNN will attack anyone who supports President Trump, including the brave men and women of our military who fight everyday to protect our freedom,"" Ms. Sanders wrote. She declined to comment further on the president's speech.

In his remarks, Mr. Trump also boasted that he had secured ""billions and billions of dollars of new equipment"" for the military.

""You're getting such new equipment, your eyes are popping, right?"" he asked the troops."
2,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/14/us/politics/white-house-government-shutdown.html,"WASHINGTON -- As he prepared to finally emerge from the White House on Monday morning, after days of complaining that he had been cooped up there waiting for Democrats to negotiate with him to end a 24-day government shutdown, President Trump momentarily seemed to forget where he was headed.

""Getting ready to address the Farm Convention today in Nashville, Tennessee,"" the president said in a Twitter message. ""See you in a little while.""

Farmers in Tennessee would have to wait: Mr. Trump was actually scheduled to visit an agricultural conference in Louisiana on Monday. And when he did, he was on the ground for little more than two hours before flying back to the White House.

Mr. Trump has made it a repeated point of pride that he has been confined to the capital in recent weeks while waiting for his Democratic adversaries to give in and agree to spending $5.8 billion on his border wall, but he has actually been stuck in what his allies say is an uncomfortable limbo. It has made him wax wistfully about being unable to visit Mar-a-Lago, his gilded bunker by the sea where if members disagree with him on anything -- from the firmness of the house meatloaf recipe to his isolationist approach to foreign allies -- they tend to keep those opinions to themselves.

So, unable to resume his weekend routine of soliciting friendly advice from club members on the patio or spending sunny mornings at his nearby golf club, Mr. Trump has tried to make the snowy confines of Washington feel more like his Palm Beach cocoon.

The results are mixed.

Since the shutdown began Dec. 22, Mr. Trump has left the White House fewer than 10 times. He has shared his shut-in routine with America: When not at work in the Oval Office, he has frittered away the hours by watching the multiple flat-screen TVs installed in the White House residence, gazing out of secured windows, tweeting at his enemies and phoning his friends.

""Wish I could share with everyone the beauty and majesty of being in the White House and looking outside at the snow filled lawns and Rose Garden,"" Mr. Trump tweeted on Sunday as the chaos of an embittered capital was all but silenced by snow. Melania Trump, the first lady, then shared a photo of the wintry wonderland to give Americans a visual.

But the flurry of tweets Mr. Trump sent shortly afterward attacking assorted perceived foes, including Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, his first announced Democratic opponent in 2020 and the billionaire Jeff Bezos, seemed to show that not even the most dedicated of homebody presidents is immune from a bout of cabin fever.

""I think it was harmful to him psychologically that he didn't make it down here over the holidays,"" Laurence Leamer, a longtime Palm Beach resident who has known Mr. Trump since the 1990s and has written a book on Mar-a-Lago, wrote in an email. ""Despite his impulsive exterior, he's a man of routine, and that's what Mar-a-Lago is all about.""

Both Mr. Trump and White House officials have said that he would remain in Washington for as long as the shutdown persists, though allies expect him to give in and make an appearance in Palm Beach over the long Martin Luther King Jr. Day weekend.

In a statement, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, Mr. Trump's press secretary, said the president was at work whether he was at the White House, one of his ""personal properties"" or riding on Air Force One.

""The president is always working,"" Ms. Sanders said. ""During the time leading up to the shutdown and since, he has been almost entirely at the White House working to find solutions to deal with the humanitarian and national security crisis at our southern border.""

Democrats, Ms. Sanders added, ""have spent their time at beach resorts, watching Broadway shows and attending cocktail receptions with lobbyists.""

Ms. Sanders was referring to a trip organized by the political arm of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, which flew three dozen or so House members to San Juan for two days of receptions and meetings on the damage to the island from Hurricane Maria as well as a performance of ""Hamilton"" with its creator, Lin-Manuel Miranda. Although Republicans said Speaker Nancy Pelosi was one of those attending, a spokesman said she, like the president, stayed in Washington for the weekend.

A person familiar with the president's thinking who spoke on the condition of anonymity described Mr. Trump as both a ""workaholic"" and a ""homebody."" The president, that person said, has been sensitive to the criticism that he is vacationing when he visits his assorted properties on the weekends, when in fact that has been his preferred mode of weekending for decades.

Stuck in Washington over the weekend, Mr. Trump called into Fox News personality Jeanine Pirro's TV show to remind Americans that he was still in work mode.

In a lengthy phone call with Ms. Pirro on Saturday evening, the president angrily defended his demand for $5 billion in border wall funding and attacked news reports that the F.B.I. has conducted an investigation into whether or not he has worked on behalf of Russia.

And the president stated once again that he relished the idea of stewing at home alone.

""I like the symbol of me being here and them being at some play in a nice location having a good time,"" Mr. Trump said, joining in the bashing of the Puerto Rico trip.

The last time Mr. Trump visited Puerto Rico, he was panned for throwing paper towels into a crowd.

""I haven't actually left the White House in months,"" Mr. Trump said to Ms. Pirro before acknowledging that he had in fact left. ""I've been here virtually every night, I guess every night other than one day I flew to Iraq and then to Germany to see our troops.""

Mr. Trump has long enjoyed puttering around his homes, said Timothy O'Brien, the author of the 2005 book ""TrumpNation: The Art of Being the Donald."" The president does not enjoy extensive travel, or sleeping or eating under a roof that is not his own, and he has long imported friends and associates to visit him for dinner.

""Before he was president,"" Mr. O'Brien wrote in an email, ""he favored the familiar because it allowed an antisocial teetotaler to mingle selectively with other people -- on his own terms and under his control -- before retreating back inside to do what he enjoys spending most of his time doing: sitting in front of a TV with a cheeseburger watching sports.""

Mr. Leamer, the author, said that Mr. Trump is ""as isolated as any public figure could conceivably be,"" and added that Mr. Trump's gregarious exterior masked the habits of a loner.

""He has walled himself off from the rest of the world,"" Mr. Leamer said. ""He loves to go out and receive the accolades of his adoring supporters, but as soon as the applause dies out, he's back into his own private world.""

At the conference in New Orleans on Monday, Mr. Trump received a standing ovation -- the same reception he gets whenever supporters spot him at Mar-a-Lago. He praised the New Orleans Saints and bragged that an ally had placed about 100 phone calls to make sure that he would actually turn up.

Then he returned to Washington for another at-home event -- welcoming members of the Clemson University football team to the White House to celebrate their national championship last year.

The president greeted reporters in the White House dining room, where he proudly displayed a table piled high with burgers from McDonald's, Wendy's, and Burger King. Another table in back was covered with Domino's pizza and fries.

Ms. Sanders had an explanation for the menu, putting it in political terms. ""Because the Democrats refuse to negotiate on border security, much of the residence staff at the White House is furloughed -- so the president is personally paying for the event to be catered with some of everyone's favorite fast foods.""

Mr. Trump himself called it ""great American food."" But maybe it was really something else -- comfort food for a president who feels stuck at home."
3,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/11/briefing/government-shutdown-mike-pompeo-jayme-closs.html,"Good morning,

We start today with breaking news from Syria, as well as the latest from the government shutdown, which is now tied for the longest in history. And it's Friday, so there's a new news quiz.

Breaking

The U.S. began withdrawing troops from Syria today, an American military spokesman said.

White House sees storm aid as a way to build a wall

The Trump administration is considering diverting $13.9 billion allocated last year for areas damaged by hurricanes and wildfires to pay for a wall on the southwestern border. That's according to congressional and Defense Department officials with knowledge of the matter, who insisted on anonymity to discuss the possibility.

Officials are debating whether they could make such a move without a declaration of a national emergency. President Trump has repeatedly said he might declare one in order to bypass Congress, where Democrats have declined to fund a wall.

Yesterday: Mr. Trump visited the border city of McAllen, Tex., to make his case.

Go deeper: Two Times journalists are driving the length of the 1,900-mile border. Their first dispatch is from Brownsville, Tex.

The Daily: On today's episode, hear from a sheriff in Arizona who supports Mr. Trump's plans.

Government shutdown nears a record

The partial closure that has resulted from the impasse over a border wall would become the longest in history on Saturday. Most of the 800,000 federal workers involved will miss a paycheck today.

On Thursday, Vice President Mike Pence made clear that President Trump would not support a deal to reopen the government before wall funding was secured. ""No wall, no deal,"" Mr. Pence said.

Impact: Farmers have generally stood by President Trump, but some say the loss of crucial loans, payments and other services during the shutdown is threatening their support.

The details: Here's what the shutdown does and doesn't affect, as well as a look at its growing consequences.

Oceans are warming faster than we thought

Water temperatures are rising 40 percent faster on average than a United Nations panel estimated five years ago, according to an analysis published on Thursday.

The oceans have been absorbing most of the heat trapped by greenhouse gas emissions, offering a buffer against climate change. The escalating temperatures are already killing off marine ecosystems, raising sea levels and making hurricanes more destructive.

The background: Historically, understanding ocean temperatures has been difficult. A 2014 U.N. report presented five estimates, all showing less ocean warming than the levels projected by computer climate models. The new analysis incorporates more recent data, and its results are more in line with the models.

Mike Pompeo lays out a vision for the Middle East

The secretary of state told an audience in Cairo on Thursday that ""the age of self-inflicted American shame is over"" and that the U.S. would pursue a more activist policy in the Middle East, despite President Trump's move to withdraw troops from Syria.

Mr. Pompeo sharply criticized former President Barack Obama, saying he had ""fundamental misunderstandings"" about the region that ""underestimated the tenacity and viciousness of radical Islamism."" In a speech in 2009, also in Cairo, Mr. Obama made an effort to reset relations with the Muslim world in the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks and the Iraq war.

Closer look: Mr. Pompeo's speech contrasted starkly with Mr. Obama's. We compared the two.

News analysis: The Trump administration on Thursday ""explicitly favored foreign autocrats over elected American leaders,"" one of our White House correspondents writes. Mr. Pompeo praised Egypt's repressive president, and Mr. Trump later said that the Chinese were ""far more honorable"" than Democratic congressional leaders.

If you have 35 minutes, this is worth itThe nature of beauty

For decades, the centerpiece of evolutionary theory has been that creatures with the most advantageous traits have the best chance of multiplying. Beauty -- so far as a reproductive mate was concerned -- was merely a shorthand for those traits.

Charles Darwin himself never thought that explained everything. Now biologists are revisiting his theory that animals can appreciate beauty for its own sake.

Here's what else is happening

Missing girl is found: Jayme Closs, 13, disappeared in October on the night that her parents were shot to death in their rural Wisconsin home. She was found alive on Thursday, the authorities said. A suspect was in custody.

Huawei arrest: The Polish authorities have charged a Chinese employee of Huawei, the telecommunications giant, and a Polish national with spying for China, officials said today. The arrests come as the U.S. and its allies have tried to restrict the use of Chinese technology based on espionage fears.

Michael Cohen in Congress: President Trump's former personal lawyer said on Thursday that he would give ""a full and credible account"" of his work for Mr. Trump to a House committee next month.

Inauguration scrutiny: Federal prosecutors are investigating at least a dozen Ukrainians who were present during President Trump's inaugural festivities. Some of them, or their allies, are thought to have promoted proposals aligned with Russia's interests.

New Carlos Ghosn accusations: Japanese prosecutors brought fresh charges of financial wrongdoing today against the former head of the automaking alliance of Nissan, Renault and Mitsubishi. He is in jail in Tokyo.

Snapshot: Above, Venezuelans at the inauguration of President Nicolás Maduro, who was sworn in on Thursday for a second term. He has been able to retain power despite a plummeting economy, skyrocketing violence and an election that was widely seen as illegitimate.

Andy Murray retirement: The former No. 1 player and three-time Grand Slam champion announced today that he would end his tennis career after Wimbledon, if not sooner.

News quiz: Did you follow the headlines this week? Test yourself.

Late-night comedy: Jimmy Fallon discussed the government shutdown. ""Everyone's fighting. People are exhausted. There's no end in sight. It's basically like playing a game of Monopoly with your family.""

What we're reading: This reprint of an article in Appalachia, a mountaineering and conservation journal. ""You're hiking high up a frigid mountain, storm clouds are gathering, and you come across a trail of fresh prints in the snow, made by someone in decidedly unwinter-y sneakers,"" writes Michael Wines, a national correspondent. ""What would you do? This woman did what many would not. It's quite a yarn.""

And now for the Back Story on ...A gathering of Sherlock Holmes fans

The game is afoot this weekend for the Baker Street Irregulars, a literary society devoted to Sherlock Holmes that is holding its annual dinner in New York City.

Founded in 1934, the Irregulars are named for a group of street urchins who assist Holmes in some of Arthur Conan Doyle's 60 stories about the fictional detective.

The group, which is invitation only, has about 300 members around the world and publishes a quarterly journal of Sherlockian scholarship.

The Irregulars' dinner tonight is part of a five-day celebration in Manhattan featuring a lecture, a memorabilia sale and parties with other groups of Sherlock Holmes fans, including the Baker Street Babes. (The first female members of the Irregulars weren't admitted until the early 1990s.)

The event is timed to coincide with Holmes's birthday, which enthusiasts have generally agreed is Jan. 6 -- although the reasoning is far from elementary.

That's it for this briefing. Have a good weekend.

4,the guardian,http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jan/12/trump-tweets-fbi-russia-new-york-times-james-comey,"Donald Trump produced a torrent of misleading tweets on Saturday to deny the stunning claim that he was secretly working on behalf of Russia.

In a front page story extraordinary even by the tumultuous standards of the Trump era, the New York Times reported that the FBI launched an investigation into whether the US president was acting as a Russian asset, against his own country's interests.

The investigation opened after Trump fired the FBI director James Comey in May 2017, the Times said, citing anonymous sources. It was part counterintelligence, to determine whether Trump was knowingly or unknowingly working for Moscow and posed a threat to national security. It was also part criminal, to ascertain whether Trump's dismissal of Comey constituted obstruction of justice.

The FBI effort was soon absorbed into the special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election and alleged collusion between Trump's campaign and Moscow, the Times reported, adding that it was unclear if the counterintelligence aspect is still being pursued.

Jesse McKinley, a New York Times journalist, wrote on Twitter: ""It sounds like spy fiction but it is not: the FBI was investigating the president of the United States to see if he was working for the Russians.""

The president tried to fight back in characteristic style, by firing off half a dozen intemperate tweets.

The first said: ""Wow, just learned in the Failing New York Times that the corrupt former leaders of the FBI, almost all fired or forced to leave the agency for some very bad reasons, opened up an investigation on me, for no reason & with no proof, after I fired Lyin' James Comey, a total sleaze!""

Trump went on make baseless claims that the FBI mishandled an investigation into his election rival, Hillary Clinton, and proclaimed: ""My firing of James Comey was a great day for America."" He suggested without evidence that Comey is being protected by Mueller, who has issued dozens of indictments and secured convictions of some of the Trump's close associates.

And he insisted: ""I have been FAR tougher on Russia than Obama, Bush or Clinton. Maybe tougher than any other President. At the same time, & as I have often said, getting along with Russia is a good thing, not a bad thing. I fully expect that someday we will have good relations with Russia again!""

Trump's warm relationship with the Russian president Vladimir Putin has long set alarm bells ringing. The day after firing Comey, he hosted Russia's foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, in the Oval Office - and disclosed intelligence from an Israeli counterterrorism operation. At a summit in Helsinki last summer, Trump appeared to side with Putin over his own intelligence agencies on the question of election interference.

More recently, the president startled his own national security officials by suddenly announcing the withdrawal of troops from Syria, widely seen as handing a strategic victory to Russia and prompting the defense secretary James Mattis to quit. He also bizarrely endorsed the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan in the 1980s.

Holed up at the White House with no official engagements, Trump then turned his Twitter feed to the other subject dominating US politics: a partial government shutdown which, in its 22nd day, is now the longest in American history, eclipsing the previous record set during the presidency of Bill Clinton.

Trump is demanding $5.7bn towards his long-promised wall on the US-Mexico border, claiming it will solve a humanitarian and national security crisis there. Democrats, who now control the House of Representatives, have passed measures to reopen the government without funding for the wall, which they regard as an expensive, impractical and immoral response to a manufactured crisis. The result is a political stalemate that leaves a quarter of the government unfunded.

About 800,000 workers missed pay cheques on Friday, many receiving blank pay statements instead. Some posted photos of their empty earnings statements on social media and complained that they are unable to pay bills. The House and Senate voted to give federal workers back pay whenever the federal government reopens, then left Washington for the weekend.

Miami's airport will close one of its concourses most of Saturday, Sunday and Monday to make sure security checkpoints are adequately staffed as the shutdown begins to strain the aviation system. Security screeners who are not being paid are staying at home and safety inspectors are off the job.

Some national park facilities are closed while rubbish has been piling up in those that remain open. The Smithsonian museums and national zoo in Washington are shuttered, a blow to tourism revenue. Nearly everyone at Nasa is being told to stay at home.

With opinion polls showing Trump getting most of the blame for the shutdown, Trump is toying with the idea of declaring a national emergency to bypass Congress and fund the wall from existing sources of federal revenue. Republicans are divided on the move and it would be certain to face legal challenges.

The president, who claims to be a master dealmaker, rattled off half a dozen tweets about the shutdown on Saturday, including the cryptic promise: ""I do have a plan on the Shutdown. But to understand that plan you would have to understand the fact that I won the election, and I promised safety and security for the American people. Part of that promise was a Wall at the Southern Border. Elections have consequences!""

The House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, who has vowed to oppose any funding, said the president is seeking to divert attention from Mueller's investigation and other White House troubles.

""This isn't a wall between Mexico and the United States,"" the Democrat told reporters this week. ""This is a wall between his failures of his administration. This is a big diversion and he's a master of diversion."""
5,bbc news,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-46748492,"Claim: Much of the wall has already been fully renovated or built. Mexico is paying for the wall through the new US-Mexico-Canada trade agreement.

Verdict: The border authorities say work has begun on building improved border security infrastructure. The money made available so far is largely tied to barrier designs that already exist. The trade agreement with Mexico and Canada is not yet in place and it's not clear how this would directly lead to revenue from Mexico to pay for the wall.

US President Donald Trump wants to spend billions of dollars building a wall along the US-Mexico border.

He needs the US Congress to approve the funding for his plan but he has come up against strong opposition, and the Democratic party doesn't want to stump up the money.

However, Mr Trump says there has already been significant progress.

Writing on Twitter he says ""much of the wall has already been fully renovated or built. We have done a lot of work.""

So, just how much has been built so far - and is Mexico paying?

Building a wall along the border with Mexico was one of Mr Trump's key election promises.

The White House says the wall is critical to stopping illegal immigrants and drugs entering the country.

The border is 1,954 miles (3,145 km) long, with about 650 miles of various types of fencing already in place through California, Arizona, New Mexico and Texas.

According to documents obtained by CNN at the beginning of 2018, officials told Congress that the Trump plan would mean 864 miles of new wall and 1,163 miles of replacement wall. It would cost $33bn (£26bn).

Why is President Trump talking about the wall now?

The current row between the president and Congress is over a spending package of more than $5bn (£3.9bn) for the wall.

But Democratic lawmakers in the House of Representatives have so far refused to agree to any additional funding for the wall. They have offered $1.3bn for border security, such as improved surveillance and fencing, but not the wall.

This funding for border security is part of a larger budget that Congress is trying to pass. The impasse has led to a partial government shutdown that began on 22 December.

Mr Trump has said he will not sign a bill to reopen government that doesn't include money for the wall.

At the end of last year the lower house, then controlled by Republicans, passed a bill that met the president's request, but it failed to get enough votes in the Senate.

What has been built along the border so far?

In January 2018, Mr Trump asked Congress to pay $18bn (£13.6bn) over the next decade for an initial phase of construction, but the bill ultimately failed.

Estimates for a cross-border wall range from $12-40bn.

In March last year Mr Trump secured $1.6bn from Congress for projects at the border.

The US Customs and Border Protection agency (CBP) has said this raised enough money to build approximately 100 miles of ""border wall system"".

In the months that followed, the CBP said it has replaced about 14 miles of scrap metal barrier with a ""bollard-style wall"" in San Diego, built two miles of ""primary wall"" in California and 20 miles of ""new border wall"" in Santa Teresa, New Mexico.

And in December 2018, the CBP contracted the US Army Corps of Engineers to construct up to 14 miles of ""secondary wall"" and up to 15 miles of primary pedestrian replacement wall in San Diego, Yuma, and El Centro Sectors.

The bill approved by Congress stipulated that funds could go on primary and secondary ""fencing"", barrier planning and design, and border security technology. And money could be spent on new and replacement barriers that had been approved in a previous spending bill.

So that means, for example, it could not be spent on developing prototypes of new walls that have been proposed by the president.

Is Mexico going to pay for it?

Mr Trump's position on how Mexico might pay for the wall has shifted considerably in recent months. During his campaign and at the beginning of his presidency he insisted that Mexico would directly pay for the border wall.

""I would build a great wall, and nobody builds walls better than me, believe me, and I'll build them very inexpensively,"" Trump said. ""I will build a great, great wall on our southern border and I'll have Mexico pay for that wall.""

Then towards the end of last year, he insisted that the wall would pay for itself:

""Could somebody please explain to the Democrats (we need their votes) that our Country loses 250 Billion Dollars a year on illegal immigration, not including the terrible drug flow. Top Border Security, including a Wall, is $25 Billion. Pays for itself in two months.""

He is now suggesting that Mexico ""is paying for the wall"" through the new US-Mexico-Canada trade deal.

Not only has the mechanism for this funding been largely unexplained, the deal is not in place yet and has yet to be ratified by Congress.

President Trump may believe that the new trade deal will reduce the trade deficit the US currently has with Mexico and will in the long run save the US money, which can be spent on the wall, says Andrew Hunter, senior US economist at Capital Economics.

""However, there is little direct relationship between a country's trade deficit and government finance,"" says Mr Hunter.

A second possibility is that the deal increases economic activity and could eventually boost government tax revenues.

But, adds Mr Hunter, ""the changes included in the agreement are relatively minor and unlikely to have much impact on the economy.""

President Trump has also floated the idea of invoking the Patriot Act to cut off or tax remittance payments to Mexico from Mexican immigrants living in the US.

These remittances could amount to as much as $25m a year according to the Banco de Mexico. But critics say this would be very difficult to implement and would face legal challenges.

He raised this plan as a way of putting pressure on the Mexican government to pay directly for the wall - something Mexico has categorically refused to do."

The New York Times on a judge's rebuke of Michael Flynn and President Donald Trump's charitable foundation:

A bit of common sense and common decency intruded on Tuesday into the crazy world of Donald Trump.

In New York, the state attorney general announced that the president had agreed that the ""charity"" he used as a piggy bank has no reason to exist.

In Washington, a federal judge let a former top presidential aide know that you can parrot political spin or you can tell the truth, but you can't do both to someone who can send you to prison.

Michael Flynn, Mr. Trump's former national security adviser, appeared before Judge Emmet Sullivan to be sentenced to what he expected would be a term of probation, after pleading guilty to lying to federal investigators about conversations with the Russian ambassador. The office of the special counsel, Robert Mueller, had earlier filed a memo that said it would be right for Mr. Flynn to avoid prison after his extensive cooperation in the investigation of Trump ties to Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential campaign and after.

Then last week, in a memo about their client's sentencing, Mr. Flynn's lawyers implied that he had been tricked into lying and that the F.B.I. acted improperly in interviewing him - points raised by pro-Trump commentators elaborating on the president's claims of being victimized by a witch hunt.

Judge Sullivan was having none of it.

""I cannot recall an instance of a court ever accepting a guilty plea from someone who did not maintain he was guilty,"" Judge Sullivan said, ""and I do not intend to start today.""

Chastened, Mr. Flynn told the judge that nobody tricked him, that he lied and that he knew he shouldn't have.

The judge was not upset only about Mr. Flynn's sneaky prevarication. He said he felt ""disgust"" at Mr. Flynn's offenses, that a retired three-star general would lie to the F.B.I. ""while on the physical premises of the White House,"" and, acting as an unregistered agent of a foreign country, Turkey, while he was an adviser to Mr. Trump (to which he admitted but was not charged). It was a bracing reminder of the brazenness of his misdeeds and of the standards the public should be able to expect of those who serve them.

Realizing that Judge Sullivan was considering a term of up to six months in prison, Mr. Flynn accepted his offer to delay the sentencing for 90 days until he has completed his cooperation with the special counsel.

""Good luck today in court to General Michael Flynn,"" Mr. Trump had tweeted first thing Tuesday morning.

""Thanks for nothing, Mr. President,"" Mr. Flynn might have thought as he left court.

Mr. Flynn should be grateful the judge offered him the chance to come clean. By contrast, the Donald J. Trump Foundation, a charity that provided no charity, quite properly received none from the New York attorney general's office.

Attorney General Barbara Underwood accused it of ""a shocking pattern of illegality"" that ""amounted to the Trump Foundation functioning as little more than a checkbook to serve Mr. Trump's business and political interests.""

Whatever money that remains will be disbursed under the supervision of Ms. Underwood's office and the judge overseeing the continuing lawsuit her office filed in June, seeking $2.8 million in restitution and a ban on Mr. Trump and his three oldest children serving on the boards of other nonprofit organizations.

In a series of stories exposing the foundation's true nature, The Washington Post found that its largest donation was to fix a fountain in front of the Plaza Hotel in Manhattan, which Mr. Trump owned at the time, that its funds were used to buy a portrait of Mr. Trump, and that it illegally provided political donations and paid for personal legal settlements.

All this comes just days after prosecutors announced that they believed that Mr. Trump had conspired with the owner of The National Enquirer and his fixer Michael Cohen to violate campaign finance laws by paying hush money to two women who said they had affairs with him. It's also just been reported that prosecutors are investigating spending by the Trump inaugural committee. The president still faces lawsuits on the constitutionality of his enriching himself while in office. Meanwhile, the special counsel's inquiry may be expanding rather than winding down.

It's fitting that despite all his bluster and threats, a president who's demonstrated such contempt for the rule of law is finding it so formidable.

That this goes to the essence of American governance was best summed up by Paula Duncan, the Trump enthusiast who was among the jurors who found Mr. Trump's former campaign chief Paul Manafort guilty of fraud, even though she had hoped he wouldn't be convicted.

Explaining her decision after the verdict, she told Fox News, ""No one's above the law.""

The Wall Street Journal on a judge's ruling on the Affordable Care Act's individual mandate:

No one opposes ObamaCare more than we do, and Democrats are now confirming that it was designed as a way-station to government-run health care. But a federal judge's ruling that the law is unconstitutional is likely to be overturned on appeal and may boomerang politically on Republicans.

Judge Reed O'Connor ruled for some 20 state plaintiffs that the Affordable Care Act's individual mandate is no longer legal because Republicans repealed its financial penalty as part of the 2017 tax reform. Recall that Chief Justice John Roberts joined four Justices to say ObamaCare's mandate was illegal as a command to individuals to buy insurance under the Commerce Clause. ""The Framers gave Congress the power to regulate commerce, not to compel it,"" he wrote.

Yet the Chief famously salvaged ObamaCare by unilaterally rewriting the mandate to be a ""tax"" that was within Congress's power. Never mind that Democrats had expressly said the penalty was not a tax. Majority Leader Roberts declared it to be so.

Enter Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, who argues in Texas v. U.S. that since Congress has repealed the mandate, the tax is no longer a tax, and ObamaCare is thus illegal. Judge O'Connor agreed with that logic, and he went further in ruling that since Congress said the mandate is crucial to the structure of ObamaCare, then all of ObamaCare must fall along with the mandate.

We'll admit to a certain satisfaction in seeing the Chief Justice hoist on his own logic. But his ruling in NFIB v. Sebelius was in 2012 and there is more at issue legally now than the ""tax"" issue in that opinion. One legal complication is that Congress in 2017 repealed the financial part of the individual mandate, not the structure of the mandate itself. Republicans used budget rules to pass tax reform so they couldn't repeal the mandate's express language.

The Affordable Care Act has also been up and running since 2014, which means so-called reliance interests come into play when considering a precedent. Millions of people now rely on ObamaCare's subsidies and rules, which argues against judges repealing the law by fiat.

Judge O'Connor breezes past this like a liberal Ninth Circuit appeals judge handling a Donald Trump appeal. He's right that Democrats claimed the individual mandate was essential to the Affordable Care Act. But when Congress killed the financial penalty in 2017 it left the rest of ObamaCare intact. When judging congressional intent, a judge must account for the amending Congress as well as the original Congress.

In any case, the Supreme Court's ""severability"" doctrine calls for restraint in declaring an entire law illegal merely because one part of it is. Our guess is that even the right-leaning Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals judges will overturn Judge O'Connor on this point.

As for the politics, Democrats claim to be alarmed by the ruling but the truth is they're elated. They want to use it to further pound Republicans for denying health insurance for pre-existing conditions if the law is overturned. Democrats campaigned across the country against Mr. Paxton's lawsuit to gain House and Senate seats in November, and they will now press votes in Congress so they can compound the gains in 2020.

President Trump hailed the ruling in a tweet, but he has never understood the Affordable Care Act. His Administration has done good work revising regulations to reduce health-care costs and increase access, but the risk is that the lawsuit will cause Republicans in Congress to panic politically and strike a deal with Democrats that reinforces ObamaCare. This is what happens when conservatives fall into the liberal trap of thinking they can use the courts to achieve policy goals that need to be won in Congress.

The Washington Post on withdrawing all 2,000 U.S. troops out of Syria:

PRESIDENT TRUMP'S sudden move to yank U.S. troops out of Syria undermined at a stroke several foreign policy goals he has championed. The president promised to finish the job of destroying the Islamic State, but the withdrawal will leave thousands of its fighters still in place. He vowed to roll back Iran's aggression across the Middle East, but his decision will allow its forces to entrench in the country that is the keystone of Tehran's ambitions. He promised to protect Israel, but that nation will now be left to face alone the buildup by Iran and its proxies along its northern border.

The president's top national security advisers had carefully developed and articulated a strategy of maintaining a U.S. presence in Syria until the Islamic State was beyond revival and Iran withdrew its forces - a plan they were defending up until this week. Mr. Trump has again demonstrated, to them and to the world, that no U.S. policy or foreign commitment is immune from his whims.

Mr. Trump claimed the Islamic State had been defeated, but that is not the view of the Defense and State Departments. Thousands of jihadist fighters are still in Syria and control splotches of territory in the Euphrates Valley. A U.S. withdrawal will give the extremists an opportunity to reconstitute, as they did in Iraq following the premature U.S. withdrawal ordered by President Barack Obama.

Until Wednesday, a prime talking point of senior national security officials was that, ""if we've learned one thing over the years, (the) enduring defeat of a group like this means you can't just defeat their physical space and then leave,"" as the State Department's special envoy for the global campaign against the Islamic State, Brett McGurk, put it last week. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said it another way in September: ""Getting rid of the caliphate doesn't mean you then blindly say, 'Okay, we got rid of it,' march out, and then wonder why the caliphate comes back.""

Mr. Trump has justified some of his most controversial decisions, including his continued support for Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, as needed to contain Iran's threat to the United States and its allies. But the Syrian withdrawal hands Tehran and its ally Russia a windfall. Iran has deployed thousands of fighters and allied militiamen to Syria and aspires to create a corridor to Lebanon and the Mediterranean, as well as a new front against Israel along the Golan Heights. In reaction to that threat, Mr. Trump's national security adviser, John Bolton, announced Sept. 24 that ""We're not going to leave (Syria) as long as Iranian troops are outside Iranian borders, and that includes Iranian proxies and militias.""

U.S. ambitions in Syria have never been backed by adequate resources, and a case could be made that neither Congress nor the American public were prepared to support the mission suggested by Mr. Bolton. But Mr. Trump's decision appears to have been precipitated by the bellicose rhetoric of Turkey's Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who last week threatened - not for the first time - a military operation against Syrian Kurds, even though U.S. troops are positioned around them. The autocratic Turkish ruler appears to have extracted multiple favors from Mr. Trump in recent days, including the sale of U.S. Patriot missiles and a promise to reexamine the possible extradition of his rival, Fethullah Gulen, from Pennsylvania. If Mr. Trump received anything in return, he hasn't disclosed it.

The Syrian Kurdish forces, which have fought alongside the United States and played a crucial role in liberating most of eastern Syria from the jihadists, will be perhaps the foremost victims of Mr. Trump's decision. Betrayed by Washington, they will now be subject to a military offensive by Turkey. The stab in the back will send an unforgettable message to all who are asked to cooperate with the United States in the fight against terrorism: Washington is an unreliable and dangerous partner.

The Orange County (California) Register on Mick Mulvaney as Trump's choice for chief of staff:

President Trump has found a new chief of staff, albeit an interim one, in his director of the Office of Management and Budget, Mick Mulvaney.

That of chief is a terribly important post, perhaps government's most consequential aside from that of his boss. In theory, at least, the chief of staff is the gatekeeper for everything the president does, everyone he sees, everyone he talks to on the phone.

Perhaps, though few would expect this to be the case, the arbiter of every time he sends out a tweet, and of what it should say.

A Washington insider, a former congressman, Mulvaney is in many ways ideal for the job. He wants it, badly, whereas others with similarly impressive resumes touted for the job have indicated a strong desire to spend more time with their families, from Vice President Pence's staff chief Nick Ayers of Georgia to former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie.

Mulvaney shares the conservative values currently espoused by the president and was a founder of the House Freedom Caucus in 2013, the group that always taunted the Republican leadership, opposing much government funding, including debt limit increases and budget agreements made with the Democrats.

But he also, after Trump secured the Republican nomination in 2016, called the candidate ""a terrible human being"" who he only was voting for out of an even greater dislike of Hillary Clinton.

It's not as if other presidential allies of today haven't said bad things about him in the past. On the campaign trail, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz called his rival ""a narcissist at a level I don't think this country's ever seen,"" for instance.

But if you were the nation's chief executive - or the CEO of a much smaller entity, for that matter - could you hire as your top aide and work with a person who had once dubbed you ""terrible""?

Or does this kind of talk come with the territory in politics, where many strange bedfellows are made because of having to run in elections against once and perhaps future allies? Should Trump indeed elevate this practical choice for staff chief to permanent status immediately?

Los Angeles Times on banning bump stocks, which allow semi-automatic weapons to fire like machine guns:

The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives said Tuesday that it had finalized a rule reclassifying so-called bump stocks - the devices that can make a semiautomatic rifle fire nearly as quickly a fully automatic weapon - as machine guns, which makes it illegal to manufacture, sell or possess them. The agency said a year ago it had the authority to reclassify the devices, and President Trump - in the wake of the Parkland, Fla., school shooting - directed the ATF to speed up the process. Tuesday's announcement - a rare bit of welcome news from the Trump administration - makes it official; White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters that owners of the conversion devices will have until March 21 to destroy them or turn them in to the ATF.

This is a good step. Unfortunately, it's all but certain to be challenged in the courts, and it's on shaky legal ground because of the way the new rule evolved. The Obama administration determined that because bump stocks have ""no automatically functioning mechanical parts and (perform) no automated mechanical functions when installed,"" they did not fit the definition of a machine gun in federal law, which meant the ATF lacked the authority to regulate them. Tuesday's announcement, by contrast, hinges not on the technical specifications, but on the functionality. In essence, if it fires like a machine gun, it's a machine gun. Cue the lawyers.

We hope the administration prevails in whatever challenges emerge, but the sure-fire way to resolve this would be for Congress to legislate bump stocks and related gadgets out of existence. Such devices serve no function other than to evade the strict congressional limit on machine guns by, as the ATF said, harnessing ""the recoil energy of the semiautomatic firearm in a manner that allows the trigger to reset and continue firing"" without the shooter having to pull the trigger for each shot.

A mass shooter in Las Vegas used bump stocks affixed to semiautomatic rifles to fire more than 1,000 rounds in a matter of minutes from a 32nd-floor suite of the Mandalay Bay Hotel into a crowd of some 20,000 people, killing 58 concertgoers and injuring hundreds of others. It was the largest single mass shooting in the modern era, drawing attention to bump stocks and sparking outraged demands by many - the Los Angeles Times included - that the devices be banned.

As welcome as this new rule is, it will do little to corral our national problem with gun violence. The vast majority of gun deaths come in ones and twos, led by suicides. ...

But it is progress. And the president deserves credit for sticking with his promise to find a way to ban bump stocks. ...

China Daily says telecommunications giant Huawei is a victim of U.S. panic attacks:

This year has not been an annus mirabilis for China's Huawei Technologies Ltd, the world's largest supplier of telecommunications network equipment and second-biggest maker of smartphones.

Although it has been constantly in the news and it is said there is no such thing as bad publicity, it has been making headlines because of the spurious claims it somehow poses a threat to the West, even world peace. It has never been explained exactly how.

In fact it is not because of anything it has done, but because its success has brought it into the crosshairs of the United States' anxiety attacks against China.

Huawei is at the forefront of 5G technology. This latest generation mobile network technology promises to bring the much anticipated and heralded internet of things to life and the US is determined to be the 5G leader.

Not only because whichever country develops the technology that is adopted as standard will have a huge commercial advantage. But also because by setting the standard it will have a knowledge advantage.

As a result, first the US and then one after another its most obedient allies have blocked Huawei from entering their 5G markets on security grounds.

None of them have offered any specific justification for blocking Huawei. They just repeat their claim that the company poses a security risk. That is why objective observers have concluded that those countries are politicizing a commercial issue.

It sets a harmful precedent. What if other countries used the same excuse to block US companies (not confined to the telecom sector)? The US companies are very competitive in many fields, including those that could pose huge security risks, such as finance.

While Huawei will not go unscathed from being prevented from entering key markets, as a competitive player, it still has a vast market to access in other parts of the world. It has signed contracts to supply 5G equipment to 25 telecom carriers, and more than 10,000 5G base stations have been shipped.

In stark contrast to the US and its allies, India for instance, has invited Huawei to conduct 5G trials in the country and complimented it on the role it has played in helping to develop its telecom industry.

The efforts of the US and its allies to try to shield their companies against a Chinese competitor are politically motivated, not the result of a fact-based or transparent decision-making process. And they are counterproductive to the concerted efforts that are needed to ensure the security of 5G networks.

7,daily mail online,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-6502973/AP-News-Brief-12-04-m-EST.html,"White House digs in on border wall demand, risking shutdown

WASHINGTON (AP) - The White House on Sunday pushed the federal government closer to the brink of a partial shutdown later this week, digging in on its demand for $5 billion to build a border wall as congressional Democrats stood firm against it.

""We're going to do whatever is necessary to build the border wall to stop this ongoing crisis of illegal immigration,"" said White House senior adviser Stephen Miller.

Asked if that meant having a government shutdown, he said: ""If it comes to it, absolutely.""

Trump said last week he would be ""proud"" to have a shutdown to get Congress to approve a $5 billion down payment to fulfill his campaign promise to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. But the president doesn't have the votes from the Republican-controlled Congress to support funding for the wall at that level.

Democratic congressional leaders, Sen. Chuck Schumer and Rep. Nancy Pelosi, have proposed no more than $1.6 billion, as outlined in a bipartisan Senate bill. The money would not go for the wall but for fencing upgrades and other border security. Democrats also offered to simply keep funding at its current level, $1.3 billion.

Trump lawyer Giuliani rules out Mueller interview with Trump

WASHINGTON (AP) - With a number of probes moving closer to the Oval Office, President Donald Trump and his attorney unleashed a fresh series of attacks on the investigators, questioning their integrity while categorically ruling out the possibility of a presidential interview with the special counsel.

Trump and Rudy Giuliani used Twitter and television interviews Sunday to deliver a series of broadsides against special counsel Robert Mueller and federal prosecutors in New York. Giuliani said he was ""disgusted"" by the tactics used by Mueller in his probe into Russian election interference, including in securing guilty pleas from the president's former national security adviser Michael Flynn on a charge of lying to federal investigators.

Trump, Giuliani said, would not submit to an interview by Mueller's team.

""They're a joke,"" Giuliani told ""Fox News Sunday."" ''Over my dead body, but, you know, I could be dead.""

The special counsel, who is investigating possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russia, has continued to request an interview with the president. Last month, the White House sent written answers in response to the special counsel's questions about possible collusion. The White House has resisted answering questions on possible obstruction of justice.

Child's death highlights communication barriers on border

Shortly before a 7-year-old Guatemalan girl died in U.S. custody, her father signed a form stating that his daughter was in good health. But it's unclear how much the man understood on the form, which was written in English and read to him in Spanish by Border Patrol agents.

The death of Jakelin Caal highlights the communication challenges along the U.S.-Mexico border as agents come in contact with an increasing number of migrants who speak neither English nor Spanish.

Her father's native language is the Mayan tongue known as Q'eqchi'. His second language is Spanish. It's unclear whether something was lost in translation or whether it would have made a difference in saving Jakelin after the two were detained and underwent a health screening along a remote stretch of U.S.-Mexico border. But the case raises questions about the Border Patrol's use of English-only forms.

All agents are required to speak Spanish, and they receive formal Spanish training. Reading forms in Spanish is often enough to pose basic questions. But some other Spanish-speaking migrants reported signing paperwork that they later said they did not understand.

Scores of immigrant parents who were separated from their children after crossing the border in the spring said they signed forms agreeing to be deported with the understanding that their kids would be returning with them, only to find themselves deported without them. Many had to wait months before being reunited with them in their homelands.

Talks adopt 'rulebook' to put Paris climate deal into action

KATOWICE, Poland (AP) - Almost 200 nations, including the world's top greenhouse gas producers, China and the United States, have adopted a set of rules meant to breathe life into the 2015 Paris climate accord by setting out how countries should report their emissions and efforts to reduce them.

But negotiators delayed other key decisions until next year - a move that frustrated environmentalists and countries that wanted more ambitious goals in light of scientists' warnings that the world must shift sharply away from fossil fuels in the coming decade.

""The majority of the rulebook for the Paris agreement has been created, which is something to be thankful for,"" said Mohamed Adow, a climate policy expert at Christian Aid. ""But the fact countries had to be dragged kicking and screaming to the finish line shows that some nations have not woken up"" to the dire consequences of global warming as outlined in a report by the U.N Panel on Climate Change, or IPCC.

Officials at the talks, which ended late Saturday in the Polish city of Katowice, agreed upon universal rules on how nations can cut emissions. Poor countries secured assurances on financial support to help them reduce emissions, adapt to changes such as rising sea levels and pay for damage that has already happened.

""Through this package, you have made a thousand little steps forward together,"" said Michal Kurtyka, a senior Polish official who led the talks.

French city honors victims of Christmas market attack

PARIS (AP) - People filled a square in the French city of Strasbourg on Sunday to show respect and sympathy for the victims of last week's shooting attack near a famous Christmas market as the death toll rose to five.

French authorities said a Polish man died in a Strasbourg hospital Sunday, one of a dozen people wounded in last Tuesday's attack. Poland's Foreign Ministry extended condolences Sunday on Twitter to his family.

According to the newspaper DNA, more than 1,000 people attended the memorial, which ended with a minute of applause and a rendition of France's national anthem, ""La Marseillaise.""

The hour-long ceremony took place in Kleber Square, not far from where a gunman opened fire on Tuesday evening. Strasbourg Mayor Roland Ries praised the city's resilience in the face of hardship.

The ""extremely large crowd in the Christmas market"" on Saturday ""was an illustration of our commitment to these values ??on which our living together is based, which we will continue to defend against all those who want to attack it,"" Ries said.

Not into bingo, 84-year-old Texas woman gets college degree

RICHARDSON, Texas (AP) - After raising five kids and retiring at age 77 from her secretarial job, Janet Fein couldn't be blamed for finally relaxing, but that's not her.

Fein, now 84, went to back to school and will accomplish a long-held goal this week when she graduates from the University of Texas at Dallas with a bachelor's degree.

""I didn't have anything to do in retirement and I didn't think that playing bingo was up to my speed,"" said Fein, who majored in sociology because she felt it was ""substantial.""

She said she enjoyed all the reading and writing papers. ""With each class I already knew a lot, but then I also learned a lot. And that made me happy,"" she said.

People 65 and older make up less than one percent of U.S. college students. In 2015, they accounted for about 67,000 of about 20 million college students, according to the National Center for Education Statistics.

Next-generation of GPS satellites are headed to space

DENVER (AP) - After months of delays, the U.S. Air Force is about to launch the first of a new generation of GPS satellites, designed to be more accurate, secure and versatile.

But some of their most highly touted features will not be fully available until 2022 or later because of problems in a companion program to develop a new ground control system for the satellites, government auditors said.

The satellite is scheduled to lift off Tuesday from Cape Canaveral, Florida, aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. It's the first of 32 planned GPS III satellites that will replace older ones now in orbit. Lockheed Martin is building the new satellites outside Denver.

GPS is best-known for its widespread civilian applications, from navigation to time-stamping bank transactions. The Air Force estimates that 4 billion people worldwide use the system.

But it was developed by the U.S. military, which still designs, launches and operates the system. The Air Force controls a constellation of 31 GPS satellites from a high-security complex at Schriever Air Force Base outside Colorado Springs.

After fraud probe, new primary may replace GOP candidate

RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) - Legislation quickly passed by North Carolina's lawmakers this week would prepare a path for Republicans to dump their nominee in a still-undecided U.S. House race marred with ballot fraud allegations.

""I think (legislators are) worried that Mark Harris might be damaged goods and they want to have the opportunity to have a different Republican nominee,"" said Carter Wrenn, a Republican operative and consultant to former U.S. Sen. Jesse Helms and others for more than 40 years. ""That's how I read those tea leaves.""

If the state elections board decides ballot irregularities or other problems cast the true outcome into doubt and force a redo, the legislation - if allowed to go into law by Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper - would require new primary elections in the 9th Congressional District race, in addition to a new general election.

That would allow Republicans another look at Mark Harris, the Republican who led Democrat Dan McCready by 905 votes in unofficial results. Harris hasn't been certified the winner, and an investigation is looking into missing absentee ballots in rural Bladen County and whether unsealed ballots illegally handled by collection teams there could have been altered.

Top of mind: 'Justice' is Merriam-Webster's word of the year

NEW YORK (AP) - Racial justice. Obstruction of justice. Social justice. The Justice Department. Merriam-Webster has chosen ""justice"" as its 2018 word of the year, driven by the churning news cycle over months and months.

The word follows ""toxic,"" picked by Oxford Dictionaries, and ""misinformation,"" plucked by Dictonary.com.

Peter Sokolowski, Merriam-Webster's editor at large, told The Associated Press ahead of Monday's announcement that ""justice"" consistently bubbled into the top 20 or 30 lookups on the company's website, spiking at times due to specific events but also skating close to the surface for much of the year.

While it's one of those common words people likely know how to spell and use correctly in a sentence, Sokolowski pointed to other reasons that drive search traffic. Among them is an attempt to focus a train of thought around a philosophical problem, or to seek aspirational motivation. Such well-known words are often among the most looked up every year, including those that are slightly abstract, including ""love,"" he said.

The designation for ""justice"" came soon after President Trump's one-time fixer, Michael Cohen, was sentenced to three years in prison for crimes that included arranging the payment of hush money to conceal his boss' alleged sexual affairs. He told a judge he agreed time and again to cover up Trump's ""dirty deeds"" out of ""blind loyalty.""

'Spider-Verse' swings to the top; 'Mortal Engines' tanks

LOS ANGELES (AP) - ""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse"" swung to the top of the domestic box office in its first weekend in theaters, proving that there is widespread audience interest in big screen animated versions of Marvel's marquee superheroes.

The film led a host of newcomers that debuted to varying success on this pre-Christmas holiday weekend, including Clint Eastwood's drug smuggling drama ""The Mule"" and the Peter Jackson-produced epic ""Mortal Engines"" which bombed in North American theaters.

""Into the Spider-Verse"" earned an estimated $35.4 million from 3,813 theaters against a $90 million production budget according to Sony Pictures on Sunday, which is a record for animated movies in December (although the hybrid ""Alvin and the Chipmunks"" movies were higher). The film features an innovative animation style - both CGI and hand-drawn - and focuses on the Miles Morales character as he learns to become the famed web-slinger. It's another financial win for the studio's latest ""expanded Spider-Man universe"" strategy following ""Venom"" and ""Spider-Man: Homecoming.""

And ""Spider-Verse"" has been very well-received among critics, and audiences in exit surveys gave it a rare A+ CinemaScore - a first for a Spider-Man film. It's also been nominated for a Golden Globe award for best animated feature and picked up a few honors from critics' groups as well, including the New York Film Critics Circle.

""We are playing to both families and fanboys. We're an all-audience film,"" said Adrian Smith, Sony's president of domestic distribution."

Trump invited legislators he believed he could woo to the White House for talks -- and targeted their party leaders -- in an attempt to divide the Democratic Party.

The plot didn't work. A White House statement chastising Democrats for refusing to come to the lunch table to discuss border security revealed that only Republican lawmakers would come to the meeting.

'Today, the President offered both Democrats and Republicans the chance to meet for lunch at the White House. Unfortunately, no Democrats will attend,' press secretary Sarah Sanders said. 'The President looks forward to having a working lunch with House Republicans to solve the border crisis and reopen the government.'

Trump invited five Democrats to the meeting, according to The Hill. He would need close to 20, and every single Republican in the House, to end the impasse.

President Donald Trump 's plan to end the shutdown by peeling off moderate lawmakers from the opposing party who represent districts he won fell apart on Tuesday, as not one of them accepted an offer to lunch

Sanders slammed House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer in the statement that included the names of nine Republicans who'd be dining with Trump.

'As Senator Schumer and Speaker Pelosi refuse to negotiate, President Donald J. Trump and his team are working hard to find solutions to solve the humanitarian and national security crisis at the border and reopen the government,' she said.

She said Trump would be hawking a proposal at the working luncheon to that 'includes additional technology at ports of entry, allows minors from Central America to seek asylum in their home country, and physical barriers between ports of entry made of steel instead of concrete.'

'It's time for the Democrats to come to the table and make a deal,' Trump's spokeswoman asserted.

This morning, the president assailed Pelosi by name in a tweet, asking why the California congresswoman is getting paid when federal employees' who were required to stay on the job while their divisions are shutdown are not.

Democratic legislators who control the lower chamber as of this month made Pelosi the House speaker, putting her in charge of negotiations with the president to reopen the federal government.

'Why is Nancy Pelosi getting paid when people who are working are not?' the president asked.

Senate Democrats have put their weight behind New York's Schumer, another longtime party leader. Trump referred to him in a Monday tweet by the derogatory nickname 'Cryin' Chuck' that he developed for the senator who represents him home state.

The two Democrats have released public statements in lockstep since the shutdown began, but Trump is trying to split them by preying on Pelosi's vulnerabilities within her own caucus.

Trump invited legislators he believed he could woo to the White House for talks -- and targeted their party leaders -- in an attempt to divide the Democratic Party

Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer have released public statements in lockstep since the shutdown began, but Trump is trying to split them by preying on Pelosi's vulnerabilities within her own caucus

She narrowly won her election this month for House speaker, as freshman representatives who believe the party needs fresh blood revolted.

Other Democrats who support Pelosi have signaled that they would be willing to break with her since then and give Trump the money he wants for a physical barrier along the southern border in order to end the longest government shutdown in history.

California Rep. Katie Hill acknowledged Saturday that the bitter battle between her party and the president over his 'wall' was a semantic one as she said she would be willing to vote in favor of funding a barrier.

'For many of us, there's not really doubt that some kind of physical barrier is necessary,' she told Fox News in a Saturday interview. 'I think the challenge is that we've gotten so hung up on the semantics, really on both sides. Gosh, I can't tell you how much I've come to hate the word ""wall,"" and many of us have.'

Trump has tried to attack the problem from the angle of the semantic debate, telling Democrats they can call the barrier a fence, if they want to, to get over the hump and claim to constituents they did not fund a wall.

Hill's comments were the first sign that his tactics could be working, and the White House sought to capitalize on them this week with an invitation to rank-and-file Democrats to meet with Trump.

It could be his last stop before taking unprecedented action to divert military resources to the construction of his wall. He said Monday he'd prefer to work with Congress. But he has also declared repeatedly over the past 10 days that he was likely to use emergency powers if he comes to believe the impasse cannot be resolved through regular order.

Trump on Monday slapped down a proposal from Sen. Lindsey Graham, a key Republican confidant, to reopen the federal government for three weeks while he negotiates with congressional Democrats over funding for his long-promised border wall.

'That was a suggestion that Lindsey made, but I did reject it,' Trump told reporters as he left the snow-swept White House for a speech in New Orleans.

About one-quarter of the federal government's funding, and 800,000 workers' paychecks, has been on hold since December 21 in the longest-ever shutdown as the White House tangles with Pelosi and Schumer.

Trump has said he won't sign a budget that would reopen the government unless it includes $5.7 billion in new spending to complete portions of his border barrier.

'I'm not interested,' Trump said Monday of a temporary pause. 'I want to get it solved. I don't want to just delay it. I want to get it solved.'

A White House official told DailyMail.com on Monday that the president has 'zero confidence' Pelosi and Schumer would change their position if he were to sign a short-term spending bill, 'and that might just embolden them.'

The president hasn't taken his foot off the gas pedal, bashing Democrats for leaving Washington while government employees wait to find out when their paychecks will return.

'I've been here all weekend,' he groused. 'A lot of Democrats are in Puerto Rico, celebrating something, I don't know. Maybe they're celebrating the shutdown.'

He ridiculed Schumer as 'Cryin' Chuck in a tweet earlier in the day and said he had been 'waiting all weekend' amid an ongoing standoff in negotiations.

'Nancy and Cryin' Chuck can end the Shutdown in 15 minutes. At this point it has become their, and the Democrats, fault!' Trump said.

Weekend polling showed that more Americans blamed Trump than the Democrats for the partial shutdown that has TSA and border agents working without pay, but he says it's not his fault negotiations have stalled.

'I've been waiting all weekend. Democrats must get to work now. Border must be secured!' Trump wrote in a Monday missive.

President Donald Trump has rejected the idea of reopening the government for three weeks while negotiations continue over funding for his border wall

Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, a key Trump confidant, proposed the idea over the weekend as a good-faith gesture to bring Democrats back to the table

He didn't express any confidence that the shutdown's days are numbered, although he described Republicans as 'rock solid' and claimed of Democrats that 'many of them are calling and many of them are breaking.

'I don't know if we're close on a deal,' Trump told reporters. 'This should be the easiest deal that I've ever seen. We're talking about border security. Who could be against it?'

'We're talking about drugs pouring in, human traffickers tying up women, putting tape on their mouths, and pouring into our country. We can't have that. We can't have that. We have drugs, we have criminals, we have gangs. And the Democrats don't want to do anything about it.'

With Pelosi and Schumer standing in his way, a remaining option is for the president to declare a national emergency and use existing Defense Department funds, tasking the Army Corps of Engineers to serve as his border wall's general contractor.

Trump has resisted the temptation, and appeared no closer on Monday to taking that tempting off-ramp from the crisis.

'I'm not looking to call a national emergency. This is so simple, you shouldn't have to,' he said. 'Now, I have the absolute legal right to call it, but I'm not looking to do that.

Trump claimed that Democrats 'are stopping us, and they're stopping a lot of great people from getting paid.'

'All they have to do is say, ""We want border security."" That automatically means a wall or a barrier.'"

President Donald Trump once again unloaded on Democrats for the government shutdown saying it has 'become their fault.'

He ridiculed Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer as 'Cryin' Chuck and said he had been 'waiting all weekend' amid an ongoing standoff in negotiations.

'Nancy and Cryin' Chuck can end the Shutdown in 15 minutes. At this point it has become their, and the Democrats, fault!' Trump tweeted, following weekend polling showing more Americans blamed him than the Democrats for the partial shutdown that has TSA and border agents working without pay.

'I've been waiting all weekend. Democrats must get to work now. Border must be secured!' Trump wrote in another missive.

President Donald Trump went after Democrats again on Day 24 of the partial government shutdown

Another tweet went after Democrats indirectly for jetting to Puerto Rico for a 'Hamilton' production and hurricane relief fundraiser. Attendees included House Speaker Nancy Pelosi.

'Dems in Puerto Rico as Shutdown hits day 24,' was all Trump wrote about it in a Monday tweet, tagging @foxandfriends,' which reported on it at Fox News, the network Trump called into Saturday night following a bombshell report the FBI opened a counterintelligence investigation of him following his firing of FBI Director James Comey.

Trumps tweets came as Congress returned to Washington amid the ongoing shutdown with no clear answer about when it will end.

It also followed additional polling showing more Americans blame the president than do congressional Democrats for the impasse. A new CNN poll showed 55 per cent of Americans blaming Trump, compared to 32 per cent who blamed Democrats in Congress.

His efforts digs against Democrats were interrupted by an odd tweet where he said he was 'Getting ready to address the Farm Convention today in Nashville, Tennessee. Love our farmers, love Tennessee - a great combination! See you in a little while.'

Trump once again referred to Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., as 'Nancy' in a tweet going after her and Sen. Charles Schumer Monday amid the shutdown

In fact, Trump is traveling to New Orleans.

One Republican senator says he's offered President Donald Trump a possible solution, though it may just be wishful thinking.

Sen. Lindsey Graham is encouraging Trump to reopen government for several weeks to continue negotiating with Democrats over the border wall Trump wants to build on the U.S.-Mexico border. If there's no deal at the end of that time, Graham says Trump would be free to take the more dramatic step of declaring a national emergency to build it.

But the South Carolina Republican says Trump still wants a deal on funding for the wall before agreeing to reopen shuttered government departments. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat, insists Trump reopen the government first.

Their weeks-old standoff led to the partial government shutdown, now on day 24 without a clear end in sight.

'Before he pulls the plug on the legislative option, and I think we're almost there, I would urge him to open up the government for a short period of time, like three weeks, before he pulls the plug, see if we can get a deal,' Graham said. 'If we can't at the end of three weeks, all bets are off.

'See if he can do it by himself through the emergency powers. That's my recommendation,' added Graham, who has publicly pushed Trump to use his authority to declare a national emergency to build the wall. Such a step would allow Trump to bypass Congress and tap various pots of unspent federal money, including for military construction and disaster relief as well as from assets seized by law enforcement, to pay for the wall.

Trump has kept Washington on edge over whether he would resort to such a declaration, citing what he says is a 'crisis' of drug smuggling and the trafficking of women and children at the border. The president initially sounded as though such a move was imminent, but then pulled back. He has said several times since he first mentioned the idea in public this month that he prefers a legislative solution.

A key question is how much more time is Trump willing to give lawmakers. Graham, who spoke with Trump by telephone on Sunday morning, said the legislative path 'is just about shut off' and blamed intransigence by Pelosi.

The speaker's office had no immediate comment.

Democrats oppose an emergency declaration but may be powerless to block it. Some Republicans are wary, too, fearing how a future Democratic president might use that authority. Such a move, should Trump ultimately go that route, would almost certainly be challenged in the courts.

Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., called Graham's idea to reopen the government a 'great place to start.'

'I do think if we reopen the government, if the president ends this shutdown crisis, we have folks who can negotiate a responsible, modern investment in technology that will actually make us safer,' Coons said.

Trump says technology is nice, but that the border can't be secured without a wall.

The White House has been laying the groundwork for an emergency declaration, which is feared by lawmakers in both parties.

Senate Homeland Security Committee Chairman Ron Johnson, R-Wis., said he'd 'hate to see' a declaration issued because the wall wouldn't get built, presumably because of legal challenges. Democrats voted in the past for border security and should again, he said.

'I actually want to see this wall get built,' Johnson said. 'I want to keep pressure on Democrats to actually come to the negotiating table in good faith and fund what they have supported in the past.'

Graham favors a declaration and said the time for talk is running out.

'It's the last option, not the first option, but we're pretty close to that being the only option,' he said.

Graham and Coons spoke on 'Fox News Sunday' and Johnson appeared on CNN's 'State of the Union."

'A nation without borders is a nation not at all,' Trump said in his remarks from Washington, D.C. on Thursday.

'Without borders, we have the reign of chaos, crime, cartels and believe it or not, coyotes.'

The President added that he refused to give in to 'the whims of criminal organizations.'

President Donald Trump is seen above on the left as Vice President Mike Pence looks on in Washington, D.C. on Thursday. 'A nation without borders is a nation not at all,' Trump said in his remarks

Coyotes, of course, are a species of canine native to North America.

In the context of migrants crossing the border illegally, the term 'coyotes' means a group of people who are paid money to help smuggle migrants into the United States.

Migrants pay a fee to coyotes who in return guide them across the border.

Once the migrant arrives to a pre-determined destination, usually a town along the border in California, Texas, or Arizona, they pay a fee to the coyote.

The increased surveillance and security along the southern border has led to an increase in the usage of coyotes, according to a study by the RAND Corportation.

Coyotes, which is used both in English and Spanish, could receive as much as $15,000 per person to smuggle migrants into the U.S., according to The New York Times.

These 'coyotes' are apparently not what Trump had in mind when he used the term on Thursday.

This led to a number of hilarious reactions on social media, with Twitter users posting memes of Wile E. Coyote fleeing the Road Runner.

'Your daily reminder that President Trump thinks literal coyotes have taken over our border with Mexico,' tweeted Patrick Chovanec.

The federal government partially shut down as of Saturday after the President refused to authorize continued funding that did not include $5billion for a border wall.

Trump said on Twitter on Saturday that he was continuing to negotiate with Democrats to end the U.S. government shutdown, but added that 'it could be a long stay.'

The Senate ended a short legislative day on Saturday and will hold its next legislative session on Thursday, as negotiators continued to search for a way to end the partial government shutdown that began just after midnight.

'Your daily reminder that President Trump thinks literal coyotes have taken over our border with Mexico,' tweeted Patrick Chovanec. The tweet includes an attached GIF showing Wile E. Coyote

Senator Chris Murphy, a Democrat representing Connecticut, wrote: 'So you get that he thinks these are real coyotes, right?'

Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell said the Senate would meet in a 'pro forma' session on Monday.

Those sessions can last for just minutes before adjourning.

As McConnell was closing the Senate, Vice President Mike Pence told reporters that negotiators were 'still talking.'

The House of Representatives passed a bill that included $5 billion Trump had demanded for a wall, but the Senate included considerably less money for border security.

The partial shutdown will affect about 15 percent of the federal workforce, a senior administration official said on Saturday, as a majority of agencies and departments, including the Department of Defense and the Postal Service, already have secured funding.

Still, some 800,000 employees from the Departments of Homeland Security, Transportation and others will be affected.

According to the American Federation of Government Employees, 420,000 people who have been deemed 'essential' must work without pay, while 380,000 others will not be able to report for work at all.

Trump administration officials say anyone working without pay will receive back pay once a deal is reached."

WASHINGTON (AP) - President Donald Trump is taking the shutdown battle to the U.S.-Mexico border, seeking to bolster his case for the border wall after negotiations with Democrats blew up over his funding demands.

Trump stalked out of his meeting with congressional leaders - ""I said bye-bye,"" he tweeted soon after - as efforts to end the partial government shutdown fell into deeper disarray. Hundreds of thousands of federal workers now face lost paychecks on Friday.

During his stop Thursday in McAllen, Texas, Trump will visit a border patrol station for a roundtable on immigration and border security, and will get a security briefing on the border. But Trump has expressed his own doubts that his appearance and remarks will change any minds, as he seeks $5.7 billion for the wall that has been his signature promise since his presidential campaign.

McAllen is located in the Rio Grande Valley, the busiest part of the border for illegal border crossings.

The unraveling talks prompted further speculation about whether Trump would declare a national emergency and try to authorize the wall on his own if Congress won't approve the money he's seeking.

Here's what's up with the partial government shutdown on Day 20.

WHAT'S NEW TODAY

President Donald Trump will try to bolster his case for the border wall with a visit to the U.S.-Mexico border.

The trip Thursday follows a White House meeting with Republican and Democratic leaders that fell apart quickly, showing the two sides are still far apart on how to bring the partial government shutdown to an end.

US apparel firm cuts off Chinese factory in internment camp

A U.S. supplier of t-shirts and other team apparel to college bookstores cut its ties Wednesday with a Chinese company that drew workers from an internment camp holding targeted members of ethnic minority groups.

In recent years, authorities in the far west Chinese region of Xinjiang have detained an estimated 1 million Uighurs and Kazakhs in heavily-secured facilities where detainees say they are ordered to renounce their language and religion while pledging loyalty to the China's ruling Communist Party.

Last month an Associated Press investigation found the Chinese government had also started forcing some detainees to work in manufacturing and food industries. The investigation tracked recent shipments from one such factory, the privately-owned Hetian Taida Apparel, located inside an internment camp, to Badger Sportswear, a leading supplier in Statesville, North Carolina.

In a statement posted to its website, Badger said Wednesday it will no longer do business with Hetian Taida, nor import any goods from the same region ""given the controversy around doing business"" there.

""Furthermore, we will not ship any product sourced from Hetian Taida currently in our possession,"" the company said, adding that the supplier accounted for about 1 percent of Badger's total annual sales.

Rebel drone bombs Yemen military parade, kills at least 6

SANAA, Yemen (AP) - A bomb-laden drone flown by Yemen's Houthi rebels flew into a military parade on Thursday outside of the southern port city of Aden, killing at least six troops from a Saudi-led coalition and their allies in a brazen attack threatening U.N.-brokered peace efforts to end the yearslong war tearing at the Arab world's poorest nation.

The attack at the Al-Anad Air Base, where American special forces once led their fight against Yemen's al-Qaida branch, targeted high-ranking military officials in Yemen's internationally recognized government.

The attack also raised new questions about Iran's alleged role in arming the Houthis with drone and ballistic missile technology, something long denied by Tehran despite researchers and U.N. experts linking the weapons to the Islamic Republic.

""Once again this proves that the Houthi criminal militias are not ready for peace and that they are exploiting truces in order for deployment and reinforcements,"" said Information Minister Moammar al-Eryani, who said two senior military officials were wounded in the attack.

""This is time for the international community to stand by the legitimate government and force the militias to give up their weapons and pull out of the cities,"" he added.

Celebrations in Congo's capital as opposition candidate wins

KINSHASA, Congo (AP) - Joyous dancing erupted in the streets of Congo's capital to celebrate the surprise victory of opposition candidate Felix Tshisekedi, who was early Thursday declared winner of the long-delayed, disorganized and controversial presidential election.

""Today I am happy,"" said Tshisekedi. ""Happy for you, my base (his supporters). Happy for the people of Congo. Everyone is celebrating that there is peace. No one could imagine the scenario where an opposition candidate could be victorious!""

However, rival opposition candidate Martin Fayulu charged the results had been rigged by outgoing President Joseph Kabila who made a backroom deal with Tshisekedi. Kabila may have negotiated with Tshisekedi to prevent anti-corruption crusader Fayulu from winning, according to Fayulu, diplomats and observers.

Tshisekedi, who received 38 percent of the vote according to the electoral commission's results, had not been widely considered the leading candidate and is relatively untested. Long in the shadow of his father, the now deceased opposition leader Etienne, Tshisekedi startled Congo shortly before the election by breaking away from the unified opposition candidate, Fayulu, to stand on his own.

Fayulu quickly denounced Tshisekedi's victory as fraud. The results were an ""electoral hold up"" that were ""rigged, fabricated and invented"" and do ""not reflect the truth of the ballots,"" said Fayulu. Speaking to the press shortly after the results, Fayulu called on the Congolese people to ""rise as one man to protect victory.""

Iraq closes camps for displaced, pushes families into peril

BZEIBIZ, Iraq (AP) - It was a cold and gusty day in December when the army came to the Bzeibiz camp and told families displaced by the war against the Islamic State group that it was time to go home.

The fighting was over, they said, and the camp west of Baghdad was going to be closed.

Some of the families protested that they had no homes to return to. The army said they would be sent to Amariyat al-Fallujah, a remote camp ringed by chain-link fences and barbed wire.

""They threatened us,"" said Khalwa Hamid, 27. ""They said, whoever doesn't leave, we'll haul them out in our Humvees.""

In the next few days, close to 800 families filed out, according to family interviews and U.N. data.

Texas landowners prepare wall fight; Trump to visit border

HIDALGO, Texas (AP) - As President Donald Trump travels to the border in Texas to make the case for his $5.7 billion wall, landowner Eloisa Cavazos says she knows firsthand how the project will play out if the White House gets its way.

The federal government has started surveying land along the border in Texas and announced plans to start construction next month. Rather than surrender their land, some property owners are digging in, vowing to reject buyout offers and preparing to fight the administration in court.

""You could give me a trillion dollars and I wouldn't take it,"" said Cavazos, whose land sits along the Rio Grande, the river separating the U.S. and Mexico in Texas. ""It's not about money.""

Trump is scheduled to visit the border Thursday in McAllen, a city of 143,000 on the river.

Congress in March funded 33 miles (53 kilometers) of walls and fencing in Texas. The government has laid out plans that would cut across private land in the Rio Grande Valley. Those in the way include landowners who have lived in the valley for generations, environmental groups and a 19th century chapel.

US, China leave next steps for trade talks unclear

BEIJING (AP) - The United States and China gave no indication of their next step after wrapping up talks aimed at resolving a tariff fight that threatens to chill global growth.

The two sides will ""maintain close contact,"" China's Ministry of Commerce said Thursday. But they announced no agreements or date for meeting again during the 90-day truce declared on Dec. 1 by Presidents Donald Trump and Xi Jinping in their fight over Beijing's technology ambitions.

That uncertainty dampened Asian investor sentiment. Stock markets in Germany, France, Japan and China fell back after rising Wednesday following Trump's comment on Twitter that the talks were ""going well!""

Negotiators focused on China's pledge to buy a ""substantial amount"" of agricultural, energy, manufactured goods and other products and services, the U.S. Trade Representative said.

However, a USTR statement emphasized American insistence on ""structural changes"" in Chinese technology policy, market access, protection of foreign patents and copyrights and cyber theft of trade secrets. It gave no sign of progress in those areas.

Australia praises Thai action on Saudi woman seeking asylum

BANGKOK (AP) - Australia's foreign minister praised Thailand on Thursday for its handling of a young Saudi woman who fled her family to seek asylum in Australia, but also reminded it of continuing concern about a Bahraini soccer player granted asylum in Australia who remains in Thai detention.

Marise Payne met with senior Thai officials in Bangkok a day after Australia announced it would assess the request for asylum by 18-year-old Rahaf Mohammed Alqunun, who was stopped Saturday at a Bangkok airport on her way to Australia and her passport seized. She said she was fleeing abuse by her family.

Payne told reporters that Australia's review of Alqunun's case is already underway.

She quashed speculation that Alqunun might accompany her back to Australia, ""because there are steps which are required in the process which Australia, and any other country considering such a matter, would have to go through.""

Confined to an airport transit hotel, Alqunun conducted an online appeal for help, garnering tens of thousands of followers on Twitter and enough public and diplomatic support to convince Thai officials to admit her temporarily under the protection of U.N. officials. The office of the U.N. High Commissioner for Refugees quickly deemed her a legitimate refugee.

Scientists seek ways to finally take a real measure of pain

WASHINGTON (AP) - Is the pain stabbing or burning? On a scale from 1 to 10, is it a 6 or an 8?

Over and over, 17-year-old Sarah Taylor struggled to make doctors understand her sometimes debilitating levels of pain, first from joint-damaging childhood arthritis and then from fibromyalgia.

""It's really hard when people can't see how much pain you're in, because they have to take your word on it and sometimes, they don't quite believe you,"" she said.

Now scientists are peeking into Sarah's eyes to track how her pupils react when she's hurting and when she's not - part of a quest to develop the first objective way to measure pain.

""If we can't measure pain, we can't fix it,"" said Dr. Julia Finkel, a pediatric anesthesiologist at Children's National Medical Center in Washington, who invented the experimental eye-tracking device."
13,daily mail online,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-6580411/Shutdown-suspends-federal-cleanups-US-Superfund-sites.html,"BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) - The government shutdown has suspended federal cleanups at Superfund sites around the nation and forced the cancellation of public hearings, deepening the mistrust and resentment of surrounding residents who feel people in power long ago abandoned them to live among the toxic residue of the country's factories and mines.

""We are already hurting, and it's just adding more fuel to the fire,"" says 40-year-old Keisha Brown, whose wood-frame home is in a community nestled among coking plants and other factories on Birmingham's north side.

The mostly African-American community has been forced to cope with high levels of arsenic, lead and other contaminants in the soil that the Environmental Protection Agency has been scraping up and carting away, house by house.

As President Donald Trump and Congress battle over Trump's demand for a wall on the southern U.S. border, the nearly 3-week-old partial government shutdown has stopped federal work on Superfund sites except for cases where the administration deems ""there is an imminent threat to the safety of human life or to the protection of property.""

EPA's shutdown plans said the agency would evaluate about 800 Superfund sites to see how many could pose an immediate threat. As an example of that kind of threat, it cited an acid leak from a mine that could threaten the public water supply. That's the hazard at Northern California's Iron Mountain mine, where EPA workers help prevent an unending flow of lethally acidic runoff off the Superfund site from spilling into rivers downstream.

Practically speaking, said Bonnie Bellow, a former EPA official who worked on Superfund public outreach at the agency, the impact of the stoppage of work at sites across the nation ""wholly depends"" on the length of the shutdown.

""We are overlooked,"" Brown said. (AP Photo/Kimberly Chandler)

""Unless there is immediate risk like a storm, a flood, a week or two of slowdowns is not going to very likely affect the cleanup at the site,"" Bellow said.

In north Birmingham, Brown said it's been a couple of weeks since she's spotted any EPA crews at people's houses. It wasn't clear if state workers or contractors were continuing work.

But long before the shutdown began, Brown harbored doubts the cleanup was working anyway. ""My main concern is the health of the people out here,"" said Brown, who has asthma. ""All of us are sick, and we've got to function on medicine every day.""

In terms of time, the federal government shutdown is a chronological blip in the long history of the site - which includes ethics charges in a local bribery scandal to block federal cleanup efforts - but adds to the uncertainty in an area where residents feel forgotten and betrayed.

At the EPA, the shutdown has furloughed the bulk of the agency's roughly 14,000 employees. It also means the EPA isn't getting most of the daily stream of environmental questions and tips from the public. Routine inspections aren't happening. State, local and private emails to EPA officials often get automated messages back promising a response when the shutdown ends.

In Montana, for instance, state officials this month found themselves fielding calls from a tribal member worried about drinking water with a funny look to it, said Kristi Ponozzo, public-policy director at that state's Department of Environmental Quality. The EPA normally provides tribes with technical assistance on water supplies.

With most EPA colleagues idled, Ponozzo said, her agency also had to call off an environmental review meeting for a mining project, potentially delaying the project.

But it's the agency's work at Superfund sites - lessening the threat from old nuclear-weapons plants, chemical factories, mines and other entities - that gets much of the attention.

Absent imminent peril, it would be up to state governments or contractors to continue any cleanup during the shutdown ""up to the point that additional EPA direction or funding is needed,"" the EPA said in a statement.

""Sites where cleanup activities have been stopped or shut down will be secured until cleanup activities are able to commence when the federal government reopens,"" the agency said.

For federal Superfund sites in Michigan, the shutdown means there are no EPA colleagues to consult, said Scott Dean, a spokesman for that state's Department of Environmental Quality.

At Michigan Superfund sites, day-to-day field operations were continuing since private contractors do most of the on-the-ground work, Dean said.

Bellow, the former EPA official, said the cancellation of hearings about Superfund sites posed immediate concerns.

In East Chicago, Indiana, for example, the EPA called off a planned public hearing set for last Wednesday to outline how the agency planned to clean up high levels of lead and arsenic in the soil.

The EPA has proposed a seven-month, $26.5 million cleanup that includes treating and removing tainted soil from the area, where a lead smelter previously was located.

During a public meeting Nov. 29, some residents complained that the EPA's approach would leave too much pollution in place. But others didn't get a chance to speak and were hoping to do so at the meeting this week, said Debbie Chizewer, a Northwestern University environmental attorney who represents community groups in the low-income area.

The EPA announced the cancellation in an online notice and gave no indication that it would be rescheduled.

Leaders of the East Chicago Calumet Community Advisory Group asked for a new hearing date and an extension of a Jan. 14 public comment deadline in a letter to the EPA's regional Superfund division.

Calls by The Associated Press to the agency's regional office in Chicago this week were not answered.

Local critics fear the EPA will use the delay caused by the shutdown as justification for pushing ahead with a cleanup strategy they consider flawed, Chizewer said, even though the agency has designated the affected area as an ""environmental justice community"" - a low-income community of color that has been disproportionately harmed by pollution.

The EPA has a ""special obligation"" when dealing with such communities, Chizewer said. ""This would be an example of shutting them out for no good reason.""

In North Birmingham, former longtime neighborhood resident Charlie Powell said most of the people living in and around the Superfund site had already ""just got tired and fed up.""

Powell left the area but started a group called PANIC, People Against Neighborhood Industrial Contamination. He believes money would be better spent helping residents move away from the pollution.

""Can I say hell?"" Powell said when asked what residents have been through.

14,bbc news,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-46739947,"When Nancy Pelosi is sworn in as Speaker of the House on Thursday, she becomes not just the third most powerful US politician but also the leader of the Trump opposition. Both loved and loathed, her comeback story is an extraordinary tale of political survival.

After eight years in the political wilderness, Nancy Pelosi is back on top.

In 2007, the California Democrat made history as the first female speaker of the US House of Representatives, but it was short-lived.

This time, she's at the helm of a resurgent party with responsibility for initiating new laws through the lower chamber of Congress, not to mention guiding a slew of new investigations into the president.

And she's done so despite being written off multiple times and labelled a pedestrian public speaker prone to the occasional gaffe, having high disapproval ratings and becoming a lightning rod for Republicans.

Tying her name to embattled Democratic candidates had been an effective weapon for conservatives in the past but in the 2018 mid-term elections, it lost its punch.

In Virginia, for example, Republican incumbent David Brat mentioned Nancy Pelosi and her ""liberal agenda"" 21 times in an hour and a half at a debate.

His Democratic opponent, Abigail Spanberger, finally shot back: ""I question again whether Congressman Brat knows which Democrat in fact he's running against... My name is Abigail Spanberger.""

She went on to win the district, one of 40 Democrats who captured Republican-held seats, giving the Democrats their largest surge in the House since the 1970s Watergate scandal.

Now, with her return to the speaker's chair, Ms Pelosi again becomes the most powerful woman in US politics.

It caps a remarkable journey for someone who grew up the youngest child in a family steeped in East Coast big-city politics, made a political name for herself in the most liberal corners of California and has dominated Democratic politics for nearly a decade and a half.

""People have gone wrong by under-estimating her for years,"" says journalist Elaine Povich, who wrote a 2008 biography about Ms Pelosi. ""Never bet against her. She's consistently the hardest worker, the best organized and great vote counter.""

These skills are going to be sorely tested in the days ahead, as the incoming speaker will have to balance the competing priorities of her Democratic caucus while facing incoming flames from the political Vesuvius that is Donald Trump.

The public had a taste of such confrontations in December, when the two argued in the Oval Office about border wall funding. She emerged from that duel with Democrats singing her praises but for many on the left such fireworks should only be the beginning.

They will be clamouring for aggressive oversight of the president while others want a legislative record that Democrats can run on.

It's a recipe for intra-party conflict and indicates the treacherous path ahead for her to navigate.

Although Republicans have typically painted Ms Pelosi as a ""San Francisco liberal"" enamoured with big government and far to the left on social issues, her roots are from a more practical style of politics on the other side of the continent.

She grew up in a political family, one of seven children in the gritty East Coast city of Baltimore, Maryland, where her father - Thomas ""Big Tommy"" D'Alesandro Jr - was mayor. She was the youngest and the only girl.

To be a politician in mid-century Baltimore meant succeeding at old-school Democratic machine politics. Keeping track of favours received and favours given. Knowing whom to help and whom to hurt - and how to do both. Ms Pelosi managed her family's political accounts, including answering the eight phone lines that connected to the house.

She went to college in nearby Washington where she met and eventually married financier Paul Pelosi. They first moved to Manhattan, and then San Francisco, where Ms Pelosi started as a housewife. She had five children - four daughters and a son - in the space of six years.

In 1976 she became involved in politics, using her old family connections to help then-California Governor Jerry Brown, running for president, win the Maryland primary.

She then rose through the state's Democratic Party ranks, eventually becoming its chair. In 1988 - at the urging of the outgoing Democrat - she ran for a seat in Congress and won.

In the House she worked her way up again. Because she represented a portion of the city with a large gay community, she made increasing Aids research funding a priority. She fought a multi-year bureaucratic battle to have a shuttered military base in San Francisco turned into a national park.

In 2001, she ran against Maryland's Steny Hoyer - whom she once interned with back in Washington - for House minority whip, vote-counter and second in command of the caucus, and won a narrow victory. The next year she moved up to minority leader after Dick Gephardt of Missouri resigned.

She was one of the highest-profile, most outspoken opponents of the US invasion of Iraq in 2003, and in 2005 successfully helped block President George W Bush's call for partial privatisation of the government-run Social Security retirement programme.

When the Democrats won the majority in 2006 for the first time in 12 years, her legislative acumen had been established and her stand on the war - at least in the minds of Democrats - was vindicated. She became the clear choice for Speaker of the House and was elected by her party in a unanimous vote.

In January 2007 the Californian made history as the first female speaker of the US House of Representatives.

But four years later, Democrats lost control of the lower chamber of Congress.

Despite the setback Ms Pelosi kept her head above the turbulent political waters, riding out a series of electoral defeats and beating back challenges within her own ranks, to take the gavel once more.

Speaker of the House is the one congressional job detailed in the US Constitution. It is second in line for the presidency, behind only the vice-president, although such an ascent would require an unlikely set of circumstances in which both offices were vacated.

Its massive office, in the Capitol rotunda, reflects the prestige of the job, with its own balcony looking out toward the Washington Monument.

Unlike the Senate, the majority party in the House - led by the speaker - has virtually unfettered control over the legislative process.

The speaker and her deputies and committee chairs determine what bills are considered and voted on. They set the agenda and decide the rules governing debate. If a speaker can keep her majority in line - and Republicans over the last two years showed that is far from a certainty - the legislative process in the House can purr like a well-tuned machine.

That was the case the last time Ms Pelosi's was speaker.

From 2009 to 2011, when Democrats had unified control of Congress and the White House, her chamber enacted an $840bn stimulus package in the aftermath of the 2008 economic collapse. She passed pro-union and cap-and-trade climate legislation (which never made it past the Senate and into law) and financial reform and a bill prohibiting gender discrimination in pay (which did).

She also pushed hard to get the Affordable Care Act, which became the defining battle of the Barack Obama presidency, through the House and on to the president's desk.

Donna Edwards, then a member of the House from Maryland, describes Ms Pelosi's performance during the 2009 healthcare battles.

""In those negotiations, I watched Pelosi, the tactician,"" she wrote in a Washington Post opinion article.

""She held scores of meetings, back-to-back, day into night. She juggled phone calls - House and Senate leaders, Cabinet secretaries, the president.

""All to get us to 'yes'. She paid the most attention to vulnerable members; Pelosi knew they would pay the highest price for doing the right thing, and they did.

""When all the men in the room wanted to give up - after the nose-dive in approval ratings, media vitriol and unrelenting protests - Pelosi started counting votes and doing the kind of bare-knuckles work that was needed.""

Eight months after that final vote, Democrats lost 63 seats in the House and their majority - in part because of the conservative furore over healthcare reform, and Ms Pelosi's role in pushing it through.

She had grown so politically toxic that she couldn't campaign publicly for Democrats.

Republicans, smelling blood, aired more than 150,000 television spots that year that featured her - and she has become a favourite target ever since.

It's part of the reason why, as recently as 2015, journalists were giving her ""practically zero chance"" of ever becoming speaker again.

They were wrong.

There are times in politics where the image matches the moment. Such was the case on 11 December, when Ms Pelosi walked out of the White House in a bright red coat, slipped on her sunglasses and addressed the gathered reporters. Her future, which had seemed uncertain even months earlier, was once again bright.

She, along with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, had just finished a remarkable televised Oval Office sparring match with President Trump over border security and the impending government funding crisis.

When Mr Trump implied she was not popular in her party, she shot back.

""Mr President, please don't characterise the strength that I bring to this meeting as the leader of the House Democrats, who just won a big victory.""

Mr Trump wasn't all that wrong to suggest that Ms Pelosi was feeling some heat from members of her own party.

During the mid-term elections, more than 60 Democratic candidates campaigned on a pledge to oppose her speakership bid. After their mid-term success, a group of 16 incoming House Democrats issued a letter calling on new party leadership. They suggested it was time for the 78-year-old Pelosi to hand over power to a new generation.

In the ensuing weeks, however, the California Democrat went about slowly dismantling the rebellion. She peeled off some of the letter's signatories and sympathisers with promises of plum committee seats or prioritising their issues.

Then came her White House showdown, which set Democrats buzzing and launched a thousand complimentary memes on social media.

A day later Ms Pelosi all but secured her speakership with her biggest concession - agreeing to eight-year term limits for members of the House Democratic leadership, applied retroactively.

""Over the summer, I made it clear that I see myself as a bridge to the next generation of leaders, a recognition of my continuing responsibility to mentor and advance new members into positions of power and responsibility in the House Democratic Caucus,"" she said.

Ms Pelosi is a woman in a party that has swept to power in large part due to the engagement and support of women. Fifty-eight percent of those who voted for Democrats in the House were women. There will be 89 women out of the 235 Democratic members of Congress.

That's a far cry from when Ms Pelosi first entered Congress in 1988, when she was one of only 24 women in the entire 435-seat chamber.

More women than ever before won seats in Congress in the 2018 mid-terms.

What does it mean for Congress - and America?

So the question, then, is why has Ms Pelosi been a political survivor? She's not a compelling public speaker. Her delivery is choppy and, at times, grating. Her jokes range from mildly funny to groan-inducing.

She can, however, count votes like few in Congress - a throwback to her days as the child of Baltimore city politics. She's exceedingly organised, in both her personal and professional life.

Not far off from her 80th birthday, she is also tireless. She is up at 5:30 every morning and works late into the night. She seldom takes holidays.

Perhaps because of these efforts, she's a fund-raising powerhouse. From 2002 to 2018, the period that marked her ascent to and occupation of the highest perch in her party's House leadership, she raised $680m for Democrats.

""Speaking was never her strong suit,"" Povich says. ""Her strong suit was the insider game, the coalition game, the organiser game.""

In the days ahead, Ms Pelosi will face a formidable set of challenges.

She must balance a restive base that yearns for confrontation with a more moderate Democratic establishment keen on keeping power, after eight years without.

When asked recently about how she viewed Robert Mueller's ongoing Russia collusion investigation, her answer was an exercise in the art of the political dodge.

""From our standpoint, what we're interested in is meeting the needs of America's working families,"" she said.

""To spend our time lowering health-care costs by reducing the cost of prescription drugs, increasing paycheques by building infrastructure of America. Both of those things are things that the president said he wanted to do during the campaign. So this is common ground.""

Democrats these days appear to have little interest in finding common ground with Mr Trump.

It's much more probable that the coming two years will be defined by acrimony, conflict and partisan gridlock.

The part played by Ms Pelosi will be crucial.

The Californian fought for eight long years to get back the gavel. It's time to see what she does with it."
15,reuters,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-shutdown-idUSKCN1P81FU,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A partial government shutdown entered its 24th day on Monday as talks between U.S. President Donald Trump and congressional Democrats remained stalled even as some of Trump's fellow Republicans called on the president to cut a deal and strains mounted nationwide.

Trump appeared unmoved to act, however, retweeting criticism of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer that urged the top Democratic leaders to negotiate with him over funding for his long-promised wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.

""I've been waiting all weekend. Democrats must get to work now. Border must be secured!"" Trump wrote in an early morning Tweet on Monday.

Democrats have rejected Trump's demand for $5.7 billion for the border wall in addition to other border funds but have said they would support $1.3 billion to bolster border security, including beefing up the number of Border Patrol agents and increasing surveillance.

About one-quarter of the U.S. government shut down last month as Republicans controlled both chambers of Congress as well as the White House. Trump must now win concessions from the Democrats, who took over the U.S. House of Representatives this month following November's elections. He must also win over enough Senate Democrats to secure the 60 votes needed to pass funding legislation there.

The stress from the shutdown became more visible as 800,000 federal employees across the United States missed their first paychecks on Friday. The cut government services also affected travelers as a jump in unscheduled absences among federal airport security screeners forced closures in Houston and Miami airports.

Republican U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham, who last week had called on Trump to declare a national emergency as a way to get money to build his wall, on Sunday urged the president to instead reopen the government for a short period of time in an effort to restart talks before taking such action.

Declaring a national emergency over ongoing immigration issues is fiercely opposed by Democrats and remains unpopular with some other Republicans. It would also likely face an immediate legal challenge.

Trump had said in a televised meeting with Pelosi and Schumer that he would be ""proud"" to shut down the government but has since blamed the Democrats, reportedly storming out of a White House meeting with them last week.

""Nancy and Cryin' Chuck can end the Shutdown in 15 minutes. At this point it has become their, and the Democrats, fault!"" he tweeted on Monday.

Representatives for Pelosi and Schumer could not be immediately reached for comment on Monday.

U.S. Senator Chris Coons on Monday reiterated fellow Democrats' call for Trump to reopen the government while negotiations over the wall and larger immigration issues continue.

He acknowledged efforts by Graham and other Republicans to forge a temporary solution but said Trump has been unpredictable even among fellow conservatives and keeps shifting positions.

""Every time they make progress, the president throws cold water on it,"" Coons told CNN in an interview."
16,reuters,https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-congress-budget-departments-factb-idUSKCN1OL0O9,"(Reuters) - Following weeks of talks between President Donald Trump and congressional leaders, parts of the U.S. government shut down on Saturday after negotiators reached an impasse over a deal to keep the government fully funded.

At issue was funding for a wall along the country's southern border with Mexico. The House of Representatives passed a bill that included $5 billion Trump had demanded for a wall, but the Senate included considerably less money for border security.

The partial shutdown will affect about 15 percent of the federal workforce, a senior administration official said on Saturday, as a majority of agencies and departments, including the Department of Defense and the Postal Service, already have secured funding.

Still, some 800,000 employees from the Departments of Homeland Security, Transportation and others will be affected.

According to the American Federation of Government Employees, 420,000 people who have been deemed ""essential"" must work without pay, while 380,000 others will not be able to report for work at all.

Trump administration officials say anyone working without pay will receive back pay once a deal is reached.

Below is what will happen at some of the agencies and departments affected by the shutdown.

The department that oversees Customs and Border Protection, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the Transportation Security Administration, the Coast Guard and the Secret Service is affected by the shutdown.

But most of those agencies' employees are considered essential, so they will need to work without pay until a government funding bill is passed.

Of the 245,000 people who work under the department's umbrella, nearly 213,000 have been deemed essential, according to the department's contingency plan.

Of the department's 7,500 employees, only 343 are expected to work. Nearly 1,000 other people may be called in to work on specific tasks, for which they will not be paid until a funding bill is passed.

Though public housing authorities and tribally designated housing entities are not part of the federal government and are not required to shut down, some of their funding is provided by the federal government, so they may need to reduce or change normal operating hours.

The department, which is also responsible for some housing loans and low-income housing payments, said in its contingency plan a shutdown would likely not significantly affect the housing market.

But, it added, ""a protracted shutdown could see a decline in home sales, reversing the trend toward a strengthening market that we've been experiencing.""

The National Park Service, under the umbrella of the Interior Department, will have a skeleton staff. Under its contingency plan, no national parks will be open and no visitor services - including restrooms, facility maintenance and trash collection - will be provided.

But some governors have pledged to step in, including in Arizona, the site of the Grand Canyon, and New York, where the state has provided funding for the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island to stay open.

Of the department's 55,000 employees, 20,400 will be put on leave. Those employees do not include most of the Federal Aviation Administration, where 24,200 will be working, or the Federal Highway Administration, where all 2,700 employees are funded through other sources.

Air traffic control, hazardous material safety inspections and accident investigations will continue, but some rulemaking, inspections and audits will be paused.

An estimated 1,100 of the office's 1,800 employees would be placed on leave. This will include most of the Office of Management and Budget, which helps the president implement his budget and policy goals."

President Trump began Thursday under siege, listening to howls of indignation from conservatives over his border wall and thrusting the government toward a shutdown. He ended it by announcing the exit of the man U.S. allies see as the last guardrail against the president's erratic behavior: Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, whose resignation letter was a scathing rebuke of Trump's worldview.

At perhaps the most fragile moment of his presidency -- and vulnerable to convulsions on the political right -- Trump single-handedly propelled the U.S. government into crisis and sent markets tumbling with his gambits this week to salvage signature campaign promises.

The president's decisions and conduct have led to a fracturing of Trump's coalition. Hawks condemned his sudden decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria. Conservatives called him a ""gutless president"" and questioned whether he would ever build a wall. Political friends began privately questioning whether Trump needed to be reined in.

After campaigning on shrinking America's footprint in overseas wars, Trump abruptly declared Wednesday that he was withdrawing U.S. troops from Syria, a move Mattis and other advisers counseled against. And officials said Thursday that Trump is preparing to send thousands of troops home from Afghanistan as well.

The president also issued an ultimatum to Congress to fund construction of his promised U.S.-Mexico border wall, a move poised to result in a government shutdown just before Christmas. Trump and his aides had signaled tacit support for a short-term spending compromise that would avert the shutdown, but the president abruptly changed course after absorbing a deluge of criticism from some of his most high-profile loyalists.

Leon Panetta, who served as former defense secretary, CIA director and White House chief of staff for Democratic presidents, said, ""We're in a constant state of chaos right now in this country."" He added, ""While it may satisfy [Trump's] need for attention, it's raising hell with the country.""

Panetta said the resignation of Mattis is a singular moment and his letter, which underscores how Mattis sees Trump's approach as misguided, ""puts the security of the nation right now at some degree of risk.""

Trump has been isolated in bunker mode in recent weeks as political and personal crises mount, according to interviews with 27 current and former White House officials, Republican lawmakers and outside advisers to the president, some of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity to offer candid assessments.

""There's going to be an intervention,"" one former senior administration official said speculatively. ""Jim Mattis just sent a shot across the bow. He's the most credible member of the administration by five grades of magnitude. He's the steady, safe set of hands. And this letter is brutal. He quit because of the madness.""

In his resignation letter, Mattis wrote, ""My views on treating allies with respect and also being clear-eyed about malign actors and strategic competitors are strongly held and informed by over four decades of immersion in these issues . . . Because you have the right to a Secretary of Defense whose views are better aligned with yours on these and other subjects, I believe it is right for me to step down from my position.""

Although Trump's relationship with Mattis has been rocky for months, the president spent the first part of Thursday focused on another fraying relationship: with his conservative base.

On Thursday, as criticism over his capitulation on the wall grew louder by the hour, Trump complained to friends and aides that he felt politically shackled. He had no plan, but was spoiling for a fight. By midday, the president picked one.

""I've made my position very clear: Any measure that funds the government must include border security. Has to,"" Trump said Thursday. He added that he had ""no choice"" but to act.

Trump's advisers acknowledged that the funding may not be secured in the end, but boasted that the spectacle would be remembered favorably by his base voters as proof of his mettle. A wall funding proposal was approved by the House late Thursday, but faced uncertain prospects in the Senate.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), habitually careful in his approach to Trump, avoided strong-arming the president in their recent exchanges, knowing that urging him to stand down on the wall funding likely would only embolden him, according to two people familiar with the discussions. At every turn, McConnell confided to Trump that congressional efforts this month -- from the passage of the farm bill to bipartisan criminal-justice reform -- were a string of victories for him, the people said.

Thanks to McConnell's soothing, there was cautious optimism that the president would eventually sign a funding bill. ""McConnell has a lot to do with it, of course. They talk a lot,"" Rep. Harold D. Rogers (R-Ky.), said. ""It's smart to save the fight for another day.""

House Speaker Paul D. Ryan (R-Wis.) -- busy this week bidding farewell to Congress after two decades in office -- followed McConnell's playbook, pointing out how Trump would be able to battle for wall funding in the new year, a person close to him said.

Both Ryan and House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) told Trump last week that they could not pass a spending bill with $5 billion for wall construction, and McConnell was told by the White House that Trump would sign a short-term bill without it, according to two people familiar with the conversations.

But on Fox News Channel and across conservative media, there was a brewing rebellion. Prominent voices urged Trump to hold firm on his wall money and warned that caving would jeopardize his reelection.

Rush Limbaugh dismissed the compromise bill on his radio program as ""Trump gets nothing and the Democrats get everything."" Another firebrand, Ann Coulter, published a column titled, ""Gutless President in Wall-less Country."" Trump even found resistance on the couch of his favorite show, ""Fox & Friends,"" where reliable Trump-boosting host Brian Kilmeade chided him on the air Thursday.

The president was paying attention. He promptly unfollowed Coulter on Twitter. And he pecked out a series of defensive tweets blaming congressional leaders for not funding the wall, while also staking a defensive posture. He suggested that a massive wall may not be necessary in its entirety because the border already is ""tight"" thanks to the work of Border Patrol agents and troops.

""One of the things he's most vulnerable to is mockery and mockery by his own supporters,"" said Mark Krikorian, a leading anti-immigration activist.

Members of the conservative House Freedom Caucus joined in the rebellion. During House votes on Wednesday evening, caucus chair Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) and other members refused to budge and held court with reporters, railing against the Republican leadership and warning Trump that he was being led astray.

At a Thursday Oval Office meeting with Ryan and McCarthy, Trump was calm and did not yell, but was resolute and ""dug in on what he wants,"" said a Republican official briefed on the discussion.

Trump spent six to seven minutes in the meeting with Ryan and McCarthy talking about ""steel slats"" and saying that the term was preferable to calling the proposed construction a ""wall,"" as the president has done for more than three years.

Theadministration drama comes at an especially perilous juncture for Trump, following his thumping at the polls in November's midterm elections. Democrats are preparing to take control of the House in January and to use their subpoena power to investigate Trump's finances and conduct in office, as well as alleged corruption in the administration.

Meanwhile, Republicans in their last gasp of unified government are divided. A band of hard-line conservative lawmakers voted against Trump's prison reform legislation, which passed the House and Senate with bipartisan support and is expected to be signed by the president Friday. And many foreign policy hawks, including Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.), a Trump confidant, sharply criticized Trump's decision Wednesday to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria.

Inside the Oval Office on Thursday, Trump was in what one Republican close to the White House described as ""a tailspin,"" acting ""totally irrationally"" and ""flipping out"" over criticisms in the media.

Even as aides argued to him that protesting over wall funding could deprive government workers paychecks over Christmas, Trump warned in private conversations with Republican lawmakers that they all would get ""crushed"" if they did not get the wall built.

Trump vented to his advisers that signing the short-term spending bill without wall money would make him look weak and make his base voters think he broke a campaign promise. He also complained that he did not have sufficient bargaining leverage with Congress and blamed senior aides -- including White House legislative affairs director Shahira Knight -- for not presenting him with better options.

""He's legitimately saying, 'This is ridiculous. Why would I sign this?'"" said American Conservative Union Chairman Matt Schlapp, whose wife, Mercedes Schlapp, is a senior White House staffer. ""If you're the outsider, you don't want to go along with the same old stupid rules. When he does that, he doesn't look like an outsider.""

Marc Short, Trump's former White House legislative affairs director, said, ""He feels he made a promise to voters that he would build the wall. There is a realization that with Congress changing hands, that the challenge of getting funding for the wall only gets larger.""

Trump's pin-balling conduct -- veering from a promise of a shutdown to moving toward a deal, and then changing his mind -- has vexed members of his own party. Many Republican lawmakers said they sense that Trump is adjusting uneasily to the dynamics of soon-to-be divided government and lashing out to reclaim some of his dominance over the congressional agenda.

The defense secretary's resignation compounded the concern.

""Having Mattis there gave all of us a great deal more comfort than we have now,"" retiring Sen. Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) said. ""Chaos has kind of been the norm but it seems to have been heightened. Sometimes you think it's got to settle, and then another thing happens."""

Scott Applewhite, File) By Eli Rosenberg Eli Rosenberg General assignment reporter covering national and breaking news December 20 at 8:09 PM

It was a partnership forged by necessity: Ann Coulter, the far-right commentator and provocateur, and Donald Trump, the reality-show star and Democrat-turned-Republican icon.

And for a while, it seemed like it was working. Trump touted Coulter's books and support on Twitter. Coulter returned the favor: calling Trump an ""emperor god,"" and titling a recent book, ""In Trump We Trust.""

They have a common goal: to build the wall on the southern border with Mexico that Trump made a central promise of his presidential campaign.

But Coulter has been one of the many voices from the far-right who has made it clear that their support is contingent on Trump being able to carry out his campaign pledge. It is unclear where she stands on Trump's campaign vows to have Mexico pay for the wall.

This week, Trump unfollowed Coulter on Twitter, according to an automated Twitter account that tracks changes to the Twitter accounts of the Trump family.

The small slight was a sign of the tension that swelled this week between the president and his far-right supporters after the White House signaled that Trump would back away from his vow to shut down the government if funding was not secured for the border wall.

Coulter, along with other allies in the hyper-partisan world of conservative media, led the charge, unleashing a full attack: on Twitter, in her writing, and on a podcast.

""Gutless President in Wall-Less Country,"" her column, which ran on Breitbart, was titled.

""This utterly unlikely and, at least for president, in many ways, a not particularly attractive presidential candidate beat the most qualified woman ever to run for the office, basically on one promise: the promise to build a wall and never backing down on that,"" she said on the Daily Caller's podcast.

She said that Trump's White House risked becoming a ""joke presidency that scammed the American people,"" if he wasn't able to get the wall built, and said she wouldn't vote for him in 2020 if he didn't.

""Why would you?"" she said. ""To make sure Ivanka and Jared can make money? That seems to be the main point of the presidency at this point.""

On Twitter, she tweeted a barrage of criticism about Trump.

[Ann Coulter called Trump an 'emperor god.' Now she calls him the 'worst negotiator.']

A master troll, she even retweeted an interview from the 1990s in which she spoke glowingly about the importance of the Constitution's impeachment clause.

Trump changed tack on Thursday after pressure from his base, saying that he wouldn't sign a budget deal that would avert a government shutdown without money for the wall. And Coulter had a retort.

""BREAKING: Doctors announce world's first successful spine transplant,"" she wrote.

Later, she tweeted, ""Maybe if we left Jared's friend, Saudi prince MSB, alone with Trump we'd get a wall!""

Coulter was referring to Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, often referred to as MBS, who has been accused of ordering the killing of dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi.

Coulter's anger over the lack of a border wall has been building throughout Trump's presidency. In September 2017, she went on another Twitter tear, issuing satirical insults directed at the president and again raising questions about impeachment.

She had drawn her line in the sand previously. In ""In Trump We Trust,"" she wrote that there was nothing Trump could do ""that won't be forgiven,"" except one thing: ""change his immigration policies.""

She told The Washington Post via email that Trump's Twitter snub was a minor slight.

""I don't think the important thing is his quitting as a follower, it's his quitting as a leader,"" she wrote.

With the partial government shutdown headed toward its second week and no resolution in sight, President Trump on Friday issued a string of tweets in which he once again vowed to close the entire U.S. border with Mexico and halt aid to several Latin American countries unless Democrats agree to his demand for billions of dollars in wall funding.

Trump is also canceling plans to visit his Florida resort, Mar-a-Lago, and will remain in Washington over the New Year holiday, Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney said.

About 25 percent of the federal government has been shut down since Saturday, with roughly 800,000 workers affected, including an estimated 350,000 who are on furlough at home.

""We will be forced to close the Southern Border entirely if the Obstructionist Democrats do not give us the money to finish the Wall & also change the ridiculous immigration laws that our Country is saddled with,"" Trump said in a morning tweet.

In a reprise of his threat before the midterm elections to cut off aid to Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador as a caravan of migrants was making its way toward the United States, Trump said that those three countries ""are doing nothing for the United States but taking our money.""

""Word is that a new Caravan is forming in Honduras and they are doing nothing about it,"" he said, without providing further details. ""We will be cutting off all aid to these 3 countries -- taking advantage of U.S. for years!""

Despite Trump's threat, the United States this month announced a new collaboration with Mexico on a program to curb migration from Central American countries, with much of the $10.6 billion U.S. contribution to be drawn from existing aid programs.

Trump's tweets come as Congress has effectively given up on breaking the impasse over the president's demands for border-wall funding, all but ensuring that the partial government shutdown will stretch into at least the start of the new year.

The House and the Senate convened for just minutes on Thursday before gaveling closed until next week. During the brief session in the House, Republicans shot down a Democratic attempt to vote on legislation to reopen the government.

As he did Thursday, Trump remained out of public view on Friday. In an appearance on Fox News, Mulvaney said that the president had ""canceled his plans for Christmas, and now he's canceled his plan for New Year's.""

""He's staying in Washington, D.C., over New Year's,"" said Mulvaney, who is set to become Trump's acting chief of staff next month.

Even though Trump will be in town and Republicans control both chambers of Congress, Mulvaney acknowledged that little progress on a deal is expected until the start of the new Congress on Jan. 3, when Democrats will retake the House. Contending that Democrats ""have simply shut down the discussions,"" he sought to place the blame on House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), who is expected to be elected speaker in the new Congress.

""Nancy Pelosi, in fairness, does not have the votes for the speakership yet,"" Mulvaney said. ""She cannot be seen by her party as being weak on negotiating with Donald Trump. So we fully expect that until she is elected speaker and has locked that vote up, we don't expect to hear from the Democrats again.""

According to a Washington Post tally, Pelosi, who won the Democratic caucus's nomination for the speakership in late November, appears to have secured enough support to be elected speaker in January.

Pelosi's spokesman, Drew Hammill, said in a statement Friday that Democrats ""are united against the President's immoral, ineffective and expensive wall -- the wall that he specifically promised that Mexico would pay for.""

Democrats will not consider any offers that have not been publicly endorsed by Trump himself, he said.

""While we await the president's public proposal, Democrats have made it clear that, under a House Democratic majority, we will vote swiftly to reopen government on Day One,"" Hammill said.

At the heart of the stalemate is Trump's demand for $5 billion in funding for his proposed wall at the U.S.-Mexico border. Congressional Democrats have rejected that figure and in recent weeks have refused to publicly endorse a figure above $1.3 billion, which continues existing funding levels and includes money for new border fencing and levee walls, but not the concrete wall Trump once demanded before he started more recently talking about ""steel slats.""

Mulvaney said Friday that ""some folks use the term 'wall' and they mean different things.""

""Everyone agrees that what we can and should be building on that southern border is that steel barrier that the president tweeted out. That's what he wants to build. The Democrats, believe it or not, don't call that a wall,"" he said.

20,washington post,https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/powerpost/paloma/daily-202/2018/12/18/daily-202-retirement-could-liberate-lamar-alexander-during-his-final-two-years-in-the-senate/5c1889631b326b2d6629d4d8/,"THE BIG IDEA: Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) likely would have won another term in 2020, but he probably would have faced a primary challenge from someone promising to march more in lockstep with President Trump.

In 2014, Alexander won the GOP nomination for a third term against two unknown challengers with less than 50 percent of the vote. He beat then-state Rep. Joe Carr, running as a tea partyer, by just nine points. He even lost his home county.

Now that he's decided not to seek reelection, the former cabinet secretary, governor and presidential candidate has two years to pursue his pragmatic instincts for compromise unencumbered by fear of blowback from grass-roots activists or donors. He can negotiate deals that would be able to pass a Democratic House, especially around health care or education, and possibly even speak out against Trump, who is temperamentally his opposite.

With Bob Corker and Jeff Flake leaving town next week, many have been wondering who -- if anyone -- will emerge in the next Congress as the leading conscience for conservatism against the backdrop of Trumpism. There's not an obvious spokesman for traditional Republican values like fiscal responsibility and morality.

Sen.-elect Mitt Romney (R-Utah) has gotten a lot of buzz because he's just secured a six-year term and was the party's standard-bearer in 2012, but he's still getting his sea legs and has signaled that he will mainly want to go along to get along, at least initially.

Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) has been more willing to speak truth to power, but he's up for reelection in 2020 -- which creates a strong disincentive to stand athwart Trump, yelling stop. At least until he wins his primary.

Ditto with Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), who long ago boarded the Trump Train.

Alexander's retirement announcement makes him a wild card to watch. Becoming a lame duck might embolden the 78-year-old to embrace the role of senior statesman. He is perhaps now as well positioned as anyone in the upper chamber to break the fever of tribalism that has infected and diminished what was once the world's greatest deliberative body.

""I have gotten up every day thinking that I could help make our state and country a little better, and gone to bed most nights thinking that I have,"" Alexander said in a statement. ""I will continue to serve with that same spirit during the remaining two years of my term.""

Alexander served five years as chair of the Senate Republican Conference, the No. 3 post in GOP leadership, but gave it up in 2012 because he wanted to focus more on legislating than messaging. Many lawmakers would kill for that role, and it said a lot about his approach to the job that he didn't want it anymore. ""He has stood for civility, for bipartisanship and for pragmatism, and the country is a better place because of him,"" said Sen. Orrin Hatch (R-Utah).

Senate Democrats see Alexander as an honest broker they can work with, and they are hopeful that not standing for reelection will sharpen his conciliatory instincts. Chuck Schumer said he ""felt a pang of sadness"" when he saw the afternoon news alert that Alexander was retiring while riding the Amtrak from New York to Washington. The Senate minority leader immediately phoned him. ""He reminded me ... he will still be around for two years and wants to work together to get things done, an Alexanderian statement if there ever was one,"" Schumer said in a floor speech last night.

The New York Democrat recalled that Alexander called him almost every day for a month to keep the opioid bill that Trump signed into law in October from getting derailed, and he said they always chat candidly when they're exercising together in the Senate gym. ""He seeks compromise almost reflexively, so both sides of the aisle trust him -- and respect him,"" said Schumer. ""I know I do, and we've worked together a great many times in my years here. Hopefully, as he said on the phone, there will be a few more opportunities in the next two years to work together successfully -- hopefully and God willing -- again.""

On the other hand, Alexander is much closer personally with Mitch McConnell than he is to Schumer. The Senate majority leader is now in cycle and could face a tough 2020 reelection battle in neighboring Kentucky. Alexander would seemingly be reluctant to take any actions that would make his friend's life much harder, such as the way that Flake has boycotted judicial nominees until he gets a vote on his bill to protect special counsel Bob Mueller.

Because Alexander's intent is to pass bills into law, he will also likely be reluctant to antagonize the president or pick fights that could poison the well. That's just not his style. Moreover, as a veteran of two administrations, Alexander is also more inclined to give the benefit of the doubt to the executive branch than some of his colleagues.

So don't expect Lamar! to go on TV and harangue the president. He's not going to publicly declare that Trump is putting us on track for World War III, as the outgoing chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee did. But Alexander could always become more forceful behind the scenes. ""I know he will press through the next two years with great vigor,"" Corker said in a statement, ""and I look forward to all he will accomplish ... as he completes his service in Washington.""

Alexander says he made up his mind to retire in August while he was fishing in Canada. The senator told Sean Sullivan in an interview that he waited until the end of the year before announcing his decision to ensure it was the right one: ""He called Trump on Sunday to inform him, and before he could reveal his decision to the president, Trump talked about him serving 20 more years, Alexander recalled. When he told Trump why he was calling, the president expressed disappointment, according to Alexander, but also congratulated him.""

He acknowledged that reaching across the aisle is harder than it used to be, but he also emphasized that more work gets done that way than most outsiders realize. He pointed to a copyright bill that recently was signed into law and will mean more royalties for songwriters in Nashville as an example of something that generated little fanfare. ""I think there's plenty that goes on in a bipartisan way, and I think the more senators we have who use those skills and work with each other, the better the Senate will be,"" Alexander told Sean.

Sen. Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) said Alexander has ""a unique capacity to bring people together"" in the divided Senate. ""He is a problem solver at a time when too many people in politics want to talk about a problem rather than solve a problem,"" said Blunt.

Health care is the biggest area where there's an opening for Alexander to lead. He will remain the chairman of the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee -- known in congressional parlance by its acronym HELP.

After Republican legislative efforts to repeal Obamacare failed last year, Alexander declared that it was time to make the law work. He chastised the forces inside his own party who believed the health-care system should be allowed to collapse and worked with Democrats to forge a compromise that would have resumed key payments to insurers, as a way to keep premiums down, in exchange for granting states greater flexibility to regulate health coverage.

""I would ask,"" Alexander said in a floor speech, ""what's conservative about creating chaos so millions can't buy health insurance?""

But forces in the Trump administration and congressional conservatives conspired to torpedo his deal with Sen. Patty Murray (D-Wash.). Instead, Republicans repealed the individual mandate as part of the tax code overhaul -- further undermining the stability of the exchanges and fueling a court challenge that will mean years of continuing uncertainty -- which could jeopardize coverage for people with preexisting conditions.

Alexander might be able to make headway coming up with fixes for the ACA that could lower health-care costs and make insurance more affordable. The president will be looking for wins he can run on in 2020 and might be more amenable than he was when Republicans controlled the House. Murray, who will continue to be the top Democrat on HELP, expressed hope:

Regardless of how the next two years play out, Alexander has had a truly remarkable run as a man in the arena. As an undergrad at Vanderbilt, he was editor in chief of the campus newspaper -- where he wrote editorials in the late 1950s and early 1960s against segregation. After law school at New York University, he clerked on the 5th Circuit for John Minor Wisdom, a progressive on race for his time.

Alexander went to work as a legislative assistant in 1967 for Sen. Howard Baker (R-Tenn.), who became his most consequential mentor and whose seat he now holds. Baker would later become Senate majority leader and then Ronald Reagan's White House chief of staff. Alexander left the Hill to become a staff assistant to Richard Nixon for two years before going home to manage Winfield Dunn's successful campaign for governor in 1970. Dunn became the first GOP governor in 50 years.

Alexander himself was the GOP nominee for governor four years later. But he lost in 1974 because that post-Watergate election was a nightmare for the GOP. He tried again and won in 1978 as Jimmy Carter's Democratic Party suffered significant losses in the South. During that race, in the pre-cellphone era, Lamar famously walked 1,022 miles across the state and stayed overnight at the homes of 73 supporters along the way. He was only 38 years old when he became governor, and he helped make the state a hub for automakers and accelerated an economic renaissance. After his second term, he became president of the University of Tennessee system. Then George H.W. Bush tapped him to be education secretary.

He waged credible campaigns for the Republican presidential nomination in 1996 and 2000. He easily won election to the Senate in 2002 when Fred Thompson retired and has won reelection twice. He'll have held statewide office for more than a quarter of a century when his third Senate term ends.

While everyone in the Capitol is buzzing about how Alexander will act now that he's not running, everyone in the Tennessee political class is obsessing over who will replace him. Outgoing Republican Gov. Bill Haslam would follow in the pragmatic tradition of Alexander, Corker and Baker -- and he'd be the front-runner if he chooses to run. Alexander appeared with Haslam on Monday for the unveiling of his portrait at the state capitol in Nashville. ""No one has served our state longer as a governor and senator and few, if any, have served it better than Lamar,"" Haslam said in a statement.

If Haslam passes on the Senate race, the party establishment might rally around Bill Hagerty, the ambassador to Japan, or someone like Diane Black, who lost the primary in the governor's race this year. The more confrontational, harder-edged wing of the GOP is looking to rally around Rep.-elect Mark Green, who just got elected to the House last month but sounds interested in seeking the Senate seat. The Club for Growth put out a statement yesterday urging Green to run.

""The reality is that whoever wants to replace Lamar Alexander will need to marry conservative values with proven results,"" said Republican strategist Brian Reisinger, a former Alexander spokesman. ""Tennessee has a long history of electing people who have a proven ability to get things done. ... Whoever succeeds Lamar will need to offer Tennesseans the same balance of principle and pragmatism that he has come to embody more than anyone else.""

-- The Senate's report on Russian disinformation revealed Kremlin trolls targeted Bob Mueller after he was appointed special counsel. Craig Timberg, Tony Romm and Elizabeth Dwoskin report: ""The Russian operatives unloaded on Mueller through fake accounts on Facebook, Twitter and beyond, falsely claiming that the former FBI director was corrupt and that the allegations of Russian interference in the 2016 election were crackpot conspiracies. One post on Instagram -- which emerged as an especially potent weapon in the Russian social media arsenal -- claimed that Mueller had worked in the past with 'radical Islamic groups.' ...

""On Monday, the NAACP called for a week-long boycott of Facebook starting Tuesday, saying the company's business practices -- and the spread of 'disingenuous portrayals of the African American community' on its site -- should prompt further congressional investigation. Facebook said in a statement that it has 'made progress in helping prevent interference on our platforms during elections, strengthened our policies against voter suppression ahead of the 2018 midterms, and funded independent research on the impact of social media on democracy.'""

-- ""Russia's support for Trump's election is no longer disputable,"" The Post's Editorial Board writes. ""Republicans have protested over the past year that election interference is neither unusual nor important. This week's reports comprehensively put both arguments to rest. Russia waged an unprecedented campaign, targeting Americans across all segments of society, on platforms large and small. ... The question now is whether committee members will be willing to hold Russia accountable in their own forthcoming review. Candidate Donald Trump once invited Russia to find Ms. Clinton's emails, sending the message that it could meddle with impunity. Though sanctions have been imposed since the election, evidently Russia has not been deterred. Until that changes, no reform will be sufficient.""

-- Two of Michael Flynn's business associates were indicted on charges of acting as agents of the Turkish government. Rachel Weiner, Matt Zapotosky and Carol D. Leonnig report: ""Throughout the fall of 2016, while Flynn served publicly as a key surrogate and foreign policy adviser to [Trump's] presidential campaign, prosecutors say he and business partner Bijan Kian took hundreds of thousands of dollars from the Turkish government to push for the extradition from the United States of dissident cleric Fethullah Gulen. Their efforts, prosecutors said, were directed by Kamil Ekim Alptekin, a Turkish businessman with close ties to the country's leadership. ... Flynn, who went on to serve as [Trump's] national security adviser, admitted last year to lying about his consulting firm's business with the Turkish government and agreed to cooperate with law enforcement in a deal with [Mueller's] team. That almost certainly helped produce charges against Kian and Alptekin. But the indictment Monday spells out for the first time how intimately Flynn was involved in the effort, which involved weekly conference calls to coordinate with Turkish officials.""

-- ""The indictment is further evidence that the idea that Flynn was just some guy going about his business who waltzed into an FBI trap is fanciful,"" Aaron Blake writes. ""The indictment lays out a kickback scheme that made it seem as if a Turkish businessman was the Flynn Intel Group's client, when, in fact, it was the Turkish government. It says Flynn and Kian met with high-level Turkish officials in New York in September 2016 about the effort -- despite Flynn having said that it was just to gain background about the country.""

-- Ahead of Flynn's sentencing today, Mueller released a January 2017 memo detailing the FBI's interview that month with the then-national security adviser. CNN's Katelyn Polantz reports: ""In the interview described in the memo, Flynn lied about his contact during the presidential transition in 2016 with then-Russian ambassador to the United States, Sergey Kislyak. ... He told the agents that 'no,' he had not sought to influence Russia's vote on a United Nations Security Council resolution about Israeli settlements. But investigators knew ... that Flynn had asked for Russia to vote against or delay the resolution. Flynn's second lie, as described in the FBI memo, came in response to the agents asking him about the US's expulsion of Russian diplomats or closing Russian properties following the Kremlin's interference in the 2016 election. They asked him if he had encouraged Kislyak not to retaliate. 'Flynn responded, ""Not really. I don't remember."" It wasn't, ""Don't do anything""' the memo said. But the FBI knew that Flynn had asked Russia on that call not to escalate its response."" (Read the memo here.)

-- After appearing again before House lawmakers, former FBI director Jim Comey accused Trump of trying ""to burn down the entire FBI."" Karoun Demirjian reports: ""'The FBI's reputation has taken a big hit because the president with his acolytes has lied about it constantly,' Comey told reporters ... But Comey directed his vitriol not just at the GOP members of the House Judiciary and Oversight and Government Reform committees, but at all Republicans -- including retiring GOP lawmakers, such as Sens. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) and Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.), who have openly criticized Trump but aren't seeking reelection.

""'At some point, someone has to stand up and face the fear of Fox News, fear of their base, fear of mean tweets, stand up for the values of this country and not slink away into retirement but stand up and speak the truth,' Comey said, without naming names. ... Comey reiterated [his defense of his actions as FBI director] more strongly Monday, flatly refusing to take any personal responsibility for the reputation of the FBI having suffered under his stewardship. He instead blamed Trump for 'lying about the FBI, attacking the FBI and attacking the rule of law in this country' and the 'silence from people in this building' -- meaning Capitol Hill -- for allowing him to do it.""

-- Trump ally Roger Stone admitted he spread false information on the far-right conspiracy website Infowars, but the information was not about WikiLeaks. From Tim Elfrink: ""To settle a lawsuit seeking $100 million in damages from Guo Wengui, an exiled Chinese businessman, Stone admitted that he 'failed to do proper research' before accusing Guo of violating U.S. election law by donating money to Hillary Clinton's campaign. Stone also falsely accused Guo, who is also known as Miles Kwok, of funding a presidential run by Stephen K. Bannon and being convicted of financial crimes. In a statement sent to The Washington Post, Stone blamed the falsehoods on Sam Nunberg, a former Trump aide who has now testified before a special counsel's grand jury.""

THE #METOO MOVEMENT:

-- CBS's board of directors announced Les Moonves would not receive any severance after the former chairman was accused of sexual misconduct. From Elahe Izadi and Travis M. Andrews: ""The network made the announcement after the completion of a company investigation that found Moonves guilty of 'willful and material malfeasance' and a failure to comply with the investigation. He was set to receive as much as $120 million as part of his severance package, depending on the results of the inquiry. Moonves resigned in September after several women accused him of sexual misconduct in a pair of scathing exposes in the New Yorker. A lawyer for Moonves called the CBS board's conclusions 'without merit.'""

-- Vanity Fair's Evgenia Peretz has an in-depth piece on the culture of Georgetown Prep, the school Brett Kavanaugh was attending when an assault alleged by Christine Blasey Ford would have taken place: ""At a typical party, the Prep boy would put the Who or the Stones on the turntable, and the action started. As [Kavanaugh's friend Mark] Judge put it, 'If you could breathe and walk at the same time, you could hook up with someone.' But hooking up wasn't always about mutual pleasure. Since Kavanaugh's confirmation hearing, countless women from his private-school scene have been sharing experiences they had that mirror the one Blasey Ford described. 'Like Chrissy, I don't remember the house where I was assaulted,' Kelly Fordon, who graduated Visitation in '85, says. 'I don't remember the date, and I'm absolutely certain that no one who was at the party besides me and the perpetrator would have any memory of the events. One thing I remember with absolute clarity is the person who assaulted me.'""

-- Australian actress Yael Stone accused actor Geoffrey Rush of sexual misconduct. The ""Orange Is the New Black"" star claimed Rush continually expressed sexual interest in her and ultimately exposed himself to her and watched her while she showered. Another actress has also accused Rush of similar harassment while they worked on a production of ""King Lear"" together. (A. Odysseus Patrick)

-- Former ""Prairie Home Companion"" host Garrison Keillor is taking a minor step back into the spotlight a year after he was ousted over a sexual misconduct allegation. The AP's Jeff Baenen reports: ""Fans laughed, applauded and sang along throughout Sunday night's two-hour show -- the second of back-to-back, sold-out Keillor performances at Crooners, a jazz nightclub in a northern Minneapolis suburb not far from where Keillor grew up. For Keillor, it's a much smaller audience than the millions of radio listeners he entertained on Saturday evenings during the heyday of 'Prairie Home.' But the nightclub show also represents a step into the spotlight for the 76-year-old Keillor a year after Minnesota Public Radio cut ties with him over a sexual misconduct allegation.""

THE IMMIGRATION WARS:

-- Republican leaders struggled yesterday to persuade Trump to strike a deal with congressional Democrats over border-wall funding to avert a partial government shutdown at the end of the week. Seung Min Kim, Erica Werner and Josh Dawsey report: ""At the White House, Trump has remained disinclined to support even stopgap measures that would keep federal government operations running for a week or two, told by his closest advisers that he would have even less leverage when Democrats take control of the House next month. Trump is also bolstered by support of rank-and-file Border Patrol agents, whose union leader told the president in a recent Oval Office conversation that they would back a wall-induced shutdown if the dispute came to that point.

""All that has left Republican lawmakers eager to avoid a shutdown unsure whether Trump would ultimately come around to at least one option that would end the impasse before Friday. Without a resolution that the president could sign before midnight Friday, roughly 800,000 federal workers will be furloughed or forced to work without pay in a partial shutdown that Trump has already -- and proudly -- claimed as his own. ... Trump has told people around him that he is frustrated that he does not have much leverage in the fight, and two presidential advisers said a shutdown was unlikely because there was no way the president could win. The White House plan is to not shut down the government, both of these people said.""

-- A senior Customs and Border Protection official told Congress that border officials are trying to limit asylum applications to discourage migration into the United States. BuzzFeed News's Hamed Aleaziz reports: ""The statement by Jud Murdock, CBP's acting assistant commissioner, contradicted official claims that the practice of 'metering' -- when officials limit the number of individuals who can make asylum claims at ports of entry on any given day -- was due to resource constraints, including a lack of detention space and personnel. When asked about the practice at a Senate hearing last week, CBP Commissioner Kevin McAleenan said that it was not meant as a deterrent. But on Dec. 6, Murdock said in a closed congressional briefing that CBP had chosen to limit asylum-seekers at ports of entries because '[t]he more we process, the more will come,' according to [a letter written by senior House Democrats].""

-- House Democrats want to question the Border Patrol agents who detained 7-year-old Jakelin Caal after she died in their custody. Nick Miroff reports: ""Democrats with the Congressional Hispanic Caucus say they will tour a Border Patrol station in New Mexico on Tuesday to 'investigate' the circumstances leading up to the death of a Guatemalan girl who collapsed hours after she and her father were taken into U.S. custody on Dec. 6. ... According to congressional aides, lawmakers want to question the Border Patrol agents present when Caal became critically ill, but CBP officials have not granted the request.""

THE REST OF THE AGENDA:

-- If the Texas judge's ruling striking down the Affordable Care Act makes it to the Supreme Court, it will face the same majority that twice upheld the law. Robert Barnes reports: ""The case first must be considered by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit and would not reach the high court until the term that begins next October -- leaving the issue unresolved heading into the 2020 presidential campaign. ... Still, legal experts cautioned against dismissing U.S. District Judge Reed O'Connor's decision as an implausible flight of judicial activism that is sure to be quickly struck down ... Many say they do not expect O'Connor's ruling to survive review at its next stop ... even though it is viewed as one of the nation's most conservative appeals courts. If the 5th Circuit overturns O'Connor's ruling, the controversy could end there. If not, the Supreme Court would almost surely accept an appeal for the term that begins in October 2019, with a decision coming [as late as June 2020].

""If it does end up before the Supreme Court, the fate of the ruling will probably hinge on Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. ... O'Connor drew extensively on Roberts's 2012 opinion that said the law could not be justified by the commerce clause, and that Congress's taxing power provided its legitimacy. It is possible the chief justice would be moved by that argument, and the individual mandate, and along with it the provisions that provide affordable insurance for those with preexisting conditions, should fall. But finding that the entire law is unconstitutional might be a more difficult ask. Roberts in 2012 quoted Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes when explaining that 'as between two possible interpretations of a statute, by one of which it would be unconstitutional and by the other valid, our plain duty is to adopt that which will save the act.'""

-- The Senate overwhelmingly voted to advance the chamber's criminal justice reform bill. Seung Min Kim reports: ""Senators voted 82 to 12 to end debate on the First Step Act and steer the legislation to a final vote, probably scheduled for Tuesday. The bill would revise several sentencing laws, such as reducing the 'three strikes' penalty for drug felonies from life behind bars to 25 years and retroactively limiting the disparity in sentencing guidelines between crack and powder cocaine offenses. ... Before a final Senate vote, dozens of the bill's proponents will have to defeat 'legislative poison pills' that they say are designed to kill the bipartisan compromise that has been carefully negotiated among Democratic and GOP lawmakers, as well as the Trump administration.""

-- A school safety commission created by Trump in the wake of the Parkland, Fla., shooting plans to recommend rolling back Obama-era policies meant to ensure that minority children are not unfairly disciplined. The New York Times's Erica L. Green and Katie Benner report: ""Almost immediately [after its creation], the commission turned away from guns and instead scrutinized the Obama administration's school discipline policies, though none of the most high-profile school shootings were perpetrated by black students. ... The documents obtained by The Times -- a draft letter and a draft chapter of the safety commission's research -- focus significantly on race and promote the idea that the federal crackdown on potentially discriminatory practices has made schools more dangerous.""

-- Trump plans to sign an executive order formally creating a U.S. Space Command. The AP's Zeke Miller and Lolita Baldor report: ""Vice President Mike Pence will make the announcement Tuesday at the Kennedy Space Center, in Cape Canaveral, Florida, two U.S. officials said, and Trump could sign the order as soon as Tuesday. The move is separate from Trump's goal of creating a 'Space Force' as an independent armed service branch, but could be a step in that direction. The U.S. Air Force's existing Space Command would be a key component of the new joint entity, raising space to the same status as U.S. Cyber Command. ... The move would actually recreate a U.S. Space Command, which existed from 1985 to 2002.""

-- House Democrats' Blue Dog Coalition has undergone a radical transformation since its creation in 1994 and is poised to play a significant role in the next Congress. Paul Kane reports: ""Blue Dog membership will hit at least 24 next year and more are being recruited. This will make them a force to be reckoned with in the next two years, as Democratic leaders will have fewer than 20 votes to spare to pass legislation if Republicans stand united against them. ... These Blue Dogs may not come from Alabama and Mississippi anymore, but they still represent swing districts and are reluctant to support sweeping legislation like single-payer universal health insurance. These Blue Dogs want to focus on the campaign pledges that swept Democrats back to power in the House, such as stabilizing health costs and an infrastructure plan.""

ALL THE PRESIDENT'S MEN:

-- Ryan Zinke's departure from the Interior Department will probably not end investigations into his possible ethical misconduct. Politico's Ben Lefebvre and Zack Colman report: ""Interior's in-house watchdog said Monday that it will keep pursuing the multiple investigations it has open into Zinke. The probes by the Interior inspector general's office include one into Zinke's involvement in a Montana land deal ... that is backed by Dave Lesar, chairman of the giant energy company Halliburton. ... The Justice Department declined to comment on multiple news reports that it is pursuing its own probe into the land deal. But if such a criminal probe were underway at DOJ, Zinke's departure would be unlikely to derail it ... On top of those investigations, Zinke and his successor will still have to face House Democrats who are eager to scrutinize the Trump administration's policies of opening lands for drilling and mining while shrinking the size of protected federal monuments in the West.""

-- The nonpartisan Office of Congressional Ethics announced there is ""substantial reason to believe"" outgoing Rep. Rod Blum (R-Iowa) misused House resources to support his personal business, held back material information about his financial stake and allowed the company to engage in an ""unfair or deceptive trade practice"" to solicit customers. But Blum won't face formal sanctions because he lost reelection last month, and the Ethics Committee will no longer have jurisdiction come January. Elise Viebeck lays out what the congressman did: ""The OCE's investigation began in March after the Associated Press reported that Blum violated House ethics rules by failing to disclose his ties to Tin Moon, a company that promises to help clients bury unflattering information in their Internet search results. The OCE found that Blum did not include his financial stake in Tin Moon on a 2016 disclosure form and that he probably underestimated his interest in the business on the amended form. Blum has called the omission a 'minor, unintentional oversight' and downplayed his role in the company, describing himself as a '$700 passive investor.' But the company website identified him as CEO and included his official congressional photo on its website until ... the AP published its story ... A video testimonial that appeared on the site in 2016 featured Blum's then-district director John Ferland [who is currently his chief of staff] representing himself as a small-business owner and encouraging others to 'take a look at Tin Moon.'""

-- Mick Mulvaney, the president's new acting chief of staff, said in 2016 that Trump's past actions and comments would disqualify him from office in an ""ordinary universe."" CNN's Andrew Kaczynski reports: ""On October 7, 2016, a week before Mulvaney made the comments, the Access Hollywood tape of Trump making lewd comments about women, including bragging about grabbing them by the genitals, was made public. 'My guess is worse stuff is going to come out in the last 30 days,' Mulvaney said ... 'That's not going to make Hillary Clinton a good candidate for president.' 'Should either of these people be, be a role model for my 16-year-old triplets? No,' Mulvaney said. 'In an ordinary universe, would both of these people's past activities disqualify them for serving for office? Yes. But that's not the world we live in today.""

2020 WATCH:

-- Republican operatives are testing new strategies for how Trump should present himself to voters as he seeks reelection. Michael Scherer reports: ""One polling effort is intended to test messages and policy initiatives for the next State of the Union address and the coming year, while providing a better understanding of what worked and what did not in the midterm elections, according to a person familiar with the Trump reelection effort. ... Other Republican-aligned research projects are planned to decode the 2018 results in an effort to reclaim voters Trump will probably need to win reelection. The research will test the appeal of crossover issues Trump could champion in swing states among voters the GOP has been losing -- such as new initiatives to control the costs of prescription drugs, deal with student loan costs and tackle the opioid crisis. ...

""The Republican National Committee has launched its own data analysis of the 2018 results. A second effort is affiliated with America First Action, a super PAC that spent more than $30 million before this year's election, largely in states that are expected to be battlegrounds in 2020. The third effort by another outside group that supported Trump's 2016 campaign will focus on decoding the sentiments of counties in the Midwest that voted for Barack Obama in 2008 and Trump in 2016.""

-- Trump's 2020 campaign intends to adopt an unusual organizational structure that will involve merging with the RNC. Politico's Alex Isenstadt reports: ""It's a stark expression of Trump's stranglehold over the Republican Party: Traditionally, a presidential reelection committee has worked in tandem with the national party committee, not subsumed it. ... The goal is to create a single, seamless organization that moves quickly, saves resources, and -- perhaps most crucially -- minimizes staff overlap and the kind of infighting that marked the 2016 relationship between the Trump campaign and the party. While a splintered field of Democrats fight for the nomination, Republicans expect to gain an organizational advantage.""

-- Mayor Pete Buttigieg (D) of South Bend, Ind., announced he would not seek a third term, positioning himself for a likely presidential run. Annie Linskey reports: ""Buttigieg would not be the first mayor to attempt such a jump -- nor, likely, even the sole mayor in the 2020 Democratic presidential field. But he would put forth a distinct profile, as a 36-year-old former Rhodes scholar and Afghanistan veteran who is gay and married. 'I know now that the time has come for me to prepare the city for new leadership again,' Buttigieg said during a news conference at his office. Asked about his political future, Buttigieg said he doesn't plan to make an announcement until the new year. ... Buttigieg already has a trip on the books to Iowa.""

-- Rep. Tulsi Gabbard (D-Hawaii) is seeking potential staffers for a presidential campaign and may make an announcement as soon as this week. BuzzFeed News's Alexis Levinson reports: ""If Gabbard runs, her supporters say, she could be the candidate who quenches the current political thirsts. At 37, she would be one of the youngest candidates in the field. She's an Iraq War veteran and became the first Hindu in Congress when she was elected in 2012. And she has bona fides as someone who was proposing climate change legislation before potential Democratic presidential candidates started signing on to the Green New Deal.""

-- Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) is reaching out to Iowa Democrats before she formally announces her 2020 bid. The Des Moines Register's Brianne Pfannenstiel reports: ""'She's not calling me to ask about the weather or my Christmas plans,' said Tri-County Democrats Chairman Kurt Meyer, who received a call from Warren in early December. 'We talked about issues and things that were important to her and things that I care about.' Warren is one of the few possible Democratic presidential contenders who has not visited the first-in-the-nation caucus state in recent months, though she did deploy staff and resources to aid Iowa Democrats ahead of the midterms. The phone calls reflect continued movement behind the scenes as Warren decides whether to formally launch a presidential campaign. She said before the midterms that she would 'take a hard look' at doing so.""

-- Warren is expected to release a bill today aimed at lowering drug prices by having the government mass-produce generic drugs. Politico's Alex Thompson and Sarah Karlin-Smith report: ""The bill, dubbed the Affordable Drug Manufacturing Act, is unlikely to pass the Republican-led Senate, but it signals that a future Warren White House could try to radically revamp the federal government's role in the pharmaceutical market in order [to] try to lower prices. ... Warren is one of several senators eyeing White House runs who have introduced bills targeting the pharmaceutical industry. ... The flurry of bills suggests that the powerful pharmaceutical industry will be a major populist target during the Democratic presidential primary and possibly the general election, as millions of Americans struggle with rising health care costs.""

-- Potential 2020 contender and New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo (D) said he would push to legalize recreational marijuana. The New York Times's Vivian Wang reports: ""The highly anticipated proposal came in a speech in Manhattan on Monday, in which the governor outlined his agenda for the first 100 days of his third term. ... The speech, which seemed delivered with a national audience in mind, could prolong slow-burning speculation about Mr. Cuomo's presidential ambitions. It also showed, in striking detail, the governor's leftward evolution in his eight years in office, from a business-friendly centrist who considered marijuana a 'gateway drug,' to a self-described progressive championing recreational marijuana, taxes on the rich and a ban on corporate political donations.""

-- Rep.-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) is considering backing a 2020 primary challenge to Rep. Hakeem Jeffries (D-N.Y.). Politico's Laura Barrón-López reports: ""[Ocasio-Cortez] put colleagues on notice for future primaries just days after the November election, telling a livestream audience that she and an allied group, Justice Democrats, would keep working together to boost anti-incumbent challengers -- though she didn't name names. But a person who has discussed the project with Ocasio-Cortez and her team said the congresswoman-elect has recruited an African-American woman to challenge Jeffries, who was just elected to replace [Rep. Joe Crowley (D-N.Y.)] as caucus chairman -- the No. 5 House Democratic leadership position. ... The group feels Jeffries takes too much money from corporate interests, a key litmus test, and is overly friendly with banking and pro-charter school interests.""

-- A former Democratic federal prosecutor is considering a 2020 Senate run against Sen. Pat Roberts (R-Kan.). McClatchy's Bryan Lowry reports: ""Roberts looks vulnerable to Democrats -- and some Republicans, and that's a big reason the 2020 race has quickly drawn a prominent potential challenger, former U.S. Attorney for Kansas Barry Grissom. Grissom confirmed Monday that he's been considering a run for U.S. Senate as a Democrat for roughly a year. He's not officially made his decision, but he's actively ... laying the groundwork to mount a challenge against Roberts, the Kansas Republican who has been in Congress for nearly four decades.""

THE NEW WORLD ORDER:

-- Talks between U.S. diplomats and Taliban representatives on ending the war in Afghanistan stretched into a second day. Sayed Salahuddin reports: ""Initially, the talks between the Taliban emissaries and a team led by U.S. envoy Zalmay Khalilzad, as well as officials from Pakistan, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates, were expected to last one day, but Taliban spokesman Zabiullah Mujahid confirmed that the meetings would continue through Tuesday. The Taliban said Monday that its delegates had no plans to meet with members of the Kabul government, which it insists is just a puppet of the Americans and too divided internally to negotiate effectively.""

-- Trump's tumultuous relationship with German Chancellor Angela Merkel epitomizes his confrontational stance toward U.S. allies that has led some to wonder whether he is trying to destroy the European Union. The New Yorker's Susan B. Glasser reports: ""Europe has had many fights with American Presidents over the years, but never in the seven decades since the end of the Second World War has it confronted one so openly hostile to its core institutions. Since Trump's election, Europe's leaders have feared that it would come to this, but they have disagreed about how to respond to him. ... The challenge from Trump has been especially personal for Germans, whose close relationship with the United States has defined their nation's postwar renaissance. ... [French President Emmanuel Macron] has sought to guide the Continent through the standoff with Trump, but has struggled, because the President's harsh words reflect a painful truth: Europeans are dependent on the United States for their security and increasingly divided as Putin's Russia threatens the nations in the east.""

-- British Prime Minister Theresa May announced a new parliamentary vote would be held on her Brexit deal in mid-January. Karla Adam reports: ""May said parliamentary debate on the deal would resume Jan. 7, with a vote held the following week. That didn't satisfy her critics. Opposition Labour party leader Jeremy Corbyn tabled a largely symbolic motion of no confidence in the prime minister, 'due to her failure to allow the House of Commons to have a meaningful vote straightaway.' The motion, directed at May personally, might be embarrassing for her but could not bring down her government. It also doesn't require the government to allot time to debate it. On Monday it was unclear when or if such a debate would happen.""

-- A Saudi human rights commission is investigating alleged torture of jailed women's rights activists. The Wall Street Journal's Margherita Stancati and Summer Said report: ""A top aide to Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, Saud al-Qahtani, allegedly oversaw some aspects of the torture and threatened at least one jailed woman with rape and death, according to testimony before the commission, [government] officials and others said.""

21,washington post,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2018/12/26/ruth-bader-ginsburg-released-hospital-after-lung-cancer-surgery/,"By Deanna Paul Deanna Paul Reporter covering national and breaking news December 26 at 1:21 PM

Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg was discharged from the hospital Tuesday, Supreme Court spokeswoman Kathleen Arberg confirmed.

The 85-year-old justice underwent a pulmonary lobectomy at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center last week to remove two malignant nodules in her left lung. Friday's procedure went smoothly, doctors said, and there was ""no evidence of any remaining disease elsewhere in the body.""

[Ruth Bader Ginsburg says she has 'at least 5 more years' on the Supreme Court. Her fans rejoice.]

Ginsburg, the oldest sitting member of the nation's highest court, has had her fair share of health scares:

She has combated colorectal and pancreatic cancer, though she did not miss an oral argument during treatment, and received a heart stent in her right coronary artery. Last month, she was hospitalized for three fractured ribs.

Because Ginsburg is one of four liberals on the court, her health has been a point of scrutiny and observation since President Trump's rise to power.

[Ruth Bader Ginsburg has surgery for malignant nodules in her lung]

Trump called for her resignation during his 2016 presidential campaign, tweeting that her ""mind is shot.""

Ginsburg has said she intends to remain on the bench.

""As long as I can do the job full steam, I will do it,"" Ginsburg said last year, despite being five years above the average retirement age of the 11 justices preceding her. She has also reportedly hired law clerks through 2020.

Ginsburg will spend the remaining holiday season recuperating at home. The Supreme Court, which is not in session until the new year, will next hear cases Jan. 7.

'I am all alone': An isolated Trump unleashes a storm of Yuletide gloom

Trump forces Mattis out two months early, names Shanahan acting defense secretary"
22,washington post,https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/paloma/the-trailer/2018/12/20/the-trailer-iowa-s-field-of-dreamers/5c1a841d1b326b6a59d7b1f0/,"In this edition: The other Democrats come to Iowa, the race for Chicago's mayor heats up, the Democrats get a debate schedule, and the lame-duck legislatures set the table for 2020.

This will be the last Trailer of 2018; Congress may not be done with the year yet, but voters are. We'll be back in action once the traditional pagan ritual in Times Square inaugurates the new year.

DES MOINES -- On Thursday morning, as the Democratic National Committee announced new rules to maximize the number of presidential candidates allowed into the party's primary debates, three Democrats were demonstrating why. Sen. Jeff Merkley (Ore.); Rep. Eric Swalwell (Calif.); and Pete Buttigieg, mayor of South Bend, Ind., arrived in Iowa ahead of a liberal group's fundraising dinner -- none of them polling above 1 percent, all of them very serious about running in 2020. And they're not at all worried about the competition.

""I don't feel like I have to get in early to get ahead,"" Swalwell said in an interview at Scenic Route, a cafe that's become a magnet for Democratic operatives in Des Moines. ""I see a pathway for a next-generation candidate who has experience in government but not so much that they're jaded.""

Months before the primaries get underway, Democrats are making peace with the likelihood of an enormous field and embracing the lack of an obvious front-runner. While former vice president Joe Biden has led in polls of Iowa and New Hampshire, he has not locked up early party endorsements, as Hillary Clinton did in the run-up to the 2016 campaign. (Like Clinton at this point in the 2016 cycle, Biden has not yet announced anything.) Just a handful of Democrats, like former New Orleans mayor Mitch Landrieu, have suggested that they'll stay out of the race if he runs -- and that's out of personal friendship, not political fear.

""It's a wide open field right now, with people coming from every direction,"" Merkley said. ""There's an attitude in Iowa of looking forward to having two or three dozen people descend on the state.""

The relatively slow start to this race has created a large class of dreamers, ambitious Democrats who can see themselves walking the same path as Jimmy Carter or Barack Obama. One party operative here, who had not settled on a candidate but had talked to several, divided the field between ""guys who've been here"" and ""guys who haven't."" Progress Iowa, the group gathering Swalwell, Buttigieg, Merkley and businessman Andrew Yang in Des Moines tonight, has gotten used to the ""star"" candidates skipping events; that, according to the candidates who are actually coming, has created a brief opportunity to shape the race.

As The Post's Matt Viser reported this week, Iowa Democrats have welcomed the parade to their state. The 2016 experience is fresh and bitter in activists' minds, from the early crush of support for Clinton -- 60 members of Congress had endorsed her by this point four years ago -- to a general election that saw some supporters of Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) stay home or back a third party. The perception of a Clinton coronation, and of a conspiracy to stop Sanders, stuck with the party long past the primary, even influencing the DNC's decision to open up the debates.

""Even if it's coming on the back end of a calamity for our party, the fact that there's no juggernaut, or no single program to get behind, is a very good thing,"" Buttigieg said. ""It's really a fertile time for new people and new ideas to emerge.""

Despite that, Iowa Democrats say the scramble for local political talent is happening more slowly than they anticipated. Operatives have had months of conversations with candidates and their representatives, and hires began more than a year ago, starting with Maryland Rep. John Delaney's early presidential announcement and his decision to focus on early states before anyone else even considered it.

Candidates don't see donors as locked in yet, either.

""I've already talked to some major Democratic donors who've signaled that they're going to donate to 10 or 12 people,"" Buttigieg said. ""In the staff primary, people need to pick one candidate; in the finance primary, they very much don't.""

The early polling strength of Biden and Sanders has created an opening that dozens of other candidates fit into: the chance to be new. Instead of nostalgia for the Obama years, they could start with voters by arguing that no Democrat had gotten this stuff right yet.

In interviews, the candidates addressing Progress Iowa's Thursday night gala repeatedly emphasized that they had been vocal, early, on an issue that the party should have embraced in 2016. Merkley cited a renewable energy plan; Swalwell cited student loan forgiveness.

""I'm not hearing candidates talk about solving problems in bold ways,"" Swalwell said. ""My friends in the Bay Area don't even engage with government because they don't think it can solve problems anymore. The great leaders of our time -- President Roosevelt, President Johnson -- they proved that it could.""

Merkley, who was elected to the Senate in 2008 as a critic of the judicial filibuster, said he wanted Democrats to consider bold governing ideas like the end of the filibuster for legislation. There was no appetite, he said, for yet another president who united the country during his campaign then alienated it by failing to deliver on big ideas.

""Part of the cynicism out there is that people can vote for a president and a Congress to pursue aggressive action, but you've got a minority that blocks it from getting to a final vote,"" Merkley said.

While Merkley endorsed Sanders for president in 2016, he said Sanders was not a factor in his 2020 plans; even if the senator from Vermont announced another run, Merkley might jump in. None of the lesser-known candidates were put off by polling, as there were simply too many case studies of candidates lagging in name recognition and catching fire once their campaign was in place.

""I don't think polling tells you very much right now,"" Buttigieg said. ""Even polling three days out from the caucus doesn't tell you much."" This isn't wrong; the perpetual drama in Iowa is a year of candidates like Rick Santorum or Ted Cruz being asked why they haven't surged yet, right before they do.

Biden's political speeches before the midterms tore into the Trump administration while harking back to a period when Washington and the Senate could achieve big things. In the weeks before the real scrum begins, the lesser-known candidates are asking Iowans to think about this: If the big names in the party were equipped to beat Trump, why hadn't they stopped him before?

""There's a lot of people in the field who've been doing this for a while,"" Swalwell said. ""They've either been in the majority in the Senate, or they've run before. We need to turn a page forward, not a page backward.""

No, there's no typo here: Republicans aren't contesting the election for mayor of the Midwest's biggest city, and have not for years, even though the race is nonpartisan. (Democratic Party affiliation is added to the names above because we know which party the candidates support.) The election is on Feb. 26 and will be followed by a runoff unless, as seems unlikely, one candidate cracks 50 percent of the vote. If there's a surprise here, it's the weak support for Bill Daley, a scion of the city's legendary political family who has made several runs for office, then quit when support seemed to be lacking.

That could leave a contest between Preckwinkle, who considered challenging Mayor Rahm Emanuel in 2015, and Mendoza, who has been portrayed as a natural Emanuel successor but fought hard against that image. In 2015, left-wing opposition to Emanuel coalesced behind the surprisingly strong campaign of Jesus ""Chuy"" Garcia, who is now headed to Congress; something to watch here is whether the left can cohere behind someone else. (So far it doesn't seem to be happening to Enyia, who gained national attention after an endorsement from Chance the Rapper.)

In this decade, only Florida has disappointed Democrats with as much aplomb as Kentucky. The party began the 2014 race for U.S. Senate, the 2015 race for governor and the 2018 race for the 6th Congressional District with polls that showed a clear path to victory. It lost all of those races as rural and increasingly Republican voters turned out bigger than expected.

What could be different in 2019? Gov. Matt Bevin, who won the office in one of those red wave upsets, has been consistently unpopular, increasingly so since the capture of the state legislature in 2016 allowed him to pursue pension reform, Medicaid work requirements and other conservative policies that lack strong Kentucky constituencies. Beshear, the son of the state's last Democratic governor and its attorney general since 2016, has positioned himself against that agenda; this is also a state where the long-shot GOP attempts to repeal the Affordable Care Act, and by doing so scrap Medicaid expansion, has put one of the party's weakest issues in the forefront.

Still: Republicans saw bad polls in every major Kentucky race this decade; not since 2011, when Beshear's father won a second term, have they failed to run ahead of those numbers.

Chicago Mayor. Speaking of Bill Daley, he's finally on the air ahead of the Feb. 26 election, with an ad urging Chicagoans to ""get real"" and focusing entirely on the need to ""get guns off our streets"" and cut property taxes. Daley is the only white, male candidate in the race's top tier; notably, he's pictured talking exclusively to people who are not white men.

Immigration. People for the American Way is continuing to make under-the-radar digital buys in swing states with lots of Latino voters. Its newest, in English and Spanish, tells the story of Jakelin Caal, the 7-year-old migrant girl who died in a processing center.

It's official: the Democratic National Committee will sponsor 12 presidential primary debates, three more than it did in the 2016 cycle -- and twice as many as it had planned to that year. Six will be held in 2019, starting in June and starting outside the first four primary states (Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada, South Carolina). To handle what could be the largest candidate lineup in history, the party will draw lots for debates; if it is unable to fit every credible candidate on one stage, it will split the debate in two.

""It's conceivable that we could have a double-digit field of candidates,"" said DNC Chairman Tom Perez in a Thursday morning call with reporters. ""To compete by random assignment for those first debates is the best way to not play favorites. We've also been discussing the possible contingency of having debates on consecutive nights.""

The only candidates with anything to lose from the debate plan were the many lower-profile Democrats who start the race with single-digit poll numbers; the DNC will factor in ""grass-roots fundraising,"" not just polling, in its debate berths, something that could put insurgent candidates on the level. In conversations Thursday, Rep. John Delaney (D-Md.); Rep. Eric Swalwell (D-Calif.); and South Bend, Ind., Mayor Pete Buttigieg, none of whom have cracked 1 percent in polls, said they considered the rules to be fair.

But the laws of the universe demand Democrats to be in some amount of disarray; if not, Republicans want to put them there. America Rising celebrated the debate announcement, calling it ""a fantastic early Christmas present"" of ""the enormous field of Democrat candidates attacking one other and racing to the left night after night."" Worth noting: The Republican National Committee signed off on exactly as many debates, 12, in the 2016 primaries.

Joe Biden. He had the strongest net favorable ratings of any Democrat tested in Quinnipiac University's latest poll -- 53 percent of voters view him positively, compared with 33 percent who view him negatively. The only downside, as far as nervous Democrats see it: Plenty of polls showed Hillary Clinton just as or even more popular than this during the years between her time at the State Department and her reentry into politics.

Sherrod Brown. His march through the political press continued with a perceptive Henry Gomez profile in BuzzFeed. Brown is also getting closer to potential ""dignity of work"" events in early primary states -- none this year, but perhaps in January.

Amy Klobuchar. She sat down for an interview with the New Yorker, continuing to sketch out her potential advantages as a candidate by describing how she continues to win voters who have abandoned other Democrats: ""You go not just where it's comfortable but where it's uncomfortable. And to me that means being there,"" in counties that went for Trump.

Imagine this scenario. It's a few weeks before a tough election. A caravan of immigrants is heading toward the U.S.-Mexico border, ready to ask for asylum. Republicans seize on the issue, asking if Democrats can still deny that there's a need for more border security, including a wall. Come Election Day, Republicans lose 40 seats.

What's incredible about the latest political lurch toward a shutdown over border security is that it's happening so soon after the issue utterly failed to boost Republicans in the midterms -- an outcome that emboldened Democrats heading into 2020. With weeks of polling to sift through, Democrats now believe the border wall cost them marginally in some rural districts where they were never favored to win, while boosting them in the suburbs; the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee's executive director, Dan Sena, told us as much earlier this month.

Public polling has also found that the issue at the center of the shutdown fight, the border wall, remains narrowly unpopular. On Wednesday, the Quinnipiac University poll found 43 percent of voters backing a wall; just 34 percent backed a government shutdown if that was what it took to get it funded. Consistently, when the wall is offered as its own issue, and not as part of a comprehensive immigration package, it tanks.

Why does Congress keep ending up here? Simple: The base of the Republican Party, amplified on conservative media, has both endorsed the wall as a must-pass litmus test issue and insisted that a shutdown that ends with wall funding will be an incredible win for the president.

The second part of that is true, but not as some conservative talkers understand it. Early this year, the president briefly entertained a deal that would have secured $25 billion of border security funding, which he interpreted as money for the wall, in exchange for a Dream Act. Without rehashing the drama, we know two things: It could have passed, and it would have divided Democratic politicians from an activist base that rallied around a ""Clean Dream Act"" with no wall money. Trump had, and squandered, an opportunity to weaken his opponents and get what he wanted.

That's not an option anymore, but there's a large amount of conservative commentary that insists it is -- or that the polls are wrong, and getting money for a wall would set the president up for 2020. There's a real risk of the president being talked into a series of confrontations, across 2019 and 2020, that shore up a base too small to reelect him. It's hard to find any Democrat worried about this.

Democrats in three swing states have spent the month since the midterm elections fighting, and often losing, efforts by lame-duck Republican legislatures to pass new rules that would restrict the party that beat them. In Wisconsin, Gov. Scott Walker has signed the lame-duck bills weeks before Democrat Tony Evers takes office; in North Carolina, Republicans expect they will be able to get new laws that alter voter ID and special election laws past Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper's veto, days before they lose their veto-proof majority.

The rest of the action is underway in Michigan, where Democrats believe they have the best chance of blocking lame-duck bills, some by bipartisan votes and some by appeals to the retiring governor, Rick Snyder (R). Thursday morning began with nearly 150 bills, passed by the strongly Republican state Senate, facing votes in the House.

""You've seen a groundswell of people standing up and protesting in the Capitol,"" said Sam Singh, the outgoing Democratic leader in Michigan's House. ""You just saw the House adjourn because they couldn't get the votes for some of these Senate bills. Many of the bills that they've already sent to the governor could get vetoed; many have constitutional problems and we'll pursue those in court.""

At the end of the year, we'll have a final tally of how many of these post-election bills made it to a governor's desk. The ones Democrats want to stop most in Michigan are related to voting rights; one, which the party badly wants to kill, would amend the voter-passed automatic registration initiative so that to register on Election Day, voters would need to leave their polling place and head to a county clerk's office. When the dust settles, expect plenty of liberal strategizing on which of these lame-duck issues can become voting issues in 2020 and targets for reversal in 2021.

Not President Trump.

Trump, who spoke of ""American carnage"" in his inaugural address, seems plainly uninterested in seizing the mantle of moral leadership on the global stage. He's consistently displayed a Hobbesian and Machiavellian approach to power politics during his nearly two years in office, eschewing the pillars of Lockean, Wilsonian and Reaganite thought while de-emphasizing the promotion of democracy and human rights as aims of U.S. foreign policy.

His blase responses this fall to the killing of Washington Post contributing columnist Jamal Khashoggi and what the United Nations calls the world's worst humanitarian crisis in Yemen have put in stark relief Trump's abdication of that traditional moral leadership role.

On Thursday afternoon, a bipartisan coalition in Congress moved to fill the void and perform this function of the presidency that Trump has essentially outsourced. Senators voted 56-to-41 to cut off U.S. military support for Saudi Arabia's often brutal conduct in the Yemen civil war. It's the first time either chamber of Congress has asserted itself against the executive branch by using the War Powers Act, which became law during the depths of the Vietnam quagmire in 1973.

A few minutes later, the Senate voted unanimously to approve a separate, nonbinding resolution that blames Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman for what happened to Khashoggi. The CIA concluded that MBS, as he's known, probably ordered and monitored the dismemberment of the dissident journalist inside a Saudi consulate in Istanbul on Oct. 2. But Trump has touted the authoritarian prince's denials and sought to play down the expert assessment of his own intelligence community. There's even a tape.

""Unfortunately, at a moment in which it is most needed, the Trump administration has abdicated America's moral leadership,"" said Sen. Mark Warner (D-Va.), the vice chair of the Intelligence Committee. ""In filling that void, and in light of the actions by the Saudis both in Yemen and in Khashoggi's murder, the Senate must send a message that America's moral voice will not be diminished.""

-- Thursday's vote was a personal and political triumph for three senators across the ideological spectrum who have made ending the war in Yemen their shared cause. Each believes strongly in the profound power of American moral leadership, and that Congress should reclaim the power to make war that the framers of the Constitution intended. Sen. Mike Lee (R-Utah), one of the most conservative members of the Senate, forged an alliance last year with Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), a self-described democratic socialist, and Sen. Chris Murphy (D-Conn.), who is primarily known for advocating stricter gun control, to figure out ways to get the United States out of Yemen. They introduced the resolution that passed yesterday (with amendments) early in the year, but it was tabled in March. Khashoggi's heinous death created momentum to get it on the floor.

""Today was a victory for the Constitution and the separation of powers,"" said Lee, who secured support from six of his GOP colleagues for the war powers resolution. ""With this vote, we are one step closer to reviving our constitutional framework -- where the power to declare war lies with Congress, not the executive branch -- and we have taken a step towards removing ourselves from the spread of human suffering in Yemen.""

""For decades, under Republican presidents and Democratic presidents, Republicans congresses and Democratic congresses, the Congress of the United States has abdicated its constitutional responsibility for war-making,"" said Sanders. ""It is not the president who has the responsibility under the Constitution to send our young men and women to war. It is the Congress. And we have got to take it back.""

""A bipartisan majority spoke with one voice that the status quo is over, and we will no longer accept the war crimes being committed in our name,"" said Murphy. ""The momentum is on one side, and it's only growing. Congress has woken up to the reality that the Saudi-led Coalition is using U.S. military support to kill thousands of civilians, bomb hospitals, block humanitarian aid and arm radical militias. The Saudis are important partners, but they need to realize that our partnership is not a blank check for them to fund extremists and murder civilians.""

-- House Republicans plan to ignore the war powers measure, and the White House has indicated Trump will disregard the nonbinding resolution, but the Senate debate appears to have had some impact at the negotiating table.

A broader campaign of international pressure from the West has pushed the Saudis to make concessions in peace talks after four years of fighting. The United Nations has brokered negotiations in Sweden this week between Yemen's Saudi-backed government and the Houthis, the Iran-backed rebel group. The two sides agreed yesterday to a cease-fire in the port city of Hodeida, which serves as a critical lifeline for humanitarian aid into the country. They also apparently settled on terms for a prisoner swap. ""We are living the beginning of the end of one of the biggest tragedies of the 21st century,"" U.N. Secretary-General António Guterres told reporters.

""Previous cease-fire agreements have collapsed quickly. But there has been greater international pressure on the warring sides in recent months to de-escalate the fighting, in part because of warnings by relief agencies that more than 16 million people in Yemen -- more than half of the country's population -- are facing famine-like conditions,"" Kareem Fahim and Missy Ryan report from Riyadh. ""More than 60,000 people, combatants and civilians, have been killed in the conflict since 2016, according to an estimate by the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project.""

-- Many senators said they hope the resolution accelerates peace talks by putting Saudi Arabia on notice that they cannot count on unquestioning American support. ""There must be a negotiated end to the fighting in Yemen, and the Saudi government must clearly understand that as a strategic ally of the United States, it has a responsibility to act in ways that promote democracy, human rights and stability in the region,"" said Sen. Rob Portman (R-Ohio). ""[W]e must send a message to the administration that we need a stronger response on this issue.""

""After reviewing the overwhelming evidence, it is clear that the Saudi-led coalition's actions in Yemen are no longer something we, as the leader of the free world, can support,"" added Sen. Joe Manchin (D-W.V.). ""This resolution ... sends a clear message ... that the United States will no longer tolerate their disregard for human life.""

-- Paul Ryan, doing the bidding of the administration in one of his final acts as speaker, jammed language into the farm bill on Wednesday that will prevent the House from using the War Powers Act during the remainder of the lame-duck session to cut off U.S. support for the Saudi effort in Yemen.

""It's a common technique in the House: An unpopular measure is snuck into something that must pass. The gimmick worked, but only because five Democrats who had worked on the farm bill broke with their party to support it,"" Dave Weigel reports. ""In the new Democratic Party, that meant that five more Democrats were being talked about as targets for primary challenges. Alexandra Rojas, whose group Justice Democrats is recruiting challengers in 2020 House races, said the farm bill vote had galvanized activists who were on the verge of winning the Yemen fight.""

-- But the comfortable margin in the Senate showed how much juice the well-heeled Saudi lobby has lost and could be a harbinger of what's to come once Democrats control the House, from implementing sanctions to curtailing arms sales to Riyadh. ""American foreign policy should be dictated by our national security interests and our values, not by the interests of the Saudi royal family,"" said Sen. Maggie Hassan (D-N.H.).

""We won't enable a president who chooses to cover up for Saudi leadership instead of standing up for American values,"" added Sen. Tim Kaine (D-Va.).

-- How it's playing:

-- This new street sign has just been erected outside our headquarters:

WHILE YOU WERE SLEEPING:

-- Trump's insistence for much of the year that he had ""no knowledge of any payments"" to silence the women who allege they carried on extramarital affairs with him while the first lady was home caring for their infant son tops The Post Fact Checker's list of ""the biggest Pinocchios of 2018."" Glenn Kessler explains: ""There has been no serial exaggerator in recent American politics like the president. He not only consistently makes false claims but also repeats them, even though they have been proved wrong. The explosion of false and misleading statements from him in 2018 is well documented in our database: In the seven weeks leading up the midterm elections, the president made 1,419 false or misleading claims -- an average of 30 a day. ... Meanwhile, the midterm election campaign, of course, was also an endless source of false claims, as an avalanche of negative ads tumbled across televisions screens. One of the president's ads is included on this list. Two potential opponents of the president in 2020 -- Sens. Kamala D. Harris (D-Calif.) and [Bernie] -- earn spots on our list. ...

""Trump says many things that are factually incorrect, but he sometimes says things that are mind-blowingly false. Despite having access to more information than anyone on Earth, he persists in making claims with literally no foundation. He has repeatedly claimed that U.S. Steel announced it is building new plants -- anywhere from six to nine -- but that's not true. He said that as president, Barack Obama, gave citizenship to 2,500 Iranians during the nuclear-deal negotiations, but that's not true. Over and over, Trump claimed that the Uzbek-born man who in 2017 was accused of killing eight people with a pickup truck in New York brought two dozen relatives to the United States through 'chain migration.' The real number is zero.

""Trump and his aides claimed they did not have a family separation policy, when in fact they did. They said U.S. laws or court rulings forced them to separate families that crossed the border illegally, but that was not true. When a caravan of more than 5,000 migrants from Central America started making its way to the border, another series of dubious claims was spawned, including that people of Middle Eastern descent were involved. The president also falsely claimed that he had started building his border wall, but Congress has not appropriated the necessary funds.""

-- Trump's 2017 inaugural committee is being investigated by federal prosecutors for possible misuse of funds. The Wall Street Journal's Rebecca Davis O'Brien, Rebecca Ballhaus and Aruna Viswanatha report: ""The criminal probe by the Manhattan U.S. attorney's office, which is in its early stages, also is examining whether some of the committee's top donors gave money in exchange for access to the incoming Trump administration, policy concessions or to influence official administration positions. Giving money in exchange for political favors could run afoul of federal corruption laws. Diverting funds from the organization, which was registered as a nonprofit, could also violate federal law. ... The investigation partly arises out of materials seized in the federal probe of former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen's business dealings ... In April raids of Mr. Cohen's home, office and hotel room, [FBI] agents obtained a recorded conversation between Mr. Cohen and Stephanie Winston Wolkoff, a former adviser to Melania Trump, who worked on the inaugural events. In the recording, Ms. Wolkoff expressed concern about how the inaugural committee was spending money. ...

""The inaugural committee has publicly identified vendors accounting for $61 million of the $103 million it spent, and it hasn't provided details on those expenses, according to tax filings. As a nonprofit organization, the fund is only required to make public its top five vendors. The committee raised more than double what former President Barack Obama's first inaugural fund reported raising in 2009, the previous record. [Trump's] funds came largely from wealthy donors and corporations who gave $1 million or more -- including casino billionaire Sheldon Adelson, AT&T Inc. and Boeing Co.""

-- The prosecutors are investigating whether the inaugural committee, as well as a pro-Trump super PAC, accepted illegal foreign donations, according to the New York Times's Sharon LaFraniere, Maggie Haberman and Adam Goldman. ""The inquiry focuses on whether people from Middle Eastern nations -- including Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates -- used straw donors to disguise their donations to the two funds. Federal law prohibits foreign contributions to federal campaigns, political action committees and inaugural funds. ... Thomas J. Barrack Jr., a billionaire financier and one of Mr. Trump's closest friends, raised money for both funds. ... The super PAC, Rebuilding America Now, was formed in the summer of 2016 when Mr. Trump's presidential campaign was short of cash and out of favor with many major Republican donors.""

-- Multiple news outlets have now confirmed that Trump himself was at the August 2015 meeting where Cohen and National Enquirer publisher David Pecker discussed hush-money payments to the president's alleged mistresses. The Wall Street Journal first reported the president's attendance at the meeting last month. NBC News's Tom Winter reports: ""As part of a nonprosecution agreement disclosed Wednesday by federal prosecutors, American Media Inc., the Enquirer's parent company, admitted that 'Pecker offered to help deal with negative stories about that presidential candidate's relationships with women by, among other things, assisting the campaign in identifying such stories so they could be purchased and their publication avoided.' The 'statement of admitted facts' says that AMI admitted making a $150,000 payment 'in concert with the campaign,' and says that Pecker, Cohen and 'at least one other member of the campaign' were in the meeting. According to a person familiar with the matter, the 'other member' was Trump.""

-- In his first interview since being sentenced, Cohen said of the hush-money payments that Trump ""was very concerned about how this would affect the election."" John Wagner reports: ""Cohen, who has admitted facilitating payments to two women in violation of campaign finance laws, told ABC News that he knew what he was doing was wrong. Asked whether the president also knew it was wrong to make the payments, Cohen replied, 'Of course.' He added that the purpose was to 'help [Trump] and his campaign.' ... His comments, in an interview on 'Good Morning America,' are at odds with those of Trump on Thursday in tweets and a television interview.""

-- ""[The president's] evolving strategy on the hush-money allegations is textbook Trump: Tell one version of events until it falls apart, then tell a new version, and so on -- until the danger passes,"" Philip Rucker and John Wagner report. ""The latest developments have exposed the depth of Trump's efforts to deceive the public about the illegal hush-money payments, and some of his friends and advisers said privately that they fear those efforts could imperil the president. While there is a consensus view inside the White House that a sitting president will not be indicted, [a] former senior administration official described a deep uncertainty about other ways that Trump could be held liable. And there is growing anxiety among Trump's allies, including in Congress, that he could be vulnerable to the various investigations and, eventually, Democratic-led impeachment proceedings.""

-- The escalating investigations, aided by cooperation from Trump's former allies, have left the president feeling increasingly isolated. The Los Angeles Times's Chris Megerian and Eli Stokols report: ""Several [people] close to the president ... said Trump already senses diminishing respect and worries about losing support from powerful financial donors and Republican lawmakers as his legal and political troubles worsen. 'They're still not saying it publicly, but most Republicans on the Hill understand ... that it's not going to end well, that it's going to be bad,' said a longtime Republican operative close to party leadership.""

-- The latest developments in the Russia investigation have reinvigorated claims from Trump's critics that his election victory was illegitimate. Marc Fisher reports: ""The evidence emerging in recent days and months that multiple crimes were committed in an effort to help Trump win the presidency is fueling arguments from Democrats and other Trump critics that the man in the Oval Office got the job through nefarious means. Even with no proof that those crimes swayed votes, the critics say, Trump has no moral hold on the office. ... Trump and his defenders retort that prosecutors so far have fallen well short of proving criminal deeds by the president himself. They say the legitimacy debate is just one more weapon in a bristling partisan arsenal deployed by Trump haters on the left.""

-- Another threat: House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said she expects a House committee to ""take the first steps"" toward getting Trump's tax returns after Democrats retake the chamber next month. John Wagner reports: ""Pelosi said the decision on whether to initiate the process will fall to the Ways and Means Committee. Rep. Richard E. Neal (D-Mass.), who is expected to become chairman of the tax panel, has said he plans to insist that Trump release his tax returns. If Trump doesn't do so voluntarily, then Neal plans to file a legal request with the Treasury secretary that would require that the returns be disclosed to a small group of people on Capitol Hill. Neal has predicted that the matter would end up in federal court.""

-- The guilty plea of Russian agent Maria Butina has cast an unwanted spotlight on the National Rifle Association, a group she allegedly infiltrated at the highest levels and whose legal exposure remains unclear. Rosalind S. Helderman, Tom Hamburger and Michelle Ye Hee Lee report: ""One of Butina's main targets was the NRA -- a group she identified in a 2015 memo as an organization that 'had influence over' the Republican Party, according to court filings. Her relationships with the group, she wrote, could be used as the groundwork for an unofficial channel of communication to the next presidential administration. Later that year, she helped organize a delegation of top NRA leaders to visit Moscow, arranging for them to meet Russian government officials, and she attended the group's annual conventions as an honored guest. Butina and Alexander Torshin, a former Russian government official who helped direct her activities, then used their NRA connections to get access to GOP presidential candidates.""

""NRA officials, who did not return requests for comment Thursday, have repeatedly refused to answer questions about Butina or its interactions with Russian activists. NRA spending on the 2016 elections surged in every category, with its political action committee and political nonprofit arm together shelling out $54.4 million. The bulk of the money -- $30 million -- went to efforts supporting Trump. That is triple the amount the group devoted to electing Republican Mitt Romney in the 2012 presidential race. ... The group's spending on federal races in 2018 plummeted to roughly $9 million.""

-- Mueller's pattern of getting guilty pleas from cooperating witnesses may suggest his investigation is nearing its end. Devlin Barrett reports: ""In the cases of Cohen, former campaign adviser George Papadopoulos, former campaign chairman Paul Manafort, and former national security adviser Michael Flynn, Mueller has proceeded to the sentencing of each without first making him testify at trial against others. That's at odds with the common practice of prosecutors -- which is to hold the stick of a tougher prison sentence over defendants until they have completed all of their cooperation, particularly any public testimony. While the recent legal action has led to speculation that prosecutors are narrowing in on the president in anticipation of more criminal charges, Mueller's sentencing timeline suggests a different outcome to some legal experts -- that the accounts of those cooperating witnesses will appear in a written report, not in court.""

-- The House and Senate Intelligence Committees are looking to talk to several people who have been charged in Mueller's investigation. CNN's Jeremy Herb and Manu Raju report: ""The [Senate] committee has been engaged in discussions with the special counsel and defense attorneys to get access to several cooperating Mueller witnesses in addition to Cohen, including Flynn, Papadopoulos and [Manafort's deputy Rick] Gates, according to a source familiar with the investigation. ... The expected incoming chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff of California, has also expressed a desire to speak again to Cohen, who testified behind closed doors before both intelligence panels last year. Schiff has said he's in touch with Cohen's legal team, too.""

-- Friends and associates of Michael Flynn agree that his public persona underwent a radical transformation in the past few years, but they are divided as to why. Marc Fisher writes in an in-depth piece on Trump's former national security adviser: ""His friends and critics agree that after winning a reputation as a master intelligence officer on the battlefields of Iraq and Afghanistan, Flynn broke with lifelong patterns of behavior. Once discreet and apolitical, he morphed into a highly partisan alarm ringer. A man once trusted to cautiously analyze information began touting wild hearsay as fact. ... Did he gradually absorb a new, conspiracy-minded worldview, in part inspired by his son Michael Jr.'s embrace of fringy ideas? Did he discard lifelong habits because he'd been enraged to his core when President Barack Obama's administration in 2014 removed him as director of the Defense Intelligence Agency (DIA), his last and most senior military assignment? Or had Flynn, who retired as a lieutenant general, long harbored extreme views, successfully shielding his real opinions from those around him?""

THE IMMIGRATION WARS:

-- Stories from the border: A 7-year-old girl from Guatemala died of dehydration and exhaustion after she was taken into Border Patrol custody last week. Nick Miroff and Robert Moore report: ""The child's death is likely to intensify scrutiny of detention conditions at Border Patrol stations and CBP facilities that are increasingly overwhelmed by large numbers of families seeking asylum in the United States. According to CBP records, the girl and her father were taken into custody about 10 p.m. Dec. 6 south of Lordsburg, N.M., as part of a group of 163 people who approached U.S. agents to turn themselves in. More than eight hours later, the child began having seizures at 6:25 a.m., CBP records show. Emergency responders, who arrived soon after, measured her body temperature at 105.7 degrees, and according to a statement from CBP, she 'reportedly had not eaten or consumed water for several days.' ... The agency is investigating the incident to ensure appropriate policies were followed.""

-- Trump pledged to do ""whatever it takes to get border security,"" even as he tried to shift blame toward Democrats for any potential government shutdown. Erica Werner, Damian Paletta and John Wagner report: ""In a video posted on Twitter, Trump attacked Democrats as 'absolute hypocrites' and claimed they've supported funding border barriers in the past but won't do so now because of their opposition to him. The video showed images of people rushing the border and included clips of [Chuck Schumer], former secretary of state Hillary Clinton and [Barack Obama] speaking in opposition to illegal immigration and in favor of border security. 'We need to have the wall. We need border security. Whatever it takes to get border security, I will do it,' Trump says in the video. 'I pledged that a long time ago, and I will pledge it always.'"" Reminder: Trump said just three days ago he would be ""proud"" to shut the government down over wall funding.

-- Lawmakers say no progress has been made on a border wall deal since Trump had his contentious meeting with Schumer and Pelosi. Politico's Sarah Ferris, Burgess Everett and Anthony Adragna report: ""Lawmakers say there is no public plan to prevent a partial government shuttering. And no secret plan either. 'There is no discernable plan. None that's been disclosed,' said Sen. John Cornyn, the Senate's No. 2 Republican, as he threw his hands into the air. ... The House isn't planning to return until the night of Dec. 19 -- leaving only about 72 hours to reach a border wall deal that has eluded both parties for months. Democrats say they're waiting on Republicans, and Republicans say they're waiting on Trump.""

-- In case you missed it: ICE has arrested 170 immigrants who sought to sponsor migrant children. NBC News's Daniella Silva reports: ""ICE said Tuesday that the arrests were of immigrants suspected of being in the United States illegally and took place from early July to November. They were the result of background checks conducted on potential sponsors of unaccompanied migrant children placed under the care of the Department of Health and Human Services. Nearly two thirds of those arrested -- 109 in total -- had no criminal record, the agency said. Another 61 of those arrested did have criminal records, but ICE did not specify the crimes and said it could not break down convictions by violent and nonviolent offenses.""

-- DHS issued a news release entitled, ""Walls Work,"" which included questionable claims about the progress being made on Trump's border wall. USA Today's William Cummings reports: ""'DHS is committed to building wall and building wall quickly,' reads the release, which eschews the use of articles in many instances. 'We are not replacing short, outdated and ineffective wall with similar wall. Instead, under this President we are building a wall that is 30-feet high.' 'FACT: Prior to President Trump taking office, we have never built wall that high,' the message adds. The government has built higher walls, but the statement presumably meant to specify it was referring to a border wall.""

WEST WING INTRIGUE:

-- Trump is considering his son-in-law Jared Kushner for White House chief of staff, according to HuffPost's S.V. Date: ""[Kushner] met with Trump Wednesday about the job, a top Republican close to the White House [said]. He and two others close to Trump or the White House ... confirmed Kushner's interest in the position. ... Kushner has been pushing his own candidacy with Trump, citing his work on a criminal justice reform package and a claimed ability to work with Democrats, one person said. 'I don't know why he thinks that, when the Democrats are mainly going to be coming after Trump,' the source said. ... Trump told reporters Thursday that he is down to five finalists. 'We are interviewing people now for chief of staff,' he said at a photo opportunity with newly elected governors who were visiting the White House.""

-- Trump also met with former New Jersey governor Chris Christie about the job last night, per Axios's Jonathan Swan. ""[Trump] considers him a top contender to replace John Kelly as chief of staff, according to a source. ... Trump has met with a couple of others, but the way he's discussed Christie to confidants make them think he's serious. His legal background may come in handy next year.""

-- Some advisers are encouraging Trump to consider young White House aide Johnny DeStefano for chief of staff. The LA Times's Eli Stokols reports: ""Several people close to the president are promoting [DeStefano], who was a political aide to former House Speaker John A. Boehner before joining the administration as Trump's director of personnel. He since has seen his portfolio expand and often travels with the president.""

-- The president's top aides remain deeply divided over whether Trump's former deputy campaign manager David Bossie should be considered for the job. Politico's Gabby Orr, Andrew Restuccia and Rebecca Morin report: ""Some White House allies say [Bossie] shot to the top of the list the minute Trump expressed an interest in having an effective political operator in the slot. His chances only improved, they add, when Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.), head of the conservative Freedom Caucus, fell out of the running. But others quickly dismiss the speculation, saying the Trump world adviser can't overcome opposition within the first family and lingering concerns about a hotheadedness that kept him out of the West Wing to begin with.""

-- ""Trump's hunt for a new chief of staff has taken on the feel of a reality TV show,"" the AP's Catherine Lucey and Jonathan Lemire write. ""No leading name has emerged in the days since Trump's preferred candidate to replace John Kelly bowed out. But the void has quickly filled with drama. ... Trump himself likes to feed the drama, dropping hints about the number of candidates in the running and bantering with journalists about who wants the job. The erratic search recalled the transition period before Trump took office, when prospective aides and television personalities paraded before a pack of journalists in the lobby of Trump Tower. Author Chris Whipple, an expert on chiefs of staff, called the search process 'sad to watch.'""

IF YOU COME AT THE QUEEN, YOU BEST NOT MISS:

-- There are two deeply reported tick-tocks this morning on how Nancy Pelosi locked down the votes to become speaker. Both focus on the many strategic and tactical mistakes made by Rep. Seth Moulton (D-Mass.), the ringleader of the rebels trying to take her down. The hyper-ambitious Moulton has become a lightning rod, and Pelosi allies -- including some of the biggest donors in the Democratic Party -- are now determined to field a primary challenger against him in 2020.

-- ""Moulton had drawn up list of 58 Democrats who he knew wanted a new leader. Most of those, he said he believed, would sign a letter expressing opposition to Pelosi. ... Instead of 35 names, the rebels ultimately released a letter Nov. 19 with only 16 names,"" Mike DeBonis and Robert Costa report. ""'A lot of summer soldiers around here,' Moulton, a former Marine Corps officer, would say.

-- ""Moulton told his colleagues that he'd win over the incoming freshmen, even referring to these lawmakers as 'my candidates,' according to multiple Democratic sources,"" per Politico's Rachael Bade, Heather Caygle and John Bresnahan. ""Moulton had a personal connection to the anti-Pelosi candidates who had military backgrounds. He campaigned with them, raised money for them and worked alongside VoteVets, a progressive political organization supporting veterans running for office, to try to get them elected. Moulton told these members-elect that Pelosi was going to be ousted and that it would be good for them politically to join the movement. But Moulton oversold his sway, rebel sources complained. Rep.-elect Mikie Sherrill, a former Navy helicopter pilot running in New Jersey, had released an ad against Pelosi and campaigned with Moulton. But she wouldn't go anywhere near the letter. Several other freshmen who received help from Moulton also avoided the letter.

""Pelosi had neutered Moulton right under his nose. Just days after the election, she phoned VoteVets' Chairman Jon Soltz and asked for his help wooing the incoming freshmen. Soltz had been working with Moulton but also had a close relationship with Pelosi. Soltz decided his group would remain neutral. But he gave the candidates advice that proved critical to helping Pelosi, sources said: Think about the long game. To be an effective legislator, you will have to work with the next speaker -- which more likely than not would be Pelosi. The advice worked. The candidates refused to sign the rebels' document. And when Moulton lobbied harder for their signatures, he repelled them even more. In fact, some female veterans told other Democrats that they were annoyed with Moulton, these lawmakers said, concluding that they were being used for Moulton's own political gain. ...

""He asked for a meeting with Pelosi to start talks between the two sides -- then misled his fellow rebels about who initiated the discussion, according to three sources familiar with the incident. Moulton told [Rice] and Rep. Tim Ryan (D-Ohio) -- perhaps Pelosi's staunchest critics in the group -- that Pelosi requested the meeting. In reality, he had gone to Pelosi's staff and said he wanted to sit down. It created an awkward dynamic before a terrible meeting. Rice walked into Pelosi's office and said, 'Thank you for calling this meeting.' 'I didn't ask for this meeting,' Pelosi scoffed. An awkward silence ensued, and the meeting unraveled from there.""

-- The term-limit deal Pelosi negotiated has once again cast a spotlight on her complicated relationship with her No. 2, Steny Hoyer (D-Md.). The New York Times's Sheryl Gay Stolberg reports: ""The friction goes back decades. The last time Democrats took power from Republicans, in 2006, Ms. Pelosi backed then-Representative John P. Murtha in his effort to oust Mr. Hoyer from the majority leader's slot. The putsch failed spectacularly, but she's ready to handcuff him again with a deal on term limits. ... Some see Mr. Hoyer as the ultimate corporate pol, out of sync with a Democratic caucus in which women, millennials and people of color are in ascendance, with the loudest new voices on the left. ... But over his more than 50 years in public life, 37 of them in Congress, Mr. Hoyer has proved himself a quiet survivor.""

MIDTERMS FALLOUT:

-- GOP congressional candidate Mark Harris directed the hiring of the operative now at the center of election fraud allegations in North Carolina, despite warnings about his tactics. Amy Gardner and Beth Reinhard report: ""Harris sought out the operative, Leslie McCrae Dowless, after losing a 2016 election in which Dowless had helped one of Harris's opponents win an overwhelming share of the mail-in vote in a key county. State and local investigators say that whether Harris knew that his campaign may have engaged in improper tactics has become a focus of the expanding probes into whether election irregularities affected the 9th District election, in which Harris leads Democrat Dan McCready by 905 votes. That question is also roiling the state Republican Party, whose leaders had rallied around Harris, a 52-year-old evangelical pastor from the suburbs of Charlotte. Party leaders are now backing away from Harris and trying to limit the fallout of a scandal that has delayed certification of the last undecided federal contest of the 2018 election cycle. ...

""Harris was warned about possible fraud on primary day in June 2016, during his first bid for the 9th District congressional seat, according to people familiar with the conversation. The incumbent congressman and winner of the primary had received just one mail-in vote in rural Bladen County. Harris, who came in second place, had won four. Johnson, the last-place contender, meanwhile, had received nearly all of them -- 221. The only explanation, advisers told Harris that night in Charlotte, was that something shady had occurred on that third-place campaign, according to the people. A year later, they said, when Harris resolved to run for Congress again, the candidate personally directed the hiring of Dowless, an adept field operative and Bladen County native who had helped deliver that unusual result in 2016.""

-- Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey (R) is cooling on the idea of appointing former Senate candidate Martha McSally to John McCain's old Senate seat if Sen. Jon Kyl (R) steps aside. Sean Sullivan reports: ""Ducey has made no firm decision and McSally, who narrowly lost this year's Senate race, remains a finalist. ... But her stock has fallen in the eyes of the governor, according to two people familiar with his thinking, as Ducey approaches one of the most significant decisions of his political career. Ducey's choice would affect not only the future of the Senate but the 2020 elections in an increasingly competitive battleground state. It could also impact his relationship with [Mitch McConnell], a McSally advocate, as well as other party leaders who want to see more Republican women in Congress.""

-- A federal judge rejected GOP Rep. Bruce Poliquin's lawsuit challenging Maine's candidate-ranking system. The AP's Marina Villeneuve and Patrick Whittle report: ""Poliquin sought to have the voting system declared unconstitutional after he lost the election to Democrat Jared Golden despite having the most first-place votes. Poliquin asked U.S. District Judge Lance Walker either to declare him the winner or order another election for the 2nd Congressional District. But Walker, appointed by [Trump], said states are given great leeway in how they conduct elections. Critics can question the wisdom of ranked-choice voting, Walker said, but such criticism 'falls short of constitutional impropriety.'""

-- Kansas's incoming Democratic governor turned down a White House invitation to meet with Trump and other governors-elect, according to the Wichita Eagle's Jonathan Shorman and Bryan Lowry. ""Trump campaigned aggressively for Gov-elect Laura Kelly's Republican opponent, Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach, this fall. ... Kelly's team said she was unable to travel to Washington because she is focused on the transition and the state budget. ... Kelly and every other newly elected governor was invited to attend the Thursday meeting to discuss shared state and federal priorities, including workforce development, infrastructure, support for veterans and military families and fighting the opioid crisis, according to the White House.""

MORE FROM THE HILL:

-- The House and Senate quickly passed a bill aimed at overhauling how Congress handles sexual harassment complaints and sent the legislation to Trump's desk. Elise Viebeck reports: ""Advocates welcomed the measure, which mandates an annual report of all settlements and awards and eliminates the confidentiality agreements required for accusers at the beginning of the existing process. ... The measure approved on Thursday only requires lawmakers to pay for settlements involving harassment and retaliation, not discrimination. Cases in which a woman is fired for being pregnant, for example, would not trigger the liability. Republicans and Democrats in the lower chamber said they plan to introduce legislation next year to change this on the House side."" Why it matters: Trump will now sign into law a bill made possible by the #MeToo movement, which was triggered in part by his electoral victory despite accusations of sexual misconduct and which he has repeatedly mocked over the past year.

-- House Republicans are increasing pressure on the Trump administration to end government funding for research using fetal tissue. Amy Goldstein reports: ""[A] hearing before subcommittees of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee grew testy at times over whether cells from sources other than aborted fetuses are as useful as fetal tissue in advancing therapies and possible cures for diseases from HIV to cancer. ... The hearing, which played to Republicans' base of social and religious conservatives, comes amid moves by Trump health officials to rethink whether federal money should continue to support the research. In the past three months, the Department of Health and Human Services has severed one contract with a California firm that has been a major supplier of such tissue for laboratories.""

-- For the second consecutive year, the Senate will allow to lapse Barry Lee Myers's nomination to lead the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. The New York Times's Lisa Friedman reports: ""Democrats have said that Mr. Myers has significant conflicts of interest, including his past eagerness to privatize the National Weather Service. ... Republicans blamed Democrats for the delay. Mr. Trump had to renominate Mr. Myers in January after the Senate failed to act last year. Mr. Myers has twice been advanced by the Commerce Committee, said Senator John Thune of South Dakota, the Republican chairman.""

-- Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Jim Inhofe (R-Okla.) tried to defend his purchase (and rapid sale) of stock in a defense contractor after he voiced support for record Pentagon spending. Karoun Demirjian reports: ""Inhofe said through spokeswoman Leacy Burke that the purchase was made without his knowledge by a third-party adviser, and that he had 'no involvement' in the transaction. 'The Senator has called his financial adviser and they reversed, or busted, the transaction,' Burke said, referring to a Wednesday letter in which Inhofe instructed adviser Keith Goddard 'to no longer purchase defense or aerospace companies as part of my financial holdings.'""

-- Sens. Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.) and Jeff Flake (R-Ariz.) used their farewell addresses to blast the dysfunction of the Senate and politics generally. NBC News's Allan Smith reports: ""'Peter Morgan, an author, wrote that no family is complete without an embarrassing uncle,' said [McCaskill]. 'We have too many embarrassing uncles in the United States Senate. Lots of embarrassing stuff.' She said that if senators 'don't have the strength to look in the mirror and fix' the Senate, 'the American people are going to grow more and more cynical, and they might do something crazy like elect a reality TV star president.' McCaskill added: 'The United States Senate is no longer the world's greatest deliberative body. And everybody needs to quit saying it until we recover from this period of polarization and the fear of the political consequences of tough votes.'

""Earlier, Flake used his final address on the Senate floor to warn of threats to America's democracy 'from within and without.' 'We of course are testing the institutions of American liberty in ways that none of us likely ever imagined we would -- and in ways that we never should again,' Flake said. 'My colleagues, to say that our politics is not healthy is something of an understatement. I believe that we all know well that this is not a normal time, that the threats to our democracy from within and without are real, and none of us can say with confidence how the situation that we now find ourselves in will turn out.'""

(J. Scott Applewhite/AP) By Ben Guarino , Ben Guarino Reporter covering biology, genetics, nature, paleontology and the culture of science Carolyn Y. Johnson , Carolyn Y.

Neither bear nor rattlesnake nor hurricane has prevented ecosystem ecologist Jeff Atkins from collecting water samples in Shenandoah National Park. But a recent letter from the government did what wildlife and storms could not: For the first time since the early 1980s, the monitoring program, which traces the forest's recovery from acid rain, has a gap in its weekly data. Because the project uses federal money on federal land, the data point became another casualty of the ongoing shutdown.

""Losing that one point is going to be really detrimental,"" said Atkins, a postdoctoral researcher at Virginia Commonwealth University who usually takes samples of Shenandoah's streams on weekends. ""Now I have a hole in the data set. It's just a needless problem."" Atkins is one of the many scientists whose work has been hobbled by the 18-day shutdown, which could last ""months or even years,"" President Trump recently threatened.

Of the 800,000 federal employees furloughed or working without pay, thousands are researchers. These include agency scientists at the Agriculture Department, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA), the National Science Foundation and the U.S. Geological Survey. (The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Institutes of Health, which were separately funded through September, are almost entirely safe from this shutdown.) Furloughed government scientists are banned from any form of work activity -- they cannot so much as open an email.

""The current government shutdown has far-reaching effects that put America's scientific progress at risk. While there are reports that agencies like NOAA and the USGS are still issuing alerts about weather and natural hazards, much of the scientific research into how to prevent these kinds of disasters has stalled,"" said Christine McEntee, executive director of the American Geophysical Union. ""This shutdown could affect the EPA's ability to meet deadlines for assessing chemicals, and NOAA isn't able to track fish for commercial harvesting or endangered species to protect them from passing ships.""

She added: ""Until funding is secured, many scientists employed by the U.S. government aren't able to make important observations or analyze data to protect life, property and ecosystems here at home and abroad.""

A small crew maintains the National Center for Agricultural Utilization Research in Peoria, Ill., which is normally staffed at 250 and is the largest research center run by the USDA. Studies there exploring new treatments for antibiotic-resistant bacteria have stopped. Employees exempted from the furlough are allowed only to keep the plants and other specimens alive.

""President Trump's shutdown impacts the lab's employees who are not able to work and are not getting paid,"" Sen. Richard J. Durbin (D-Ill.) said in a statement. Research in agriculture and health, ""including preliminary testing building on a recent discovery at the lab that amplifies the effectiveness of antibiotics,"" the senator said, ""has been put on hold.""

At the White House Office of National Drug Control Policy, which coordinates drug policy across the government, only three people are still working out of a staff of about 80. They include James Carroll, the agency's director, known informally as the nation's ""drug czar."" The Senate confirmed him last week.

The office is largely responsible for developing drug policy and strategy, and it administers two grant programs. One sends money to state and local law enforcement agencies in ""high-intensity drug-trafficking areas."" The other helps support community groups working to curb youth substance abuse.

As The Washington Post reported last month, scientists will miss critical research windows, such as the emergence of seasonal insects or rare celestial phenomena, as the shutdown continues. Those missed opportunities and delays are stacking up. At the start of a new year, NOAA releases U.S. average temperatures for the previous year. The data for 2018 are not yet available.

Scientists employed or funded by the federal government will also suffer the lack of paychecks. Leslie Rissler, program director for the NSF's environmental biology division, wrote on Twitter on Jan 3. that she had filed for unemployment.

Kevin Johnson, a molecular ecologist and postdoctoral researcher at Louisiana State University, realized on Jan. 2 that his monthly stipend from the National Science Foundation wouldn't be available during the shutdown. Right away, he contacted his landlords in Baton Rouge, who generously told him not to worry. But he's unsure how long that offer will stand; his landlords are a younger couple who depend on his rent payment to help pay their mortgage.

Johnson, speaking by phone as he and his fellow laboratory members drove back to Louisiana after presenting research at a meeting of the Society for Integrative and Comparative Biology in Tampa, said if he doesn't get paid by Jan. 21, he'll start to owe $300 in late charges on top of unpaid bills. Right now, he and his wife, a graduate student, are dipping into savings and putting everything on three credit cards.

""I'm just going to work as usual,"" Johnson said, who added that he does feel lucky because he knows he will eventually get back pay, unlike some colleagues. ""With science, you're trying to build up your research in order to publish, in order to be attractive to be hired for a job -- and if I were to stop working and wait until I got paid, it would only hurt me more.""

Johnson studies how genes and the environment interact in oysters as they respond to changes in salinity -- a big question for the oyster farming industry after natural disasters such as Hurricane Harvey and as rainfall patterns have shifted because of climate change. He hopes his work will help scientists and oyster farmers understand how to make oysters more resilient.

January is a critical time for the process by which scientists receive federal funding, via agencies such as the NSF and the National Institute of Food and Agriculture. NIFA grants, which support long-term agriculture, are very likely stuck in the review process. Likewise, during the shutdown, the NSF cannot provide new funding or review new grant proposals. Although about 1,400 agency employees have been furloughed, the shutdown's most palpable effects have been felt this week.

One hundred non-federal scientists were scheduled to convene on panels to review hundreds of grant proposals on research topics such as Earth sciences, polar programs and chemistry. The scientists who review those grants will have to cancel travel plans and may have to work any rescheduled reviews around their teaching and research schedules. Researchers waiting to hear about whether they receive funding will face uncertainty and delays.

""To try and minimize the amount of impacts this will have, NSF plans to make decisions on a daily basis for canceling and rescheduling panels,"" NSF spokeswoman Amanda Greenwell said.

A California researcher, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because of the privacy surrounding grant reviews, said he was scheduled to travel to Washington to review proposals early next week. He said he had no idea yet whether the panel, which will recommend which research projects have the most scientific merit, will take place. He also can't access the electronic system that he would use to review the grant proposals in advance, and said he needs at least two days before the panel, which is scheduled to start Monday.

Benjamin Corb, director of public affairs for the American Society for Biochemistry and Molecular Biology, calculated how much funding NSF provided through Jan. 8 last year: $42 million in 2018, vs. $0 in 2019.

""This is the American scientific enterprise that's being strangled, for no good reason, through this process,"" Corb said. ""This is going to ripple through science this year and next year, and it's silly for the NSF and all these other agencies to be held up over [a] political dispute.""

In lecture halls nationwide, lessons are diminished. Mary Abercrombie, a professor at Florida Gulf Coast University who teaches Earth science and environmental chemistry, uses information from NASA, NOAA and Environmental Protection Agency websites in her lectures. Those websites are down, with NOAA citing the ""lapse in appropriation"" as the cause. ""I'm sure I've got lots of company in many, many classrooms,"" Abercrombie said. ""This is going to be terrible!""

Conferences were emptier, too, as federal researchers were unable to travel to scientific meetings. Hundreds of scientists could not attend the American Meteorological Society's annual meeting in Phoenix. More than 100 federal scientists scheduled to attend an International Soil Science Society of America meeting, which took place Jan. 5 through Jan. 9., did not.

The shutdown dealt ""a significant blow"" to federal soil research, said Ellen Bergfeld, chief executive of the Soil Science Society of America. ""Soil science is understood globally to be a fundamental component of national security -- as the resource for life as we know it. . . . Our U.S. federal scientists deserve to be able to communicate, disseminate their information and learn from their colleagues in this crucial area of science for the benefit of all Americans."" A scientific tour of federal lands where California wildfires have altered soil ecosystems was canceled.

At the winter meeting of the American Astronomical Society in Seattle, hundreds of federal scientists were missed. The society estimated that roughly 15 percent of attendees -- as many as 450 people -- were unable to attend because of the shutdown.

Presentations by invited federal researchers were canceled. Academic scientists had to scramble to serve as understudies for government colleagues who were supposed to present the results of their research. Committees to award prizes and plan future research were short several members.

""It's been chaotic,"" said Rafaella Margutti, an astrophysicist at Northwestern University who was asked at the last minute to fill in on panels about the future of the Hubble Space Telescope and a new alert system for tracking fleeting celestial phenomena.

The majority of those missing were NASA employees; about 95 percent of the agency's staff members are furloughed. AAS was forced to cancel an agency town hall meeting, which usually involves hundreds of people, as well as special sessions to discuss research priorities and plans for upcoming telescopes.

The society urged its members to contact their representatives in Congress to demand a federal budget. And at the meeting's opening session, scientists recorded a video message to their absent government colleagues.

""We miss you,"" AAS President Megan Donahue said. ""We're facing a world where science is not always at the table.""

Disruptive, disappointing, chaotic: Shutdown upends scientific research

Hundreds of scientists to miss world's largest weather conference because of federal shutdown

Federal workers in Washington aren't the only ones going without pay"

The government shutdown that has halted paychecks for hundreds of thousands of federal workers began its third week Saturday with no end in sight, as Vice President Pence, top White House officials and senior congressional aides met for more than two hours without reaching a deal to reopen the government.

Inside the meeting at the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, Pence refused to budge from the more than $5 billion President Trump has demanded from Congress to pay for a portion of his promised wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, according to two Democratic officials briefed on the negotiations.

The standoff -- which has heavily affected national parks and other operations and threatens to halt payments as varied as food stamps and tax refunds -- has made Trump's unrealized border wall the linchpin of his presidency as he seeks to make good on a signature campaign promise.

Administration officials have acknowledged that they were not prepared for the potential consequences of an extended shutdown and Trump's decision to demand wall funding. Democrats, meanwhile, are standing firm on offering no taxpayer money for the project, which Trump had long asserted would be funded by Mexico.

Pence was deputized by Trump to oversee Saturday's talks, but he did not have the president's blessing to float new or specific numbers as he did last month in a meeting with Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), according to two Trump aides who were not authorized to speak publicly. That meant few specifics were actually discussed Saturday, as Democratic staffers repeatedly pushed the administration to reopen the federal government and negotiate differences over the border after the shutdown ends.

But the administration -- represented by Pence, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and senior adviser Jared Kushner -- refused, according to multiple officials.

""Not much headway made today,"" Trump tweeted Saturday afternoon. ""Second meeting set for tomorrow. After so many decades, must finally and permanently fix the problems on the Southern Border!""

Before the meeting began Saturday morning, Trump took a combative tone in several Twitter messages and claimed that news coverage documenting cracks in Republican support for his hard-line position were inaccurate.

""Great support coming from all sides for Border Security (including Wall) on our very dangerous Southern Border,"" Trump tweeted. ""Teams negotiating this weekend! Washington Post and NBC reporting of events, including Fake sources, has been very inaccurate (to put it mildly)!""

A number of Republicans, including Sen. Cory Gardner (R-Colo.), who is up for reelection in 2020, have said in recent days that the government should be reopened and that a shutdown is not the ""right answer,"" worrying GOP leaders about the depth of support for Trump's position.

Trump spent much of Saturday on the phone with allies, talking through his positioning on the shutdown and hearing their reviews of his Friday news conference in the Rose Garden, according to a person close to him. Two people regularly on his call list -- Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) and Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) -- have encouraged Trump to hold fast and refuse to agree to reopen the government unless wall funding is secured, the person said.

""I've never seen the president as resolved on any issue as he is on this,"" Meadows said Saturday. ""But he is open to new ideas about how to end the impasse.""

Trump told reporters Friday that he wants to reopen government but is prepared to maintain the shutdown for weeks or even years. He also told congressional leaders at the White House on Friday that he preferred the term ""strike"" over ""shutdown,"" people briefed on the meeting said.

[Tax refunds, food aid could be shutdown's early casualties]

In conversations with top aides on Friday and Saturday, House Democratic leaders said Trump and GOP leaders seem eager to be seen as making progress even if the talks remained stalled, allowing Republican lawmakers back home over the weekend to reassure nervous constituents, according to two Democratic officials briefed on those discussions who were not authorized to speak publicly.

""There is the reality of what the White House is doing, which is very little, and the image they're trying to send, which is, 'Look at us, we're busy, and the vice president is rolling up his sleeves,' "" one Democratic official said. ""They're worried about defections.""

During Saturday's meeting, Democratic staffers asked the White House to lay out in formal detail the administration's funding request for the border -- including its specific security requests, what the money would be used for, and what in the Homeland Security budget the administration would cut to make the numbers work, people familiar with the meeting said.

Democrats ""emphasized that it's important for us to have an updated budget request from the White House because they have been all over the map,"" said another official briefed on the discussion. The White House plans to provide those figures before the group meets again Sunday afternoon.

Some centrist Republicans on Saturday urged Trump and congressional leaders to reopen the government, reflecting growing unease in their ranks about the prolonged shutdown and the political cost the GOP might pay.

""With Nancy Pelosi as speaker, it's going to have to be a compromise solution,"" Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick (R-Pa.), a moderate and former FBI agent who represents the Philadelphia suburbs, said in an interview. ""It's our most basic function as members of Congress to fund the government, and we need to have these battles on immigration and other issues on their own turf, separately.""

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said in a statement Saturday that the House will begin passing separate bills to reopen the government in the coming week, starting with the funding bill that covers the Treasury Department ""so that the American people can receive their tax refunds on schedule.""

""The senseless uncertainty and chaos of the Trump Shutdown must end, now,"" Pelosi said.

Mulvaney said in an interview to air Sunday on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" that Trump would ""take a concrete wall off the table"" in negotiations with Democratic leaders if that would help end the shutdown.

""If he has to give up a concrete wall, replace it with a steel fence to do that so that Democrats can say, 'See? He's not building a wall anymore,' that should help us move in the right direction,"" Mulvaney said.

But Trump is annoyed by news reports about the negotiations that make it seem that he is backing away from his demands and wants to avoid stories about new numbers for wall funding being discussed, Trump aides said. The president instead encouraged Pence and senior aides to focus on the $5.6 billion for border security that was the focal point of legislation passed last month by House Republicans, the aides said.

Trump exasperated members of both parties with his comments Friday, but Trump spent that evening boasting to friends that he was in a strong negotiating position because he was able to capture attention and make a flurry of points that he feels his core voters appreciate, White House officials said.

[After years of Trump's dire warnings, a 'crisis' has hit the border but generates little urgency]

On Saturday evening, Trump tweeted that he would travel to Camp David on Sunday for ""meetings on Border Security and many other topics"" with aides attending a White House staff retreat. He then followed up with a tweet of his ""Game of Thrones""-style poster saying, ""The Wall is Coming.""

Mulvaney is spearheading the Camp David gathering as a way of connecting with his new deputies and colleagues, according to officials.

The president is asking advisers about further ways to battle for wall funding in the coming days, whether it is meeting with family members of people killed by undocumented immigrants, huddling with sheriffs or visiting the border, the officials said.

As Saturday's meeting unfolded, Trump was eyeing his own options for trying to force the Democrats' hand, including declaring a national emergency to begin wall construction without congressional approval, a possible course he mentioned at his Friday news conference.

According to two confidants of Trump's, who have spoken to him in recent days but were not authorized to speak publicly, Trump is looking at how such a move would play out and has told his aides that such a drastic turn could rattle the Democrats and compel them to offer him wall funding. The legality of such a move is unclear, however, and Trump would almost certainly face immediate legal challenges in the courts.

Still, there are signs within the White House that more-comprehensive deals are at least being discussed, more likely for after the shutdown concludes and the government reopens.

Kushner, the president's son-in-law, continues to tell his allies that he thinks there could eventually be a deal for border wall funding in exchange for immigration protections for undocumented immigrants who were brought to the United States as children, according to two people who were briefed on those discussions. Another person familiar with the discussions emphasized, however, that Kushner was not pushing for a deal on Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, at this time.

Chatter about an agreement involving protections for young immigrant beneficiaries of the DACA program have risen a bit in recent days, although the administration has rejected previous wall-for-DACA deals and Democratic leadership is in no mood for one now.

After his work on a bipartisan criminal justice reform bill, Kushner is as engaged as ever with Capitol Hill, the people said. Still, Kushner's interest in brokering a possible deal on immigration has caused some anxiety among conservatives close to Trump, several of whom said Saturday they feared the president could eventually be intrigued by Kushner's position as the shutdown drags on and Trump searches for a way out."
26,washington post,https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/economy/trump-faces-large-barrier-as-he-seeks-money-for-border-wall/2018/12/18/693e6d36-0303-11e9-b5df-5d3874f1ac36_story.html,"By Damian Paletta Damian Paletta Reporter covering economic policy December 18 at 4:20 PM

President Trump has directed his Cabinet secretaries to search for any stray funds that could be repurposed for the construction of a wall along the Mexico border, conceding that Democrats have stymied his efforts in Congress.

But his new approach sets up more budget and political battles, as it's very difficult to legally redirect taxpayer money without Congress's approval.

""If you do this without going through the proper reprogramming requests and getting all the proper approvals, you are breaking the law,"" said Todd Harrison, director of defense budget analysis at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

A similar assessment was shared by some Democrats and Republicans on Tuesday, but White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said lawyers were reviewing what was possible.

""That's their entire job is determining whether or not something is legal, and we are looking to those individuals to find out those specific pots of money that can be used for that,"" she said.

[White House backs down in shutdown dispute, says Trump will find other ways to fund border wall]

The rapidly changing approach reflects a scramble by Trump aides to deliver on one of his core campaign promises without much assistance from Congress. The White House hasn't settled on a plan for funding a border wall, and Republicans haven't devised a way to obtain even a small portion of the spending Trump has demanded.

This has led to complaints from supporters of new restrictions on immigration that the White House fumbled one of their top priorities and never had a plan for how to proceed.

Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, said Trump has repeatedly threatened to fight Democrats over border wall funding, only to back down at the last minute, which made it clear to Democrats that he would capitulate again.

""I think this really undermines the president's credibility,"" said Krikorian, whose think tank has broad influence inside the Trump administration and favors tight restrictions on immigration. ""Why didn't he go to the mattresses the first time this became an issue?""

The Constitution requires Congress's approval before money can be allocated and spent, which has made it difficult for Trump to secure money for a border wall.

One of Trump's central campaign promises in 2016 was the construction of a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, and he vowed he would force Mexico to pay for the entire project. Since becoming president, he has abandoned that call, saying instead that taxpayer money should be devoted to the project and threatening repeatedly to shut down the government if his demands weren't met.

In a Twitter post last week, Trump suggested a pending trade deal with Canada and Mexico would somehow provide the money needed for a wall along the Mexico border, though his advisers have not explained how this would work. Sanders said Tuesday it would come from new revenue to the Treasury Department triggered by economic growth, but this would be very hard to measure with any precision, if at all.

Congress has passed several spending bills in the past year that did allow the Trump administration to repair and rebuild existing portions of border walls and even add some new barriers, but these projects have fallen far short of the scope Trump sought during the campaign.

The Department of Homeland Security said the Trump administration has already begun work on 14 miles of wall in the San Diego area and another 20 miles near Santa Teresa, N.M. But the U.S.-Mexico border stretches for about 2,000 miles.

In the run-up to last month's midterm elections, Trump overstated the amount of progress the government has made in the past year in constructing barriers. He said he had already secured $3.2 billion for these projects, an inflated figure. And House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), who is expected to be the chamber's next speaker, has said she will not support funding to build additional barriers once Democrats take control of the House in January.

There have been varying estimates for the cost of a full or partial wall along the Mexico border, with many starting at around $25 billion. Trump last week said $5 billion would be an ample amount to make major progress creating a partial barrier along the border that is sufficient to block immigrants from crossing into the U.S.

On Tuesday, as it became clear Democrats would not approve even half that amount, Sanders said the White House would be satisfied with $1.6 billion in new appropriations from Congress and then find other ways to cover the remaining $3.4 billion. But a few hours later, Democrats said they had never agreed to spending even $1.6 billion for the construction of a new wall. Democrats have long said that money is for replacing existing walls and barriers, though the White House has said the money would be for new barriers.

The federal government is projected to spend more than $4 trillion this year, and the $5 billion sought by the White House for a border wall is about 0.1 percent of that. But even moving around that amount of money could be considered illegal without congressional approval.

""This is pretty tricky business,"" said Elaine Kamarck, a former top Clinton White House official. She said agencies can occasionally move around smaller sums of money without congressional input, but never anywhere near the amount the Trump administration is trying to secure.

Congress has already passed a defense law to fund the military through the end of September, making it hard for lawmakers to siphon off any money that is already allocated for military programs. Funding for the Department of Homeland Security expires on Friday at midnight, but Democrats are closely monitoring any new request for that agency to prevent it from being used for a wall.

""I think our appropriations process restricts the wall, so I don't see how he does it legally,"" Sen. Benjamin L. Cardin (D-Md.) said.

Sen. Lamar Alexander (R-Tenn.) said the White House could be looking for any money in other agencies that was specified to be used for ""border security"" but otherwise would come up short.

""If they have authority to deal with border security, they can spend the money,"" he said. ""If they don't have congressional authority, they can't.""

Comments from Sanders and a number of Republicans on Tuesday made clear that there wasn't a concrete plan going forward and that multiple scenarios were being considered.

""We are looking at existing funding from other agencies right now,"" Sanders said.

This is the second in a four-part series examining the dynamics of the new Congress. | Part one

Beginning in January, the United States will have a divided Congress, which doesn't bode well for productivity.

The Democrats won back control of the House on promises of advancing big-ticket items that are historically challenging to reconcile, such as health care, immigration reform and the environmental protections. Republicans, who still hold the Senate and the White House, are unlikely to cede any ground.

We got a peek into what future negotiations could look like on Tuesday, when House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) met with President Trump to discuss funding the government. Those talks broke down spectacularly.

There's even more reason to be cynical: the 2020 elections. With as many as 16 Democratic members of Congress already angling to take on Trump as the party's nominee, it will be more advantageous for them to push ambitious ideas than compromise. And the sitting president is often given credit for legislative wins, so why would Democrats give Trump any leverage ahead of the 2020 campaign?

What will the Democratic House prioritize?

Expect House Democrats to seize headlines by taking up certain pieces of legislation, not because there's a chance of them becoming law, but to lay down markers for policies they could pass if Democrats gain control of both Congress and the Oval Office.

Environmental protections will top that list: Rep.-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.) has already secured a commitment from old and new members for her Green New Deal, which would address climate change and income inequality. The White House has been hostile to environmental regulations, and have rolled back many, so there's no chance ideas like that get anywhere but into the eventual campaign ads.

On health care, Democrats could struggle with how far left to push. Liberals who campaigned for ""Medicare-for-all"" will want a vote, but moderate swing-district members may be apprehensive about a universal health-care program. One issue that could find its way to the president's desk is cementing protections for preexisting conditions. Democrats campaigned hard on this and forced many Republicans, including the president, to publicly support it. The devil will be in the details.

Then there's immigration. Comprehensive reform simply isn't going to happen with Trump's preoccupation with a border wall and his rhetoric about dangerous migrants. Democrats and some Republicans may seek legislation to protect the children of migrants who entered the country illegally, known as dreamers. But even that seems unlikely.

And, of course, there's gun legislation; an issue that did not progress even when Democrats last controlled Congress and the White House.

Is there anything both sides agree on?

Infrastructure is the most common answer. Both Republicans and Democrats agree that the nation's basic systems are in desperate need of an overhaul. Plus, investing in infrastructure is a job creator. The hang-up has always been over how to pay for it. The easiest infusion of revenue would come from raising the gasoline tax, but Republicans refuse. Democrats have also pitched a carbon tax to pay for infrastructure advancements, while Republicans want to leverage the private sector to cover costs.

So what will actually happen in the next Congress?

Other than a lot of political posturing, expect an onslaught of investigations by House Democrats into everything Trump -- his White House, his campaign and his business. Just this week, Pelosi said they'll go after Trump's tax returns. Meanwhile, Senate Republicans will continue working with Trump on stacking the judiciary with conservatives, something House Democrats have no control over."
28,washington post,https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2019-01-02/from-elon-musk-to-tim-cook-2019-horoscopes-for-ceos,"By Tara Lachapelle | Bloomberg January 2 at 7:00 AM

From succession planning and digesting megamergers, to repairing embattled businesses and learning from #MeToo-related scandals, 2019 is set to be a consequential year for the heads of some of the most iconic American companies. We've scanned the stars for clues to what lies ahead for a select group of them based on their zodiac signs. What follows is our third annual compilation of CEO horoscopes:

Capricorn 12/22-1/19Mary Barra, Chairman and CEO of General Motors Co.

Capricorn, your best quality is pragmatism. It's a trait that can make you seem cold, but some decisions - like reshaping General Motors for the future - require practicality. In 2018, you chose to shutter several U.S. plants in a shift away from sedans and hybrid cars, in favor of higher-margin SUVs and a bet on fully electric vehicles. The move will cause pain to those working-class communities, and since it runs counter to President Donald Trump's rhetoric about restoring manufacturing jobs, you knew it would instigate a Twitter tirade. But you also know that for GM to remain a leader and survive the next potential recession without another bailout, this is what it must do. It's not enough, though. Investors show little faith in the long-term earnings prospects of U.S. automakers, and the $6 billion in annual savings you project from the plant closures probably isn't enough to truly transform GM. Meanwhile in China, the electric-car market is booming, but the Chevy Bolt isn't. You must work faster to get costs under control and pursue a profitable electric-vehicle strategy unencumbered by White House bluster and an outdated image of GM.

Aquarius 1/20-2/18Bob Iger, Chairman and CEO of Walt Disney Co.

Aquarius is the visionary of the zodiac, and that trait was on display in your dealmaking at Disney. First with Pixar, then Marvel and Lucasfilm (""Star Wars""), your acquisitions have allowed the company to dominate the box office and continue drawing swarms of fans to Disney's theme parks. But your vision is less understood when it comes to your recent $85 billion takeover of 21st Century Fox Inc.'s TV and film studios. In theory, owning these assets will cement Disney's position as it pursues a new audience of TV streamers through the soon-to-come Disney+ app. Yet, this megadeal and Disney+ also complicate a previously meticulous strategy. This year, you must focus on tidying up the Magic Kingdom so that its success can outlast your time at the helm. Retirement is just a couple of years away and there's much work to be done, including grooming a successor. That will only get more difficult if Disney+ causes strife within the empire by forcing different divisions to compete for content and resources. You must also take care not to alienate fans as you start to preserve some of Disney's best movies and TV shows for the app. More reflection on this new streaming strategy may serve the company - and your legacy - better in the long run.

Pisces 2/19-3/20Larry Culp, Chairman and CEO of General Electric Co.

Pisces, you'll set the tone for the year early on when you unveil your much-anticipated plan for steering the embattled industrial giant out of its current crisis. You've made some missteps in your first few months as CEO: you ruled out an equity raise only to put one back on the table; your attempt to ease investors' anxiety via a CNBC appearance backfired; and your decision to re-hire a long-time insider to chair the eyesore gas-turbine business confounded investors expecting deep-rooted cultural change. But there have also been signs of progress, including your decision to appoint a power and insurance expert to the board and to start shopping for a new auditor. To regain investors' confidence, you must inject more transparency into GE's earnings, provide clarity on its liabilities and, most importantly, present a viable plan for reducing its bloated debt load. An equity raise would give you breathing room, as would scrapping the spinoff portion of a planned GE Healthcare divestiture. But your most difficult challenge is finding a way to balance restructuring and debt repayment with growth investments, so that whatever remains of GE once you're done has a competitive leg to stand on. -Brooke Sutherland

Aries 3/21-4/19Shari Redstone, Vice Chair and controlling shareholder of CBS Corp. and Viacom Inc.

The last few years have a been a struggle, but an Aries doesn't back down. Just when you finished cleaning house at Viacom and started seeing the fruit of the regime change, arguably worse problems arose at CBS. Now, with the removal of Les Moonves following the numerous sexual-misconduct allegations made against him, and the overhaul of a board that had turned hostile to you, you're probably through the worst of it. CBS is in culture-repair mode, and Viacom is making progress turning around its Paramount film studio and ramping up TV production. Still, you know that neither company can thrive on its own in the long run as Disney and AT&T get bigger and join Netflix and Amazon.com Inc. in streaming domination. This is the year to finally do what you've long wanted - to recombine CBS and Viacom. It may even make sense to form a three-way merger involving CBS's new chairman, Strauss Zelnick, and his $12 billion video-game company, Take-Two Interactive Software Inc. as another step toward building direct-to-consumer relationships. Scale and content are the themes in the industry, and CBS and Viacom could use more of both. Take your cue from the ram and charge ahead.

Taurus 4/20-5/20Randall Stephenson, Chairman and CEO of AT&T Inc.

You have difficult days ahead. While you imagined this would be one of the most exciting times for AT&T, the stock instead finished 2018 near an almost eight-year low. Investors don't yet grasp your vision for turning a stable wireless-service carrier into a cyclical and challenged media conglomerate that is now trying to go head-to-head with Disney, Netflix and Amazon - especially when Verizon Communications Inc. seems to be moving in the opposite direction. The pressure is on to prove that the Time Warner assets and beleaguered DirecTV business can both flourish within AT&T, and also that the company's mountain of debt and wireless spending needs - related to the crucial build-out of AT&T's 5G network - won't get in the way of shareholders' beloved dividend payments. You'll launch a new video-streaming service in 2019 that will offer three pricing tiers with varying assortments of movies and shows, which does help attract a wider audience and serves as a threat to other offerings out there. But it may also cause further confusion for consumers in an already muddled marketplace of streaming packages. There's little room for error, so in the event of any unforeseen setbacks or economic disruptions, you may have to look to the dividend as the sacrificial lamb.

Gemini 5/21-6/20Stefano Pessina, Vice Chairman and CEO of Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc.

Geminis are said to always be looking for their other half, and it's true that you've been no stranger to corporate tie-ups. You built Alliance Boots through mergers, then combined it with Walgreens four years ago. But lately, the company has taken a back seat from dealmaking, preferring partnerships over acquisitions, while others in the health-care space have done industry-shifting vertical megadeals. Rival CVS Health Corp. is re-imagining the health-care business with its $77 billion takeover of insurer Aetna Inc. Meanwhile, Walgreens was left with a consolation prize of just under 2,000 Rite Aid Corp. stores after regulators stood in the way of a larger transaction between the pharmacy chains. Since then, you've been talking with Humana Inc. about taking mutual investment stakes and expanding an existing senior-focused health-care alliance. You argue that partnerships provide many of the advantages of a merger without having to shell out billions of dollars, and you're not wrong about that. But they are fundamentally half-measures that may leave Walgreens ill-prepared to deal with the retail and pharmacy threat of Amazon, and the heft of other vertically consolidated health-care giants. -Max Nisen

Since this sign is represented by the twins, here's another Gemini horoscope:

Howard Willard, Chairman and CEO of Altria Group Inc.

Like your Gemini peer above, you have been forging alliances with businesses around your industry, seeking to remake Altria as cigarettes become less relevant and a real cannabis industry rises from their ashes. Altria hasn't often made big acquisitions, but in 2018 that changed as you recognized the urgent need to diversify Altria's portfolio of Marlboro cigarettes, Skoal rings and other traditional tobacco products. First, Altria agreed to pay $1.8 billion for a 45 percent stake in Cronos Group Inc., one of Canada's fast-growing cannabis producers. Just a few weeks later, you closed a $12.8 billion deal for a 35 percent stake in Juul Labs Inc., the maker of electronic cigarettes that are popular among younger smokers. It was a smart move; the only question is, why did you stop at 35 percent? Buying Juul Labs outright may be down the road, and it would even be a logical precursor to a recombination with Philip Morris International Inc. The two of you are already partnering on the iQos tobacco-heating device to target older smokers, a product that may complement Juul's. Deepening all these ties would give you greater control over Altria's future.

Cancer 6/21-7/22Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla Inc.

Cancers can be a bit impulsive - like the times you picked fights with sell-siders, spelunkers and the SEC, tweeted out ""funding secured"" and blazed up live on air. Tesla's shareholders were understandably unnerved by some of your actions in 2018, but all seemingly was forgiven after unexpectedly good third-quarter results. Investors clearly foresee those becoming a regular fixture, judging by the multiples they're paying for the stock. Whether that unusually strong performance can be sustained is, therefore, a big question for 2019. The picture is hazy, with federal tax credits for Tesla's vehicles due to decline and Model 3 sales likely shifting toward lower-spec versions (though the vaunted $35,000 version remains elusive). Another, related, mystery is whether Tesla will raise more capital. You say it isn't necessary, but prudence suggests Tesla should have capitalized on its sky-high stock price and sold more already. You closed the year in unexpected, yet familiar, fashion by sending a modified Model X on a bumpy ride through a short Boring Co. tunnel in Los Angeles, thereby demonstrating a new future for transportation, we are told. As useful as an uneventful 2019 might be, that's the one thing we can't see in the stars. -Liam Denning

Leo 7/23-8/22Ginni Rometty, Chairman and CEO of International Business Machines Corp.

Your nearly seven years leading IBM have been defined by falling revenue, massive cost cuts and a stream of hogwash about how IBM is transforming into a technology leader. It is not. But then, Leo, you roared in 2018 by striking a $34 billion acquisition of business-software firm Red Hat Inc. It was one of the largest corporate acquisitions of the year, and by far the largest in IBM's 107-year history. The price you paid was steep, but an expensive roll of the dice is better than the status quo, and IBM and Red Hat together would seem to make a more compelling cloud-computing alternative than they could on their own. Your legacy rests on proving that the combined company can become a go-to shepherd for corporations that badly want to modernize their technology. Right now, that role is mostly filled by rivals such as Microsoft Corp. and Oracle Corp. Leos are reputed to be fierce and passionate, and you'll need all those qualities and more to integrate the two wildly different cultures of IBM and Red Hat, and keep IBM going well into its second century. -Shira Ovide

Virgo 8/23-9/22Warren Buffett, Chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.

Virgo, you'll turn 89 this year, making it more important than ever that Berkshire Hathaway's next generation of leadership be given a chance to get properly acquainted with investors. Virgos are known to be methodical perfectionists, a quality that's been key to your decades of successful investing and dealmaking, but you could do better when it comes to messaging around your succession plan. You aren't ready to pass the torch and there's no sign you need to, but at least start to share the stage at appearances like Berkshire's annual investor meeting. Greg Abel and Ajit Jain, the executives you'll most likely name as your replacements, were notably absent from the feature moment of last year's meeting - the Q&A session - which draws investors from around the world looking to hear your market musings, outlook for Berkshire's array of businesses and about your hunt for takeover targets. After the S&P 500 index fell in 2018 by the most since the financial crisis, it's time to strike at least one last megadeal. To put a dent in Berkshire's cash, which long ago reached unproductive levels, would be the greatest gift to your successor so that he's not left to resort to a large dividend payout. Surely there are some Buffett-worthy bargains out there now - perhaps even one from this old wish list.

Libra 9/23-10/22Reed Hastings, Chairman and CEO of Netflix Inc.

Netflix has tried to give TV fans close to everything they want at an affordable price and without ads. It's only appropriate that as co-founder and CEO of the business, you're a Libra, a sign characterized by people-pleasers. But in 2019, the sustainability of Netflix's generosity - and that of its lenders - will be tested. Disney and AT&T are both launching streaming services aimed at Netflix's Achilles' heel: Many of its most-watched shows are the property of other companies, such as Disney and AT&T, that are in the early days of cutting off their supply to Netflix and confining their content to their own products. You've tried to neutralize some of that competition by signing deals directly with top content creators. Netflix's value proposition may also still ultimately be better for consumers should it sustain the variety and breadth of its library. However, as subscriber growth slows and some users defect to these new services, you may need to turn to price increases. Investors have always explained away Netflix's cash burn rate, but they may not be so willing to give the benefit of the doubt when Disney starts flexing its muscle.

Scorpio 10/23-11/21Tim Cook, CEO of Apple Inc.

In your seven years in the corner office, the challenges have never been more daunting than they are now, and I know that can sting, Scorpio. Apple propelled itself into the most profitable company in the U.S. - and the most valuable in the world, until recently - thanks to the sales power of the iPhone, but it's running out of steam. Investors believe iPhone sales will decline in 2019, and it'll be tough for Apple to make up the difference with your higher-priced phones. You don't typically make big-ticket acquisitions, but the Apple holiday helpers have been busy writing checks not for companies, but for high-profile projects for Apple's coming Netflix-like web video service. There's programming coming from Oprah Winfrey, from the ""Peanuts"" cartoon kids, an elephant documentary and a lot more. You might need a strategy to go with that high-priced programming, though. With investors betting that Apple's growth relies on its ability to sell subscriptions to web video, news and other internet services, all eyes are on how you'll manage to offset the waning growth of the smartphone product that delivers two-thirds of Apple's revenue. -Shira Ovide

Sagittarius 11/22-12/21Abigail Johnson, Chairman and CEO of Fidelity Investments

As a Sagittarius, you don't like to be held back. That's why Fidelity in 2018 pioneered the zero-fee index fund, bringing the management cost war to its logical conclusion. But now may not be the best time to try to pitch investors a broad market index fund. Those products launched in August, just one month before the S&P 500 index peaked at its all-time high and then sold off. Volatile environments are when Fidelity's stock pickers have shined brightest - that's how the firm built its reputation, after all. If things remain rocky, will you try to get your zero-cost funds out of the limelight and pivot back to the active management side of the business? That's more than enough to keep you busy in the new year, but as the most powerful woman in investing, you also have a platform to help fix the gender imbalance on Wall Street. Fund management is still a men's club, even though diversity and client returns are shown to go hand in hand. Even your firm has grappled with cultural issues following allegations of sexual harassment made against former portfolio managers. Continue to help Fidelity do its part as the industry - and the business world as a whole - slowly becomes a more equitable place. -Brian Chappatta

Rep. Nancy Pelosi is set to regain the House speakership Thursday and instantly cement her place as the most powerful woman in American politics.

It is a job she has done before, even during a Republican presidency, but Pelosi faces a novel challenge in her new role as President Trump's chief adversary -- how to balance her esteem for the office he holds against her barely veiled contempt for the man who holds it.

""I respect the office that he holds and the agencies of government that he appoints to -- I think I respect them more than he does, looking at who he has appointed to those offices,"" she told The Washington Post in an interview as she prepared to take the speaker's gavel.

Navigating that dilemma has affected the limited talks to end the partial government shutdown, now in its second week, over the president's demand for money for a U.S.-Mexico border wall, and it is certain to define Pelosi's dealings with Trump in the new era of divided government.

It is an unpredictable chapter in the historic career of the 78-year-old Pelosi, the nation's first female speaker, as she retakes the gavel after eight years.

When she entered the Oval Office on Dec. 11 for a meeting with Trump and Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), she had a phrase in mind that she planned to use in private -- ""Trump shutdown.""

She did not realize she would deliver that line in front of television cameras. The world watched as the president interrupted her after she uttered those words at the outset of a wild 15-minute exchange: ""Did you say 'Trump' ""?

Moments after Pelosi mentioned ""Trump shutdown,"" she urged him to kick out the media and proceed with private talks more befitting, in her view, the stakes and the setting.

""What I saw in that Oval Office circus was someone struggling really to try and respect the institution of the president while having total disdain for the man himself,"" said Jim Manley, who was a top aide to then-Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.), who served alongside Pelosi. ""She's smart enough to know that she can't go into the gutter, but you know she's going to find ways to tweak the guy.""

The needling, aided by Schumer, paid political dividends after Trump proclaimed at the end of the meeting that he was ""proud to shut down the government for border security"" -- words that have been shown on a seemingly endless loop as the president deals with the damage.

Shortly after leaving the meeting, Pelosi told a private gathering of fellow Democrats that the wall was a ""like a manhood thing"" for Trump, a comment seemingly calibrated to unnerve the president -- and promptly and widely leaked to the media.

Trump, for his part, has needled Pelosi while expressing respect for her.

""I like her. Can you believe it? I like Nancy Pelosi. I mean, she's tough and she's smart,"" he said after the midterm elections, when Democrats recaptured the House with a 40-seat gain. Later, he offered to solicit Republican votes when she was struggling to persuade Democrats to elect her speaker.

['It's like a manhood thing for him': Pelosi's power play with Trump serves as message to opponents]

Pelosi said of Trump in the interview: ""We have to stipulate to a set of facts if we're going to ever negotiate. But he simply won't do it. What he talks about with the wall isn't true. It isn't true about terrorists coming over the wall, people with illnesses flooding the country. I mean, really?""

Beyond the factual divide, Pelosi says she sees in Trump a lack of ""shared values about our country"" and belief in governance, as well as a ""disrespect for the dignity and worth of a person.""

Yet she still speaks routinely -- if somewhat mechanically -- about her desire to work in tandem with Trump on issues of mutual interest, that she would seek to ""light the way"" and ""extend the hand of friendship.""

""We're about dignity and a tone that is respectful of the offices that we hold, and the office he holds,"" she added. ""We're not stooping to his level, no.""

Pelosi can have difficulty masking her disdain. Often that is by implication -- speaking effusively about George W. Bush's personal character or quoting from Ronald Reagan's 1989 farewell address, in which he said the nation should be ""open to anyone with the will and the heart to get here.""

Pelosi returned to the White House on Wednesday -- behind closed doors and joined by a broader cast of congressional leaders, a setting several Democratic aides cast as a White House effort to avoid a repeat of the earlier fiasco. Rather than with words, this time she made her point with her power.

She declared House Democrats would vote Thursday to reopen the government without funding the wall -- on Republican-written legislation, a move orchestrated to isolate Trump and split the GOP around him. ""We're asking the president to open up government,"" Pelosi said. ""We are giving him a Republican path to do that. Why would he not do it?""

Friends, family and foes, even those within her party who pressed for her to step aside for the next generation, praise her political skills.

""She'll cut your head off, and you won't even know you're bleeding,"" Pelosi's daughter Alexandra said Wednesday on CNN.

Pressed on the advice she's gotten on dealing with Trump, Pelosi insisted she makes her own advice -- a point she made by paraphrasing a passage from a 57-year-old papal encyclical.

""I observe, judge, act -- I learned that from the pope,"" she said. ""Observe. Judge. Act.""

[Pelosi strikes deal with rebels, will step aside by 2022 to win speaker votes]

Despite Pelosi's image as a liberal partisan, an image driven relentlessly by GOP campaign ads, she has a long history working productively with Republicans -- first as a junior lawmaker serving on bipartisan House Appropriations and Intelligence committees, later during her first two years as speaker, dealing with Bush.

Like Trump, Bush at the time had weak approval ratings and inspired deep enmity in the Democratic base -- to the point that some lawmakers floated impeaching him. And while Pelosi was personally against the Iraq War and campaigned against it to win the majority, she was never heard to speak askance of Bush's manhood or any other aspect of his character.

Bush signed several major laws passed by Democrats, led by Pelosi and Reid, including energy, tax and foreign-aid bills, and in the final months of his presidency, the leaders worked closely together to address an epochal financial crisis.

""President Bush was very committed to continuing what had been started [in Iraq] and to see it through, and so they clashed on that,"" said Daniel P. Meyer, who served as Bush's legislative affairs director during Pelosi's speakership. ""But it was a professional relationship. I don't think there was personal animus in any way, shape or form.""

Her initial interactions with Trump, Meyer said, portend a different relationship: ""He's not going to hold back, and that reflects his style. And she, apparently, is going to respond somewhat in kind.""

Pelosi still speaks fondly of Bush and his late father, whose photograph she keeps in her Capitol Hill office alongside those of Presidents John F. Kennedy and Barack Obama. And she rejects entirely any comparison between her dealings with Bush and with Trump.

""He was a Republican, I'm a Democrat,"" she said of Bush. ""We differed on a woman's right to choose, the war in Iraq, those kinds of things. But in our negotiations we recognized certain facts.""

At one point in the interview, Pelosi picked at a political scab of Trump's, noting he was ""elected -- not by a majority of the popular vote -- but nonetheless to be president of the United States."" At another, she said her dealings with Trump have been largely respectful, ""except for saying I can't speak for myself,"" a reference to Trump bringing up in the Oval Office her difficulty corralling speaker votes. She secured the necessary votes a day later.

Pelosi denied trying to openly needle Trump by calling the wall a matter of ""manhood"" -- something she did publicly in an October appearance at Harvard University before she repeated it privately to Democrats last month.

""I don't think he has any concern about that. He likes publicity, good or bad, doesn't he?"" she said, adding, ""It's a guy thing -- maybe I should say it that way. Maybe it's a guy thing.""

Trump's allies in the White House and on Capitol Hill are fond of pointing out -- and potentially exploiting -- the difficulties Pelosi will probably have managing her caucus's aggressive left flank. Rep.-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), for instance, tweeted criticism of Democratic leaders Monday over the makeup of a special climate-change committee and Wednesday announced she would vote against rules changes backed by Pelosi.

But Pelosi has more experience managing those dynamics than they might realize. Former congresswoman Lynn Woolsey (D-Calif.), a leader of the Democratic antiwar bloc, said Pelosi skillfully managed that aggressive faction while she was sparring with Bush over Iraq.

""Nancy did not lead it, but she never got in our way,"" she said. In one instance, Pelosi rejected the idea of Woolsey and others inviting Tom Hayden, a controversial former student radical, to Capitol Hill.

Woolsey said Pelosi was right, as Hayden's presence ""would have been the story instead of what we were really aiming to accomplish.""

Trump, Woolsey said, ""is going to know that he's up against something very real and very tough.""

At the end of a chaotic day punctuated by a failed meeting between President Trump and Democratic leaders intended to end the partial government shutdown, the president took to Twitter late Wednesday night to air his well-worn grievances about a familiar adversary -- the media.

In a series of tweets and retweets, Trump once again voiced disdain for the """"Mainstream Media,"" specifically naming NBC and MSNBC as the source of his ire, while also touting support for himself and his controversial wall ahead of a visit to the southern border Thursday.

The president began by attacking the news outlets for being ""dishonest"" and describing them as the ""Opposition Party working with the Dems"" in two tweets shared 10 minutes apart.

""May even be worse than Fake News CNN, if that is possible!"" Trump wrote.

He went on to complain about network anchors, claiming they ""quickly leaked the contents"" of an ""OFF THE RECORD luncheon"" that occurred before his prime-time address Tuesday. Trump was likely referencing a New York Times story reporting that the president had complained in that meeting that he didn't want to give the televised speech or go to the border but that aides had talked him into it. ""It's not going to change a damn thing, but I'm still doing it,"" the Times reported him saying in the luncheon.

""Who would believe how bad it has gotten with the mainstream media, which has gone totally bonkers!"" Trump tweeted.

Trump then proceeded to retweet flattering messages of support that championed his controversial border wall.

The president reposted four tweets from one of his most vocal supporters, Charlie Kirk, founder of Turning Point USA, a pro-Trump organization. Two of Kirk's tweets advocated the need for the wall, citing misleading statistics about illegal activity happening at the southern border. In another tweet that the president retweeted, Kirk wrote that Trump is ""winning this shutdown fight"" and urged the president to ""stand your ground.""

The retweets also included a tweet from his campaign manager, Brad Parscale, who wrote that he had ""just received my newest voter score tracking from my team.""

""@realDonaldTrump has reached his highest national approval rating since I started tracking,"" Parscale boasted. ""The @TheDemocrats have really made a mistake going with their gut over data.""

Trump capped off his late-night flurry of Twitter activity by retweeting conservative commentator Dan Bongino, who had shared a link to a misleading news story from ""The Dan Bongino Show"" titled, ""New Poll: Vast Majority of Voters Believe There is 'Crisis' or 'Problem' at U.S. Border."" The poll Bongino's tweet referenced was conducted by Politico and Morning Consult this week and found that 42 percent of voters view the border situation as ""a crisis,"" while another 37 percent say there is ""a problem"" along the border, but don't believe it is a crisis.

On Tuesday, the president delivered his first prime-time address from the Oval Office in which he gravely informed Americans that his wall is the only solution to the ""growing humanitarian and security crisis"" at the southern border. But Wednesday, it appeared that his plea did little to sway congressional Democrats who continued to refuse to grant him funding for the wall, prompting the president to storm out of a tense shutdown negotiation meeting. Trump is also beginning to lose support from some members of his own party over his shutdown strategy as eight House Republicans voted in favor of a plan backed by Democrats to reopen the Treasury Department even if border wall funds are not secured, The Washington Post's Felicia Sonmez and John Wagner reported.

['He's a gut politician': Trump's go-to negotiating tactics aren't working in shutdown standoff]

There is one news organization, however, that has managed to stay in the president's good graces. On his Fox News show Wednesday, host Sean Hannity announced he would be conducting an interview with Trump at the border in McAllen, Tex., on Thursday.

""We will be there,"" Hannity told his viewers. ""We have a lot to talk to the president and everyone else about tomorrow."""

FORGET DONALD TRUMP. The president -- erratic, posturing, pandering and detail-averse -- does not have the dealmaking chops to break the current deadlock with Democrats and reopen the government. That's no excuse for Congress to sit on its hands. Instead of digging themselves deeper into their own trench of irreconciliation, why don't lawmakers put a tough-minded deal on the president's desk and force his hand?

That deal, as many in Washington know and have advocated for months, involves a swap: Shield hundreds of thousands of ""dreamers"" from the threat of deportation, ensuring them the safe and secure lives they deserve in the country they've known since they were brought to this nation as children. On top of that, grant a reprieve to tens of thousands of Hondurans, Haitians and Salvadorans who have lived legally for years in the United States but now face the threat of removal as the administration rescinds their existing protections under the temporary protected status (TPS) program. In return, offer Mr. Trump some money to build his wall.

Everyone gnashes their teeth over that tradeoff, proof that it contains the elements of a plausible compromise. There's no shortage of House Democrats, reveling in their new majority, who say they will ""never"" fund Mr. Trump's wall, nor even a portion of it. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.), AWOL since the president flipped on a stopgap funding measure to keep the government running last month, remains in his sullen funk, refusing to bring legislation to a vote without Mr. Trump's say-so. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) frames the debate, specifically the wall, in terms of morality -- a surefire kiss of death.

It may feel comfortable to wallow in the moral certainties of a No Deal, but why stoop to the president's level? Newly elected Democrats who flipped previously GOP-held seats might take account of their swing-voting constituents who might be fine with a measure of creative conciliation that restarts the government. Democrats from Trump-hating districts can sell the deal as a rescue package for well more than 1 million dreamers and TPS recipients who face imminent and drastic threats to their futures. Republicans who want to build a wall can crow that they secured funding, at last, for a down payment on one.

In a political age that has become solution-averse, these are the building blocks of an honorable way out from the current dead end. Of course, Mr. Trump will snarl, threaten a veto and maybe make good on that threat. If he does, the ball will be in his court, his hand forced to produce an alternative -- or Congress can override, as the Constitution allows.

Congress is a separate branch of government; it needn't be paralyzed by a tantrum-prone president. The legislative branch is empowered to send legislation to the White House. Has it forgotten it has that prerogative?

The Post's View: Democrats can use their leverage on the wall for a truly moral purpose

Newt Gingrich and Donald Graham: Fund the wall and save the dreamers

Marc A. Thiessen: Democrats were for a wall before they were against it

32,abc news,https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/wireStory/congress-face-question-shutdown-end-60354548,"Congress returns to Washington for its first full week of legislative business since control of the House reverted to Democrats, but lawmakers will be confronted with the same lingering question: When will the partial government shutdown end?

One Republican senator says he's offered President Donald Trump a possible solution, though it may just be wishful thinking.

Sen. Lindsey Graham is encouraging Trump to reopen government for several weeks to continue negotiating with Democrats over the border wall Trump wants to build on the U.S.-Mexico border. If there's no deal at the end of that time, Graham says Trump would be free to take the more dramatic step of declaring a national emergency to build it.

But the South Carolina Republican says Trump still wants a deal on funding for the wall before agreeing to reopen shuttered government departments. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat, insists Trump reopen the government first.

Their weeks-old standoff led to the partial government shutdown, now on day 24 without a clear end in sight.

""Before he pulls the plug on the legislative option, and I think we're almost there, I would urge him to open up the government for a short period of time, like three weeks, before he pulls the plug, see if we can get a deal,"" Graham said. ""If we can't at the end of three weeks, all bets are off.

""See if he can do it by himself through the emergency powers. That's my recommendation,"" added Graham, who has publicly pushed Trump to use his authority to declare a national emergency to build the wall. Such a step would allow Trump to bypass Congress and tap various pots of unspent federal money, including for military construction and disaster relief as well as from assets seized by law enforcement, to pay for the wall.

Trump has kept Washington on edge over whether he would resort to such a declaration, citing what he says is a ""crisis"" of drug smuggling and the trafficking of women and children at the border. The president initially sounded as though such a move was imminent, but then pulled back. He has said several times since he first mentioned the idea in public this month that he prefers a legislative solution.

A key question is how much more time is Trump willing to give lawmakers. Graham, who spoke with Trump by telephone on Sunday morning, said the legislative path ""is just about shut off"" and blamed intransigence by Pelosi.

The speaker's office had no immediate comment.

Democrats oppose an emergency declaration but may be powerless to block it. Some Republicans are wary, too, fearing how a future Democratic president might use that authority. Such a move, should Trump ultimately go that route, would almost certainly be challenged in the courts.

Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., called Graham's idea to reopen the government a ""great place to start.""

""I do think if we reopen the government, if the president ends this shutdown crisis, we have folks who can negotiate a responsible, modern investment in technology that will actually make us safer,"" Coons said.

Trump says technology is nice, but that the border can't be secured without a wall.

The White House has been laying the groundwork for an emergency declaration, which is feared by lawmakers in both parties.

Senate Homeland Security Committee Chairman Ron Johnson, R-Wis., said he'd ""hate to see"" a declaration issued because the wall wouldn't get built, presumably because of legal challenges. Democrats voted in the past for border security and should again, he said.

""I actually want to see this wall get built,"" Johnson said. ""I want to keep pressure on Democrats to actually come to the negotiating table in good faith and fund what they have supported in the past.""

Graham favors a declaration and said the time for talk is running out.

""It's the last option, not the first option, but we're pretty close to that being the only option,"" he said.

Graham and Coons spoke on ""Fox News Sunday"" and Johnson appeared on CNN's ""State of the Union.""

The Army is looking for a few good robots. Not to fight -- not yet, at least -- but to help the men and women who do.

These robots aren't taking up arms, but the companies making them have waged a different kind of battle. At stake is a contract worth almost half a billion dollars for 3,000 backpack-sized robots that can defuse bombs and scout enemy positions. Competition for the work has spilled over into Congress and federal court.

Euro currency remains a work in progress on 20th birthday

FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- The euro is about to celebrate its 20th birthday, but the countries that use it are still wrestling with how the shared currency should work and how to fix flaws exposed by the debt crisis that marred its second decade.

The euro was launched on Jan. 1, 1999, when 10 countries fixed their exchange rates to it and handed decisions on interest rates to the newly-founded European Central Bank. Euro notes and coins went into circulation three years later.

The shared currency was seen as a solution to the constant quarrels over exchange rates that had marked European politics after World War II and as a logical extension of the European Union's tariff-free trade zone. Britain, notably, opted out, but 19 of 28 EU countries use the euro.

North Korea's 'Singapore shops' expose gap in sanctions push

PYONGYANG, North Korea (AP) -- Despite the unwanted publicity of a criminal trial for one of their main suppliers, business is booming at Pyongyang's 'Singapore shops,' which sell everything from Ukrainian vodka to brand-name knock-offs from China. The stores stock many of the very things United Nations' sanctions banning trade in luxury goods are intended to block and provide a nagging reminder that not all potential trade partners are lining up behind the U.N.'s pronouncements or the Trump administration's policy of maximum pressure on the North.

Especially when there's a buck -- or a few million bucks -- to be made.

The stores are anything but secret.

Musk got into trouble with the Securities and Exchange Commission in early August when he said in a tweet that he had ""funding secured"" to take the electric car company private at $420 per share.

GOP and Democrats trade blame for shutdown, no deal in sight

WASHINGTON (AP) -- The partial government shutdown will almost certainly be handed off to a divided government to solve in the new year, as both parties traded blame Friday and President Donald Trump sought to raise the stakes in the weeklong impasse.

As agreement eludes Washington in the waning days of the Republican monopoly on power, it sets up the first big confrontation between Trump and newly empowered Democrats. Trump is sticking with his demand for money to build a border wall with Mexico, and Democrats, who take control of the House on Jan. 3, are refusing to give him what he wants.

Trump raised the stakes on Friday, reissuing threats to shut the U.S.-Mexico border to pressure Congress to fund the wall and to shut off aid to three Central American countries from which many migrants have fled.

34,nbc news,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/congress/pelosi-hours-away-speaker-vote-n954176,"WASHINGTON -- Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., was elected speaker of the House on Thursday for a second time, as Democrats took control of the lower chamber.

Pelosi -- who retook the speaker's gavel after a formal floor vote that lasted about an hour -- reclaimed the House's top leadership post amid a congressional face-off with President Donald Trump over border wall funding that has left parts of the federal government shuttered for the third time in a year.

Pelosi, 78, won with 220 votes, with 12 Democrats voting for someone other than Pelosi and three Democrats voting present. As Pelosi cast a vote for herself, her granddaughter held her hand, jumped excitedly and yelled across the chamber. A number of House Democrats wore blue ""Madame Speaker"" buttons during the vote.

""Two months ago, the American people spoke, and demanded a new dawn,"" Pelosi said in remarks in the House chamber after the vote. ""They called upon the beauty of our Constitution: our system of checks and balances that protects our democracy, remembering that the legislative branch is Article I: the first branch of government, co-equal to the presidency and judiciary.""

The California Democrat -- who previously served as House speaker from 2007 until 2011, spanning the administrations of Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama, and led Democrats under the eight-year Republican majority in the House that followed -- secured enough support to win the leadership post late last year, despite a brief insurrection among a small group of Democrats.

The new Democratic Caucus chairman, Rep. Hakeem Jeffries of New York, formally nominated Pelosi on the House floor to rousing applause.

Pelosi's family, including her husband, Paul, and her children were in the gallery, and her nine grandchildren were inside the chamber as well during the vote. Her other guests included singer Tony Bennett, Project Runway host Tim Gunn, Grateful Dead drummer Mickey Hart, and EMILY'S List founder Ellen Malcolm and President Stephanie Schriock, among others.

Her election came as the partial government shutdown stretched into its 13th day, with no deal to end it on the horizon. The House, under the newly elected speaker, planned to vote Thursday on an appropriations package that would end it.

""We will debate and advance good ideas no matter where they come from,"" Pelosi said. ""And in that spirit, Democrats will be offering the Senate Republican appropriations legislation to re-open government later today -- to meet the needs of the American people, to protect our borders and to respect our workers.""

That vote was scheduled to take place Thursday evening, despite the fact that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has said he will not bring up the legislation for a vote in the Senate.

Congressional leaders, including Pelosi, are expected to return to the White House at 11:30 a.m. Friday for another meeting with Trump to discuss the shutdown situation.

Democrats expressed low expectations for any result from the meeting, which they said could be another political stunt.

Also on the new Democratic majority's agenda: oversight. In an exclusive interview with NBC's ""Today"" ahead of Thursday's vote, Pelosi didn't rule out the prospect of a Trump impeachment.

WASHINGTON -- Aid groups are warning that humanitarian relief delivered to some 1.6 million Syrians in the northeastern region may be at risk if the Trump administration quickly withdraws U.S. troops and personnel from Syria, as announced this week.

The decision, issued despite opposition inside the Pentagon, State Department and among U.S. allies, caught aid organizations off-guard and left many scrambling to respond. Aid officials fear that a sudden U.S. withdrawal could destabilize the area, endanger their staff and cut off humanitarian access to parts of the country previously secured by American forces.

A draft statement circulating among a group of 70 international aid groups operating in and around Syria warned that a sudden withdrawal could create a vacuum that might trigger more violence and hamper aid efforts in the northeast.

""A lot of people are very upset about this decision because it has come out of the blue,"" said Arnaud Quemin, the Syria director for Mercy Corps, a major aid group, adding that the population lacked basic supplies like food, water and heating. ""What matters is not who controls the place, but whether we have access...we really hope that it's not going to go away after this decision.""

Over the past year, U.S.-backed aid efforts have focused on restoring basic services to Syrian towns devastated by years of war. U.S. officials repeatedly described such efforts as critical to preventing extremist groups from regaining a foothold.

The U.S. has committed more than $1.6 billion in funding for the period that runs from Oct .1, 2017 to Sept. 30, 2019. The fate of funding still in the pipeline is now unclear, according to aid groups that say it may be difficult to continue operating if violence breaks out.

The State Department-led Syria Transition Assistance Response Team, or START, which has been operating in an around Syria since 2012 overseeing U.S. aid efforts, was given 24 hours under the troop withdrawal order to leave the country and relocate to Kuwait, according to an official familiar with the situation.

U.S.-backed groups, including the major development contractor Tetra Tech , started evacuating international staff after the announcement. Tetra Tech didn't respond to a request for comment.

The United Nations, including the World Food Program, the major recipient of U.S. funding, said it would continue to deliver aid, if security conditions permitted.

""We are keen to continue providing life saving assistance to people in need in the area, provided access remains open and the security situation remains calm and safe for our staff,"" said Panos Moumtzis, the U.N.'s regional humanitarian coordinator for Syria.

A U.S. Agency for International Development official said that the agency, the State Department's leading aid agency, hadn't received any notification yet on funding. USAID data shows that some 13 million Syrians are in need of humanitarian assistance, including 5.8 million displaced inside the country, where harsh conditions include a lack of access to food, running water and electricity.

""At this time, USAID and State have not received direction to discontinue our stabilization assistance in northeast Syria,"" a USAID official said. ""We will continue to evaluate and assess our programming as the situation on the ground develops, and adjust as necessary, in consultation with interagency partners, and in support of the White House.""

The official said the U.S. government will continue to support international efforts to improve local security, governance and economic conditions in areas liberated from ISIS. The U.S. has spent over $9.1 billion in humanitarian assistance to Syria since 2012.

The U.S.-backed effort to restore basic services in Syria has been a focal point of the effort to prevent Islamic State from returning to towns such as Raqqa, once the capital of its self-declared caliphate. Almost 153,000 Syrians have returned home to Raqqa over the past year, despite extensive damage to the city, where aid groups are working to restore basic services.

Mark Ward, the former State Department official in charge of START, said the provision of stipends and basic equipment like garbage trucks, ambulances and generators were designed ""to keep towns functioning.""

Cutting off such programs in the middle of a civil war puts basic services in jeopardy, Mr. Ward added, and risks opening up a ""vacuum for extremist groups to fill.""

""People get frustrated and lose hope when services aren't provided... which might lead them to welcome the bad guys back,"" he said.

The top U.S. envoy for Syria negotiations, Ambassador James Jeffrey, described the humanitarian assistance efforts at a recent news briefing as a critical component of the effort to prevent Islamic State from returning.

""Our policy is to work with the people of the northeast first of all to defeat ISIS. We have to do some basic humanitarian work and local stabilization work in order to have a platform for this defeat of ISIS,"" Mr. Jeffrey told reporters in early December.

A U.S. official, speaking on background, said It is possible that some of the companies that contract with the State Department may be able to continue operating in Syria using funding from other countries, if the security situation allows continued access.

Rachel Sider of the Norwegian Refugee Council said that the U.S. decision had completely ""blindsided"" the aid community and left staff, their families and millions of Syrians dependent on assistance in limbo.

""This took us all by complete surprise. As with all other parties in the conflict, there is a degree of necessary coordination between aid partners on the ground and coalition forces,"" Ms. Sider said, adding that any outbreak in violence, particularly in light of Turkey's threats of a military incursion, could exacerbate the humanitarian crisis in Syria.

36,nbc news,https://www.nbcnews.com/politics/white-house/shutdown-suspends-federal-cleanups-contaminated-superfund-sites-n957551,"BIRMINGHAM, Ala. -- The government shutdown has suspended federal cleanups at Superfund sites around the nation and forced the cancellation of public hearings, deepening the mistrust and resentment of surrounding residents who feel people in power long ago abandoned them to live among the toxic residue of the country's factories and mines.

""We are already hurting, and it's just adding more fuel to the fire,"" says 40-year-old Keisha Brown, whose wood-frame home is in a community nestled among coking plants and other factories on Birmingham's north side.

The mostly African-American community has been forced to cope with high levels of arsenic, lead and other contaminants in the soil that the Environmental Protection Agency has been scraping up and carting away, house by house.

As President Donald Trump and Congress battle over Trump's demand for a wall on the southern U.S. border, the nearly 3-week-old partial government shutdown has stopped federal work on Superfund sites except for cases where the administration deems ""there is an imminent threat to the safety of human life or to the protection of property.""

EPA's shutdown plans said the agency would evaluate about 800 Superfund sites to see how many could pose an immediate threat. As an example of that kind of threat, it cited an acid leak from a mine that could threaten the public water supply. That's the hazard at Northern California's Iron Mountain mine, where EPA workers help prevent an unending flow of lethally acidic runoff off the Superfund site from spilling into rivers downstream.

Practically speaking, said Bonnie Bellow, a former EPA official who worked on Superfund public outreach at the agency, the impact of the stoppage of work at sites across the nation ""wholly depends"" on the length of the shutdown.

""Unless there is immediate risk like a storm, a flood, a week or two of slowdowns is not going to very likely affect the cleanup at the site,"" Bellow said.

In north Birmingham, Brown said it's been a couple of weeks since she's spotted any EPA crews at people's houses. It wasn't clear if state workers or contractors were continuing work.

But long before the shutdown began, Brown harbored doubts the cleanup was working anyway. ""My main concern is the health of the people out here,"" said Brown, who has asthma. ""All of us are sick, and we've got to function on medicine every day.""

In terms of time, the federal government shutdown is a chronological blip in the long history of the site -- which includes ethics charges in a local bribery scandal to block federal cleanup efforts -- but adds to the uncertainty in an area where residents feel forgotten and betrayed.

At the EPA, the shutdown has furloughed the bulk of the agency's roughly 14,000 employees. It also means the EPA isn't getting most of the daily stream of environmental questions and tips from the public. Routine inspections aren't happening. State, local and private emails to EPA officials often get automated messages back promising a response when the shutdown ends.

In Montana, for instance, state officials this month found themselves fielding calls from a tribal member worried about drinking water with a funny look to it, said Kristi Ponozzo, public-policy director at that state's Department of Environmental Quality. The EPA normally provides tribes with technical assistance on water supplies.

With most EPA colleagues idled, Ponozzo said, her agency also had to call off an environmental review meeting for a mining project, potentially delaying the project.

But it's the agency's work at Superfund sites -- lessening the threat from old nuclear-weapons plants, chemical factories, mines and other entities -- that gets much of the attention.

Absent imminent peril, it would be up to state governments or contractors to continue any cleanup during the shutdown ""up to the point that additional EPA direction or funding is needed,"" the EPA said in a statement.

""Sites where cleanup activities have been stopped or shut down will be secured until cleanup activities are able to commence when the federal government reopens,"" the agency said.

For federal Superfund sites in Michigan, the shutdown means there are no EPA colleagues to consult, said Scott Dean, a spokesman for that state's Department of Environmental Quality.

At Michigan Superfund sites, day-to-day field operations were continuing since private contractors do most of the on-the-ground work, Dean said.

Bellow, the former EPA official, said the cancellation of hearings about Superfund sites posed immediate concerns.

In East Chicago, Indiana, for example, the EPA called off a planned public hearing set for last Wednesday to outline how the agency planned to clean up high levels of lead and arsenic in the soil.

The EPA has proposed a seven-month, $26.5 million cleanup that includes treating and removing tainted soil from the area, where a lead smelter previously was located.

During a public meeting Nov. 29, some residents complained that the EPA's approach would leave too much pollution in place. But others didn't get a chance to speak and were hoping to do so at the meeting this week, said Debbie Chizewer, a Northwestern University environmental attorney who represents community groups in the low-income area.

The EPA announced the cancellation in an online notice and gave no indication that it would be rescheduled.

Leaders of the East Chicago Calumet Community Advisory Group asked for a new hearing date and an extension of a Jan. 14 public comment deadline in a letter to the EPA's regional Superfund division.

Calls by The Associated Press to the agency's regional office in Chicago this week were not answered.

Local critics fear the EPA will use the delay caused by the shutdown as justification for pushing ahead with a cleanup strategy they consider flawed, Chizewer said, even though the agency has designated the affected area as an ""environmental justice community"" -- a low-income community of color that has been disproportionately harmed by pollution.

The EPA has a ""special obligation"" when dealing with such communities, Chizewer said. ""This would be an example of shutting them out for no good reason.""

In North Birmingham, former longtime neighborhood resident Charlie Powell said most of the people living in and around the Superfund site had already ""just got tired and fed up.""

Powell left the area but started a group called PANIC, People Against Neighborhood Industrial Contamination. He believes money would be better spent helping residents move away from the pollution.

""Can I say hell?"" Powell said when asked what residents have been through."
37,the wall street journal,https://www.wsj.com/articles/world-bank-president-jim-yong-kim-to-resign-in-february-11546879066,"Early departure could reignite battle over who gets to pick leader of institution By Josh Zumbrun Josh Zumbrun The Wall Street Journal BiographyJosh Zumbrun @JoshZumbrun josh.zumbrun@wsj.com Updated Jan. 7, 2019 7:32 p.m. ET

WASHINGTON -- World Bank President Jim Yong Kim unexpectedly announced his resignation on Monday, setting up a potential dispute between the U.S. and other member countries over selecting the next leader of the world's largest development-finance institution.

Mr. Kim plans to leave the bank on Feb. 1, nearly three years before his term was set to expire, to join a firm focused on infrastructure investments.

He first became president of the World Bank in 2012, appointed by President Obama, and in 2016 he was appointed to a new term lasting through 2021, meaning his successor wouldn't have been appointed during the first term of the Trump presidency.

Kristalina Georgieva, the current CEO of the World Bank, will become interim president effective Feb. 1.

Mr. Kim, 59 years old, said in an email to bank staff that his ""opportunity to join the private sector was unexpected, but I've concluded that this is the path through which I will be able to make the largest impact on major global issues like climate change and the infrastructure deficit in emerging markets.""

He had previously been president of Dartmouth College, and before that was a physician known for his work combating HIV/AIDS. He will also rejoin Partners in Health, an international community health-care organization that he co-founded more than 30 years ago.

The World Bank said that details about the infrastructure fund that Mr. Kim is joining would be released at a later date.

In the bank's seven-decade history, its president has always been picked by the U.S., but it isn't guaranteed that Washington will get to make the new selection. Many countries and advocacy groups have sought an end to Washington's control, and the prospect of President Trump making the selection could galvanize countries to fight for a change in this status quo.

""To have strong, good governance that is a globally representative, it shouldn't be one country dominating the decision on leadership,"" said Nadia Daar, the head of the Washington office for Oxfam International, a global relief and development organization. ""The world is changing economically and politically and the institution really needs to modernize in that way as well,"" she said.

In 2012, the U.S. faced a challenge to its primacy in appointing the World Bank's president. Mr. Kim's nomination by the U.S. faced contenders from Nigeria and Colombia. Many officials have argued that the World Bank's role in development finance warrants leadership -- at least occasionally -- from countries in the global south.

""Jim Kim's selection was controversial, mostly because much of the world was no longer satisfied with a pre-ordained arrangement where an American headed the bank and a European headed the International Monetary Fund,"" said Scott Morris, a senior fellow at the Center for Global Development.

The U.S. Treasury Department, however, takes the lead on issues with the World Bank, and would likely be the agency on the front lines of any fight to appoint his successor.

A Treasury representative said in a statement: ""We appreciate Mr. Kim's service to the World Bank,"" adding that Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin ""looks forward to working with his fellow governors in selecting a new lead.""

The Treasury is the largest shareholder at the World Bank, controlling about 16% of voting shares. It has had a sometimes-antagonistic relationship with the bank under Mr. Mnuchin. The Treasury has criticized the World Bank for lending too much to China and for compensation packages that it says are too generous.

Newsletter Sign-up

But this past April, the Treasury backed a $13 billion funding increase for the World Bank. Securing the funding was a major victory for Mr. Kim's legacy at the bank, especially when the Trump administration has been so critical of many international organizations.

""He secured a capital increase at a time that few would have thought it was possible,"" said Mr. Morris, who had been the Treasury appointee responsible for development finance under Mr. Obama.

During his tenure, Mr. Kim also achieved two replenishments of funding for the International Development Association, the fund at the World Bank earmarked to support the world's poorest countries.

Mr. Kim's tenure wasn't without controversy. He presided over a reorganization of the bank that drew some objections from both inside and outside the bank.

Mr. Kim had been credited for hiring a top economist, Paul Romer, to lead the bank's economics department. But Mr. Romer shocked the bank last year by resigning and alleging that the bank's scientific integrity was compromised. Mr. Romer, in particular, apologized to the country of Chile saying that it had been unfairly harmed by methodology changes used to calculate the bank's flagship report on business competitiveness.

A bank review concluded that there had been no intent to manipulate World Bank reports for political purposes, but the bank also agreed to change the way it ranked countries' business competitiveness, and the episode was a black eye for the institution.

But a five-day-old GoFundMe fundraiser for Donald Trump's border wall by a Florida man is starting to look anything like a joke. With ambitions to raise a brow-raising $1 billion, it has already secured nearly $13 million from more than 200,000 individuals since launching on Sunday. And GoFundMe campaigns do not have deadlines.

Where that mounting pile of money will land is the looming question. The man behind the campaign, Brian Kolfage, formerly ran conspiracy-theory websites, along with a Facebook page called Right Wing News that was shut down by Facebook in October.

Kolfage, who is also a U.S. veteran who served in Iraq and lost both legs and one arm, talks at some length about his public service on his GoFundMe page. He also states that he has been on Fox News ""many times, [so] you can see I'm credible and a real person."" He meanwhile mentions nothing about his media ventures, telling NBC News yesterday that he doesn't ""want it to be a distraction"" to potential donors.

More concerning are some of the claims that Kolfage makes at the page, including that 100 percent of the donations will go to the Trump Wall, when there is no mechanism that would allow such a transfer of funds as of this moment. Congress would have to enact a statute to permit it. Writes Kolfage: ""How will we get the funds to the right place? We have contacted the Trump Administration to secure a point of contact where all the funds will go upon completion. When we get this information secured, we will update. We have many very high level contacts already helping.""

The page also tells visitors that the U.S. government has accepted large donations from private investors in the past, linking to a 2012 story about billionaire David Rubenstein, co-founder of the Carlyle Group, who donated $7.5 million to repair cracks near the top of the Washington Monument. What the GoFundMe campaign does not make clear is that Congress was behind that particular initiative, allocating $7.5 million to the repairs on the condition that private donations would match that same amount.

In fact, numerous government agencies accept matching gifts from private donors, including the National Endowment for the Humanities. But the idea is to double the impact of government-led initiatives through those contributions, not to invite donors to dictate the initiatives themselves. As U.S. Representative Bob Goodlatte, a Republican from Virginia and the chair of the House Judiciary Committee, told the New York Post yesterday, ""Obviously, we can't let citizens raise money and say, 'The government will spend my money on this purpose.' ""

Given that roughly one-third of Americans of voting age identify as Republicans, two-thirds of whom appear to support Trump's push for a border wall, Kolfage's $1 billion target doesn't sound entirely outlandish. The campaign has already landed one $50,000 donation, and if it gains further momentum, others may come to view it as a straightforward way to flex their financial and political muscle.

Indeed, at some point, the campaign, if it continues to gain momentum, could begin to raise questions, beyond whether or not it's smart for people to be sending their money to Kolfage. Specifically, though it's against the law for the government to accept donations with strings attached, might we see a day when the U.S. citizens are able to wield as much power as lobbying groups by coming together on financial platforms like GoFundMe? Though no amount of money committed to Kolfage's GoFundMe campaign would obligate the government to build a border wall, already Republican lawmakers have introduced bills seeking to allow the Treasury Department to accept public donations for the purpose of funding one. The bills are unlikely to go anywhere once Democrats take control of the House next month, but they could pave the path for future legislation.

In the meantime, what happens to Kolfage and the many millions of dollars he has raised will be interesting to watch. As a Post report yesterday noted, GoFundMe's terms of service prohibit ""not using funds for their stated purpose,"" meaning that if the government can't find a way to work with Kolfage, he may have to reimburse donors. Or, at least, GoFundMe -- which hasn't responded to our requests for comment -- may be saddled with doing so.

It wouldn't be the first time the platform has had to return money to a campaign's donors.

Just last month, a New Jersey couple and a homeless man were accused of making up a story that raised more than $400,000 through GoFundMe, money that they reportedly spent on a car, trips, high-end handbags and casinos. The couple and the man now face charges of second-degree theft by deception and conspiracy to commit theft by deception. GoFundMe has said it will fully reimburse the campaign's 14,000 donors.

Interestingly, GoFundMe has never revealed how much it has raised from its own investors, which include Iconiq, Stripes Group, Accel, TCV, Greylock and Meritech Capital. It raised its first outside round of capital four years ago. The company was founded in 2010."

President Donald Trump tweeted early Monday morning that he was excited to visit Nashville, Tennessee, for the American Farm Bureau Federation's annual convention.

One problem: The event is in New Orleans.

""Getting ready to address the Farm Convention today in Nashville, Tennessee,"" Trump wrote. ""Love our farmers, love Tennessee - a great combination! See you in a little while.""

Trump deleted the tweet minutes later. One possible reason for the confusion was that the prior year's convention was held in Nashville.

Several other of the president's tweets Monday morning focused on the partial government shutdown, which is now in its 24th day -- the longest such shutdown in U.S. history.

""I've been waiting all weekend,"" Trump wrote. ""Democrats must get to work now. Border must be secured!"" The president added in another tweet minutes later, ""Nancy and Cryin' Chuck can end the Shutdown in 15 minutes. At this point it has become their, and the Democrats, fault!""

Trump scuttled an agreement both parties reached in December to keep the government funded through early February because it did not contain about $5 billion in funding for a wall along the southern border. Democrats said they will not provide Trump with any additional wall funding on top of $1.6 billion that had already been allocated."

Mark Zuckerberg began 2018 resolving to fix the issues afflicting Facebook Inc. FB -7.25% By December, it was all the clearer just how daunting a task that is for the chief executive.

It was a year of reckoning for Facebook, Alphabet Inc.'s GOOGL -0.76% Google and other tech giants. Even as they touched, briefly, new highs in stock-market valuation, the companies battled criticism on a range of issues -- much of it rooted in their handling of the oceans of data they collect on their users.

Facebook and Google have leveraged that information to dominate digital advertising and achieve enormous wealth, but a series of revelations showed they have done far too little to protect it. Facebook let outside companies access personal information in ways its users didn't expect, including Cambridge Analytica, a data firm that worked for President Trump's 2016 campaign. Google allowed app developers for its Gmail service to read users' emails without their knowledge.

Moreover, both companies had major data-security lapses, including one that hit Google+ users months after Google promised to shut the social network in response to a Wall Street Journal story exposing a previous privacy shortcoming.

Their missteps brought the companies and their leaders unprecedented scrutiny from users, governments and investors. Both Mr. Zuckerberg and Sheryl Sandberg, Facebook's top two executives, were hauled in front of Congress, and, as the year drew to a close, so was Google CEO Sundar Pichai, after the search giant skipped earlier hearings.

With more focus on privacy than ever before, the tech titans still have a lot of fixing to do in 2019.

Bumpy Road for Nissan, Tesla, Other Car Makers

From tariffs to new technologies to a CEO scandal, it has been a turbulent period for the auto industry.

Tesla Inc. TSLA -1.20% was able to ramp up production of its highly anticipated Model 3 electric car, helping to keep its market valuation higher than that of old-line car makers like General Motors Co. GM 0.09% In August, Chief Executive Elon Musk declared on Twitter that he had secured funding to take Tesla private. Mr. Musk later dropped the plan and was stripped of his chairman title as part of broader settlement with federal securities regulators who alleged his comments misled investors.

Meanwhile, traditional car makers, facing slowing sedan sales and new threats from Silicon Valley, restructured. GM carved out its autonomous-car unit into a separate business and revealed plans last month to cut as many as 14,800 workers, end some sedan models and idle five plants. Ford Motor Co. also disclosed plans to cut head count and said it likewise was ending several sedan models, including the Ford Fusion, as it diversifies into new transportation ventures, including electric scooters.

The safety of autonomous vehicles was debated after an Uber Technologies Inc. self-driving car killed a pedestrian in March. Uber said it is working to improve its software and driver training.

The auto industry also saw the loss of two prominent car company leaders. Sergio Marchionne, who engineered the merger of Fiat and Chrysler, died in July at the age of 66 after what the company said was complications from a shoulder surgery.

Then, last month, Carlos Ghosn, chief architect of a global alliance that links Nissan Motor Co. NSANY -1.16% , Renault and Mitsubishi, was arrested in Japan on suspicions of financial misconduct. Mr. Ghosn, charged this month with understating his compensation in Nissan financial reports, told prosecutors he denies wrongdoing, according to Japanese public broadcaster NHK.

A new trade deal brokered by President Donald Trump to replace Nafta spared car makers from costly tariffs on imported cars from Canada and Mexico, but added new restrictions on duty-free trade, potentially increasing costs.

A Year of Trouble for GE, Sears

For General Electric , GE 5.36% 2018 was a year to forget.

The onetime American icon, representing the industrial might of the last century, lost nearly 60% of its stock valuation and was removed from the Dow Jones Industrial Average. It was hurt by more problems at its largest division, which makes massive turbines that generate electricity, and the need to put cash into its struggling GE Capital lending unit.

GE set plans to sell or spin off its health care, locomotive and oil-services businesses while also disposing of a number of smaller divisions. But change wasn't coming fast enough for the board of directors, which replaced Chief Executive John Flannery in October after just 14 months on the job.

New CEO Larry Culp, the first outsider to run GE, cut the dividend, the second for the company in a year, and is working to strengthen its balance sheet, mostly by selling assets and paying down debt.

GE also faces potential legal headaches. The Justice Department and the Securities and Exchange Commission are investigating a $22 billion charge the company booked in the third quarter tied to acquisitions in GE's power unit, as well as a $6 billion charge in the first quarter for a shortfall in insurance reserves.

GE wasn't the only well-known 20th century business to suffer this year. Sears Holdings Corp. , which once defined American retailing with catalogs and department stores, filed for bankruptcy, hurt by competition from online retailers as well as its unorthodox retail strategy of cutting spending on advertising, inventory and store improvements.

In addition, Toys ""R"" Us Inc. liquidated all of its U.S. stores this year, leaving billions of dollars in holiday toy sales available to other retailers.

-- Thomas Gryta

Deal Activity Stayed Strong

It was a good year for deal making, if not great. At more than $3.8 trillion, global merger volume was on track to notch its third-best year ever in 2018, according to Dealogic, as health care companies like Japan's Takeda Pharmaceutical Co. and Cigna Corp. of the U.S. and technology companies like International Business Machines Corp. struck mega takeover deals -- for Shire PLC ($63 billion), Express Scripts Holding Co. ($54 billion) and Red Hat Inc. ($37 billion).

Earlier in the year, M&A was on a record pace but the second half proved underwhelming as volatile markets and uncertainty about economic growth and trade policy plagued corporate decision makers.

The new-issue market also turned in a strong performance -- with more than $200 billion of deals world-wide, up 6%, according to Dealogic -- as strong demand for initial public offerings helped embolden tech companies around the world like Spotify Technology SA and Tencent Music Entertainment Group to list their shares.

The IPO market, in particular, is primed for an even better year in 2019 as some of the biggest startups still waiting in the wings, like Uber Technologies Inc. and Lyft Inc., recently took steps toward listings that could take place by June -- assuming markets cooperate.

In Brief

Apple Inc. unveiled its biggest and most expensive iPhone lineup ever, but later reports of the company cutting supply orders raised questions about how well the models were connecting with consumers.

The battle for 21st Century Fox 's entertainment assets ended with Walt Co. acquiring Fox's film and TV studio, among other assets, for $71.3 billion. Comcast Corp. , though, later beat out Disney and Fox by agreeing to pay $38.8 billion for European pay-TV giant Sky PLC.

AT&T Inc. was allowed to proceed with its $80 billion acquisition of Time Warner Inc., after a federal judge ruled the Justice Department hadn't proved its case that the deal would suppress competition in the pay-TV industry. The Justice Department later decided to appeal the ruling, even though the deal already had closed.

CVS Health Corp. completed its nearly $70 billion acquisition of Aetna Inc. after taking steps to ease regulators' concerns, but a federal judge later questioned the government's decision and threatened to halt the companies' integration.

Leslie Mooves was forced out as chief executive of CBS Corp. in September amid a board probe into allegations of sexual harassment and assault. Mr. Moonves said he regretted that he may have made some women uncomfortable but denied assaulting anyone. The list of media and entertainment figures in #MeToo scandals includes Harvey Weinstein, Bill O'Reilly, Matt Lauer andCharlie Rose, to name a few."
42,nbc news,https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/trump-doesn-t-care-about-governing-or-being-reelected-he-ncna951956,"Supporters cheer before President Donald Trump takes the stage for a rally in support of Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Tex., in Houston on Oct. 22, 2018.Loren Elliott / Getty Images file

A conventional politician, having won the presidency with a negative popular-vote margin, would likely spend his time in office trying to broaden his base and, by extension, his path to re-election.

Not so Donald Trump, who seems intent on winning the White House in 2020 by running with the same rhetorical playbook that carried him to an unlikely victory two years ago. Starting with the vision of ""American carnage"" he conjured in his inaugural address, Trump has governed with the same divisive dystopianism that marked his campaign, loudly narrowcasting to his most ardent supporters with little apparent regard for who else hears him.

That monomaniacal focus on his base has been on especially stark display in the wake of voters' crippling rejection of the Trumpian GOP -- a ballot box message Trump has ignored, partially shuttering the government just before Christmas over his unpopular wall-with-Mexico idea.

This approach is both a source of strength for the president and, quite possibly, a politically fatal weakness.

It is a strength because it has helped bind his supporters to him: He retains strong support among a group that makes up somewhere between 35 to 40 percent of the electorate, as the most recent NBC/Wall Street Journal poll illustrates. At the heart of that Trump base are white men without college educations who have felt both buffeted by social and economic changes and angry at a system that they feel ignores and is rigged against them.

""The hot core of Trumpism is a group of Americans who are the perfect marks for a con-man like Trump: Anxious over economic and social status markers in a changing world,"" Never-Trump GOP strategist Rick Wilson wrote in his book, ""Everything Trump Touches Dies."" ""Sure, they're looking for a place for both their anger and uncertainty to be heard. But they're also looking for someone to blame.""

Trump gives them that. If Richard Nixon kept his enemies list in secret, Trump posts his on social media: the press, immigrants from Central America, Muslims, the growing constellation of former employees testifying against him, football players who kneel during the national anthem, political appointees he once deemed great but are suddenly dangerously incompetent (Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and outgoing Secretary of Defense James Mattis come to mind) and foreign countries not named Russia, to name a few. And he does it while showering his supporters with the attention they felt deprived of by setting up an us-versus-them, grievance-based dichotomy that is catnip to his voters.

Traditional presidents, impressed with the gravity of being leader of the whole country (as well as being motivated by the aforementioned desire to get more adherents) have couched even their appeals to their core supporters in ways that don't alienate others. But Trump doesn't bother with dog-whistles; he just barks.

""There is a way of speaking to your base that is more inclusive,"" says Jeff Shesol, who was a speechwriter for President Bill Clinton. But, he adds, Trump is ""desperate for affirmation and to try to broaden ... to the middle of the American electorate would have really required work, would have really required him to find something in himself which he really doesn't have.""

It's a symbiotic relationship: Trump revels in his supporters' adulation, while they bask in the fact that when he speaks it's to them and them alone. If few politicians talk like Trump, it's because few have plucked the strings of authoritarianism as nakedly as he has. And his supporters conflate crass demagoguery with authenticity. ""They like the fact that he isn't couching things in high-level, safe terms,"" says a Democratic pollster with extensive experience in red states. ""They think he talks straight and he's honest in the way he talks to people.""

Of course, Donald Trump is manifestly not honest. He is a fabricator without parallel in U.S. history; and the pace of his prevarications has only increased. Not that this particularly undercuts his core support, for a combination of reasons.

Most obviously, some Americans underestimate the breadth and depth of his mendacity, in no small part because they mistrust the media more than their leader. His status as a businessman also affords him greater leeway because people know he's a salesman and that salesmen embellish; in their view he is speaking larger truths about them and the country, so the details are less important.

""It's also what he's doing,"" says the Democratic pollster. ""He's a wrecking ball. They've been ignored and he's paying attention to them. And the thing that ignored them ... he's just smashing.""

Whit Ayres, a veteran Republican pollster and Trump critic, recalled a focus group he ran in the spring that helped him understand support for the president. ""We get the joke about Trump,"" Ayres recalled them saying. ""We understand that he's a bear to work for and in many ways he's not a nice person.""

""But we live in communities where most of our manufacturing jobs have been shipped overseas, opioids are ravaging our communities, our families are coming apart,"" they added, according to Ayres. ""And we were faced with a choice between a man who said he'd help us and a woman who called us deplorable. What the hell did you expect us to do?""

But while Damn the other voters, full speed ahead! worked against Hillary Clinton (with both her quarter-century of Republican-primed baggage and the campaign's take-the-Midwest-for-granted strategy, not to mention James Comey's and Vladimir Putin's fingers on the scale) it hasn't produced much beyond thrashing and smashing in office. Is it likely to carry Trump to victory again in two years?

""It's either rewriting the rules of politics or it is spectacularly self-destructive politically,"" says Shesol. But early signs point to the president getting burned by the Trumpster fire he has so gleefully stoked.

His base may be a rock-solid 35 percent, but he has trouble pushing his approval rating into the mid-40s -- and you could see the fruit of Trump's approach in the midterm elections, when Democrats gained 40 seats. ""It's a problem when you're in a government of the people, by the people and for the people and a majority of the people are against what you're trying to do,"" says Ayres.

Republican pollster David Winston sifted through polling data from the election and determined that Trump's manic focus on immigration leading up to Election Day was ""popular with the base and those at President Trump's rallies but also controversial and divisive, particularly with Independents,"" he wrote in a report. ""The people who made their decision over the last few days voted Democratic by a 12-point margin.""

Winston noted that the demographic makeup of the electorate didn't change drastically from 2016 to 2018; but the GOP got wiped out because especially suburban voters deserted the party. As alarming for Republicans, CNN's Ron Brownstein noted, ""Democrats ran much more competitively among the roughly half of [white working-class voters] who are not evangelical Christians,"" and especially among white, nonevangelical women. Given that Trump's Electoral College victory was built on an 80,000-vote margin in three states, he can't afford even small fracture in his base.

Republicans in suburban districts say that Trump was a toxic drag. They have a point: Running up his margins in states he's going to win anyway won't help Trump if suburbanites abandon him in swing states as they did last month.

And yet here we sit: One quarter of the government -- including, (irony is not dead!) the Department of Homeland Security -- is darkened while Trump wallows in a fog of invective and grievance. Why? Because the president, spurred by the interlocutors with his base who make their money in the conservative-entertainment complex, has decided to treble down on his wall. ""Trump's advisers acknowledged that the funding may not be secured in the end but boasted that the spectacle would be remembered favorably by his base voters as proof of his mettle,"" The Washington Post reported last week.

Like the shutdown, Trump's beloved barricade enjoys greater support among his base than among the broader electorate. The shutdown and the wall, then, are Trump's latest performance art pieces. They're aimed at his base, a show of strength, power and devotion with the rest of us an unwilling and increasingly unhappy audience."
43,the daily caller,https://dailycaller.com/2019/01/02/mcconnell-dem-funding-proposal-non-starter/,"WASHINGTON -- Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Wednesday rejected incoming House Democrats' government funding proposal, calling it a ""non-starter"" if the Democrats do not ""get serious about border security.""

McConnell went to the floor of the Senate and reminded his Democratic colleagues that any proposal passed in the House will need 60 votes to pass the upper chamber as well as receive a presidential signature. (Related: Pelosi: Dems Won't Agree To Money For Wall, But Shutdown Isn't Dems' Fault)

""All three of these things are needed. One partisan vote in the House tomorrow won't solve anything. The legislation that House Democrats are reportedly planning to introduce would not be a serious contribution to these negotiations,"" he said

He added, ""It isn't comprehensive. It ignores the needs of border security. It's exactly the kind of proposal you'd expect if the incoming House Democrats were choosing to stage a political sideshow rather than do the hard work of helping to govern the country. A total non-starter."" (Related: Pelosi's Daughter Says Her Mom Will 'Cut Your Head Off And You Won't Even Know You're Bleeding')

President Trump Wednesday discussed the government funding proposals at the White House with McConnell and incoming House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, House Republican Leader Kevin McCarthy and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer.

Pelosi later declared she planned to bring a spending bill, sans border wall funding, to the floor of the House after the 116th Congress is sworn into office.

""We are asking the president to open up the government,"" Pelosi said standing outside the White House after the meeting with the president. ""We are giving him a Republican path to do that. Why would he not do it?""

House Republican Whip Steve Scalise reminded Democrats of their previous support of border wall funding in an op-ed he wrote for Fox News.

""Barack Obama and Chuck Schumer voted for 10 times more funding than President Trump is requesting now to secure our border. What has changed Democrats' recognition that our southern border needs to be secured? Two words: President Trump,"" Scalise wrote.

The Democrat proposal would provide funding for most of the government that is presently closed until the end of the fiscal year. However, the Department of Homeland Security would only be funded until February 8.

The new Congress will be sworn in on Thursday afternoon -- the 13th day of the partial government shut down."
44,cbs news,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/government-shutdown-could-hurt-federal-workers-credit-scores/,"As the U.S. government's partial shutdown stretched into its 21st day Friday, federal workers who've been furloughed or forced to work without pay are scrambling to avoid getting dinged by lenders and credit-reporting agencies for skipping loan payments that could damage their credit scores. Missing just one payment on a credit card, for example, can knock up to 100 points off a consumer's credit score, and it can take several years to recover the deficit, according to experts.

Some lenders, including banks and auto-leasing companies, say they are making concessions to accommodate government employees who are not receiving paychecks, but their concession standards vary, and some government workers tell CBS MoneyWatch they are struggling to negotiate deals with their creditors.

""The general flavor of what we have heard is creditors are waiving late fees, offering the opportunity to skip a payment, or offering short-term interest-free loans to federal workers that come with a grace period on repayment,"" said Bruce McClary, spokesman for the National Foundation for Credit Counseling. ""Unfortunately, the landscape of concessions is widely varied.""

Just ask Jeffery Davis, 35, who has worked since 2009 as an air traffic controller in Malden, Massachusetts. The married father of three currently leases two cars, an Infiniti and BMW. He said BMW has allowed him to defer payment on his car lease for two months, but he reports his second lessor is less flexible.

Davis said he tried ""to see if they're willing to delay payments or even take the lease back early -- they could write off how little I have to pay off -- but they said there's nothing they can do right now.""

President Donald Trump, who insists funding be secured to build a U.S.-Mexico border wall before the government reopens, has signaled that the closure could last months or even a year. With no end in sight, federal employees like Davis are jittery.

""With things the way they are, tensions as high as they are right now, it kind of worries me. Things that Trump has said, this could go on for a year,"" Davis said.

And while many lenders say they're committed to helping customers who have missed payments, some federal workers say that has not been the case for them.

Justin Williams, an army veteran who works as a contractor for the Internal Revenue Service, said he took out a personal loan with Mariner Finance when he moved to Washington, D.C. for work a year ago, but that the company has been ""not so understanding"" as he seeks a payment deferment while he's furloughed. Meanwhile Bank of America insisted that if he misses a payment on his credit card, he'll owe double the minimum payment on his balance next month.

Mariner Finance and Bank of America did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Friday called on commercial banks to offer furloughed workers interest-free loans that allow them to pay their bills on time. She cited past shutdowns that concluded with workers receiving back pay after the government reopened. ""Since there is a guarantee that they will be getting paid, I would hope that the commercial banks, the banks in our country, would follow the lead of some of the credit unions by giving interest-free loans right now to these families so that they can pay their bills on time,"" Pelosi said.

The existing credit-reporting system currently puts the onus on lenders to approve repayment solutions that help consumers avoid taking hits on their credit reports, according to Eric Ellman, senior vice president for public policy and legal affairs of the Consumer Data Industry Association (CDIA), which represents consumer reporting agencies, including Equifax, Experian and TransUnion.

The CDIA issued a notice to lenders reminding them of a code they can use when reporting consumers in forbearance to the likes of Equifax, Experian and TransUnion. Under a forbearance agreement, a lender temporarily suspends owed loan payments. ""It will hopefully give consumers a break who are affected by the shutdown,"" Ellman said.

TransUnion said it is helping guide lenders to use the code ""that will help give people a break on their credit during this difficult time.""

FICO -- the best-known company calculating consumer credit risk -- depends on credit-reporting agencies' consumer borrowing and payment histories to rate individuals' credit scores. ""It's kind of immaterial what FICO is doing -- their [scoring] model has long been built and it's not systemically possible for them to just 'do something,' "" said credit-scoring expert John Ulzheimer, formerly of FICO and Equifax.

A call for comment from FICO owner Fair Isaac Corp. was not returned.

Florence Weston, who works for the United States Department of Agriculture and has been furloughed since Dec. 22, says she has used her savings to meet her monthly car payment. Still, she worries the ripple effects of the shutdown -- and possibly numerous weeks of no paychecks -- will deplete her funds.

""I had to tap into my savings account to pay my mortgage, but I also have my car notes, and my mortgage next month. Everything is only two to three weeks away and right now we are not being paid.""

It's not all doom and gloom, though. Brandon Miller, a Federal Aviation Administration controller in Potomac, said the United Services Automobile Association, where he banks, ""has been completely open to what I have needed,"" including allowing him to delay payment on his credit card for a full month.

But members at the meeting were divided about the best path forward.

Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Richard ShelbyRichard Craig ShelbyTrump: Shutdown 'hopefully' won't last long McConnell: Funding talks with Trump 'to continue' Senate approves funding bill, preventing partial government shutdown MORE (R-Ala.) urged the president to accept a spending deal that includes $1.6 billion for a border wall -- a figure that Senate Democrats had agreed to just weeks ago.

But conservatives at the lunch, including some of Trump's top allies in the hard-line House Freedom Caucus, pushed back on that idea, encouraging the president not to cave and accept what they view as a bad deal.

They are pressing the president to get -- if not the full $5 billion he's demanded for wall funding -- at least as much as he possibly can.

""I want to make it very clear $1.6 billion is not going to work for conservatives, it's not going to work for the president,"" House Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark MeadowsMark Randall MeadowsTrump: Shutdown 'hopefully' won't last long Shutdown begins as lawmakers wrestle over Trump's border wall Senate agrees to last-ditch talks, but no clear path over shutdown MORE (R-N.C.) told The Hill outside his office after the White House meeting.

But when asked if that was possible without the $5 billion for the wall, Shelby said ""Well I would say you can get to $5 billion in different ways.""

One source familiar with the spending negotiations said a figure being floated by the White House is $2.1 billion, without restrictions on how the money can be spent to secure the border.

But Meadows said he expects the administration to aim for a higher figure.

""The numbers I've heard that they've floated -- and it's not an offer -- have been much higher than that,"" he told The Hill.

""It's got to be more than $1.6 billion dollars,"" Graham told ABC News in an interview after the meeting. ""This idea that we can't get a penny more is ridiculous.""

But Shelby argued that Trump could secure additional money for the wall by tapping funds from elsewhere in the budget -- an idea floated by White House spokesperson Sarah Huckabee Sanders just days ago.

Shelby also suggested to the president that they try to reach an agreement before the GOP relinquishes control of the House to Democrats on Jan. 3.

""I told the president that I thought that we ought to cut the best deal that we could now, but it would be up to them,"" Shelby told The Hill following the lunch. ""And I also told him ... that come January 3 the political equation changes. Some of those guys don't realize that.""

Rep.

""Until President Trump can publicly commit to a bipartisan resolution, there will be no agreement before January when the new House Democratic Majority will swiftly pass legislation to re-open government,"" Pelosi wrote in a ""Dear Colleague"" letter.

It remains unclear how much the president is willing to compromise on his $5 billion demand for border wall funding. Conservative radio and TV hosts Rush Limbaugh and Sean Hannity personally lobbied Trump to shut the government down if Democrats don't give him his wall; Trump got the message and vowed to fight.

""The crisis of illegal activity at our Southern Border is real and will not stop until we build a great Steel Barrier or Wall,"" Trump tweeted Saturday afternoon. ""Let work begin!""

While the Freedom Caucus members and Graham were strategizing in the Rayburn Office Building after the White House lunch, Pence was huddling with Senate Majority Leader Charles SchumerCharles (Chuck) Ellis SchumerHouse adjourns without clear path to avert shutdown Michelle Malkin, other conservatives rip Trump over border wall funding Feeling heat from the left, Dems reject judges deal MORE (D-N.Y.) on the other side of the Capitol.

Schumer has said repeatedly that Democrats simply won't support another dollar for Trump's promised border wall -- a project he characterized Saturday as ""expensive, ineffective"" and unpopular. Schumer accused Trump of being ""beholden to the far, far right.""

""It will never pass the Senate,"" Schumer vowed. ""Not today, not next, not next year.""

Leaving Schumer's office in the Capitol, Pence gave no details of the discussion.

""Still talking,"" Pence said.

But there was no indication if any progress had been made, and a number of sources suggested both sides are dug in.

""They are not even close to a deal,"" one administration source said. ""Schumer is throwing out all sorts of bullshit requests that he knows we won't support and that doesn't have the votes.""

Meadows, who is slated to travel back to North Carolina for Christmas on Sunday, also questioned whether Schumer is negotiating in good faith.

""The conversations with Schumer and them have to, you know, produce some fruit in terms of what an offer may or may not look like,"" he said. ""I do not believe that Senator Schumer is serious about negotiating based on the conversations that I've heard and you know until he is serious about reaching a reasonable compromise it's not worth the time.""

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnellAddison (Mitch) Mitchell McConnellShutdown begins as lawmakers wrestle over Trump's border wall Senate agrees to last-ditch talks, but no clear path over shutdown On The Money: Latest on shutdown drama | Senate leaders tout breakthrough for moving forward | Last-minute talks to secure final deal | Trump reverses, says Dems to blame | Dow suffers worst week since 2008 crisis MORE (R-Ky.) said Saturday that he's largely on the sidelines of the debate, as the White House and Senate Democrats try to hammer out the details of an agreement.

""The talks that count are between the Senate Democrats, whose votes you need, and the administration,"" McConnell said. ""So I'm pulling for them.

""Whatever the president and the Senate Democrats can negotiate is what we're prepared to pass,"" he added.

For all the aggressive jockeying from conservatives, they, too, suggested they'll support whatever deal Trump ultimately backs.

Meadows, for instance, acknowledged on Friday that if Trump were to publicly back a deal, ""certainly"" some conservatives would come along.

McConnell adjourned the Senate on Saturday afternoon with no deal in sight. In a procedural move, he carved out pro-forma sessions on Christmas Eve and again on Dec. 27th -- a maneuver that essentially bracketed off Christmas Day, while allowing space both before and after the holiday for the Senate to act if a deal is secured.

""If an agreement is reached, then we'll come back and pass it,"" McConnell said, leaving the chamber floor.

The majority leader said establishing that calendar is no indication that negotiators remain far apart.

""I wouldn't take that as a sign of that,"" he said.

McConnell also rejected the notion that allowing for a pro-forma session on the 27th means the shutdown will last at least that long.

""Listen, anything can happen,"" he said. ""We're pulling for an agreement that can get 60 votes in the Senate and a majority of votes in the House."""
46,the daily caller,https://dailycaller.com/2019/01/08/media-trump-national-address/,"Journalists were quick to take to Twitter and the airwaves as soon as President Donald Trump's primetime plea for a border wall was broadcast Tuesday evening.

Trump discussed public safety, economic and illicit drug issues he said stem from illegal immigration as the partial government shutdown triggered by his push for border wall funding hit Day 18.

Members of the media reacted almost immediately.

""I see the president's face but I hear Stephen Miller's voice,"" tweeted Maggie Haberman of The New York Times, referring to Trump's senior policy advisor who has defended shutting down the government for border security. (RELATED: See How The Shutdown Racks Up Against The Longest In History)

""How is this a call for bipartisanship?"" she added.

Other journalists appeared in network fact checks between Trump's address and Democrats' rebuttal.

""Just because you say it's a crisis doesn't necessarily make it one,"" Cecilia Vega of ABC News said, referencing Trump's characterization of the issue as a ""crisis at our southern border.""

Others called Trump racist.

""Sickening to hear Trump try to bait the Latino and Black communities with false, racist trope about immigrants taking jobs,"" tweeted CNN political commentator Karen Finney. ""If he really cared about people of color in the U.S. he would stop his nativist agenda and would've easily denounced the KKK in Charlottesville for starters.""

""Why is Trump asking for more money for his wall now that Democrats control the U.S. House than he did when the Republicans controlled everything? He needs to create a fight to distract from Muller Muller Muller Muller,"" Finney later tweeted.

Washington Post media reporter Erik Wemple found Trump's address to be more of the same.

""Looks like the White House secured major network TV time for an address that repeats all of the president's arguments on immigration, only, this time, through a TelePrompTer,"" Wemple wrote on Twitter.

The admission came during a wide-ranging conversation on Monday's edition of ""Cuomo Prime Time"" about the partial government shutdown and President Donald Trump's desire for border barrier funding to be included in any bill he signs.

Manchin also noted that border security could easily be funded by the $69 billion already passed ""for overseas contingency funding"" because Trump is ""cutting back in Afghanistan.""

""It doesn't have to come out of programs or out of more debt and that's what I have been saying,"" said Manchin. ""Use the money you have before you, in front of you. Use that money if we need to. But let's get a vote on fixing our immigration problem. We're going to go down this path every six months to every year it seems like."" (RELATED: Tucker Asks Liberal Radio Host If Wall Works In Israel)

""I'm just saying we have the money in the military,"" he added. ""The money is there in the military. If those people who don't want to spend money because it's being taken away from programs or adding more to debt, whatever the reason may be, we have already voted for over $40 billion for border security. We have voted many times. Chuck Schumer put a bill on the table with $25 billion for the dreamers or DACA. It's been out there many times.""

Diverting away from Trump and others' stated need for a border wall, Cuomo noted that the contention that ""we're a wall away from safety"" is ""not true.""

Both agreed on several things needed to make the border safe, including drones and more agents.

""There are so many things that we need to secure this border,"" said Manchin. ""But a fence or a secured border, a fencing of some sort is needed also.""

""Sure,"" Cuomo responded, but noted also that it is ""not a panacea."""

But before you wonder if I've taken leave of my senses, I should add that it's only in connection with his view that there will be a disturbing right-wing reaction if Britain makes a move towards a People's Vote.

Having spent three hours on the streets of Devizes, Wiltshire on Saturday helping to run a stall for our local People's Vote campaign and finding plenty of support, it was also clear that many Leave supporters are hardening their views.

And Ukip hasn't gone away. A couple of them were running their own stall nearby, given away shopping bags to their own support when I went round to have a friendly chat.

I was told, in the clearest of terms, that MPs like Anna Soubry were ""traitors"" because they weren't carrying out the wishes of their electorate. We all know the fate of traitors, so we're back in ""enemies of the people"" territory, with its encouragement to violence.

Farage and the Leave campaign, far from going away, are gearing up for what is going to be a deeply unpleasant fight.

If Theresa May's deal fails, Article 50 is extended and a People's Vote is finally seen as a way out of our current political morass, the gloves will be off.

So Grayling is right. But he's wrong in trying to frighten his colleagues and the rest of us into supporting May's deal. Not only is he Failing Grayling, he's also Gutless Grayling.

Instead of giving way to these people in a 2019 version of Project Fear, Farage and his ilk need to be challenged robustly.

To paraphrase Edmund Burke, the only thing necessary for the triumph of such people is that the rest of us do nothing.

Mired in lawsuits, President Trump is desperately seeking a diversion which prompted him to launch a fake national security crisis to build his beloved concrete-steel wall. All the major networks have concluded there is no danger at the border and the ""wall"" is merely a political stunt to fulfil his campaign promise much like his bogus claim that Mexico will pay for the wall.

Haunted by the ghosts of ""huge crowd sizes"" to celebrate his presidency and bogus claims of fake news, the delusional president is exhibiting his ""superb negotiating skills"" by pounding on the table to abruptly terminate his meeting with US House Speaker Pelosi and Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer.

His behaviour is reminiscent of former Russian president, Nikita Khrushchev, who disrupted a meeting of the United Nations General Assembly with several angry outbursts, pounding the table with both fists followed by removing his shoe and smashing it on the table.

Meanwhile, an enormous humanitarian crisis is unfolding with over 800,000 furloughed federal workers whose lives have been thrown into turmoil. Lifesaving critical care services have vanished. Food inspections no longer exist. Other government agencies are bereft of critical funding.

The House has passed a bill that would end the shutdown without funding the wall but Mitch McConnell, Senate majority leader is asleep at the wheel terrified he might offend the messianic Trump. Our adversaries, China and Russia are gleefully observing this chaos. It is time to end the shutdown NOW.

The news has shown President Trump chairing a crisis meeting which commenced with prayer.

In 1971 when we went into Europe, Brits presumed, as the longest-running democratic country, we were going to ""lead the continent"" and show Europe how to trade better with the rest of the world post-empire.

It was a chauvinistic, anti-expert, anti-statist approach. 45 years on, with waning influence in a huge EU, we are reverting to an anti-EU cartels, anti-experts and ""independence for the nation-state"" style.

As Theresa May stated in another context: ""nothing has changed"", except the rapidity of our deliquescence.

The grownups gave the kids a choice: ""Would you like chocolate cake or something else?""

52% of the kids voted for ""something else"".

The grown ups then discovered that what else was available was slightly more limited than might have been hoped.

They also had a range of different views, sometimes violently opposed, about just what that ""something else"" should be - what, as they put it, the kids really meant.

One thing, however, was absolutely clear to the grownups: it must be something other than chocolate cake. (They settled on liver; and, while some of the 52% really would have preferred chocolate cake, their faith in the grownups and the democratic system was secured.)

A new Congress has been sworn in and a new Speaker of the House is in place, but lawmakers and the White House are no closer to a deal to fully fund the government.

The partial government shutdown is now 14 days old.

Pelosi and her new majority in the House aren't budging.

Late Wednesday night, the House passed two bills to fully fund the government but did not include any additional funds for the wall.

The Hill: House approves legislation to reopen the government, defying Trump's opposition.

The Washington Post: Speaker secures her place as most powerful woman in politics.

The White House announced before those votes that the president will not sign the legislation, should it reach his desk.

""The Administration is committed to working with the Congress to reopen lapsed agencies, but cannot accept legislation that provides unnecessary funding for wasteful programs while ignoring the Nation's urgent border security needs."" -- Office of Management and Budget

Of course, there's no chance the House bill makes it to Trump's desk because Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnellAddison (Mitch) Mitchell McConnellHouse passes legislation to re-open government despite opposition from Trump Overnight Defense: Pompeo warns Iran against space launches | Top Army official makes surprise Afghanistan visit | Trump reportedly considering Jim Webb to replace Mattis Cracks beginning to show in GOP shutdown resolve MORE (R-Ky.) says the upper chamber, where Republicans hold a 53-47 majority, will not take it up.

""Let's not waste the time. Let's not get off on the wrong foot with House Democrats using their platform to produce political statements rather than serious solutions."" -- McConnell

Pelosi challenged the GOP-led Senate to break with Trump.

""What we're asking the Republicans in the Senate to do is to take 'yes' for an answer. We are sending them back exactly, word for word, what they have passed. Why would they not do that? Is it because the president won't sign it? Did they not hear about the coequal branch of government, and that we the Congress send the president legislation and he can choose to sign or not?"" -- Pelosi

There are cracks showing in McConnell's coalition, as lawmakers begin feeling pressure to come to an agreement.

That seems unlikely, as real-world tales of hardship and public disapproval pile up in hometown news reports across the country.

Some government workers, including at the Department of Homeland Security and at branches of the Armed Forces, such as the Coast Guard, will begin missing paychecks in the middle of January.

That won't go over well, and neither would delays in tax refunds.

The Wall Street Journal: In a shutdown, IRS will take your money, but give no refunds.

The Hill: Pain is coming from shutdown, except for Trump and Democrats.

Pelosi has invited Trump to give the State of the Union address on Jan. 29. That could be seen as a working deadline, as it seems unlikely that the president or Congress will want the national address to take place against the backdrop of a shutdown.

Polling over who bears the blame for the shutdown is sparse, but the principals on both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue will be keeping close tabs on the data as negotiations continue.

YouGov: Poll shows it's becoming Trump's shutdown.

HuffPost: Americans give everyone negative marks for government shutdown.

LEADING THE DAY

CONGRESS: Democrats in charge in the House moved swiftly Thursday to signal change in Congress and to put Trump on notice that he and his administration are firmly in the crosshairs.

The House voted 234-197 to approve a rules package that tackles the deficit, embraces diversity and establishes internal rules barring discrimination (The Hill). The measure passed largely along party lines despite misgivings among some progressives about its pay-as-you-go budget restrictions.

Fifteen Democrats voted against Pelosi to be Speaker, leaving no doubt about the challenges she faces within her party as Democrats build an agenda they say is not all about blocking, resisting and investigating Trump. The vote tally of Pelosi detractors is HERE.

Hours before claiming the gavel, Pelosi sought to pump the brakes on talk within her conference of impeaching Trump (The Hill). She was unsuccessful. A fellow California Democrat, Rep. Brad ShermanBradley (Brad) James ShermanRashida Tlaib calls to impeach Trump on her first day in Congress Jordan blasts Democrat for pursuing Trump impeachment on first day of new Congress House elects Pelosi to second Speakership MORE, immediately moved to introduce articles of impeachment against the president, including allegations of obstruction of justice (The Hill). Sixty-six House Democrats backed impeachment last year.

House Judiciary Committee Chairman Rep. Jerrold Nadler (D-N.Y.) introduced a measure to protect special counsel Robert MuellerRobert Swan MuellerSasse: US should applaud choice of Mueller to lead Russia probe MORE and his work from interference (The Hill). The language is similar to a bill that failed to advance under Republican control of the House last year (Bloomberg).

Also reintroduced: A Senate bill sponsored by Ron WydenRonald (Ron) Lee WydenOn The Money: Stocks plunge after Apple slashes earnings forecast | GOP senator calls on Congress to end shutdown without border deal | Trump's Fed attacks pose market risks Top Finance Dem reintroduces bill that would require Trump to release tax returns 'Medicare for all' advocates emboldened by ObamaCare lawsuit MORE (D-Ore.) to secure release of Trump's federal tax filings as a means of ""public transparency"" (The Hill). The president says he will not disclose his tax returns because he and the Trump Organization remain under audit by the IRS. (It is widely assumed that Mueller and his investigative team secured Trump's tax returns as part of the special counsel probe.)

On Thursday, House Democrats announced hearings on progressives' ""Medicare for all"" plan, which includes health care provisions that divide rather than unite the party (The Washington Post). Pelosi says she backs the hearings (The Hill).

Amid Thursday's ""Day One"" tumult, images popped up on social media hinting at some of the changes ahead for the House and Senate:

POLITICS: Trump on Thursday accused the Democrats of playing politics with the government shutdown, saying they're more concerned with staking out left-leaning positions ahead of the 2020 presidential cycle than finding common ground on spending.

The dynamics around the 2020 Democratic presidential primary are beginning to take shape, with endorsements rolling in, even for candidates who have yet to declare.

Dianne FeinsteinDianne Emiel FeinsteinSenate GOP names first female members to Judiciary panel The Hill's 12:30 Report: Opening day for the 116th Congress | Dems take control of House | Historic day for Pelosi Feinstein urges Biden to run in 2020 MORE (D-Calif.) is sticking with the old guard, backing former Vice President Joe BidenJoseph (Joe) Robinette BidenThe 15 Democrats who voted against Pelosi McAuliffe: Voters want 'realistic alternative' to Trump's policies The Hill's 12:30 Report: Opening day for the 116th Congress | Dems take control of House | Historic day for Pelosi MORE, who is weighing a potential third bid for the White House (Politico).

WHITE HOUSE: Council of Economic Advisers Chairman Kevin Hassett predicted other U.S. companies will join Apple in lowering earnings projections because of China's ebbing economic engine, further weakened by trade frictions with the United States (Bloomberg).

""It's not going to be just Apple. There are a heck of a lot of U.S. companies that have sales in China that are going to be watching their earnings being downgraded next year until we get a deal with China."" -- Hassett

Trump defended his China trade policy as financial markets reacted with alarm to the Apple news. Technology stocks suffered their worst losses in seven years (The Associated Press).

Reuters: Weak sales at Apple and Cargill, U.S. giants of technology and agriculture, may be the clearest sign yet that Trump's quest to reset world trade carries costs at home.

The State Department chose Thursday to publish a travel advisory about China: ""Exercise increased caution in China due to arbitrary enforcement of local laws as well as special restrictions on dual U.S.-Chinese nationals. Chinese authorities have asserted broad authority to prohibit U.S. citizens from leaving China by using 'exit bans,' sometimes keeping U.S. citizens in China for years. China uses exit bans coercively.""

According to a Morning Consult poll published Wednesday, which began surveying registered voters just as the news of the partial government shutdown hit the news, Trump's resilience among the GOP faithful is not reflected in the 39 percent score that he received overall -- a number that is reminiscent of public attitudes during the fallout from the Charlottesville riots in August 2017.

Overall, the respondents expressed pessimism that Trump could secure funding for the border wall -- which remains the president's chief objective in the standoff with the Democratic Party leadership -- with 54 percent of Republicans and 64 percent of general voters expressing doubt that Trump could win this battle.

Of those polled who said they voted for Trump in the 2016 election, that number drops to 38 percent. On Christmas Day, Trump told reporters that the government would stay in its current holding pattern until funding for the wall is secured. On Wednesday, Washington Post icon Bob Woodward told CNN, ""it's a governing crisis,"" in reference to the shutdown.

Respondents said they were aware of the government shutdown and the Congressional impasse, with 78 percent indicating they had received ""some"" news of the situation. When asked how much they had heard about the shutdown, 39 percent responded with ""a lot."" (RELATED: Poll: Trump Approval Rating At All Time High)

51,the hill,https://thehill.com/blogs/floor-action/scheduling/423281-this-week-shutdown-showdown-looms-over-new-congress,"Lawmakers are returning to Washington for the start of the 116th Congress with no end in sight to the partial government shutdown.

Though the new session doesn't start until Thursday, the Senate is expected to return on Wednesday afternoon -- the last day Republicans will control both chambers. The House has yet to flesh out any plans before Thursday, but outgoing GOP leadership is giving members 24 hours notice before any vote.

But with no signs of movement toward an agreement to fully reopen the government since Congress missed the Dec. 21 deadline any progress is likely to wait until at least Thursday. Lawmakers and administration say they are not close to a deal that would fund roughly 25 percent of the federal government, including the Department of Homeland Security.

Sen. Richard ShelbyRichard Craig ShelbyImmigration is pressure point for both sides in shutdown showdown Senate Appropriations Committee chair: Congress looks 'silly' amid shutdown Trump's Fed feud roils markets, alarms Republicans MORE (R-Ala.), the chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee, warned on Sunday that the partial shutdown ""could last a long, long time"" and that the negotiations are ""at an impasse at the moment.""

""At the end of the day, all of this will end. We don't know when, in negotiations. It's not a question of who wins or loses. Nobody's going to win this kind of game. Nobody wins in a shutdown. We all lose and we kind of look silly,"" Shelby told CBS's ""Face the Nation.""

The administration has tried to shift the blame to Democrats, including playing up the idea of a split between members of Democratic leadership. Trump, in a tweet over the weekend, said that he was in ""White House waiting for the Democrats to come on over and make a deal on Border Security.""

But Trump -- who said earlier this month that he would accept the ""mantle"" of a shutdown -- also indicated late last week and over the weekend that Republicans were using the ""hard way,"" a shutdown, to try to get the wall funding, and that he believed the fight will benefit him in his 2020 campaign.

""For those that naively ask why didn't the Republicans get approval to build the Wall over the last year, it is because IN THE SENATE WE NEED 10 DEMOCRAT VOTES, and they will gives us 'NONE' for Border Security! Now we have to do it the hard way, with a Shutdown. Too bad!,"" Trump said in a tweet on Saturday.

Trump separately said in a tweet late last week that Democrats ""may have the 10 Senate votes, but we have the issue, Border Security. 2020!""

The crux of the entrenched stalemate on funding part of the government is money for Trump's U.S.-Mexico border wall. Trump has demanded $5 billion for the wall, an amount approved by House Republicans earlier this month.

But that amount is dead on arrival in the Senate. Trump and Republicans will lose control of the House, and a key source of leverage, on Thursday when Democrats take back control of the House.

A spokesman for Pelosi pledged in a recent tweet that Democrats would ""act swiftly to end the Trump Shutdown"" and advocate for a policy that includes ""strong and smart border security.""

The floor drama will be the first chance for the new House majority to flex their political muscles after attempts by Democratic lawmakers to force votes on funding legislation that did not include funding for Trump's border wall were blocked by GOP leadership over the holidays.

House Minority Whip Steny HoyerSteny Hamilton HoyerHoyer: Democrats won't seat NC Republican amid election fraud investigation Dem rep after visiting migrant camps: It's like watching an episode of 'Locked Up Abroad' Dem leaders vow investigations after latest death of migrant child in US custody MORE (D-Md.) noted that they tried to offer a Senate-passed stopgap bill to fund part of the government through Feb. 8 but were blocked, adding that Democrats had ""already compromised"" on the border.

[Republicans] have got a history of using the shutdown of government as a strategy to get what they want. We are fully prepared to support the bill that came over from the Senate,"" Hoyer said.

Passing either a short-term continuing resolution (CR) or a larger bill to fund the remaining 25 percent of the federal government through Sept. 30, the end of the 2019 fiscal year, would kick the fight back to the Senate.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnellAddison (Mitch) Mitchell McConnellTrump's shifting Cabinet to introduce new faces No signs of talks as shutdown moves into second week Dem-led House must lead cleanup of Trump-made mess MORE (R-Ky.) has publicly taken a backseat in the shutdown fight, arguing in the wake of the partial closure that working out an agreement was between Trump, whose signature they need, and Democrats, whose votes are needed.

But if the House was able to pass a bill it would add new political pressure on McConnell, who has repeatedly warned repeatedly against shutting down the government. But moving a bill that didn't have Trump's support would open up himself and other Republican senators to attacks from the mercurial president.

McConnell has hinted Trump's support is needed for a vote in the Republican-controlled Senate. And GOP senators say they think it's unlikely the chamber would move forward on a bill without the president, after Trump caught them flat footed earlier this month when he rejected the Senate-passed CR.

""I think Senator McConnell our leader has already addressed that. That said that he would not even take up the bill until he found some compromise that the President would agree to sign. So we're going to be at an impasse. That would be probably an empty gesture, but that goes on in Washington every day,"" Shelby said, asked what would happen if the House passed the bill early next month.

Democrats have warned that $1.3 billion is their cap on negotiations and that it would go toward fencing, not a concrete wall. Outgoing White House chief of staff John KellyJohn Francis KellyMORE told the Los Angeles Times that the administration had moved away from the concept of a literal wall early in the Trump administration.

Trump is edging closer to declaring a national emergency to circumvent Congress and build a wall, a step that could start a court fight with Democrats.

Negotiations between the two sides have not been fruitful. Trump stormed out of a Wednesday meeting at the White House and called it a ""total waste of time.""

The shutdown will become the longest in U.S. history on Saturday.

In their comments on the floor ahead of the vote, both sides dug in hard.

TGIF! The government shutdown clock is at 21 days, tied with the record for longest government shutdown in history.

Welcome to Overnight Energy, The Hill's roundup of the latest energy and environment news.

VA DEM ADDS SUPPORT TO GREEN NEW DEAL: Democratic Rep. Don Beyer (Va.) is throwing his support behind the progressive climate change vision known as the Green New Deal, and he thinks a carbon tax should be its driving policy.

""A Green New Deal would use major infrastructure investments and policy changes to rapidly shift the U.S. economy towards clean energy solutions and away from greenhouse gas emissions in a way that grows employment in the green economy. This is an idea whose time has come, and I fully support it,"" Beyer said in a statement to the Hill Friday.

""I believe that the scientific reports issued in recent months make it unequivocally clear that we need ambitious ideas to address climate change very urgently.""

The lawmaker, who will soon sit on the House Ways and Means Committee -- the chief tax-writing panel -- said he hopes to use his new seat to push ambitious climate change policies to address global warming and the need to shrink carbon emissions.

To do so, he's looking to promote a bill he previously introduced that would limit carbon emissions and create a trading program.

""I think a smart way to help drive that transition would be to create an economic mechanism that would rapidly elevate wind, solar and other clean energy and phase out carbon pollution while minimizing the negative effects on American families,"" Beyer said.

Beyer introduced the Healthy Climate and Family Security Act last year with 36 Democratic co-sponsors. Sen. Chris Van Hollen (D-Md.) introduced companion legislation in the Senate.

Under the bill, the Department of Transportation would cap carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuel power plants and create a carbon trading program. Fuel suppliers and processors would have to purchase carbon permits equal to the amount of CO2 they emit from the Treasury, which would auction off the permits. The revenue generated from the auction would then be distributed back to U.S. households in the form of a dividend as a type of stimulus, according to the bill.

""I have just been appointed to the Ways and Means Committee, which would have jurisdiction over any carbon pricing legislation. I plan to use that appointment to push for legislative solutions to climate change, including ideas expressed in a Green New Deal,"" Beyer said.

GRIJALVA BACKS BISHOP FOR INTERIOR SECRETARY OVER ACTING HEAD: Rep. Raúl Grijalva (D-Ariz.), the chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee, on Friday said he supports the committee's ranking member Rep. Rob BishopRobert (Rob) William BishopGrijalva backs Bishop over current acting Interior Secretary Dems question legality of park fees during shutdown Statehood for Puerto Rico must be in the 116th Congress' agenda MORE (R-Utah), to be the new Interior Secretary, saying he was better than other candidates because ""He doesn't carry the legal baggage or conflicts.""

David Bernhardt is currently serving as acting secretary.

Grijalva says that while he and Bishop don't always see eye to eye, he backs Bishop because he thinks that Bishop is ""ethical.""

""His philosophy and ours obviously don't match up,"" Grijalva said to The Hill. ""But, I have to put a but in there ... he's ethical. And he doesn't carry the legal baggage or conflicts -- the pretty obvious conflicts others have.""

The lawmaker said those conflicts clearly existed in former Interior Secretary Ryan ZinkeRyan Keith ZinkeGrijalva backs Bishop over current acting Interior Secretary Dems question legality of park fees during shutdown House panel to 'demand answers' on Interior's move to use visitor fees to keep parks open MORE, who departed the agency Jan. 2 amid multiple ethics investigations, and in Bernhardt.

Bernhardt is a former energy lobbyist. He and Bishop, who chaired the House Natural Resources Committee for the past eight years, are the reported frontrunners to take over for Zinke.

""In that sense, it would be a plus for Interior, to know you're dealing with a philosophical zealot but you're not dealing with somebody who has compromised themselves legally or ethically,"" Grijalva said of Bishop.

In his role as chairman, Bishop championed rolling back protections on threatened and endangered species, supported the idea of expanding oil and gas drilling on public land and believed states should have more authority to determine how federal lands were used -- all ideas that Grijalva staunchly objected.

Conversely, Bernhardt served for months as Zinke's number two often taking the lede on crafting administrative rules, including a plan to open up drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge.

Grijalva's comments pointedly addressed Zinke, who remains under investigation by the Interior's Office of Inspector General for two ethics charges related to a real estate deal where he partnered with the then-chairman of oil services company Haliburton, and another instance where he decided against green-lighting a Native American tribe's plan to build a casino in Connecticut.

The Department of Justice is reportedly investigating Zinke for lying to investigators over one of those cases.

Zinke and Grijalva entered into an online skirmish at the end of last year that resulted in the secretary calling the lawmaker a drunk.

Wheeler will head to Capitol Hill Wednesday for his confirmation hearing in front of the Senate Environment and Public Works Committee to be the EPA's official administrator.

Expect the hearing to be an examination of the Trump administration's policies at the EPA. Democrats are likely to press him on major regulatory rollbacks on air pollution, climate change and water rules, while the GOP will likely highlight his work to help businesses.

Wheeler was already confirmed last year to be the deputy administrator, and he used to be a senior staffer at the Environment Committee.

53,cbs news,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/shutdown-suspends-cleanups-at-superfund-sites/,"BIRMINGHAM, Ala. -- The government shutdown has suspended federal cleanups at Superfund sites around the nation and forced the cancellation of public hearings, deepening the mistrust and resentment of surrounding residents who feel people in power long ago abandoned them to live among the toxic residue of the country's factories and mines.

""We are already hurting, and it's just adding more fuel to the fire,"" says 40-year-old Keisha Brown, whose wood-frame home is in a community nestled among coking plants and other factories on Birmingham's north side.

The mostly African-American community has been forced to cope with high levels of arsenic, lead and other contaminants in the soil that the Environmental Protection Agency has been scraping up and carting away, house by house.

As President Trump and Congress battle over Trump's demand for a wall on the southern U.S. border, the nearly 3-week-old partial government shutdown has stopped federal work on Superfund sites except for cases where the administration deems ""there is an imminent threat to the safety of human life or to the protection of property.""

EPA's shutdown plans said the agency would evaluate about 800 Superfund sites to see how many could pose an immediate threat. As an example of that kind of threat, it cited an acid leak from a mine that could threaten the public water supply. That's the hazard at Northern California's Iron Mountain mine, where EPA workers help prevent an unending flow of lethally acidic runoff off the Superfund site from spilling into rivers downstream.

Practically speaking, said Bonnie Bellow, a former EPA official who worked on Superfund public outreach at the agency, the impact of the stoppage of work at sites across the nation ""wholly depends"" on the length of the shutdown.

""Unless there is immediate risk like a storm, a flood, a week or two of slowdowns is not going to very likely affect the cleanup at the site,"" Bellow said.

In north Birmingham, Brown said it's been a couple of weeks since she's spotted any EPA crews at people's houses. It wasn't clear if state workers or contractors were continuing work.

But long before the shutdown began, Brown harbored doubts the cleanup was working anyway. ""My main concern is the health of the people out here,"" said Brown, who has asthma. ""All of us are sick, and we've got to function on medicine every day.""

In terms of time, the federal government shutdown is a chronological blip in the long history of the site -- which includes ethics charges in a local bribery scandal to block federal cleanup efforts -- but adds to the uncertainty in an area where residents feel forgotten and betrayed.

At the EPA, the shutdown has furloughed the bulk of the agency's roughly 14,000 employees. It also means the EPA isn't getting most of the daily stream of environmental questions and tips from the public. Routine inspections aren't happening. State, local and private emails to EPA officials often get automated messages back promising a response when the shutdown ends.

In Montana, for instance, state officials this month found themselves fielding calls from a tribal member worried about drinking water with a funny look to it, said Kristi Ponozzo, public-policy director at that state's Department of Environmental Quality. The EPA normally provides tribes with technical assistance on water supplies.

With most EPA colleagues idled, Ponozzo said, her agency also had to call off an environmental review meeting for a mining project, potentially delaying the project.

But it's the agency's work at Superfund sites -- lessening the threat from old nuclear-weapons plants, chemical factories, mines and other entities -- that gets much of the attention.

Absent imminent peril, it would be up to state governments or contractors to continue any cleanup during the shutdown ""up to the point that additional EPA direction or funding is needed,"" the EPA said in a statement.

""Sites where cleanup activities have been stopped or shut down will be secured until cleanup activities are able to commence when the federal government reopens,"" the agency said.

For federal Superfund sites in Michigan, the shutdown means there are no EPA colleagues to consult, said Scott Dean, a spokesman for that state's Department of Environmental Quality.

At Michigan Superfund sites, day-to-day field operations were continuing since private contractors do most of the on-the-ground work, Dean said.

Bellow, the former EPA official, said the cancellation of hearings about Superfund sites posed immediate concerns.

In East Chicago, Indiana, for example, the EPA called off a planned public hearing set for last Wednesday to outline how the agency planned to clean up high levels of lead and arsenic in the soil.

The EPA has proposed a seven-month, $26.5 million cleanup that includes treating and removing tainted soil from the area, where a lead smelter previously was located.

During a public meeting Nov. 29, some residents complained that the EPA's approach would leave too much pollution in place. But others didn't get a chance to speak and were hoping to do so at the meeting this week, said Debbie Chizewer, a Northwestern University environmental attorney who represents community groups in the low-income area.

The EPA announced the cancellation in an online notice and gave no indication that it would be rescheduled.

Leaders of the East Chicago Calumet Community Advisory Group asked for a new hearing date and an extension of a Jan. 14 public comment deadline in a letter to the EPA's regional Superfund division.

Calls by The Associated Press to the agency's regional office in Chicago this week were not answered.

Local critics fear the EPA will use the delay caused by the shutdown as justification for pushing ahead with a cleanup strategy they consider flawed, Chizewer said, even though the agency has designated the affected area as an ""environmental justice community"" -- a low-income community of color that has been disproportionately harmed by pollution.

The EPA has a ""special obligation"" when dealing with such communities, Chizewer said. ""This would be an example of shutting them out for no good reason.""

In North Birmingham, former longtime neighborhood resident Charlie Powell said most of people living in and around the Superfund site had already ""just got tired and fed up.""

Powell left the area but started a group called PANIC, People Against Neighborhood Industrial Contamination. He believes money would be better spent helping residents move away from the pollution.

""Can I say hell?"" Powell said when asked what residents have been through.

54,the daily caller,https://dailycaller.com/2018/12/21/gofundme-border-wall-troubles/,"Trump and congressional Democrats appear ready to enter a government shutdown over funding for the wall's construction.

A crowdfunding campaign to pay for a proposed border wall between the U.S. and Mexico is raking in millions of dollars by the day, but can the government actually use the money?

""We The People Will Fund The Wall"" is the name of a GoFundMe page dedicated to raising cash to construct President Donald Trump's wall on the U.S. southern border. The crowdfunding effort witnessed remarkable attention since Brian Kolfage, a triple-amputee Iraq veteran, launched the page Sunday. As of publication of this article, the GoFundMe campaign raised almost $13 million from more than 210,000 people.

""This is the United States and we can do anything we want,"" Kolfage said Thursday night on Fox News. ""If people want to donate to that wall and give their money, they can do it.""

The Purple Heart veteran said he's received support and donations from Republicans and Democrats alike.

The campaign hasn't only attracted small-dollar donations. A few people dropped considerable amounts of cash, with several donations totaling $10,000 or more, and the highest single contribution being $50,000.

However, there are mounting questions over whether the GoFundMe cash can actually go toward construction of a border wall. Kolfage assured donors that 100 percent the money will be used for the wall's construction. If not, he says every single penny will be reimbursed.

""We have contacted the Trump Administration to secure a point of contact where all the funds will go upon completion. When we get this information secured we will update,"" Kolfage wrote in the description page, adding that his group will cover ""all legal aspects"" before releasing any of the money.

The ""legal aspects"" remain unclear. Private citizens are allowed to raise money for the federal government, but they cannot specifically direct the government how to spend those funds.

A citizen can make a general donation to the U.S. government that is placed into a ""Gifts to the United Sate"" fund and be used for ""general use,"" according to the Treasury Department. Approval from Congress would be needed before the GoFundMe cash could be directed to the Department of Homeland Security.

Kolfage said his group is working with a law firm on several possible options to ensure sure the funds go toward the wall. Republican Mississippi Rep. Steve Palazzo, for example, introduced legislation that would allow for private funding of the border wall. The Border Bonds for America Act of 2018 would let citizens purchase revenue bonds to finance the wall's construction.

""In November of 2016, Americans voted for better border security and as Vice-Chairman of the Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee, I believe this legislation allows new alternatives for our citizens to support their values and defend our homeland,"" Palazzo said in a Monday press release. (RELATED: Roberts Joins Liberals, Thwarts Trump Bid To Enforce New Asylum Rules)

GoFundMe rules stipulate that money raised must go toward the advertised caused. If not, all funds must be given back to donors -- a rule Kolfage pledged to follow.

Meanwhile, Trump and congressional Democrats appear to be headed for a government shutdown over the border wall funding fight. The president indicated he is prepared for a drawn-out battle to secure funding, and doesn't mind if a shutdown occurs.

""We are totally prepared for a very long shut down. This is our only chance that we will ever have in our opinion,"" he said at a bill-signing ceremony Friday.

Fox News host Shannon Bream introduced Graham as having ""three words for Republicans on the border wall, 'let's dig in,'"" then asked the South Carolina senator where things are headed next.

""Number one, when you make a promise to the American people, you should keep it,"" Graham responded. ""The one thing I like about President Trump, he is trying his best to keep his promise. He promised to build a wall, and he is going to fight hard to keep that promise. After the caravan, if you don't see the need for more border security, you are blind. Here's the problem. I think Democrats hate Trump so much they want him to lose, even though it would be good for the country to work with him on border security. And if he doesn't break 'em now, it's going to be a terrible 2019. So Mr. President, dig in.""

The two discussed a possible compromise to make it a ""win-win"" -- somewhere ""less than"" the $5 billion Trump is asking for but more than $1.6 billion Democrats have offered.

""If they are not willing to work with the president, I think they are going to hear it from the American people in 2020,"" Graham said. (RELATED: Liberal Radio Host's Response To Tucker's Question About Whether A Wall Works In Israel Says Everything About Their Argument)

""I don't think I am thought of up here is some radical guy,"" the South Carolina senator added, ""but if you don't see the need for more border security, then you are just not paying attention. The president of the United States is right to want more money to secure our borders, to build the wall as part of border security. Democrats are wrong to act like children, to say you can't get a penny more.""

Stating that he's glad the president ""picked this fight,"" Graham predicted that Trump would eventually win.

""He just needs to make the case that the border needs to be better secured, the money I'm asking for can be well spent. And here is what I find odd, Democrats will spend money on almost anything except a wall that we need.""

""We are not sure how this ends,"" responded Bream.

""I will tell you how it ends,"" said Graham. ""President Trump is going to get more money for the border."""

Trump, who made the comment on Twitter, wrote in a second tweet that Democrats could ""end the Shutdown in 15 minutes"" and claimed that they are to blame for the funding lapse, which was sparked by demands that legislation include more than $5 billion for his long-promised border wall.

""I've been waiting all weekend. Democrats must get to work now. Border must be secured!"" he tweeted.

Schumer made clear in public comments Saturday, in addition to several times in the past week, that Democrats will not provide any money for Trump's border wall, which he has bashed as ineffective and a waste of money.

Republicans acknowledged on Sunday morning that Schumer is unlikely to give any ground and predicted that Trump probably won't back down either until Democrats take control of the House on Jan. 3.

The White House announced Saturday that Trump would cancel his Christmas vacation at his Mar-a-Lago resort in South Florida so he can stay in Washington for the shutdown.

""He says it's an issue of border security. I think we know better. It's an issue of his own political insecurity. When the right-wingers start screaming at him, he just backs off and dissembles in front of us,"" he said.

Toomey, however, offered the optimistic assessment ""it probably gets resolved quickly.""

If there was any glimmer of hope Sunday morning, it was the possibility that two sides might agree on a border security number and just disagree on how to describe its purpose.

Mulvaney said the president could accept a compromise over a fence-like structure, such as a steel slat barrier, a design of which Trump tweeted out last week.

""Now, what one people call a wall and another person might call a fence,"" he said.

Durbin said Democrats would be willing to support investing more in technology and border patrol personnel to tighten to limit the flow of drugs into the country.

He said experts agree that those investments are ""needed desperately and quickly.""

""The president ought to be sitting down with us and making this border more secure by making investments. He'll have Democrats onboard,"" he said."
58,rolling stone,https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/trump-russia-collusion-timeline-779262/,"President Trump's scheme to hold 800,000 federal employees hostage over border wall funding has dominated news coverage since the government began operating under a partial shutdown on December 21st, but Special Counsel Robert Mueller is still busy looking into his campaign's relationship with Russian President Vladimir Putin and the Kremlin. So is the media. On Friday, the New York Times reported that after Trump fired James Comey in May 2017, the FBI opened a counterintelligence investigation to determine whether the president was working on behalf of Russia. Trump responded by attacking the Times, claiming that he's been tougher on Russia than any present in recent history. A few days later, the Times reported that Trump ""repeatedly"" discussed pulling the United States out of NATO, an unconscionable move that would have defied advisers and delighted Putin, who has sought nothing more than to break up the alliance of Western nations.

In between the two stories came another revelation, this one from the Washington Post, which reported that Trump went out of his way to hide the details of his meetings with Putin. After convening with the Russian leader for the first time at the G-20 summit in Hamburg, Germany, in 2017, Trump even took his interpreter's notes and instructed her not to discuss the meeting with any administration officials.

On Monday, Andrew S. Weiss of the Carnegie Endowment connected the dots between the Post's story and what has already been revealed about Trump's efforts to conceal the nature of this relationship with Russia.

What Weiss goes on to lay out is startling. On the morning of July 7th, the New York Times informed the White House that it was preparing to publish a story about Donald Trump, Jr. meeting with Russians at Trump Tower prior to the election. The paper wanted a comment. That afternoon, Trump met with Putin for the first time, alongside then-Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Russian foreign affairs minister Sergey Lavrov. It was after this meeting, the Post reported on Sunday, that Trump took his interpreter's notes and told her not to discuss the meeting with other senior administration officials.

During dinner that night, Trump had a second, informal summit with Putin. Only Putin's interpreter was present. This meeting was not made public until days later, when Eurasia Group president Ian Bremmer wrote in a memo to clients that Trump got up from his seat halfway into dinner and found Putin, with whom he spoke ""privately and animatedly"" for close to an hour. The White House didn't officially confirm the second meeting until July 18th.

The same day the White House acknowledged the meeting, Trump wrote on Twitter that the ""Fake News story of secret dinner with Putin is 'sick'"" and that the ""press knew"" about the dinner. ""Press didn't know you spent an hour during dinner in 1-1 discussion w Putin (& his translator),"" replied Bremmer. ""Other G20 leaders found it...unusual.""

The next day, while flying home to Washington, Trump dictated the statement Trump, Jr. provided to the Times to explain the Trump Tower meeting. The statement claimed that Trump, Jr. and Natalya Veselnitskaya, a Russian lawyer with deep connections to the Kremlin, ""primarily discussed a program about the adoption of Russian children."" Trump later claimed that this is what he got up to covertly speak with Putin about during dinner, for nearly an hour. The statement did not mention that the meeting was arranged for Trump, Jr. to receive damaging information on Hillary Clinton, which was reported by the Times a few days later.

Taking what is known, it's almost impossible to believe that during the second meeting Trump and Putin did not discuss a way for the campaign to respond to what Trump had just found out earlier that day: that the Times knew about his son's meeting with a Kremlin-connected lawyer who had promised damaging information on Hillary Clinton.

On Monday night, Jack Weiss, a former federal prosecutor who helped his brother Andrew compile the Twitter thread piecing this together, went on CNN to discuss what they'd found. ""You put all that together, and for me as a former federal prosecutor, it's the crucible,"" he said. ""It's the crucible when your defendants, your targets, are getting found out. What do they do when they learn that someone's onto them, as the New York Times was onto them and notified the White House the morning of July 7th?

Trump has denied knowing about the Trump Tower meeting ahead of time, but this is dubious. Shortly after Trump, Jr. secured the meeting, he received a call from Emin Agalarov, a client of Rob Goldstone, who arranged the meeting, and whose father was connected to the Russian government. After the call ended, Trump Jr. placed a call to a private number. After that call ended, he called Agalrov back. When Trump Jr. was asked to whom the private number belonged by the Senate Judiciary Committee, he said, ""I have no idea."" In separate testimony former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski said that Trump uses a private number. When Trump Jr. was asked if this was true, he said he didn't know.

""Republicans refused to look at the phone records so that we could find out [who the caller was] because they were afraid of what the answer might be,"" Rep. Adam Schiff (D-CA) told USA Today in November. Schiff, who is now the chair of the House Intelligence Committee, has said he plans to investigate the nature of the call. If records show Trump was on the other end of the line, it would be the most air-tight evidence yet that Trump participated in his campaign's collusion with Russia. But even if Trump Jr. was ordering pizza, the evidence is already close to insurmountable. There can only be so many coincidences."
59,cbs news,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/sunday-miller-klobuchar-davis-potter/,"Friday evening, President Trump turned to Twitter to name Office of Management and Budget chief Mick Mulvaney his pick for acting White House chief of staff.

Fierce speculation had abounded over the president's replacement for John Kelly, after several top contenders made their disinterest for the role clear. Mulvaney will now face steep challenges in the new post, highlighted this week by another torrent of harrowing headlines for the president.

Earlier Friday, the special counsel rebuked Michael Flynn's suggestion that FBI agents duped the former intelligence agency head into lying.

""He does not need to be warned it is a crime to lie to federal agents, to know the importance of telling them the truth,"" Mueller probe attorneys chided in a court filing.

In his own Twitter attacks, President Trump has echoed the argument from his former national security adviser, bashing federal investigators for trying ""to scare everybody into making up stories.""

But the president's wrath has apparently done little to slow prosecutors in his own Justice Department, which this week secured a guilty plea from Russian spy Maria Butina, scored a three year sentence for longtime Trump fixer Michael Cohen, and reportedly opened a potential new front of Trump scrutiny: foreign donations to his inaugural fund.

In the Senate on Thursday, several Republicans broke with the Trump administration to pass bipartisan resolutions condemning Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman for the murder of Jamal Khashoggi and calling for an end of U.S. support for the Kingdom's bloody war in Yemen.

And in the House, prospects for President Trump's demands for billions in border wall funding have dimmed in the wake of his fiery encounter Tuesday with House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer.

""I will take the mantle. I will be the one to shut it down,"" the president had told the duo.

The president's border funding fight was made thornier Friday by news a child had perished in the Border Patrol's custody, triggering immediate criticism from Democrats and calls for an investigation.

Speaking with the press Friday, White House spokesperson Hogan Gidley mourned Jackeline Caal, appearing to blame her father and current immigration laws for the 7-year-old Guatemalan girl's ""horrific, tragic situation.""

""Does the administration take responsibility for a parent taking a child on a trek through Mexico to get to this country?"" Gidley asked.

60,the independent,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-jim-mattis-border-wall-government-shutdown-flipping-out-syria-withdrawal-conservatives-a8693916.html,"President Donald Trump began Thursday under siege, listening to howls of indignation from conservatives over his border wall and thrusting the government towards a shutdown. He ended it by announcing the exit of the man US allies see as the last guardrail against the president's erratic behaviour: Defence Secretary Jim Mattis, whose resignation letter was a scathing rebuke of Mr Trump's world-view.

At perhaps the most fragile moment of his presidency - and vulnerable to convulsions on the political right - Mr Trump single-handedly propelled the US government into crisis and sent markets tumbling with his gambits this week to salvage signature campaign promises.

The president's decisions and conduct have led to a fracturing of Mr Trump's coalition. Hawks condemned his sudden decision to withdraw US troops from Syria. Conservatives called him a ""gutless president"" and questioned whether he would ever build a wall. Political friends began privately questioning whether Mr Trump needed to be reined in.

After campaigning on shrinking America's footprint in overseas wars, Mr Trump abruptly declared on Wednesday that he was withdrawing US troops from Syria, a move Mr Mattis and other advisers counselled against. And officials said on Thursday that Mr Trump is preparing to send thousands of troops home from Afghanistan as well.

The president also issued an ultimatum to Congress to fund construction of his promised US-Mexico border wall, a move poised to result in a government shutdown just before Christmas. Mr Trump and his aides had signalled tacit support for a short-term spending compromise that would avert the shutdown, but the president abruptly changed course after absorbing a deluge of criticism from some of his most high-profile loyalists.

Leon Panetta, who served as former defence secretary, CIA director and White House chief of staff for Democratic presidents, said, ""We're in a constant state of chaos right now in this country."" He added, ""While it may satisfy [Trump's] need for attention, it's raising hell with the country.""

Mr Panetta said the resignation of Mr Mattis is a singular moment and his letter, which underscores how Mr Mattis sees Mr Trump's approach as misguided, ""puts the security of the nation right now at some degree of risk.""

Mr Trump has been isolated in bunker mode in recent weeks as political and personal crises mount, according to interviews with 27 current and former White House officials, Republican lawmakers and outside advisers to the president, some of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity to offer candid assessments.

""There's going to be an intervention,"" one former senior administration official said speculatively. ""Jim Mattis just sent a shot across the bow. He's the most credible member of the administration by five grades of magnitude. He's the steady, safe set of hands. And this letter is brutal. He quit because of the madness.""

In his resignation letter, Mr Mattis wrote, ""My views on treating allies with respect and also being clear-eyed about malign actors and strategic competitors are strongly held and informed by over four decades of immersion in these issues . . . Because you have the right to a Secretary of Defence whose views are better aligned with yours on these and other subjects, I believe it is right for me to step down from my position.""

Although Mr Trump's relationship with Mr Mattis has been rocky for months, the president spent the first part of Thursday focused on another fraying relationship: with his conservative base.

On Thursday, as criticism over his capitulation on the wall grew louder by the hour, Mr Trump complained to friends and aides that he felt politically shackled. He had no plan, but was spoiling for a fight. By midday, the president picked one.

""I've made my position very clear: Any measure that funds the government must include border security. Has to,"" Mr Trump said on Thursday. He added he had ""no choice"" but to act.

Mr Trump's advisers acknowledged the funding may not be secured in the end, but boasted that the spectacle would be remembered favourably by his base voters as proof of his mettle. A wall funding proposal was approved by the House late on Thursday, but faced uncertain prospects in the Senate.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky, habitually careful in his approach to Mr Trump, avoided strong-arming the president in their recent exchanges, knowing that urging him to stand down on the wall funding likely would only embolden him, according to two people familiar with the discussions. At every turn, Mr McConnell confided to Mr Trump that congressional efforts this month - from the passage of the farm bill to bipartisan criminal-justice reform - were a string of victories for him, the people said.

Thanks to Mr McConnell's soothing, there was cautious optimism that the president would eventually sign a funding bill. ""McConnell has a lot to do with it, of course. They talk a lot,"" Representative Harold Rogers, R-Ky, said. ""It's smart to save the fight for another day.""

House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis, - busy this week bidding farewell to Congress after two decades in office - followed Mr McConnell's playbook, pointing out how Mr Trump would be able to battle for wall funding in the new year, a person close to him said.

Both Mr Ryan and House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif, told Mr Trump last week they could not pass a spending bill with $5 billion for wall construction, and Mr McConnell was told by the White House that Mr Trump would sign a short-term bill without it, according to two people familiar with the conversations.

But on Fox News Channel and across conservative media, there was a brewing rebellion. Prominent voices urged Mr Trump to hold firm on his wall money and warned caving would jeopardise his re-election.

Rush Limbaugh dismissed the compromise bill on his radio program as ""Trump gets nothing and the Democrats get everything."" Another firebrand, Ann Coulter, published a column titled, ""Gutless President in Wall-less Country."" Mr Trump even found resistance on the couch of his favourite show, Fox & Friends, where reliable Trump-boosting host Brian Kilmeade chided him on the air on Thursday.

The president was paying attention. He promptly unfollowed Ms Coulter on Twitter. And he pecked out a series of defensive tweets blaming congressional leaders for not funding the wall, while also staking a defensive posture. He suggested a massive wall may not be necessary in its entirety because the border already is ""tight"" thanks to the work of Border Patrol agents and troops.

""One of the things he's most vulnerable to is mockery and mockery by his own supporters,"" said Mark Krikorian, a leading anti-immigration activist.

Members of the conservative House Freedom Caucus joined in the rebellion. During House votes on Wednesday evening, caucus chair Representative Mark Meadows, R-NC, and other members refused to budge and held court with reporters, railing against the Republican leadership and warning Mr Trump he was being led astray.

At a Thursday Oval Office meeting with Mr Ryan and Mr McCarthy, Mr Trump was calm and did not yell, but was resolute and ""dug in on what he wants,"" said a Republican official briefed on the discussion.

Mr Trump spent six to seven minutes in the meeting with Mr Ryan and Mr McCarthy talking about ""steel slats"" and saying the term was preferable to calling the proposed construction a ""wall,"" as the president has done for more than three years.

The administration drama comes at an especially perilous juncture for Mr Trump, following his thumping at the polls in November's midterm elections. Democrats are preparing to take control of the House in January and to use their subpoena power to investigate Mr Trump's finances and conduct in office, as well as alleged corruption in the administration.

Meanwhile, Republicans in their last gasp of unified government are divided. A band of hard-line conservative lawmakers voted against Mr Trump's prison reform legislation, which passed the House and Senate with bipartisan support and is expected to be signed by the president on Friday. And many foreign policy hawks, including Senator Lindsey Graham, R-SC, a Trump confidant, sharply criticised Mr Trump's decision on Wednesday to withdraw US troops from Syria.

Inside the Oval Office on Thursday, Mr Trump was in what one Republican close to the White House described as ""a tailspin,"" acting ""totally irrationally"" and ""flipping out"" over criticisms in the media.

Even as aides argued to him that protesting over wall funding could deprive government workers pay-checks over Christmas, Mr Trump warned in private conversations with Republican lawmakers they all would get ""crushed"" if they did not get the wall built.

Mr Trump vented to his advisers that signing the short-term spending bill without wall money would make him look weak and make his base voters think he broke a campaign promise. He also complained he did not have sufficient bargaining leverage with Congress and blamed senior aides - including White House legislative affairs director Shahira Knight - for not presenting him with better options.

""He's legitimately saying, 'This is ridiculous. Why would I sign this?'"" said American Conservative Union Chairman Matt Schlapp, whose wife, Mercedes Schlapp, is a senior White House staffer. ""If you're the outsider, you don't want to go along with the same old stupid rules. When he does that, he doesn't look like an outsider.""

Marc Short, Mr Trump's former White House legislative affairs director, said, ""He feels he made a promise to voters that he would build the wall. There is a realisation that with Congress changing hands, that the challenge of getting funding for the wall only gets larger.""

Mr Trump's pin-balling conduct - veering from a promise of a shutdown to moving towards a deal, and then changing his mind - has vexed members of his own party. Many Republican lawmakers said they sense Mr Trump is adjusting uneasily to the dynamics of soon-to-be divided government and lashing out to reclaim some of his dominance over the congressional agenda.

The defence secretary's resignation compounded the concern.

""Having Mattis there gave all of us a great deal more comfort than we have now,"" retiring Senator Jeff Flake, R-Ariz, said. ""Chaos has kind of been the norm but it seems to have been heightened. Sometimes you think it's got to settle, and then another thing happens."""

Sitting ""alone,"" he said, in the White House after cancelling his Christmas visit to his Mar-a-Lago club in South Florida, Trump punctuated his broadside with a statement of defiance.

""AMERICA IS RESPECTED AGAIN!"" he tweeted.

Trump's tweetstorm comes on the third day of a partial government shutdown, which started over the president's demand for $5 billion in funds for his long-desired border wall before Democrats take control of the House in January.

The president accused Democrats of acting out of spite by rejecting his request, saying ""virtually every Democrat we are dealing with today strongly supported a Border Wall or Fence"" before he was president.

""I am all alone (poor me) in the White House waiting for the Democrats to come back and make a deal on desperately needed Border Security,"" he wrote. ""At some point the Democrats not wanting to make a deal will cost our Country more money than the Border Wall we are all talking about. Crazy!""

Democrats have shown few signs they are willing to cave, bolstered by the fact they are set to take over one chamber of Congress and by Trump's recent vow that he would ""proud"" to shut down the government over border security.

While the president's stance has emboldened some conservative allies, other Republicans have grown exasperated with what they believe is a gambit that has little chance of success.

Pat RobertsCharles (Pat) Patrick RobertsThe Hill's Morning Report -- Shutdown likely after chaotic day Kansas GOP senator Pat Roberts considering retirement in 2020 Trump shutdown moves leave GOP senators in disbelief MORE (R-Kan.) said on CNN. ""I'm beyond frustrated.""

""[Former President Lyndon Johnson] said sometimes you just have to hunker down like a jackass in a hail storm and just take it. That's about where we are,"" he added.

Trump published another confusing tweet, in which he appeared to push on critics who say he could have secured up to $25 billion in border security funding in an immigration deal that he rejected earlier this year.

""The Wall is different than the 25 Billion Dollars in Border Security. The complete Wall will be built with the Shutdown money plus funds already in hand. The reporting has been inaccurate on the point,"" he wrote.

There have been few signs of progress in Washington toward resolving the funding impasse. The Senate adjourned Saturday without securing an agreement and many lawmakers went home for the holidays, even as Trump stayed back in the nation's capital.

The barrage of attacks on Monday likely reveal the depths of Trump's vexation with of a set of growing problems plaguing his presidency, several of which were triggered by a series of his decisions over the past several days.

Stock markets plunged again on Monday amid investor uncertainty that some market-watchers blame on uncertainty emanating from the Trump administration.

""He can't putt!"" the president exclaimed.

Trump's message appeared to have the opposite of its intended effect, as the Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped more than 650 points in one of its worst Christmas Eves on record.

Throughout his first year-plus in office, the economy had been a bright spot Trump could point to as evidence his approach is working. But some Trump allies fear that a slowing economy could deal a fatal blow to the president ahead of his 2020 reelection.

U.S. allies ""take advantage of their friendship with the United States, both in Military Protection and Trade,"" Trump said.

""General Mattis did not see this as a problem. I DO, and it is being fixed!"" he added.

The exit of Mattis and Brett McGurk as the U.S. special envoy to the coalition fighting ISIS alarmed Republicans in Congress who disagree with Trump's abrupt decision to pull U.S. troops out of Syria and Afghanistan. Critics fear he will have fewer aides willing to stop him from making what they believe are harmful foreign policy moves.

Corker, the retiring chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, on Sunday accused Trump of making ""devastating"" decisions in the Middle East.

To Trump, however, McGurk ""was the Obama appointee responsible"" for the ""horrific Iran nuclear deal"" that was approved by ""Little Bob Corker.""

McGurk was selected in 2015 by former President Obama as the point person for the global anti-ISIS coalition, but Trump chose to keep him on and he served in that role for nearly two years under the current administration.

Trump on Monday also tried to assure his critics over the Syria withdrawal by claiming that Saudi Arabia agreed to spend the ""money needed to help rebuild Syria.""

""See? Isn't it nice when immensely wealthy countries help rebuild their neighbors rather than a Great Country, the U.S., that is 5000 miles away. Thanks to Saudi A!"" he added.

Saudi Arabia in October transferred $100 billion in stabilization funds for Syria. The desert kingdom initially pledged the funds in August, but only wired the payment after the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi that set off worldwide outrage.

Trump also vented his anger over a CNN report that he expressed frustration with Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker because the president's former personal attorney Michael Cohen's guilty plea made him look bad.

""I never 'lashed out' at the Acting Attorney General of the U.S., a man for whom I have great respect. This is a made up story, one of many, by the Fake News Media!"" Trump wrote."
62,the independent,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/trump-foundation-michael-flynn-syria-withdrawal-government-shutdown-immigration-this-week-a8691361.html,"The president faces a slate of newly-reported investigations, into everything from his charity to his inaugural committee. The Republican party appears to be disavowing his circle of indicted former lawyers and White House appointees including ex-deputy finance chairman of the Republican National Committee, Michael Cohen, and former national security advisor Michael Flynn.

With startling news arriving out of the White House, or courthouses, at such a rapid pace, it has become almost impossible for even the most veteran of Washington journalists to keep track of every new development.

What follows are five of the newest controversies facing Mr Trump.

Republicans appear to have narrowly avoided a government shutdown as Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said the Senate will take up a short-term measure Wednesday to fund the federal government until 8 February.

But controversy remains for Mr Trump, who secured the White House during the 2016 election in part due to his campaign promise of building a wall spanning the entirety of the US-Mexico border.

The president was forced to back away from his demands for $5bn for the wall in the upcoming funding bill due to a lack of support for the measure in Congress.

He now faces criticism from supporters having said last week he would be ""proud to shut the government down over the wall. The new legislation will mot include the $5bn Mr Trump asked for.

He appeared to respond to criticism Wednesday that he was backing down, insisting on Twitter: ""One way or the other, we will win on the Wall!""

A federal judge Tuesday abruptly postponed the sentencing of Mr Trump's first national security adviser, Michael Flynn on Tuesday - declaring himself disgusted and disdainful of Flynn's crime of lying to the FBI.

US District Judge Emmet Sullivan also raised the unexpected prospect of sending the retired Army lieutenant general to prison. Flynn has admitted lying to the FBI in 2017 as part of what has become Special Counsel Robert Mueller's probe into Russian election meddling and possible collusion with Trump campaign officials.

Lawyers for Flynn, who admitted lying about his Russian contacts, requested the delay during the stunning hearing in which Judge Sullivan told the former Trump aide in a blistering rebuke that ""arguably you sold your country out.""

""I can't make any guarantees, but I'm not hiding my disgust, my disdain for this criminal offence,"" the judge said.

The postponement gives Flynn a chance to continue cooperating with the government in hopes of staving off prison and proving his value as a witness, including in a foreign lobbying prosecution unsealed this week.

The possibility of prison had seemed remote for Flynn, who was smiling and upbeat as he entered the courtroom, since prosecutors had praised his extensive cooperation and did not recommend any time behind bars.

Federal prosecutors are reportedly investigating the finances of President Donald Trump's inaugural committee and whether foreigners contributed to its events using straw donors.

ProPublica and the New York public radio station WNYC also reported new details Friday on how Trump profited from the inauguration, with the committee paying for rooms and event space at his Washington DC Hotel.

The news organisations obtained emails showing that Ivanka Trump, the president's eldest daughter, was involved in negotiating the hotel's prices.

The probe reportedly stemmed in part from materials the FBI seized earlier this year while probing the business dealings of Michael Cohen, Trump's longtime fixer and personal attorney. Cohen was sentenced to three years in federal prison this week for tax evasion and campaign-finance violations.

Mr Trump and the White House has denied any wrongdoing, saying they were not involved with the inauguration committee's decisions.

Mr Trump's charitable foundation reached a deal on Tuesday to go out of business, even as the president continues to fight allegations he misused its assets to resolve business disputes and boost his run for the White House.

New York Attorney General Barbara Underwood's lawsuit alleging he and his family illegally operated the foundation as an extension of his businesses and his presidential campaign will continue.

The lawsuit, filed last spring, seeks $2.8m in restitution and a 10-year ban on Mr Trump and his three eldest children -- Donald Jr., Eric and Ivanka -- from running any charities in New York.

In a statement Tuesday, Ms Underwood cited ""a shocking pattern of illegality involving the Trump Foundation -- including unlawful coordination with the Trump presidential campaign, repeated and willful self-dealing, and much more.""

The foundation operated as ""little more than a check book to serve Mr Trump's business and political interests,"" she said.

""The Trump Foundation has done great work and given away lots of money, both mine and others, to great charities over the years - with me taking NO fees, rent, salaries etc,"" Mr Trump wrote in a tweet on Wednesday. ""Now, as usual, I am getting slammed by Cuomo and the Dems in a long running civil lawsuit started by sleazebag AG Eric Schneiderman, who has since resigned over horrific women abuse, when I wanted to close the Foundation so as not to be in conflict with politics. Shady Eric was head of New Yorkers for Clinton, and refused to even look at the corrupt Clinton Foundation.""

He added, ""In any event, it goes on and on & the new AG, who is now being replaced by yet another AG (who openly campaigned on a GET TRUMP agenda), does little else but rant, rave & politic against me. Will never be treated fairly by these people - a total double standard of 'justice.'""

Mr Trump has ordered a rapid withdrawal of US troops from Syria after the president announced ISIS was ""defeated"" in the region.

The news quickly faced backlash from key Republicans, including Senator Lindsey Graham, who said ""An American withdrawal at this time would be a big win for ISIS, Iran, Bashar al Assad of Syria, and Russia.""

He added, ""I fear it will lead to devastating consequences for our nation, the region and throughout the world,"" describing the sudden withdrawal as an ""Obama-like mistake.""

Just last week, officials said troops would remain in Syria for an unknown period to ensure terrorist groups were permanently eradicated from the region.

""I think it's fair to say Americans will remain on the ground after the physical defeat of the caliphate, until we have the pieces in place to ensure that that defeat is enduring,"" Brett McGurk, special presidential envoy for the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS, told USA Today."
63,the daily caller,https://dailycaller.com/2019/01/14/brian-kolfage-gofundme-questions/,"Charity Watch President Daniel Borochoff says Kolfage's new nonprofit raises a ""huge red flag.""

The founder of the viral $20 million border wall GoFundMe campaign is refusing to answer basic questions about his new nonprofit organization that will use donor funds to construct a piecemeal wall mile-by-mile along the U.S.-Mexico border.

Triple amputee Air Force veteran Brian Kolfage is asking donors to transfer their donations to WeBuildTheWall Inc. following his announcement Friday that the federal government will not accept any funds from his viral fundraising campaign, despite his initial claim otherwise.

GoFundMe said Friday that donors will need to opt into transferring their donations to Kolfage's new Florida-based nonprofit by April 10, when all remaining contributions will be automatically refunded.

Kolfage claims the bylaws of WeBuildTheWall Inc. prevent him from taking any salary from donor funds that originate from GoFundMe. But Kolfage has refused to provide The Daily Caller News Foundation a copy of the nonprofit's bylaws to corroborate his claim.

Kolfage's statement omits the fact that he is now directing check donations to an entirely different organization, We Fund the Wall, Inc. with a PO Box in Houston.

Kolfage has ignored multiple inquiries from TheDCNF asking why he's directing check donations to a separate organization based in a different state, and whether donations sent to We Fund the Wall, Inc. can be used to compensate him in any way shape or form.

It's unclear how much money Kolfage has raised via check donations, but his tweets suggest it could be a substantial amount.

Furthermore, TheDCNF has been unable to find any record of We Fund the Wall, Inc.'s formal existence, and multiple inquiries requesting the organization's founding documents have gone ignored.

Charity Watch President Daniel Borochoff told TheDCNF that raises a ""huge red flag.""

""People should give right to the organization that they want to support. Why are they directing money to some other entity?"" Borochoff said. ""This money could get stolen or misdirected to be used for another purpose.""

""There could be some kind of misdirection of funds or something going on there that people might not be happy about,"" Borochoff added. ""They really need a good reason for doing that.""

Kolfage has also refused to address why he waited until Friday inform his donors about the existence of his new nonprofit organization, which was founded over two weeks ago on Dec. 28, according to Florida's Division of Corporations.

The stated purpose for Kolfage's nonprofit is: ""funding, construction, administering, and maintaining a United States Southern Border Wall and the processes associated therewith,"" according to its founding documents signed on Dec. 27.

This appears to show that Kolfage was aware the federal government would not be able to accept donations by Dec. 27 at the latest, but despite this, he knowingly raised $2.8 million on GoFundMe between that date and Friday, all the while telling donors that 100 percent of their donations would be handed over to the government for the purpose of funding a border wall.

Kolfage has ignored multiple inquiries asking why he waited over two weeks to inform his donors of his intention to transfer their contributions to his new nonprofit.

""We have contacted the Trump Administration to secure a point of contact where all the funds will go upon completion. When we get this information secured we will update,"" Kolfage claimed at the onset of his fundraiser. (RELATED: Can The $13 Million GoFundMe For Trump's Border Wall Actually Work?)

Kolfage now says ""highly experienced team is highly confident that we can complete significant elements of the wall in less time, and for less money, than the federal government.""

All contributions collected by Kolfage's GoFundMe after Friday will be automatically routed to WeBuildTheWall Inc., and Kolfage claimed Sunday that one third of his 340,000 donors had already opted into the nonprofit.

64,the independent,https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/americas/us-politics/government-shutdown-trump-workers-christmas-pay-deadline-partial-latest-update-a8695371.html,"Hundreds of thousands of government workers - among them border guards and airport security staff - will work without pay over the Christmas holiday if Donald Trump and the Democrats do not agree a budget spending deal.

As the president threatened a partial shutdown of the government that would ""last for a very long time"" if he did not receive $5bn for a border wall as part of the budget, the senate began consideringa Republican bill that contains such a sum, but which had virtually no chance of getting Democratic support.

Last week, Mr Trump said he would be ""proud"" to allow a shutdown if it meant he secured a border wall. After senators two days ago passed a bipartisan measure that contained funding for border security - but not a wall - the president dug his heels in and tried to blame his opponents. ""If enough Dems don't vote, it will be a Democrat shutdown,"" he tweeted.

Meanwhile, as politicians on Capitol Hill engaged in a blame game, the cost of a shutdown became clearer.

The New York Times said unless a budget was agreed by the deadline of midnight on Friday, nine government departments would close and as many a 420,000 federal employees would work over the holiday period without pay.

Among the departments to shut would be the treasury, agriculture, homeland security, the interior, state, housing and urban development, transportation, commerce and justice.

It said hundreds of thousands of workers considered ""essential"" - among them prison officer, border agents and weather service forecasters - will have to work without pay. The newspaper added that 42,000 Coast Guard employees expected to be among those working without pay, and that 53,000 members of the Transportation Security Administration (TSA), the man and women who oversee security at airports, will also be working without remuneration.

On Friday, Mr Trump hailed the House bill that included more than $5bn for a wall including slats and walls. Democrats have said they are willing to spend on border security but do not believe a wall is not necessary and is more a political giveaway to the president's supporters.

Mr Trump claimed the wall will ""pay for itself"" on a monthly basis - a calculation he did not fully explain.

""I don't think the Democrats care very much about this,"" he said. ""But it's a big issue.""

Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell urged approval of the bill, which includes $5.7bn for a wall on the southern border with Mexico.

Mr McConnell said the bill is neither ""radical"" nor difficult to explain. Instead he said it addresses a crisis at the border that includes illegal drug smuggling and increased apprehensions of people trying to cross illegally into the US, the Associated Press said.

Mr McConnell, who met with the president on Friday at the White House, said in a Senate speech that ""this legislation would be quite uncontroversial in a more normal political moment"".

He blamed ""far-left"" Democrats for opposing the spending package approved by House Republicans."

U.S. Congress returns to Washington for its first full week of legislative business since control of the House reverted to Democrats, but lawmakers will be confronted with the same lingering question: When will the partial government shutdown end?

One Republican senator says he's offered U.S. President Donald Trump a possible solution, though it may just be wishful thinking.

READ MORE: Sen. Graham urges Trump to reopen government for few weeks before he 'pulls the plug'

Sen. Lindsey Graham is encouraging Trump to reopen government for several weeks to continue negotiating with Democrats over the border wall Trump wants to build on the U.S.-Mexico border. If there's no deal at the end of that time, Graham says Trump would be free to take the more dramatic step of declaring a national emergency to build it.

But the South Carolina Republican says Trump still wants a deal on funding for the wall before agreeing to reopen shuttered government departments. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat, insists Trump reopen the government first.

Their weeks-old standoff led to the partial government shutdown, now on day 24 without a clear end in sight.

""Before he pulls the plug on the legislative option, and I think we're almost there, I would urge him to open up the government for a short period of time, like three weeks, before he pulls the plug, see if we can get a deal,"" Graham said. ""If we can't at the end of three weeks, all bets are off.

""See if he can do it by himself through the emergency powers. That's my recommendation,"" added Graham, who has publicly pushed Trump to use his authority to declare a national emergency to build the wall. Such a step would allow Trump to bypass Congress and tap various pots of unspent federal money, including for military construction and disaster relief as well as from assets seized by law enforcement, to pay for the wall.

Trump has kept Washington on edge over whether he would resort to such a declaration, citing what he says is a ""crisis"" of drug smuggling and the trafficking of women and children at the border. The president initially sounded as though such a move was imminent, but then pulled back. He has said several times since he first mentioned the idea in public this month that he prefers a legislative solution.

A key question is how much more time is Trump willing to give lawmakers. Graham, who spoke with Trump by telephone on Sunday morning, said the legislative path ""is just about shut off"" and blamed intransigence by Pelosi.

The speaker's office had no immediate comment.

Democrats oppose an emergency declaration but may be powerless to block it. Some Republicans are wary, too, fearing how a future Democratic president might use that authority. Such a move, should Trump ultimately go that route, would almost certainly be challenged in the courts.

WATCH: Trump refuses to back down on border wall funding in exchange for reopening the government

Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., called Graham's idea to reopen the government a ""great place to start.""

""I do think if we reopen the government, if the president ends this shutdown crisis, we have folks who can negotiate a responsible, modern investment in technology that will actually make us safer,"" Coons said.

Trump says technology is nice, but that the border can't be secured without a wall.

The White House has been laying the groundwork for an emergency declaration, which is feared by lawmakers in both parties.

Senate Homeland Security Committee Chairman Ron Johnson, R-Wis., said he'd ""hate to see"" a declaration issued because the wall wouldn't get built, presumably because of legal challenges. Democrats voted in the past for border security and should again, he said.

""I actually want to see this wall get built,"" Johnson said. ""I want to keep pressure on Democrats to actually come to the negotiating table in good faith and fund what they have supported in the past.""

Graham favours a declaration and said the time for talk is running out.

""It's the last option, not the first option, but we're pretty close to that being the only option,"" he said.

Graham and Coons spoke on Fox News Sunday and Johnson appeared on CNN's State of the Union.

The controversy began during Donald and Melania Trump's surprise Christmastime visit to Al Asad Air Base in Iraq this week.

The President received a warm welcome from the US forces stationed there. But his speech to the troops was criticised for being too political - and one line in particular stood out.

Mr Trump told the servicemen and women he had secured a 10 per cent pay rise on their behalf -- and claimed it was their first raise in more than a decade.

""You protect us. We are always going to protect you. And you just saw that, 'cause you just got one of the biggest pay raises you've ever received,"" Mr Trump said.

""You haven't gotten one in more than 10 years. More than 10 years. And we got you a big one. I got you a big one. I got you a big one.

""They had plenty of people that came up, they said, 'You know, we could make it smaller. We could make it 3 per cent, we could make it 2 per cent, we could make it 4 per cent.

""I said, 'No. Make it 10 per cent. Make it more than 10 per cent.' Cause it's been a long time, it's been more than 10 years. Been more than 10 years, that's a long time.""

There was only one problem -- it was all false.

American military personnel have received a pay rise every year since 1983.

The increase was 2.4 per cent this year - less than a quarter of the '10 percent' Mr Trump claimed to have secured - and will be 2.6 per cent in 2019.

The whopping fib didn't go unnoticed.

It caught the attention of TV reporter Katy Tur, who unleashed on Mr Trump while guest hosting MSNBC's MTP: Daily program.

The 35-year-old anchor, who penned the book Unbelievable: My Front-Row Seat to the Craziest Campaign in American History about her time reporting on Mr Trump's presidential campaign, accused the leader of deliberately spreading misinformation.

""God, he's just full of it,"" Ms Tur said after watching a clip of the president sharing the incorrect news.

""None of that is true.

""Charitably speaking, could the President have just gotten his numbers confused? Is he just that bad at numbers? Or is he deliberately lying?""

She didn't stop there, repeatedly returning to the President's claim even after her show's guests went off on tangents.

""If you told me I'm getting a 10 per cent raise, and I'm only getting a 2.6 per cent raise, I'd be pretty pissed off. Especially if I was in war zone risking my life every day,"" she said.

""To hear that I'm getting a 10 per cent raise from the commander-in-chief? The top of my echelon? I would be kinda bummed, a little angrier if I found out that's not the case.""

The Trumps' Iraq visit was their first to a war zone during Mr Trump's presidency, and surprised critics who were in the process of roasting him for failing to visit US forces over Christmas.

The President used his visit to defend his decision to withdraw US forces from Syria, which was slammed by members of his own party and led Defence Secretary James Mattis to resign in protest.

""We're no longer the suckers, folks,"" he told the troops, having been greeted by chants of ""USA! USA!"".

""The reason I'm here today is to personally thank you and every service member throughout this region for the near-elimination of the ISIS territorial caliphate in Iraq and Syria.

""Two years ago, when I became President, they were a very dominant group. They were very dominant. Today they're not so dominant anymore.

""Great job. I looked at a map and two years ago it was a lot of red all over, and now you have a couple of little spots, and that's happening very quickly.""

The troops cheered in response, and many later posed for smiling photographs with the President.

In a particularly touching moment, one of them told Mr Trump he had inspired him to return to the military.

""And I am here because of you,"" Mr Trump replied.

This all comes amid a partial government shutdown in the United States, sparked by a stoush over funding for Mr Trump's border wall with Mexico.

The stalemate is continuing with no resolution in sight, and today Mr Trump further inflamed the situation by threatening to close the entire border between the two countries in a trademark tweet.

""We will be forced to close the Southern Border entirely if the Obstructionist Democrats do not give us the money to finish the Wall & also change the ridiculous immigration laws that our Country is saddled with,"" he posted."

U.S. President Donald Trump is doubling down on claims that Mexico was paying for the proposed border wall between their two countries saying he ""never meant they're going to write out a cheque.""

Story continues below

Trump reiterated his claim that Mexico is paying for the wall via the new, un-ratified Canada-U.S.-Mexico Trade Agreement (CUSMA) while speaking to reporters at the White House before visiting the Texas border town of McAllen on the 20th day of a partial government shutdown.

Trump has held out for $5.7 billion in partial wall funding during talks to re-open the government with congressional leaders. Democrats have held steadfast in their opposition to providing any money for a border wall.

FACT CHECK: Mexico is not paying for the border wall, despite what Trump says

""When, during the campaign, I would say Mexico is going to pay for it, obviously I never said this, and I never meant they're going to write out a cheque,"" Trump said.

""I said they were going to pay for it - and they are, they are paying for it with the incredible deal we made called the USMCA.""

In fact, in October 2016, during the height of the 2016 presidential campaign, Trump released a document called ""Donald Trump's Contract with the American Voter,"" in which he said Mexico would ""re-imburse"" the U.S. for the ""full cost of the wall.""

In a separate plan presented to the Washington Post during the campaign, he suggested he would cut off access for Mexican immigrants who send money home to their families until Mexico made a ""one-time payment"" of billions of dollars for the wall. (The plan was regarded as likely illegal, the Washington Post reported.)

WATCH: Trump says GOP is 'extremely united' over border wall, government shutdown

Since being elected, Trump has cooled on calls for one-time payments, and switched to connecting the payments to the re-negotiated NAFTA deal.

On Trump's claim that the new trade deal would pay for the wall, Trump is assuming a wide variety of economic benefits will come from the new NAFTA deal. But experts say the amounts cannot be quantified, and the funding still has to be secured from government coiffers.

During the comments made Thursday morning, Trump also said he had the right to declare a national emergency.

""I have the absolute right to declare a national emergency. I'm not prepared to do that yet but if I have to I will ... I may do it. I this doesn't work out, probably I will do it,"" he said.

If he declares an emergency in an attempt to circumvent Congress's power over the national purse strings, Trump likely would try to redirect money from the Department of Defense toward his proposed wall.

Graham said he thinks Trump is willing to accept the $5.7 billion he has insisted on for the wall, along with some immigration measures Democrats might find acceptable, such as helping immigrants who were illegally brought to the U.S. as children.

Trump has expressed interest in a broader immigration overhaul, but says he first wants the Supreme Court to address the class of immigrants known as ""Dreamers."" Pelosi also has shown no interest in accepting a wall -- she has called it an ""immorality"" -- in exchange for immigration fixes.

In his first ever nationally televised prime-time address from the Oval Office, the President called for stronger border protection, saying the US had ""run out of space"" to hold the immigrants crossing the US-Mexico border.

""America proudly welcomes millions of lawful emigrants who enrich our society and contribute to our nation,"" he said in the impassioned speech. ""But all Americans are hurt by uncontrolled, illegal migration.""

Mr Trump said illegal migrants strained public resources, drove down jobs and wages, and served as a ""pipeline for vast quantities of illegal drugs"".

He described it as a ""humanitarian crisis ... of the heart and soul"", noting that 20,000 migrant children were illegally brought into the US last month. ""This is the cycle of human suffering that I am determined to end,"" he said.

The President went on to acknowledge the violence migrants face in the transition to the US, stating: ""One in three women are sexually assaulted on the dangerous trek up through Mexico. Women and children are the biggest victims by far of our broken system. This is the tragic reality of illegal immigration on our southern border.""

He said his administration had presented Congress with a ""detailed proposal"" to ""secure the border and stop criminal gangs, drug smugglers and human traffickers"".

He has also issued an urgent request for humanitarian assistance and medical support.

Mr Trump reiterated that law enforcement professionals had requested $US5.7 billion for a ""physical barrier"" to stop immigration across the border, claiming the wall would be paid for through a trade deal with Mexico.

The address to the nation came as the US entered its 20th day of a partial government shutdown over the border.

The President blamed the Democrats for the shutdown, saying: ""The federal government remains shut down for one reason, and one reason only. Because Democrats will not fund border security.

""Some have suggested a barrier is immoral. But then why do politicians build walls, fences and gates around their homes? They don't do it because they hate the people on the outside -- they do it because they love the people on the inside.""

Referencing a series of murders at the hands of ""illegal aliens"", he said: ""How much more American blood must we shared before Congress does its job?""

""This is a choice between right and wrong,"" he went on. ""Justice and injustice. This is about whether we fulfil our sacred duty to the American citizens we serve. When I took the oath of office, I swore to protect our country. And that is what I will always do. So help me God. Thank you and goodnight.""

The President is now expected to head to the southern border to draw even more attention to the scene he claims needs a radical solution.

DEMOCRATS SLAM TRUMP OVER 'TEMPER TANTRUM'

Addressing the nation in response, Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said ""much of what we have heard from President Trump throughout this senseless shutdown has been full of misinformation and even malice"".

The Speaker said it was ""plain wrong"" of him to ""withhold the pay cheques of hundreds of thousands of innocent workers"". She said there were better ways to secure the border, including building infrastructure within the ports of entry and hiring personnel to facilitate trade and immigration at the border.

""The fact is, women and children at the border are not a security threat. They are a humanitarian challenge,"" she said.

Speaking alongside Ms Pelosi, Senator Chuck Schumer urged the President to reopen the government. ""We address you tonight for one reason only: the President of the United States, having failed to get Mexico to pay for his ineffective and unnecessary border war ... has shut down the government.

""American government doesn't work that way. We don't govern by temper tantrum. No president should pound the table and demand he gets his way or the government shuts down.""

He said the border could be secured without the $US5.7 billion wall, saying: ""The symbol of America should be the Statue of Liberty. Not a 30-foot wall.

""So our suggestion is a simple one, Mr President. Reopen the government. We can work to resolve differences over border security. End this shutdown.""

SHUTDOWN NIGHTMARE

The partial government shutdown is starting to be felt among Americans, with 800,000 federal workers -- including ""anxious and angry"" members of the Secret Service -- facing the reality that their next scheduled pay cheques won't be issued.

Julie Burr, 49, said she went into ""panic mode"" after she was placed on unpaid leave from her job as a Transport Department administrative assistant, telling news.com.au she was ""seriously considering"" selling off her possessions.

Until either Trump or the Democrats budge, the most vulnerable in society are at risk, with food stamps and federal housing about to be affected.

National parks popular with tourists have closed following health and hygiene concerns as rubbish piled up and toilets overflowed without staff. The Department of Agriculture's Animal Care office has closed its hotline for reporting abuse.

Air travel has been affected as security officers and safety inspectors stay off work. Long queues formed at airports over the weekend and the Air Line Pilots Association International warned the shutdown was ""adversely affecting the safety, security and efficiency of our national airspace system.""

The economy is set to take a battering, with individuals and businesses struggling to function with nine of 15 government departments closed as well as several agencies.

Farmers already struggling cannot receive subsidies as the Agriculture Department's Farm Service Agency is shut. The Milwaukee Journal Sentinel said the shutdown ""could wreak havoc on US agriculture, and the rural economy, as farmers wait on subsidy payments, loans and data they need now to make plans for the spring.""

Manufacturers also cannot plan as they have no idea how much materials will cost this year because the Commerce Department is not processing requests for exemptions from metal tariffs.

Craft brewers cannot get approval from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives for new beer labels.

Up to 39,000 federally backed mortgage applications may have been delayed because of reduced agency staffing, according to real estate marketplace Zillow.

Mr Trump said he could relate to the unpaid workers struggling to make ends meet, but the billionaire businessman's claim drew derision from many ordinary Americans.

IS THERE A BORDER CRISIS?

The President and White House aides have been repeatedly emphasising the idea there is an immigration crisis on the US-Mexico border, and that a border wall is the solution.

Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen cited administration figures showing 161,000 family units crossed the border in 2018, a 50 per cent increase from the year before. She also said 60,000 unaccompanied children crossed the border last year, a 25 per cent increase.

Mr Trump regularly refers to ""criminals"" and ""terrorists"" attempting to enter the US from Mexico, but NBC News said border officials found only six immigrants in the first half of fiscal year 2018 whose names were on a government list of known or suspected terrorists.

However, the Washington Post described a ""bona fide emergency"" as desperate migrants wait weeks and even months for authorities to process their claims.

The closure of immigration courts due to the shutdown has made matters even worse.

Border agents are overwhelmed with arrests along the border exceeding 2000 a day. Many migrants are turning to people smugglers who are depositing rural South American families in remote areas. Humanitarian care is a growing issue.

The argument is over the solution.

All four living former presidents have said they do not support Mr Trump's border wall idea.

Many Republicans are also uncomfortable with the shutdown over border wall funding.

Several dozen GOP politicians in the House of Representatives may cross the room this week to vote for Democratic bills to reopen shuttered parts of the government, according to Politico.

""We need to reopen the government and then have a serious discussion about border security,"" Democrat and chairwoman of the House Appropriations Committee Nita Lowey told New York Public Radio.

""Isolate the (border wall) issue, take a month to discuss it, but don't hold up all the essential services -- like the Agriculture Department, Interior, parks, housing, transportation -- all the other parts of the government.

""The President is really causing great hardship to the average person in this country.""

KELLYANNE CONWAY CLASHES WITH REPORTER

One of Donald Trump's most high-profile staffers clashed with a notorious reporter just hours before the President's much-anticipated prime-time address to the nation.

Counsellor to the President Kellyanne Conway embarrassed CNN reporter Jim Acosta, slamming him as a ""smartass"" after he asked whether Mr Trump would tell the truth in his address.

""Yes, Jim,"" Ms Conway shot back, ""Can you promise that you will? The whole truth and nothing but the truth, so help you God? Am I allowed to mention 'God' to you?""

Acosta, who known for making interruptions when Mr Trump and members of his administration are made available to the press, told Ms Conway he didn't have an ""alternative facts"" problem like she did.

""Make sure that goes viral. This is why I'm one of the only people around here who gives you the time of day,"" Ms Conway responded.

""You're such a smartass most of the time and I know you want this to go viral.""

She then told the reporter that a lot of his peers didn't like him and mocked CNN ""for all the corrections"" it needed to issue.

""I was on your network 25 or 26 times in 2018. I'm one of the last people here who even bothered to go on, and the disrespect you show to me personally, I'll look past it,"" she added.

Last year Acosta had his White House press pass revoked following a tumultuous press conference where the reporter pressed Mr Trump to answer a question and refused to give up the microphone to a female aide.

The President branded Acosta ""a rude, terrible person"" and his White House reporting privileges were revoked.

Acosta's press pass was restored on November 19 after CNN argued that keeping him out of the White House violated the network and Acosta's First and Fifth Amendment rights.

The Democrats, which now has the majority in the House of Representatives, is unwilling to provide more than $US1.3 billion ($A1.8 billion) in border security funding, including money for a fence rather than a wall."
70,news.com.au,https://www.news.com.au/finance/work/leaders/donald-trumps-defence-secretary-james-mattis-quits-after-decision-to-withdraw-from-syria/news-story/a9280c36528b33de756cf8af56697f75,"Another senior member of Donald Trump's administration is quitting.

Defence Secretary James Mattis, widely seen as a stabilising influence on Mr Trump, has announced he will resign on February 28, giving the President time to find and nominate a successor.

In his resignation letter, General Mattis told Mr Trump he had ""the right to have a Secretary of Defence whose views are better aligned with yours"".

He cited disagreements with Mr Trump on the treatment of America's allies - and its adversaries.

""While the US remains the indispensable nation in the free world, we cannot protect our interests or serve that role effectively without maintaining strong alliances and showing respect to those allies,"" Gen Mattis said.

He pointedly mentioned the 74-nation coalition against Islamic State as an example of that principle at work.

Yesterday Mr Trump announced his decision to withdraw US forces from Syria and declared Islamic State had been defeated.

He was subsequently slammed by members of his own party, who called the decision a ""betrayal"" of America's allies in the region, the Kurds.

Gen Mattis also implied Mr Trump had been too soft on Russia, whose influence in the Middle East will grow as a result of the withdrawal.

""I believe we must be resolute and unambiguous in our approach to those countries whose strategic interests are increasingly in tension with ours,"" he said.

""It is clear that China and Russia, for example, want to shape a world consistent with their authoritarian model.

""That is why we must use all the tools of American power to provide for the common defence.

""My views on treating allies with respect and also being clear-eyed about both malign actors and strategic competitors are strongly held and informed by over four decades of immersion in these issues.""

Mr Trump has frequently been accused of being too friendly towards Russian President Vladimir Putin, particularly in response to Russia's meddling in the 2016 presidential election.

His critics have also taken issue with his praise for North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un in the wake of their summit in Singapore.

Overnight North Korea said it would not denuclearise until the US eliminated its own ""nuclear threat"", undermining Mr Trump's claims he had secured a denuclearisation deal at the summit.

Gen Mattis' letter did not contain a single word of praise for Mr Trump.

CNN reports he ""vehemently opposed"" to the withdrawal from Syria, and was ""livid"" today after reading a report that the Turkish Minister of Defence threatened to kill the Kurds and dump them ""in ditches"" after America leaves.

Gen Mattis then visited the White House and tried to change the President's mind, and quit when Mr Trump refused to budge.

He is merely the latest in a long line of top officials who have departed the administration.

Last month Attorney General Jeff Sessions was forced out by Mr Trump, who resented his decision to recuse himself from overseeing Robert Mueller's Russia investigation.

The President had repeatedly unleashed humiliating criticism of Mr Sessions in public.

Mr Trump is about to move on to his third White House chief of staff following the resignation of Reince Priebus in 2017 and the recent news that John Kelly will leave by the end of this year.

He has been through multiple press secretaries, including Sean Spicer and Anthony Scaramucci, who famously lasted only 11 days in the job.

Chief Economic Adviser Gary Cohn quit after clashing with Mr Trump on trade policy.

Communications Director Hope Hicks, one of the President's most trusted staffers, resigned in February. She was the fourth person to hold that role.

Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price was forced out after his costly use of private charter planes for government business blew up into a public scandal.

Mr Trump's chief political strategist Steve Bannon was fired in August of last year.

National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster left in March, having succeeded Michael Flynn, who was fired just weeks after Mr Trump took office for lying about his contacts with the Russian ambassador.

General McMaster's deputy K.T. McFarland lasted a matter of months before quitting.

Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh's tenure was even shorter. She was gone after 70 days.

That's a lot of people. But Gen Mattis' resignation could be one of the most critical.

""There are no more grown-ups in the room. You know? There is H.R. McMaster too. McMaster's gone. And Kelly's gone. And now Mattis is gone. And we'll see who is in charge now,"" CNN analyst Jeffrey Toobin said.

Former diplomat Nicholas Burns said Gen Mattis' exit would weaken the administration's credibility with its allies and foes, and his ""restraining influence on an unpredictable"" President would be a huge loss.

It has been a dramatic week for Mr Trump, with a government shutdown looming amid his struggle to secure funding for a wall on the Mexican border, and the stock market plunging.

But his decision to withdraw from Syria is the biggest controversy.

""That is something that Mattis opposed. It is something that all of the top leaders here in the Pentagon, as well as US Central Command generals, opposed,"" Fox News reporter Jennifer Griffin said.

""I was told by a very well placed source here in the Pentagon that morale has never been lower at meetings of the top brass in the last few days to discuss the pullout of troops.""

Republicans who usually defend the President have publicly blasted the withdrawal.

Senator Lindsey Graham said he was ""blindsided"" by Mr Trump's decision and called it a ""huge Obama-like mistake"".

""With all due respect, ISIS is not defeated in Syria, Iraq, and after just returning from visiting there, certainly not Afghanistan,"" Mr Graham said.

""An American withdrawal will put the Kurds and all those who came to America's aid in destroying ISIS at tremendous risk. It will make it more difficult to recruit future partners willing to confront radical Islam.

""If Obama had done this, all of us would be furious. If Obama had done this, we'd be going nuts right now.""

Congressman Adam Kinzinger said he was ""blown away"" by the withdrawal and it would be a ""devastating blow"" in the war against Islamic State.

""I want to support President Trump in every way I can. But on something like this, you have to look at this and go, 'This is going to be devastating for foreign policy.' And I don't even think we begin to know the ramifications,"" he said.

""They're celebrating in Moscow and Tehran right now. They're trembling in Tel Aviv. And in Washington we're confused, because nobody saw this coming.""

Another critic was Senator Marco Rubio, who renewed his argument in the wake of Gen Mattis's resignation.

Meanwhile, CNN and the Wall Street Journal both report administration officials are bracing for Mr Trump to announce a similar withdrawal from Afghanistan, where 14,000 troops are currently stationed."
71,stuff,https://www.stuff.co.nz/business/world/109616024/stocks-recover-from-epic-christmas-eve-plunge-dow-notches-up-historic-1050point-gain,"Stocks have climbed back from their epic Christmas Eve plunge as all three indexes posted big gains.

The Dow Jones industrial average roared more than 1050 points in late afternoon - nearly 5 per cent - as stocks snapped a four-day losing streak that had placed the 10-year bull market on the edge of death on Monday.

""Today the market's message is that we have nothing to fear but fear itself,"" said Ed Yardeni, president of Yardeni Research. ""The recent selloff reflected fears of an impending recession which were blown away today by Amazon and other retailers reporting a record holiday selling season. Santa is back.""

White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett tried to bring some calm to the markets earlier on Wednesday when he assured reporters that Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome H Powell's job is ""100 per cent safe"". The market started surging after his remarks.

* Trump vows not to reopen federal government until wall funding is secured

* Wall Street's sliding but no-one worried about the banks, until Donald Trump's Treasury Secretary spoke

* Chaos predicted if US Fed chair sacked by Donald Trump, angry about rising interest rates

* No sign of Santa on Wall Street yet as stocks tumble again

""Yes, of course, 100 per cent,"" said Hassett, the chairman of the president's Council of Economic Advisers, when asked by reporters at the White House if Powell's job is safe. ""Absolutely.""

Hassett, in an appearance on Fox Business Network, also said US President Donald Trump ""is very happy"" with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. Mnuchin created worry last weekend when he phoned the chief executives of US banks regarding the economy.

Trump's criticism of the Fed and Powell has shaken Wall Street as it weathers its worst December in history.

The Dow was whirling between slightly negative to 200 points up in the first hours of Wednesday's session before its early afternoon lift on the tails of surging blue chips Apple, Home Depot, Microsoft, Visa and Nike. Facebook and Amazon shares were up more than 6 per cent each.

All three major indexes were on pace to snap a four-day losing streak. The S&P 500 and technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite also bounced. The Nasdaq was up more than 5 per cent and the S&P posted a nearly 5 per cent percent pop by closing.

Crude oil prices surged, posting their biggest increase in two years after a 30-per cent plus drop since October. West Texas Intermediate crude was up nearly 10 per cent at around US$46 (NZ$68) per barrel. Benchmark Brent crude increased more than 8.5 per cent to more than US$54 per barrel.

The post-holiday rally comes after a shortened Christmas Eve trading session left the Nasdaq deep into correction territory, and the S&P within a wisp of a correction.

The near-decade long bull market that began in March 2009 earned a reprieve on Wednesday's rally. Consumer discretionary, energy and technology were leading the way.

Trump tried to create his own White House rally on Christmas Day when he suggested that the pullback in US stock markets is a good buying opportunity for investors.

""We have companies - the greatest in the world, and they're doing really well,"" Trump told reporters at the White House. ""They have record kinds of numbers. So I think it's a tremendous opportunity to buy. Really a great opportunity to buy.""

All three major US indexes - Dow, S&P and Nasdaq - finished down 2 per cent or more on Christmas Eve. The Dow closed down 653 points.

Ten of the S&P's 11 sectors are in correction coming into Wednesday, although all were higher in early trades. A correction is generally defined as a 20 per cent retreat off recent highs.

The Dow's 30 blue chips are close behind, down 4034 points in December - about 13.63 per cent - and nearly 5000 points off its September high. The composite of some of America's most important companies is on track for its worst month since 1998.

Investors have been shaken by recent economic and political developments, including the abrupt resignation of Defense Secretary Jim Mattis; a partial federal government shutdown; an interest rate hike; speculation that Trump might seek to fire Powell; Mnuchin's calls to US banks; and Trump's sudden decision to withdraw US troops from Syria against the counsel of his national security team.

Some saw Wednesday's rally as digesting Mnuchin's calls to bankers.

""It's an unwind of Monday's reaction to Mnuchin's unexpected phone calls,"" said Simeon Hyman, global investment strategist at ProShares. "" I wouldn't take anything else from it. If you net today and Monday out, it doesn't tell you anything new.""

The president on Christmas Day cast fresh doubt on the record of Powell, whom he has increasingly blamed for the market weakness.

""Well, we'll see,"" the president said when a journalist asked whether he had confidence in Powell. ""They're raising interest rates too fast; that's my opinion. But I certainly have confidence ... I think that they will get it pretty soon. I really do.""

Presidents are rarely happy with interest rate increases, but Trump's vocal criticism of Powell has Wall Street concerned.

""Markets are becoming more rattled by criticism of the Fed,"" said Kristina Hooper, Invesco chief global market strategist. ""The Fed instilled confidence despite the global financial crisis and government shutdowns. So while there is a minority view that stocks would rally if Powell were to be replaced, I believe it would cause a serious sell-off because of what it represents.""

""Having said that,"" Hooper said, ""the Fed should be more flexible regarding balance sheet normalisation, given how powerful a tool it is."""
72,stuff,http://www.stuff.co.nz/world/americas/109653535/Donald-Trump-threatens-to-shut-down-border-as-US-government-shutdown-drags-on,"With the partial US government shutdown headed toward its second week and no resolution in sight, US President Donald Trump issued a string of tweets in which he once again vowed to close the entire US border with Mexico and halt aid to several Latin American countries unless Democrats agree to his demand for billions of dollars in wall funding.

Trump is also cancelling plans to visit his Florida resort, Mar-a-Lago, and will remain in Washington DC over the New Year holiday, Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney said.

About 25 per cent of the federal government has been shut down since Saturday, with roughly 800,000 workers affected, including an estimated 350,000 who are on furlough at home.

""We will be forced to close the Southern Border entirely if the Obstructionist Democrats do not give us the money to finish the Wall & also change the ridiculous immigration laws that our Country is saddled with,"" Trump said in a Friday morning (Saturday NZ Time) tweet.

* Stress mounts for workers caught up in US government shutdown fight

* White House, congressional Democrats see no deal on border wall shutdown

* 'Cold reality' of partial US government shutdown sinks in, with no end in sight

* Post-Christmas holiday, partial US government shutdown to gain impact

In a reprise of his threat before the midterm elections to cut off aid to Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador as a caravan of migrants was making its way toward the United States, Trump said that those three countries ""are doing nothing for the United States but taking our money.""

""Word is that a new Caravan is forming in Honduras and they are doing nothing about it,"" he said, without providing further details. ""We will be cutting off all aid to these 3 countries - taking advantage of US for years!""

Despite Trump's threat, the United States this month announced a new collaboration with Mexico on a programme to curb migration from Central American countries, with much of the US$10.6 billion (NZ$15.8 billion) contribution to be drawn from existing aid programmes.

Trump's tweets come as Congress has effectively given up on breaking the impasse over the president's demands for border-wall funding, all but ensuring that the partial government shutdown will stretch into at least the start of the new year.

The House and the Senate convened for just minutes on Thursday (Friday NZT) before gavelling closed until next week. During the brief session in the House, Republicans shot down a Democratic attempt to vote on legislation to reopen the government.

As he did Thursday (Friday NZT), Trump remained out of public view on Friday (Saturday NZT). In an appearance on Fox News, Mulvaney said that the president had ""cancelled his plans for Christmas, and now he's cancelled his plan for New Year's.""

""He's staying in Washington DC over New Year's,"" said Mulvaney, who is set to become Trump's acting chief of staff next month.

Even though Trump will be in town and Republicans control both chambers of Congress, Mulvaney acknowledged that little progress on a deal is expected until the start of the new Congress on January 3, when Democrats will retake the House. Contending that Democrats ""have simply shut down the discussions,"" he sought to place the blame on House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat from California, who is expected to be elected speaker in the new Congress.

""Nancy Pelosi, in fairness, does not have the votes for the speakership yet,"" Mulvaney said. ""She cannot be seen by her party as being weak on negotiating with Donald Trump. So we fully expect that until she is elected speaker and has locked that vote up, we don't expect to hear from the Democrats again.""

According to a Washington Post tally, Pelosi, who won the Democratic caucus's nomination for the speakership in late November, appears to have secured enough support to be elected speaker in January.

Pelosi's spokesman, Drew Hammill, said in a statement that Democrats ""are united against the President's immoral, ineffective and expensive wall - the wall that he specifically promised that Mexico would pay for.""

Democrats will not consider any offers that have not been publicly endorsed by Trump himself, he said.

""While we await the president's public proposal, Democrats have made it clear that, under a House Democratic majority, we will vote swiftly to reopen government on Day One,"" Hammill said.

At the heart of the stalemate is Trump's demand for US$5 billion (NZ$7.5 billion) in funding for his proposed wall at the US-Mexico border. Congressional Democrats have rejected that figure and in recent weeks have refused to publicly endorse a figure above US$1.3 billion (NZ$1.9 billion), which continues existing funding levels and includes money for new border fencing and levee walls, but not the concrete wall Trump once demanded before he started more recently talking about ""steel slats.""

Mulvaney said on Friday (Saturday NZT) that ""some folks use the term 'wall' and they mean different things.""

""Everyone agrees that what we can and should be building on that southern border is that steel barrier that the president tweeted out. That's what he wants to build. The Democrats, believe it or not, don't call that a wall,"" he said."
73,stuff,http://www.stuff.co.nz/world/americas/109805159/Can-Donald-Trump-actually-declare-an-emergency-to-build-his-wall,"Trump is considering declaring a national emergency if Democrats do not approve of US$5.7 billion in funding to build a wall.

The Trump administration is weighing using a national emergency declaration to circumvent Congress and the budget stalemate and force construction of the president's long-promised southern border wall.

""We're looking at a national emergency because we have a national emergency,"" US President Donald Trump told reporters on Sunday amid stalled negotiations.

He said during a press conference on Friday that he would prefer to win the money he's demanding via Congress, but could ""absolutely"" call an emergency ""and build it very quickly"".

Such a move would be a dramatic escalation of the current showdown, which has forced a partial government shutdown that's now in its third week.

* Border wall impasse: Trump's national emergency idea is doomed to fail

* 'Cold reality' of partial US government shutdown sinks in, with no end in sight

* Trump vows not to reopen federal government until wall funding is secured

The administration has spent months trying to figure out how the president might be able to move forward with the wall - the central promise of his 2016 campaign - if Congress refuses to give him the money.

As early as last March, Trump was publicly floating the idea of using the military for the task. ""Building a great Border Wall, with drugs (poison) and enemy combatants pouring into our Country, is all about National Defense. Build WALL through M!"" he tweeted then.

But it's Congress - not the president - that controls the country's purse strings and must appropriate money he wants to spend.

Enter the emergency declaration, an option the White House counsel's office is currently reviewing. Among the laws Trump could turn to is Section 2808 of the Title 10 US Code pertaining to military construction.

According to the statute, if the president declares an emergency ""that requires use of the armed forces"", the Defense secretary ""may undertake military construction projects, and may authorize the Secretaries of the military departments to undertake military construction projects, not otherwise authorized by law that are necessary to support such use of the armed forces.""

Pentagon budget officials are analysing the 2019 construction budget to determine how many unobligated dollars would be available to use for the wall if Trump settles on a declaration. Under the provision, only those construction budget funds that are not already obligated to other construction projects could be used for the wall.

There are more than 100 such provisions giving the president access to special powers in emergencies. And Congress has typically afforded the president broad authority to determine what constitutes an emergency and what does not, said Elizabeth Goitein, co-director of the liberty and national security programme at the Brennan Center for Justice.

""Absolutely it's an abuse of power for the president to declare a national emergency when none exists and to use it to try to get around the democratic process,"" she said. ""But we are in a situation where our legal system for emergency powers almost invites that kind of abuse.""

WHAT WOULD HAPPEN THEN?

Such a move is sure to spark a flood of legal challenges questioning the president's authority as well as whether the situation at the border really constitutes an emergency. Trump has been trying to press that case in recent days, insisting the situation qualifies as a security and humanitarian ""crisis"".

He'll also run into other questions.

""The problem for the Trump administration is that border security is fundamentally a law enforcement issue that does not require the use of the military,"" said Todd Harrison, a defence budget expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, via email. ""So I think they would be on shaky legal ground trying to use emergency authorities this way, and it is almost certain that they would end up in court.""

Senator Jack Reed, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, said it would be inappropriate for Trump to use Section 2808.

""We are not at war with Mexico, and the proposed border wall has no core (Defense Department) function. Indeed, the Pentagon's most recent National Defense Strategy doesn't mention the southern border as a national defense priority,"" said Reed.

House Armed Services Committee Chairman Adam Smith, speaking on CNN, said that even if Trump could declare an emergency, it would be a ""huge mistake"".

""There clearly is no national emergency. But they asked me, 'Can he do it?' Yeah he can. It would be wrong, it would be horrible policy and I'm totally and completely against it. But from a legal standpoint he can do it,"" said Smith, a Democrat.

He and others agreed that any declaration would surely be challenged in court.

SO WILL HE DO IT?

It's unclear. Back when Trump dispatched active-duty troops to the southern border ahead of the midterm elections in what critics panned as a politically motivated abuse of power, he described the situation as a ""national emergency,"" but never signed an official proclamation.

But Trump is now under growing pressure to find a way to end the shutdown without appearing as though he's caved on the wall.

Trump ""needs to use every tool available to him as the commander-in-chief of our armed services to go and enforce our laws by putting the military on our southern border, by having them build the wall if they need to,"" his former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski urged on Fox News.

Trump will be delivering an Oval Office prime time address on Tuesday night in which he plans ""to make his case to the American people, talking about how this is a humanitarian crisis and a national security crisis"", said White House spokeswoman Mercedes Schlapp. He'll also be travelling to the border on Thursday to continue to press his case.

She declined to say whether the president had made up his mind about a declaration, but said his aides have been ""working with counsel's office to find resources for securing the border."""

Trump tried to create his own White House rally on Christmas Day when he suggested that the pullback in US stock markets is a good buying opportunity for investors.

""We have companies - the greatest in the world, and they're doing really well,"" Trump told reporters at the White House. ""They have record kinds of numbers. So I think it's a tremendous opportunity to buy. Really a great opportunity to buy.""

All three major US indexes - Dow, S&P and Nasdaq - finished down 2 per cent or more on Christmas Eve. The Dow closed down 653 points.

Ten of the S&P's 11 sectors are in correction coming into Wednesday, although all were higher in early trades. A correction is generally defined as a 20 per cent retreat off recent highs.

The Dow's 30 blue chips are close behind, down 4034 points in December - about 13.63 per cent - and nearly 5000 points off its September high. The composite of some of America's most important companies is on track for its worst month since 1998.

Investors have been shaken by recent economic and political developments, including the abrupt resignation of Defense Secretary Jim Mattis; a partial federal government shutdown; an interest rate hike; speculation that Trump might seek to fire Powell; Mnuchin's calls to US banks; and Trump's sudden decision to withdraw US troops from Syria against the counsel of his national security team.

Some saw Wednesday's rally as digesting Mnuchin's calls to bankers.

""It's an unwind of Monday's reaction to Mnuchin's unexpected phone calls,"" said Simeon Hyman, global investment strategist at ProShares. "" I wouldn't take anything else from it. If you net today and Monday out, it doesn't tell you anything new.""

The president on Christmas Day cast fresh doubt on the record of Powell, whom he has increasingly blamed for the market weakness.

""Well, we'll see,"" the president said when a journalist asked whether he had confidence in Powell. ""They're raising interest rates too fast; that's my opinion. But I certainly have confidence ... I think that they will get it pretty soon. I really do.""

Presidents are rarely happy with interest rate increases, but Trump's vocal criticism of Powell has Wall Street concerned.

""Markets are becoming more rattled by criticism of the Fed,"" said Kristina Hooper, Invesco chief global market strategist. ""The Fed instilled confidence despite the global financial crisis and government shutdowns. So while there is a minority view that stocks would rally if Powell were to be replaced, I believe it would cause a serious sell-off because of what it represents.""

""Having said that,"" Hooper said, ""the Fed should be more flexible regarding balance sheet normalisation, given how powerful a tool it is."""

Stocks have climbed back from their epic Christmas Eve plunge as all three indexes posted big gains.

The Dow Jones industrial average roared more than 1050 points in late afternoon - nearly 5 per cent - as stocks snapped a four-day losing streak that had placed the 10-year bull market on the edge of death on Monday.

""Today the market's message is that we have nothing to fear but fear itself,"" said Ed Yardeni, president of Yardeni Research. ""The recent selloff reflected fears of an impending recession which were blown away today by Amazon and other retailers reporting a record holiday selling season. Santa is back.""

White House economic adviser Kevin Hassett tried to bring some calm to the markets earlier on Wednesday when he assured reporters that Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome H Powell's job is ""100 per cent safe"". The market started surging after his remarks.

* Wall Street's sliding but no-one worried about the banks, until Donald Trump's Treasury Secretary spoke

* Chaos predicted if US Fed chair sacked by Donald Trump, angry about rising interest rates

""Yes, of course, 100 per cent,"" said Hassett, the chairman of the president's Council of Economic Advisers, when asked by reporters at the White House if Powell's job is safe. ""Absolutely.""

Hassett, in an appearance on Fox Business Network, also said US President Donald Trump ""is very happy"" with Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin. Mnuchin created worry last weekend when he phoned the chief executives of US banks regarding the economy.

Trump's criticism of the Fed and Powell has shaken Wall Street as it weathers its worst December in history.

The Dow was whirling between slightly negative to 200 points up in the first hours of Wednesday's session before its early afternoon lift on the tails of surging blue chips Apple, Home Depot, Microsoft, Visa and Nike. Facebook and Amazon shares were up more than 6 per cent each.

All three major indexes were on pace to snap a four-day losing streak. The S&P 500 and technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite also bounced. The Nasdaq was up more than 5 per cent and the S&P posted a nearly 5 per cent percent pop by closing.

Crude oil prices surged, posting their biggest increase in two years after a 30-per cent plus drop since October. West Texas Intermediate crude was up nearly 10 per cent at around US$46 (NZ$68) per barrel. Benchmark Brent crude increased more than 8.5 per cent to more than US$54 per barrel.

76,stuff,https://www.stuff.co.nz/world/americas/109653535/donald-trump-threatens-to-shut-down-border-as-us-government-shutdown-drags-on,"With the partial US government shutdown headed toward its second week and no resolution in sight, US President Donald Trump issued a string of tweets in which he once again vowed to close the entire US border with Mexico and halt aid to several Latin American countries unless Democrats agree to his demand for billions of dollars in wall funding.

Trump is also cancelling plans to visit his Florida resort, Mar-a-Lago, and will remain in Washington DC over the New Year holiday, Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney said.

About 25 per cent of the federal government has been shut down since Saturday, with roughly 800,000 workers affected, including an estimated 350,000 who are on furlough at home.

""We will be forced to close the Southern Border entirely if the Obstructionist Democrats do not give us the money to finish the Wall & also change the ridiculous immigration laws that our Country is saddled with,"" Trump said in a Friday morning (Saturday NZ Time) tweet.

* Stress mounts for workers caught up in US government shutdown fight

* White House, congressional Democrats see no deal on border wall shutdown

* 'Cold reality' of partial US government shutdown sinks in, with no end in sight

* Post-Christmas holiday, partial US government shutdown to gain impact

In a reprise of his threat before the midterm elections to cut off aid to Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador as a caravan of migrants was making its way toward the United States, Trump said that those three countries ""are doing nothing for the United States but taking our money.""

""Word is that a new Caravan is forming in Honduras and they are doing nothing about it,"" he said, without providing further details. ""We will be cutting off all aid to these 3 countries - taking advantage of US for years!""

Despite Trump's threat, the United States this month announced a new collaboration with Mexico on a programme to curb migration from Central American countries, with much of the US$10.6 billion (NZ$15.8 billion) contribution to be drawn from existing aid programmes.

Trump's tweets come as Congress has effectively given up on breaking the impasse over the president's demands for border-wall funding, all but ensuring that the partial government shutdown will stretch into at least the start of the new year.

The House and the Senate convened for just minutes on Thursday (Friday NZT) before gavelling closed until next week. During the brief session in the House, Republicans shot down a Democratic attempt to vote on legislation to reopen the government.

As he did Thursday (Friday NZT), Trump remained out of public view on Friday (Saturday NZT). In an appearance on Fox News, Mulvaney said that the president had ""cancelled his plans for Christmas, and now he's cancelled his plan for New Year's.""

""He's staying in Washington DC over New Year's,"" said Mulvaney, who is set to become Trump's acting chief of staff next month.

Even though Trump will be in town and Republicans control both chambers of Congress, Mulvaney acknowledged that little progress on a deal is expected until the start of the new Congress on January 3, when Democrats will retake the House. Contending that Democrats ""have simply shut down the discussions,"" he sought to place the blame on House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat from California, who is expected to be elected speaker in the new Congress.

""Nancy Pelosi, in fairness, does not have the votes for the speakership yet,"" Mulvaney said. ""She cannot be seen by her party as being weak on negotiating with Donald Trump. So we fully expect that until she is elected speaker and has locked that vote up, we don't expect to hear from the Democrats again.""

According to a Washington Post tally, Pelosi, who won the Democratic caucus's nomination for the speakership in late November, appears to have secured enough support to be elected speaker in January.

Pelosi's spokesman, Drew Hammill, said in a statement that Democrats ""are united against the President's immoral, ineffective and expensive wall - the wall that he specifically promised that Mexico would pay for.""

Democrats will not consider any offers that have not been publicly endorsed by Trump himself, he said.

""While we await the president's public proposal, Democrats have made it clear that, under a House Democratic majority, we will vote swiftly to reopen government on Day One,"" Hammill said.

At the heart of the stalemate is Trump's demand for US$5 billion (NZ$7.5 billion) in funding for his proposed wall at the US-Mexico border. Congressional Democrats have rejected that figure and in recent weeks have refused to publicly endorse a figure above US$1.3 billion (NZ$1.9 billion), which continues existing funding levels and includes money for new border fencing and levee walls, but not the concrete wall Trump once demanded before he started more recently talking about ""steel slats.""

Mulvaney said on Friday (Saturday NZT) that ""some folks use the term 'wall' and they mean different things.""

""Everyone agrees that what we can and should be building on that southern border is that steel barrier that the president tweeted out. That's what he wants to build. The Democrats, believe it or not, don't call that a wall,"" he said."
77,stuff,http://www.stuff.co.nz/world/americas/109648108/US-government-shutdown-leads-to-suspension-of-court-cases-involving-Donald-Trump,"The partial US government shutdown has lead to the suspension of several lawsuits in which US President Donald Trump is a defendant.

The partial US government shutdown prompted the chief judge of Manhattan federal courts to suspend work on civil cases involving US government lawyers, giving President Donald Trump a reprieve from the progress of some litigation he faces.

US District Judge Colleen McMahon said that the suspension, requested by US attorneys, will remain in effect for civil litigation involving the United States, its agencies, and its employees until the business day after Trump signs a budget appropriation law restoring Justice Department funding.

The Manhattan courts, with several dozen judges, are among the nation's busiest courts.

In the Eastern District of New York in Brooklyn, Chief Judge Dora L Irizarry issued an order Wednesday saying the court ""will continue to hear and decide cases without disruption.''

* Why the US government shutdown won't hurt Donald Trump

* Trump vows not to reopen federal government until wall funding is secured

* 'Cold reality' of partial US government shutdown sinks in, with no end in sight

* White House, congressional Democrats see no deal on border wall shutdown

Consistent with that order, Judge William F Kuntz II on Wednesday denied a request by US government lawyers to delay work on a lawsuit against Trump and other defendants. The government had said in court papers that Justice Department attorneys are prohibited from working, ""even on a voluntary basis, except in very limited circumstances.''

The request was made in a lawsuit accusing the Trump administration of an arbitrary and capricious action and racism for taking away the temporary protected status of 50,000 Haitians after a devastating earthquake that killed tens of thousands of people. The lawsuit recounted numerous instances in which it said Trump had expressed ""his animus toward immigrants of colour and Haitians in particular.''

In Manhattan, McMahon's order suspends action in several civil lawsuits in which Trump is a defendant.

In one, a judge last week ruled that a group of people suing Trump, the Trump Company, and his three eldest children can remain anonymous because they fear retaliation by the president or his followers.

US District Judge Lorna G Schofield accused Trump of using his ""position and platform'' in unprecedented fashion to affect court cases. She ruled in a lawsuit in which four plaintiffs sought class-action status to sue for money they lost in a marketing company Trump endorsed in speeches and on The Celebrity Apprentice.

Government lawyers also are defending Trump against a lawsuit in which the PEN American Center, a literary and human rights organisation, accused Trump of violating the First Amendment and his oath to defend the Constitution through ""official acts'' he has taken.

Another lawsuit against Trump, the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Federal Communications Commission claims that the defendants unconstitutionally enabled Trump to issue Presidential Alerts to cellular telephone users."
78,stuff,https://www.stuff.co.nz/world/americas/109805159/can-donald-trump-actually-declare-an-emergency-to-build-his-wall,"Trump threatens to declare a national emergency to get wall built if Democrats do not give him the $5bn he's requested.

The Trump administration is weighing using a national emergency declaration to circumvent Congress and the budget stalemate and force construction of the president's long-promised southern border wall.

""We're looking at a national emergency because we have a national emergency,"" US President Donald Trump told reporters on Sunday amid stalled negotiations.

He said during a press conference on Friday that he would prefer to win the money he's demanding via Congress, but could ""absolutely"" call an emergency ""and build it very quickly"".

Such a move would be a dramatic escalation of the current showdown, which has forced a partial government shutdown that's now in its third week.

* Border wall impasse: Trump's national emergency idea is doomed to fail

* 'Cold reality' of partial US government shutdown sinks in, with no end in sight

* Trump vows not to reopen federal government until wall funding is secured

The administration has spent months trying to figure out how the president might be able to move forward with the wall - the central promise of his 2016 campaign - if Congress refuses to give him the money.

As early as last March, Trump was publicly floating the idea of using the military for the task. ""Building a great Border Wall, with drugs (poison) and enemy combatants pouring into our Country, is all about National Defense. Build WALL through M!"" he tweeted then.

But it's Congress - not the president - that controls the country's purse strings and must appropriate money he wants to spend.

Enter the emergency declaration, an option the White House counsel's office is currently reviewing. Among the laws Trump could turn to is Section 2808 of the Title 10 US Code pertaining to military construction.

According to the statute, if the president declares an emergency ""that requires use of the armed forces"", the Defense secretary ""may undertake military construction projects, and may authorize the Secretaries of the military departments to undertake military construction projects, not otherwise authorized by law that are necessary to support such use of the armed forces.""

Pentagon budget officials are analysing the 2019 construction budget to determine how many unobligated dollars would be available to use for the wall if Trump settles on a declaration. Under the provision, only those construction budget funds that are not already obligated to other construction projects could be used for the wall.

There are more than 100 such provisions giving the president access to special powers in emergencies. And Congress has typically afforded the president broad authority to determine what constitutes an emergency and what does not, said Elizabeth Goitein, co-director of the liberty and national security programme at the Brennan Center for Justice.

""Absolutely it's an abuse of power for the president to declare a national emergency when none exists and to use it to try to get around the democratic process,"" she said. ""But we are in a situation where our legal system for emergency powers almost invites that kind of abuse.""

WHAT WOULD HAPPEN THEN?

Such a move is sure to spark a flood of legal challenges questioning the president's authority as well as whether the situation at the border really constitutes an emergency. Trump has been trying to press that case in recent days, insisting the situation qualifies as a security and humanitarian ""crisis"".

He'll also run into other questions.

""The problem for the Trump administration is that border security is fundamentally a law enforcement issue that does not require the use of the military,"" said Todd Harrison, a defence budget expert at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, via email. ""So I think they would be on shaky legal ground trying to use emergency authorities this way, and it is almost certain that they would end up in court.""

Senator Jack Reed, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, said it would be inappropriate for Trump to use Section 2808.

""We are not at war with Mexico, and the proposed border wall has no core (Defense Department) function. Indeed, the Pentagon's most recent National Defense Strategy doesn't mention the southern border as a national defense priority,"" said Reed.

House Armed Services Committee Chairman Adam Smith, speaking on CNN, said that even if Trump could declare an emergency, it would be a ""huge mistake"".

""There clearly is no national emergency. But they asked me, 'Can he do it?' Yeah he can. It would be wrong, it would be horrible policy and I'm totally and completely against it. But from a legal standpoint he can do it,"" said Smith, a Democrat.

He and others agreed that any declaration would surely be challenged in court.

SO WILL HE DO IT?

It's unclear. Back when Trump dispatched active-duty troops to the southern border ahead of the midterm elections in what critics panned as a politically motivated abuse of power, he described the situation as a ""national emergency,"" but never signed an official proclamation.

But Trump is now under growing pressure to find a way to end the shutdown without appearing as though he's caved on the wall.

Trump ""needs to use every tool available to him as the commander-in-chief of our armed services to go and enforce our laws by putting the military on our southern border, by having them build the wall if they need to,"" his former campaign manager Corey Lewandowski urged on Fox News.

Trump will be delivering an Oval Office prime time address on Tuesday night in which he plans ""to make his case to the American people, talking about how this is a humanitarian crisis and a national security crisis"", said White House spokeswoman Mercedes Schlapp. He'll also be travelling to the border on Thursday to continue to press his case.

She declined to say whether the president had made up his mind about a declaration, but said his aides have been ""working with counsel's office to find resources for securing the border."""
79,stuff,http://www.stuff.co.nz/world/americas/109555521/Under-siege-Donald-Trump-propels-US-government-and-markets-into-crisis,"ANALYSIS: US President Donald Trump began his day under siege, listening to howls of indignation from conservatives over his border wall and thrusting the government toward a shutdown.

He ended it by announcing the exit of the man US allies see as the last guardrail against the president's erratic behaviour: Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, whose resignation letter was a scathing rebuke of Trump's worldview.

At perhaps the most fragile moment of his presidency, and vulnerable to convulsions on the political right, Trump single-handedly propelled the US government into crisis and sent markets tumbling with his gambits this week to salvage signature campaign promises.

The president's decisions and conduct have led to a fracturing of Trump's coalition. Hawks condemned his sudden decision to withdraw US troops from Syria. Conservatives called him a ""gutless president"" and questioned whether he would ever build a wall. Political friends began privately questioning whether Trump needed to be reined in.

* Trump's Defence Secretary quits, after clash over Syria withdrawal

* Donald Trump claims victory over Isis, orders full withdrawal from Syria

* Trump pushes government closer to a shutdown,

* Trump on verge of giving up best chance to secure border wall money

* Trump calls for Justice Department investigation of op-ed writer

* Donald Trump willing to shut down US government over border security

After campaigning on shrinking America's footprint in overseas wars, Trump abruptly declared that he was withdrawing US troops from Syria, a move Mattis and other advisers counselled against. And officials said today that Trump is preparing to send thousands of troops home from Afghanistan as well.

The president also issued an ultimatum to Congress to fund construction of his promised US-Mexico border wall, a move poised to result in a government shutdown just before Christmas.

Trump and his aides had signalled tacit support for a short-term spending compromise that would avert the shutdown, but the president abruptly changed course after absorbing a deluge of criticism from some of his most high-profile loyalists.

Leon Panetta, who served as former defense secretary, CIA director and White House chief of staff for Democratic presidents, said, ""We're in a constant state of chaos right now in this country."" He added, ""While it may satisfy [Trump's] need for attention, it's raising hell with the country.""

Panetta said the resignation of Mattis is a singular moment and his letter, which underscores how Mattis sees Trump's approach as misguided, ""puts the security of the nation right now at some degree of risk.""

Trump has been isolated in bunker mode in recent weeks as political and personal crises mount, according to interviews with 27 current and former White House officials, Republican lawmakers and outside advisers to the president, some of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity to offer candid assessments.

""There's going to be an intervention,"" one former senior administration official said speculatively. ""Jim Mattis just sent a shot across the bow. He's the most credible member of the administration by five grades of magnitude. He's the steady, safe set of hands. And this letter is brutal. He quit because of the madness.""

In his resignation letter, Mattis wrote, ""My views on treating allies with respect and also being clear-eyed about malign actors and strategic competitors are strongly held and informed by over four decades of immersion in these issues. Because you have the right to a Secretary of Defense whose views are better aligned with yours on these and other subjects, I believe it is right for me to step down from my position.""

Although Trump's relationship with Mattis has been rocky for months, the president spent the first part of his Thursday (Friday NZT) focused on another fraying relationship: with his conservative base.

As criticism over his capitulation on the wall grew louder by the hour, Trump complained to friends and aides that he felt politically shackled. He had no plan, but was spoiling for a fight. By midday Washington time, the president picked one.

""I've made my position very clear: Any measure that funds the government must include border security. Has to,"" Trump said Thursday. He added that he had ""no choice"" but to act.

Trump's advisers acknowledged that the funding may not be secured in the end, but boasted that the spectacle would be remembered favourably by his base voters as proof of his mettle. A wall funding proposal was approved by the House late Thursday, but faced uncertain prospects in the Senate.

Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, habitually careful in his approach to Trump, avoided strong-arming the president in their recent exchanges, knowing that urging him to stand down on the wall funding likely would only embolden him, according to two people familiar with the discussions.

At every turn, McConnell confided to Trump that congressional efforts this month - from the passage of the farm bill to bipartisan criminal-justice reform - were a string of victories for him, the people said.

Thanks to McConnell's soothing, there was cautious optimism that the president would eventually sign a funding bill. ""McConnell has a lot to do with it, of course. They talk a lot,"" Republican Representative Harold Rogers, said. ""It's smart to save the fight for another day.""

House Speaker Paul Ryan, - busy this week bidding farewell to Congress after two decades in office - followed McConnell's playbook, pointing out how Trump would be able to battle for wall funding in the new year, a person close to him said.

Both Ryan and House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, told Trump last week that they could not pass a spending bill with $5 billion for wall construction, and McConnell was told by the White House that Trump would sign a short-term bill without it, according to two people familiar with the conversations.

But on Fox News Channel and across conservative media, there was a brewing rebellion. Prominent voices urged Trump to hold firm on his wall money and warned that caving would jeopardise his reelection.

Rush Limbaugh dismissed the compromise bill on his radio program as ""Trump gets nothing and the Democrats get everything."" Another firebrand, Ann Coulter, published a column titled, ""Gutless President in Wall-less Country."" Trump even found resistance on the couch of his favourite show, ""Fox & Friends,"" where reliable Trump-boosting host Brian Kilmeade chided him on the air Thursday.

The president was paying attention. He promptly unfollowed Coulter on Twitter. And he pecked out a series of defensive tweets blaming congressional leaders for not funding the wall, while also staking a defensive posture. He suggested that a massive wall may not be necessary in its entirety because the border already is ""tight"" thanks to the work of Border Patrol agents and troops.

""One of the things he's most vulnerable to is mockery and mockery by his own supporters,"" said Mark Krikorian, a leading anti-immigration activist.

Members of the conservative House Freedom Caucus joined in the rebellion. During House votes on Wednesday evening, caucus chair Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., and other members refused to budge and held court with reporters, railing against the Republican leadership and warning Trump that he was being led astray.

At am Oval Office meeting with Ryan and McCarthy, Trump was calm and did not yell, but was resolute and ""dug in on what he wants,"" said a Republican official briefed on the discussion.

Trump spent six to seven minutes in the meeting with Ryan and McCarthy talking about ""steel slats"" and saying that the term was preferable to calling the proposed construction a ""wall,"" as the president has done for more than three years.

The administration drama comes at an especially perilous juncture for Trump, following his thumping at the polls in November's midterm elections. Democrats are preparing to take control of the House in January and to use their subpoena power to investigate Trump's finances and conduct in office, as well as alleged corruption in the administration.

Meanwhile, Republicans in their last gasp of unified government are divided.

A band of hard-line conservative lawmakers voted against Trump's prison reform legislation, which passed the House and Senate with bipartisan support and is expected to be signed by the US president tommorow.

Many foreign policy hawks, including Republican Senator Lindsey Graham., a Trump confidant, sharply criticised Trump's decision Wednesday to withdraw US troops from Syria.

Inside the Oval Office on Thursday, Trump was in what one Republican close to the White House described as ""a tailspin,"" acting ""totally irrationally"" and ""flipping out"" over criticisms in the media.

Even as aides argued to him that protesting over wall funding could deprive government workers paychecks over Christmas, Trump warned in private conversations with Republican lawmakers that they all would get ""crushed"" if they did not get the wall built.

Trump vented to his advisers that signing the short-term spending bill without wall money would make him look weak and make his base voters think he broke a campaign promise.

He also complained that he did not have sufficient bargaining leverage with Congress and blamed senior aides - including White House legislative affairs director Shahira Knight - for not presenting him with better options.

""He's legitimately saying, 'This is ridiculous. Why would I sign this?'"" said American Conservative Union Chairman Matt Schlapp, whose wife, Mercedes Schlapp, is a senior White House staffer. ""If you're the outsider, you don't want to go along with the same old stupid rules. When he does that, he doesn't look like an outsider.""

Marc Short, Trump's former White House legislative affairs director, said, ""He feels he made a promise to voters that he would build the wall. There is a realisation that with Congress changing hands, that the challenge of getting funding for the wall only gets larger.""

Trump's pin-balling conduct - veering from a promise of a shutdown to moving toward a deal, and then changing his mind - has vexed members of his own party. Many Republican lawmakers said they sense that Trump is adjusting uneasily to the dynamics of soon-to-be divided government and lashing out to reclaim some of his dominance over the congressional agenda.

The defense secretary's resignation compounded the concern.

""Having Mattis there gave all of us a great deal more comfort than we have now,"" retiring Republican Senator Jeff Flake, said. ""Chaos has kind of been the norm but it seems to have been heightened. Sometimes you think it's got to settle, and then another thing happens."""
80,stuff,http://www.stuff.co.nz/world/americas/109806985/President-Donald-Trump-addresses-the-USA-from-the-White-House-live,"United States President Donald Trump has addressed the nation over the partial government shutdown and the proposed Mexico border wall.

In his first live TV address from the Oval Office in the White House since coming to power in January 2017, he told his fellow Americans on Wednesday that the immigration issues amounted to a ""humanitarian crisis"".

As a result he said he would deliver on a Homeland Security proposal which included a series of measures to improve security, including the building of a steel barrier. This barrier would replace the much-talked about wall he had planned.

""The border wall would pay for itself. The cost of illegal drugs exceeds $500 billion a year, vastly more than the $5.7 billion we have requested from Congress,"" Trump said.

Trump explained in his speech the barrier was critical to security with thousands of Americans killed by those who had illegally entered the country.

Trump was this week considering declaring a national emergency to provide funding to get work started on the border wall he pledged during the 2016 Presidential elections.

During the campaigning he pledged Mexico would pay for the wall, but since taking office he has been unable to achieve this, and is now attempting to use US taxpayer funds to the tune of US$5.7 billion (NZ$8.5b).

Efforts to execute this via Congress have been blocked by lawmakers, causing a partial government shutdown as the wall funding was part of wider legislation that secured money for the running of government, including employee salaries.

The impasse between the Democrat-controlled House of Representatives and the Republican president has forced Trump's hand to consider alternative funding, something a national emergency would provide through a military construction budget."

US District Judge Colleen McMahon said that the suspension, requested by US attorneys, will remain in effect for civil litigation involving the United States, its agencies, and its employees until the business day after Trump signs a budget appropriation law restoring Justice Department funding.

The Manhattan courts, with several dozen judges, are among the nation's busiest courts.

In the Eastern District of New York in Brooklyn, Chief Judge Dora L Irizarry issued an order Wednesday saying the court ""will continue to hear and decide cases without disruption.''

* 'Very possible' shutdown could last into new year, White House budget director Mick Mulvaney says

* Why the US government shutdown won't hurt Donald Trump

* Trump vows not to reopen federal government until wall funding is secured

* 'Cold reality' of partial US government shutdown sinks in, with no end in sight

* White House, congressional Democrats see no deal on border wall shutdown

Consistent with that order, Judge William F Kuntz II on Wednesday denied a request by US government lawyers to delay work on a lawsuit against Trump and other defendants. The government had said in court papers that Justice Department attorneys are prohibited from working, ""even on a voluntary basis, except in very limited circumstances.''

The request was made in a lawsuit accusing the Trump administration of an arbitrary and capricious action and racism for taking away the temporary protected status of 50,000 Haitians after a devastating earthquake that killed tens of thousands of people. The lawsuit recounted numerous instances in which it said Trump had expressed ""his animus toward immigrants of colour and Haitians in particular.''

In Manhattan, McMahon's order suspends action in several civil lawsuits in which Trump is a defendant.

In one, a judge last week ruled that a group of people suing Trump, the Trump Company, and his three eldest children can remain anonymous because they fear retaliation by the president or his followers.

US District Judge Lorna G Schofield accused Trump of using his ""position and platform'' in unprecedented fashion to affect court cases. She ruled in a lawsuit in which four plaintiffs sought class-action status to sue for money they lost in a marketing company Trump endorsed in speeches and on The Celebrity Apprentice.

Government lawyers also are defending Trump against a lawsuit in which the PEN American Center, a literary and human rights organisation, accused Trump of violating the First Amendment and his oath to defend the Constitution through ""official acts'' he has taken.

Another lawsuit against Trump, the Federal Emergency Management Agency and the Federal Communications Commission claims that the defendants unconstitutionally enabled Trump to issue Presidential Alerts to cellular telephone users."
82,new york post,https://nypost.com/2018/12/20/gofundme-for-border-wall-raises-more-than-1m-in-just-3-days/,"A supporter of President Trump's border wall proposal has started a GoFundMe to help pay for the project -- and the fund skyrocketed to nearly $2 million on Wednesday night after being live for just three days.

Brian Kolfage, a Trump voter and disabled Iraq War veteran with no connection to the administration, wrote that he set up the page because ""President Trump's main campaign promise was to BUILD THE WALL. And as he's followed through on just about every promise so far, this wall project needs to be completed still.""

Trump campaigned on building a ""great wall"" on the southern border during the 2016 presidential election.

As the end of Trump's second year in office comes to a close, his administration has not built the wall or secured funds for it -- and a budget proposal passed Wednesday by the Senate did not fulfill Trump's call to provide funds for it.

Kolfage's wrote on his fundraising page that if every Trump voter donates $80 to his wall-building campaign, they will raise $5 billion needed to build the border wall.

""Even if we get half, that's half the wall. We can do this,"" Kolfage wrote on the GoFundMe page.

As of Wednesday night, the campaign had raised nearly $2 million, with large and small donations pouring in nearly every minute.

Kolfage assured donors that he has contacted the Trump administration and every penny of their donations would go to funding the ""Trump wall.""

""We have many very high level contacts already helping,"" he wrote."
83,business insider,https://www.businessinsider.com/coast-guard-families-feel-strain-with-1st-missed-paycheck-of-shutdown-2019-1,"Twenty-four days after the government shuttered, Coast Guard members will miss their first paycheck on January 15. The service has been without funding to pay them since the government shutdown on December 21. Coast Guardsmen are still working around the world, and communities throughout the US are organizing to support them and their families. ""It's worrisome. I have to put food in my family's belly,"" said Coast Guard mechanic Kyle Turcott, who is working without pay. ""It's hard to focus on search and rescue if you don't know whether your kids and family are going to have a roof over their head and food on the table,"" a Coast Guard spouse said.

Twenty-four days into the longest government shutdown in US history, the strain is being felt acutely by the US Coast Guard, as some 42,000 active-duty members are preparing to miss their first paycheck on January 15.

In a January 10 letter, Vice Commandant Adm. Charles Ray said that without an appropriation or funding measure, ""the Coast Guard will not be able to meet the next payroll,"" an extreme disruption that officials averted in late December by moving funds around.

""Let me assure you your leadership continues to do everything possible, both internal and external to the Service, to ensure we can process your pay as soon as we receive an appropriation,"" Ray added. ""However, I do not know when that will occur.""

The Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps are funded through the Defense Department, which got it its fiscal year 2019 budget in the fall, and none of their troops are missing a paycheck.

But the Coast Guard, while technically a military branch, is funded through the Homeland Security Department, funding for which has been held up amid a dispute between President Donald Trump and Congress over $5.7 billion Trump wants to start construction of a wall on the US-Mexico border.

A work-around secured funding for Coast Guard payroll on December 31, paying the service's active-duty members and reservists who drilled before funding lapsed, but service leaders have said it cannot be repeated. Civilian employees are unpaid since December 21.

Active-duty members deemed essential have continued working, as have about 1,300 civilian workers. Most of the service's 8,500 civilian employees have been furloughed, and pay and benefits for some 50,000 retired members and employees could be affected.

The service continues to operate, however.

In the Coast Guard's 14th district, which covers 12.2 million square miles of the Pacific Ocean, 835 active-duty personnel and some civilians are still working from bases in Hawaii and Guam and detachments in Japan and Singapore, carrying out ""essential operations"" such as search-and-rescue and law enforcement, 14th district spokeswoman Chief Sara Muir told Stars and Stripes.

Between December 21 and January 7, the district handled 46 cases, including two major ones, Muir said. On January 13, Coast Guard personnel medevaced a crew member off a fishing vessel 80 miles north of Kauai.

Other operations, like recreational-vessel safety checks and issuing or renewing licenses and other administrative work, has been curtailed. The service has said vendors who provide fuel and other services also won't be paid until funding resumes.

As the shutdown drags on, communities around the country have mustered to support Coast Guard members and families, particularly junior members, many of whom lack savings.

On January 12, dozens of northern Michigan residents gathered for a silent auction and donation event, with funds raised going toward expenses like rent, medical bills, and heating for service members and their families.

""Whenever you cannot predict when you're gonna get your next paycheck, but you know exactly when the bills are due, it causes a lot of stress,"" Kenneth Arbogast, a retired Coast Guard chief petty officer, told UpNorthLive.com.

On January 13, more than 600 service members, including 168 families, gathered in Alameda, California, for a giveaway organized by the East Bay Coast Guard Spouses Club, providing them with everything from fresh fruit to diapers.

""It's worrisome. I have to put food in my family's belly,"" said Coast Guard mechanic Kyle Turcott, who is working without pay. ""Ain't no telling, we may not get paid until the first of next month,"" added Nathan Knight, another service member.

The organizers said they were working on another food drive and could host another distribution event this week.

On January 14, Thomas Edison State University in New Jersey announced that Coast Guard students affected by the shutdown would be able todefer=""defer""payments until tuition assistance was available again. The school has 135 active-duty students - 27 of whom are registered for February.

In Rhode Island, Roger Williams University said that on January 15 it would offer free dining-hall meals to active-duty Coast Guard members and their families from Rhode Island and southeastern Massachusetts.

Navy Federal Credit Union, which serves military members, veterans, and civilian Defense Department employees, has said it would offer no-interest loans up to $6,000 to workers affected by the shutdown, with repayment automatically deducted from paychecks once direct-deposit resumes.

In his January 10 letter, Ray also said that the Coast Guard Mutual Assistance Board had increased the interest-free loans it was offering, focusing on junior members, allowing those with dependents to get up to $1,000.

In Texas, Coast Guard noncommissioned officers have raised money through local chapters of the Coast Guard Petty Officers Association. Last week, they brought in food to cook at Ellington Field Joint Reserve Base, encouraging younger service members to take food home.

Erin Picou, whose husband is a chief petty officer with 17 years experience, said her family could cover the most important bills, but the mortgage for their house, on which they spent their savings six months ago, is less certain.

Measures have been introduced to Congress to ensure pay for Coast Guard members. However, Ray said, ""I cannot predict what course that legislation may take.""

In a Facebook post on Sunday, Coast Guard commandant Adm.

84,stuff,http://www.stuff.co.nz/world/americas/109611014/Post-Christmas-holiday-partial-US-government-shutdown-to-gain-impact,"The empty US Capitol Rotunda is seen during a partial government shutdown in Washington DC.

Christmas has come and gone but the partial government shutdown is just getting started.

Wednesday (Thursday NZ Time) brings the first full business day after several government departments and agencies closed up over the weekend due to a budgetary stalemate between US President Donald Trump and Congress. And there is no end in sight.

So far, the public and federal workers have largely been spared inconvenience and hardship because the government is closed on weekends and federal employees were excused from work on Christmas Eve and Christmas, a federal holiday. The shutdown began at midnight last Friday (Saturday NZT).

Trump said on Tuesday (Wednesday NZT) that the closed parts of the government will remain that way until Democrats agree to wall off the US-Mexico border to deter criminal elements. He said he's open to calling the wall something else as long as he ends up with an actual wall.

* Trump vows not to reopen federal government until wall funding secured

* 'Poor me': Donald Trump 'all alone' on Christmas Eve, waiting on the wall

* Donald Trump could accept less funding for US-Mexico border wall

Asked when the government would reopen fully, Trump said he couldn't say.

""I can't tell you when the government's going to be open. I can tell you it's not going to be open until we have a wall or fence, whatever they'd like to call it,"" Trump said, referring to Democrats who staunchly oppose walling off the border.

""I'll call it whatever they want, but it's all the same thing,"" he told reporters after participating in a holiday video conference with representatives from all five branches of the military stationed in Alaska, Bahrain, Guam and Qatar.

Trump argued that drug flows and human trafficking can only be stopped by a wall.

""We can't do it without a barrier. We can't do it without a wall,"" he said. ""The only way you're going to do it is to have a physical barrier, meaning a wall. And if you don't have that then we're just not opening"" the government.

Democrats oppose spending money on a wall, preferring instead to pump the dollars into fencing, technology and other means of controlling access to the border. Trump argued that Democrats oppose a wall only because he is for one.

The stalemate over how much to spend and how to spend it caused the partial government shutdown that began on Saturday following a lapse in funding for departments and agencies that make up about 25 per cent of the government.

Some 800,000 government workers are affected. Many are on the job but must wait until after the shutdown to be paid again.

Trump claimed that many of these workers ""have said to me and communicated, 'stay out until you get the funding for the wall.' These federal workers want the wall. The only one that doesn't want the wall are the Democrats.""

Trump didn't say how he's hearing from federal workers, excluding those he appointed to their jobs or who work with him in the White House. But many rank-and-file workers have gone to social media with stories of the financial hardship they expect to face because of the shutdown."

United States President Donald Trump has made a sombre televised plea for border wall funding, declaring there is ""a humanitarian crisis, a crisis of the heart and a crisis of the soul"".

Addressing the nation from the Oval Office for the first time, Trump argued for funding on security and humanitarian grounds as he sought to put pressure on newly empowered Democrats amid an extended partial government shutdown.

The shutdown was caused by disagreement over funding for the wall with Trump calling on Democrats to return to the White House to meet with him, saying it was ""immoral"" for ""politicians to do nothing"".

Responding in their own televised remarks, Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer accused Trump of misrepresenting the situation on the border as they urged him to reopen closed government departments and turn loose pay cheques for hundreds of thousands of workers. The shutdown was into its 18th day.

* Can Trump declare an emergency to build his wall?

* Trump aide Kellyanne Conway and CNN reporter clash

* Trump to make prime-time address

* Shutdown could last 'years' - Democrat Chuck Schumer

Schumer said Trump ""just used the backdrop of the Oval Office to manufacture a crisis, stoke fear and divert attention from the turmoil in his administration"".

Pelosi said after the president's address that he had ""chosen fear"" in making the case to the American people for the border wall and Democrats ""want to start with the facts"".

Pelosi said ""we all agree that we need to secure our borders,"" noting the House passed legislation to reopen government on the first day of the new Congress. But Trump rejected it because it didn't have funding for his border wall.

""The fact is: President Trump must stop holding the American people hostage, must stop manufacturing a crisis, and must reopen the government.""

THE CASE FOR A WALL

Trump, who has long railed against illegal immigration at the border, has recently seized on humanitarian concerns to argue there was a broader crisis that could only be solved with a wall. Critics say the security risks are overblown and the administration is at least partly to blame for the humanitarian situation.

In his Wednesday address, Trump used emotional language, referring to Americans who were killed by people in the country illegally, saying: ""I've met with dozens of families whose loved ones were stolen by illegal immigration. I've held the hands of the weeping mothers and embraced the grief-stricken fathers. So sad. So terrible.""

The president often highlights such incidents, though studies over several years have found immigrants are less likely to commit crimes than people born in the United States.

The president said in the address that the ""growing humanitarian and security crisis"" was hurting all Americans and that uncontrolled illegal immigration must be stopped. He said it strained public resources and drove down jobs and wages.

The president said among those hit hardest by illegal immigration were African-Americans and Hispanics, though he did not provide any evidence to back that up.

The president was trying to convince Americans that the flow of immigrants into the US illegally at the southern border was a crisis. He asserted that the government remained shut down because Democrats won't fund border security.

Trump has been discussing declaring a national emergency to allow him to move forward with the wall without getting congressional approval for the US$5.7 billion (NZ$8.5b) he's requested. He did not mention this in the Wednesday address.

POWER OF THE WHITE HOUSE

With his use of a formal White House speech instead of his favoured Twitter blasts, Trump embraced the ceremonial trappings of his office as he tries to exit a political quagmire of his own making.

For weeks he has dug in on a signature campaign promise to his base voters, the pledge to build an impregnable ""beautiful"" wall along the US-Mexico border.

The partial government shutdown reached its 18th day, making the closure the second-longest in history. Hundreds of thousands of federal workers are going without pay, and government disruptions are hitting home with everyday Americans.

In the speech, Trump steered back from speculation he would enact a state of national emergency to secure funds for the construction of a border wall. He did not declare an emergency and instead talked about building a steel barrier rather than a wall. It was just one of several measures he would employ to combat the ""crisis"" at the border.

""The border wall would pay for itself. The cost of illegal drugs exceeds US$500 billion a year, vastly more than the US$5.7 billion we have requested from Congress,"" Trump said.

Trump explained in his speech the barrier was critical to security with thousands of Americans killed by those who had illegally entered the country.

NATIONAL EMERGENCY TALK

Trump was this week considering declaring a national emergency to provide funding to get work started on the border wall he pledged during the 2016 Presidential elections.

During the campaigning he pledged Mexico would pay for the wall, but since taking office he has been unable to achieve this, and is now attempting to use US taxpayer funds to the tune of US$5.7 billion (NZ$8.5b).

Efforts to execute this via Congress have been blocked by lawmakers, causing a partial government shutdown as the wall funding was part of wider legislation that secured money for the running of government, including employee salaries.

The impasse between the Democrat-controlled House of Representatives and the Republican president has forced Trump's hand to consider alternative funding, something a national emergency would provide through a military construction budget."
87,new york post,https://nypost.com/2019/01/14/congress-returns-to-washington-as-longest-government-shutdown-ever-continues/,"Congress returns to Washington on Monday - the 24th day of the partial government shutdown - but there seems to be no end in sight for the impasse between President Trump and lawmakers over funding for a border wall.

The president who remained in Washington, DC, while Congress was adjourned for the weekend reached out to Democratic leaders House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer to return to the negotiating table.

""I've been waiting all weekend. Democrats must get to work now. Border must be secured!,"" Trump wrote on Twitter.

""Nancy and Cryin' Chuck can end the Shutdown in 15 minutes. At this point it has become their, and the Democrats, fault!,"" he posted a few minutes later, employing the nickname he's been using to describe Schumer during the shutdown talks.

He also mocked Democrats who attended a winter retreat in Puerto Rico over the weekend.

""'Dems in Puerto Rico as Shutdown hits day 24.' @foxandfriends,"" Trump tweeted.

The partial shutdown has become the longest in US history after Trump and Congress hit an impasse over funding a wall Trump wants built on the southern border.

The president is seeking $5.7 billion for the barrier, but Democrats have rejected his demands.

Instead the Democrat-controlled House passed legislation that would fund most federal agencies and reopen the government, but the measure hasn't been taken up in the Senate, which has a Republican majority.

Left in the lurch are 800,000 federal employees who have either been working without pay or have been furloughed during the shutdown.

They missed their first payday last Friday.

Trump this week is expected to sign legislation passed by Congress that would allow them to receive retroactive pay - but not until the shutdown ends.

Sen. Lindsey Graham on Sunday said he encouraged Trump to reopen the government for three weeks while negotiations continue on the wall.

If the talks fail, Trump could then resort to using his executive powers to declare a national emergency at the border and build a wall.

""Before he pulls the plug on the legislative option, and I think we're almost there, I would urge him to open up the government for a short period of time, like three weeks, before he pulls the plug, see if we can get a deal. If we can't at the end of three weeks, all bets are off, see if he can do it by himself through the emergency powers,"" the South Carolina Republican said on ""Fox News Sunday.""

As the shutdown continues, the pressure builds on Trump and the GOP.

Two surveys released over the weekend show Americans are pinning the blame for the shutdown on the president and Republicans.

A Washington Post-ABC News poll found that 53 percent of Americans point the finger at Trump and his GOP colleagues, while 29 percent fault Democrats and 13 percent say both parties are to blame.

A CNN poll showed that 55 percent of those surveyed believe Trump responsible, and 32 percent pin the blame on Democrats. Another 9 percent say both parties are at fault.

During a White House meeting last month with Pelosi and Schumer, Trump said he would take responsibility for shutting down the government if they didn't give in to his demand for a wall.

""I'll tell you what, I am proud to shut down the government for border security, Chuck,"" the president told the Democratic leaders on Dec. 11. ""So I will take the mantle. I will be the one to shut it down. I'm not going to blame you for it."""

THE FUTURE OF RUSSIAN DISINFORMATION -- MT caught up with the researchers behind the blockbuster reports unveiled Monday detailing a sweeping online influence campaign by Russia during and after the 2016 election. They told us what to expect from the Internet Research Agency in the years ahead.

-- The reports point to likely 2020 tactics: Bharath Ganesh of Oxford University said trolls are likely to move into the background and ""embed"" themselves among activist groups critical of U.S. institutions in order to amplify their voices. That is, instead of generating their own content to inflame America's social and political divides, they'll likely share, retweet and otherwise engage with genuine, domestically produced content that aligns with those goals, falsely inflating its apparent reach, according to Ganesh and Renee DiResta, a researcher at New Knowledge. DiResta said it's harder to spot manipulation when trolls are able to piggyback off real users conveying the messages they want to spread.

-- Platform hopping to continue: As seen particularly after the 2016 campaign, Russian trolls are no strangers to shifting their resources around the web to circumvent rule changes and controls that social media sites instituted in response to disinformation campaigns and trolls. ""They were complaining about being taken down from one platform and migrating to another,"" Ganesh said of the IRA. And the fact that tech platforms are now seeking them out sets up a ""little arms race,"" DiResta said, as platforms continue to modify their rules and troll monitoring techniques, and trolls then regroup to develop new tactics.

-- Google, Facebook and Twitter under fire: The researchers are also raising fresh questions about how forthcoming Google, Facebook and Twitter have been in sharing data on Russian disinformation. In its report, New Knowledge said social media companies may have chosen to share ""the bare minimum possible"" with researchers. Ganesh said he would ""broadly agree"" with the assertion, arguing that the disclosures from Google were ""incredibly scant"" and ""really limited what we could do."" In statements, Facebook said it continues to cooperate with authorities and Twitter cited its security improvements since 2016. Google declined comment.

CIVIL RIGHTS GROUPS DIAL UP PRESSURE ON FACEBOOK -- A group of 31 civil rights and advocacy organizations, including the Southern Poverty Law Center and Freedom from Facebook, are renewing calls for leadership shake-ups at the social media giant, in a letter out today. Their demands: that CEO Mark Zuckerberg step down as company chairman, that COO Sheryl Sandberg relinquish her role on the company board and that Facebook fire its top Washington executive, Joel Kaplan, whose links to conservative figures have drawn scrutiny, among others.

-- Also today the NAACP is kicking off a #LogOutFacebook boycott of the platform, in response to the latest Russia revelations. Muslim Advocates chief Farhana Khera, whose group was among those signing onto the letter to Facebook leadership today, also supports the boycott. ""The reporting ... about our deeper understanding of the influence of Russia in voter suppression is all part of the broader context in which we're making these demands,"" she said.

FCC NOMS AGAINST THE CLOCK -- Multiple holds may prevent the Senate from advancing long-stalled FCC nominations this year before Congress adjourns, which could come as soon as Friday if lawmakers resolve government funding negotiations. Sens. Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) and Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska) confirmed Monday they both still maintain holds on the nomination of GOP FCC Commissioner Brendan Carr for a full term. The holds on Carr are also blocking Democratic FCC nominee Geoffrey Starks from being seated as a commissioner, as lawmakers want to advance the two nominations as a pair.

-- The latest obstacle: Manchin, who announced last week he would block Carr in response to the FCC pausing its Mobility Fund wireless subsidy auction to probe whether wireless carriers knowingly supplied inaccurate broadband coverage data for the program. Manchin wants ""a firm timeline on the Mobility Fund funds to be released,"" an aide said. Sen. Roger Wicker (R-Miss.), Manchin's longtime partner in criticizing FCC broadband mapping, disagrees, saying the FCC has made ""a correct decision"" and ""ought to get it right before"" disbursing subsidies based on inaccurate information. Wicker's office confirmed he's pleased enough with the investigations that he is no longer trying to add a broadband mapping rider to a government funding bill.

-- Sullivan, meanwhile, is still blocking Carr following a months-long fight over the FCC's rural health care program subsidies. He secured a private meeting with FCC Chairman Ajit Pai last month and a commitment, unveiled Friday in a Pai letter, to overhaul the program rules next year. ""All good progress,"" Sullivan told John. ""We're trying to finalize this, so I think we're close. ... That letter is helpful. It did have a lot in there."" He said he's not sure whether he will be in a position to lift his hold on Carr this week.

According to The Intercept, ""Google has been forced to shut down a data analysis system it was using to develop a censored search engine for China after members of the company's privacy team raised internal complaints that it had been kept secret from them,"" all but ending the project.

-- Not so fast? Asked about the report, a Google rep reiterated CEO Sundar Pichai's stance, delivered during a House Judiciary hearing last week, that the company has no plans to launch a search product in China at the moment. But the spokesperson added that Google still hopes to somehow break into the Chinese market eventually. Google's search and other functions have for years been inaccessible in China, where the government tightly controls and monitors its citizens' internet use.

89,politico,https://politi.co/2BTYmZW,"President Donald Trump will use his face-to-face meeting with Capitol Hill leaders Wednesday afternoon to try to find a way out of the partial government shutdown, which is beginning to sting across the country as it enters its 12th day.

Trump will ""try to figure out whether he can strike a deal"" with Democrats, according to a senior GOP lawmaker. The 3 p.m. meeting between the White House and congressional leaders of both parties is the first sit-down since the shutdown started before Christmas. But Democrats aren't expecting an immediate breakthrough.

Discussions will take place as larger swaths of the country start to feel pain from the shutdown, from the closing of the Smithsonian museums in the nation's capital to a temporary halt to rural agriculture loans. Wednesday also would have been the first day back from the New Year holiday for roughly 380,000 federal workers.

The meeting with the top two leaders from each party in the House and Senate -- which has been specifically billed as a briefing on border security by top officials from the Department of Homeland Security -- is hardly expected to end the budget impasse, however.

""It's not a meeting, it is a briefing. We expect a one-sided, non-factual presentation. Expect Democrats to again have to correct the record in the meeting and afterward,"" a senior Democratic aide said Wednesday, which is technically the final day of a fully GOP-controlled government.

The briefing is being held in the White House Situation Room, a move that may be intended to add some theatrical flourish for Trump as he tries to sell the public on the need for tougher border security.

Democrats remain firmly opposed to devoting more taxpayer dollars to Trump's border wall, and have hatched their own plan to reopen government this week without any new border money. The White House rejected that plan on Tuesday night, with press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders saying any funding bill without that additional cash would be a ""nonstarter.""

On Thursday, incoming House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the Democrats will retake control of the House, swearing in a robust freshman class that is eager to deny Trump his long-sought border money.

The shift in power will embolden Pelosi and her deputies, who announced earlier this week that they have drafted a two-part spending proposal to reopen the nine shuttered federal agencies.

First, the House will pass six of the Senate's own full-year spending bills in an attempt to lure Senate GOP leaders to follow suit, or be seen as holding thousands of workers' jobs hostage. As an extra sweetener, the package would include a 1.9 percent pay raise for federal workers that Trump himself has opposed.

Second, the House will pass a short-term bill to reopen the Department of Homeland Security, while freezing its budget to the exact same levels as before. That includes $1.3 billion for border barriers that the White House and Republicans secured in a compromise last year, but not a penny more.

The plan is intended to put pressure on Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who, like Pelosi, is a former appropriator who has opposed a shutdown from the start. McConnell, however, has said he will only put a spending plan on the floor that has explicit backing from the president. And Sanders made clear Tuesday night that the White House does not support the Democrats' proposal.

""The Pelosi plan is a non-starter because it does not fund our homeland security or keep American families safe from human trafficking, drugs, and crime,"" Sanders said.

Meanwhile, the stakes are getting higher for federal workers, with roughly 380,000 people told to stay home Wednesday. Another 420,000 people have been told to work without pay, with no guarantee that their next paycheck will go out.

Across the country, the shutdown is causing more pain as federal entities are forced to shutter operations as they run out of back-up plans to get cash -- including in parts of the country that voted for Trump. Starting Jan. 1, the Department of Agriculture will no longer issue new loans for rural development or grants for housing.

Without funding for the Department of the Interior, trash is piling up and toilets are left uncleaned in places like California's Joshua Tree National Park, as well as along the National Mall in Washington.

There are other looming deadlines. For instance, the next federal pay period ends on Jan. 5, though checks don't go out until the following week. On Jan. 11, the budgets for federal courts is expected to run dry, after largely operating on court fees and other funds for weeks."

BARR CODE -- Attorney General nominee William Barr, who's scheduled for a confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee this week, intersects with the telecom world in some interesting ways. Here's a quick rundown of what to watch:

-- Sen. Amy Klobuchar (D-Minn.) said she secured a commitment from Barr to recuse himself from Justice Department activities around the $85 billion AT&T-Time Warner merger, given his past role as a Time Warner board member. (The government is appealing a judge's decision to approve the mega-deal.)

-- Barr made headlines last fall when he disputed DOJ antitrust chief Makan Delrahim's account of a Time Warner executive making a finger-wagging threat at a meeting. Barr will be Delrahim's boss if he's confirmed as AG.

-- In the early 2000s, Barr served as general counsel for Verizon, where he worked with Ajit Pai, now chairman of the FCC. The two have remained close, which could be a boon to Pai in legal battles over net neutrality and other issues, according to an industry source familiar with the relationship.

AND DON'T FORGET ABOUT TECH -- We'll be watching Barr's hearing Tuesday for any antitrust talk about the tech industry. Some progressives say tech companies have gotten too big, while Republicans including President Donald Trump have dangled the threat of antitrust scrutiny as they complain about alleged social media bias against conservatives.

TRUMP'S LATEST BEZOS BARBS -- The world's most powerful man is once again taking aim at the world's richest man. President Donald Trump over the weekend took a series of swipes at Amazon and its CEO Jeff Bezos. During a Saturday night interview on Fox News, the president dismissed a Washington Post report that he sought to conceal details about his meetings with Russian President Vladimir Putin, calling the Bezos-owned newspaper ""basically the lobbyist for Amazon"" -- a baseless charge he has repeatedly leveled. The president earlier took issue with another Post report on Twitter, calling the outlet the ""Amazon Washington Post,"" a moniker he's used in the past to falsely imply it's all one company. (Bezos separately owns the newspaper.)

-- But things appeared to take a personal turn when Trump tweeted that he was ""so sorry to hear the news about Jeff Bozo being taken down by a competitor"" to the Post. The remarks appeared to reference a recent story by the National Enquirer tabloid claiming Bezos and his longtime wife are divorcing over an alleged affair. Trump directly addressed Bezos' divorce last week, telling reporters Thursday that he wished the tech mogul ""luck,"" adding of the split, ""It's going to be a beauty."" And the president seemingly alluded to the tabloid report again on Saturday, telling Fox News that Bezos has ""got bigger problems than anybody right now."" Amazon declined comment. The Post did not respond to a request for comment late Sunday.

-- The Twitter jabs, which came as the longest government shutdown in history extended into Day 23 (and now Day 24), prompted an immediate rebuke from one Democratic lawmaker: ""Open the government, Mr. President,"" wrote Sen. Brian Schatz (D-Hawaii) on Sunday in response to Trump's latest Bezos post.

DEMS' 'TECH WALL' TALK DRAWS FIRE -- Fight for the Future is taking issue with Democratic leaders' proposal to develop a ""technological wall"" to counter Trump's demand for a physical barrier along the southern U.S. border. During a news conference last week, Pelosi proposed that funding on border security would be best spent investing in technology to scan cars for drugs and other contraband at legal points of entry into the country. ""The positive, shall we say almost technological wall that can be built is what we should be doing,"" she said.

-- In an online petition, Fight for the Future said the Democratic position ""may seem appealing in light of Trump's bizarre plan to build a costly and unnecessary wall, but in reality -- increasing border surveillance is a nefarious move that widely threatens the Fourth Amendment of the U.S. Constitution.""

NICE TO CIO BACK -- The Federal CIO Authorization Act of 2019, H.R. 247 (116), is back on the table on Capitol Hill, where it's slated to be taken up by the House under suspension of the rules as early as Tuesday, according to schedules from both parties. The measure, which would elevate the position of government CIOs, had been removed from the congressional schedule last week -- with an aide to co-sponsor Rep. Robin Kelly (D-Ill.) initially saying the measure might not move ""until the shutdown ends."" It was reintroduced by Kelly and Rep. Will Hurd (R-Texas) this year after the last Congress failed to advance it.

-- Frederick Hill, Senate Commerce Committee communications director under former Chairman John Thune (R-S.D.), will join FTI Consulting's strategic communications practice starting Tuesday as a managing director. He'll lead the firm's public affairs on telecom, media and technology.

WAPO'S ERICA WERNER, DAMIAN PALETTA and LISA REIN: ""The White House and a number of federal agencies have started advanced preparations for a partial government shutdown, as President Trump and congressional Democrats appear unlikely to resolve their fight over a border wall before some government funding lapses at week's end.

""GOP leaders are scrambling to find a short-term alternative that could stave off a shutdown, which would start on Dec. 22 absent a deal.

The failures of his predecessors and the daunting year ahead did not deter Mulvaney, who, according to several current and former White House officials, has spent several months openly lobbying for the job. Reports that he was uninterested in the job, these people said, were in fact an effort to increase his chances of landing it by playing hard to get. ...

""White House aides say he is unlikely to attempt to reform the president's habits of spending much of his time watching television and tweeting, or to curtail the influence of Trump's daughter and son-in-law, Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner, on the policymaking process. ...

-- NYMAG'S OLIVIA NUZZI, ""The Impossible Job: How John Kelly Failed to Tame the West Wing"": ""Mulvaney does have one advantage: He has demonstrated his loyalty to the president since the beginning. 'It's cultish. It's Stockholm syndrome,' said one person close to the White House. 'There's this thing that's set in of a bunker mentality. There's less infighting because of the bunker mentality.' Nevertheless, as the incoming Democratic Congress prepares to challenge Trump, and various law enforcement investigations draw ever closer to him, it seems unlikely that Mulvaney will be able to do much to change the place. ...

""Deputy Interior Secretary David Bernhardt, a former lobbyist for the oil, gas and water industries that rely on Interior's decisions, is poised to become acting secretary following President Donald Trump's announcement Saturday that Zinke will leave by the end of the year.

""And that's already alarming environmentalists, some of whom had said they might prefer to see a distracted, scandal-plagued Zinke stay in the job. Bernhardt, who joined the Trump administration last year, has taken the lead in softening the department's protections for endangered species, a move that will make it easier for oil and gas companies to drill on ecologically sensitive lands.

A lot of this depends on Congressional intent, and if a majority of the House, and a majority of the Senate say that this case should be overturned it will have a tremendous effect on the appeal.

COLLINS: ""I don't. First of all, I would probably any doubt that this ruling is not going to affect people who are currently enrolled or in Obamacare policies, so -- or their policies for 2019.

""There is widespread support for protecting people with preexisting conditions. There's also widespread opposition to the individual mandate. And here's why. The individual mandate penalties, 80 percent were paid by people -- 80 percent of the people who paid the penalty earned under $50,000 a year.

""So, this hurt low- and middle-income families who couldn't afford the cost of health insurance.

TRUMP INC. -- ""As the Trumps Dodged Taxes, Their Tenants Paid a Price,"" by NYT's Russ Buettner and Susanne Craig: ""They were collateral damage as Donald J. Trump and his siblings dodged inheritance taxes and gained control of their father's fortune: thousands of renters in an empire of unassuming red-brick buildings scattered across Brooklyn, Queens and Staten Island.

""Those buildings have been home to generations of strivers, municipal workers and newly arrived immigrants. When their regulated rents started rising more quickly in the 1990s, many tenants had no idea why.

""'I've always thought there was something strange going on,' said Jack Leitner, who has lived in the Beach Haven Apartments in Coney Island, Brooklyn, for more than two decades. 'But you have to have proof, and it's an uphill battle.' As it turned out, a hidden scam lurked behind the mysterious increases.

""In October, a New York Times investigation into the origins of Mr. Trump's wealth revealed, among its findings, that the future president and his siblings set up a phony business to pad the cost of nearly everything their father, the legendary builder Fred C.

92,politico,https://politi.co/2Fuh1yR,"President Donald Trump on Monday kept up his calls for Democrats to immediately restart funding negotiations, pushing the argument that blame for the nation's longest government shutdown should now lay squarely on their shoulders despite his previous declaration he would be proud to shut the government down.

Trump dinged lawmakers for leaving town over the weekend, reiterating that he was waiting in the White House for Democrats to return to the negotiating table despite talks coming to a standstill last week.

""I've been waiting all weekend,"" he wrote in one tweet. ""Democrats must get to work now. Border must be secured!""

""Nancy and Cryin' Chuck can end the Shutdown in 15 minutes,"" he wrote in a second post. ""At this point it has become their, and the Democrats, fault!""

The partial government shutdown, held up over Trump's demands that Congress appropriate $5.7 billion to fund a stretch of wall on the U.S.-Mexico border, became the longest in history over the weekend, with 800,000 federal workers missing their first paychecks Friday. It is now in its 24th day with no clear indication of when or how it might end.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) have fiercely resisted the White House's offers, refusing to appropriate money. The Democrats' unwillingness to concede has left Trump mulling a national emergency declaration, a legally dubious option that would allow him to order the military to build the wall, or dipping into other pots of money within the government to bypass Congress.

Trump has wavered on accepting responsibility for the shutdown, after declaring in an Oval Office meeting last month that he would be ""proud"" to shut down the government over his demands for a border wall. He has also claimed that government workers have reached out to him to urge him against backing down, even if it meant they wouldn't get paid.

Polls of both Americans generally and government workers specifically have indicated that most respondents see the president as responsible for the government shutdown, despite his efforts to shift blame to Democrats.

The president on Monday also hit a group of congressional Democrats who traveled to Puerto Rico over the weekend as part of a retreat reportedly organized by the political arm of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus. CBS News reported that the trip included meetings with local officials to hear about the progress of hurricane recovery efforts on the island as well as taking in the Broadway musical ""Hamilton,"" which is being performed on the island to raise money for local organizations.

Republicans have seized on the trip to accuse Democrats of a lack of commitment to bringing the shutdown to an end.

Although Trump criticized Democrats for their travel over the weekend, he will be on the road Monday in New Orleans to deliver a speech to the American Farm Bureau Federation."
93,politico,https://politi.co/2F8Kle8,"Yesterday, new members of the House of Representatives were sworn into Congress, and with a record 102 women now seated there, the 435-member body is looking ever so slightly more like the country its members have been elected to represent.

Slightly. The increase brings the percentage of women members of Congress from 20.6 percent in the last session to 23.7 percent. As of the 2010 census, we were more than half the U.S. population.

The new body is more diverse than it's ever been, which isn't saying so much either. Two Muslim-American women were elected for the first time -- Reps. Omar Ilhan and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan. Reps. Sharice Davids of Kansas and Deb Haaland of New Mexico will be the first Native American women in Congress. Texas is sending Veronica Escobar and Sylvia Garcia to Washington, the state's first Latina members of Congress, while Massachusetts elected Ayanna Pressley and Connecticut elected Jahana Hayes -- the first African-American women elected to Congress from either state. Shocking, isn't it?

People sometimes ask why that kind of representation matters -- why should our elected leaders, or the leaders in any industry, look like or be similar to the people they represent?

That kind of diversity could help change long-held stereotypes and biases about women in power. A 2010 Harvard study that found that people think female politicians who are ambitious are uncaring, while they don't feel the same way about male politicians.

And it could also inspire young people searching for a roadmap to how they can run for office themselves. A 2015 study from a University of Exeter professor found that women and men start out in their careers with similar levels of ambition, but women's ambition decreases over time; the reason is not a desire to have kids or stay home to care for them, but rather ""not having support, mentors or role models to make it to the top, and the subtle biases against women that lead to their choices.""

In New York state, the State Senate will have its first female majority leader in its history, in Andrea Stewart-Cousins. Shortly after her election, she gave a lengthy interview to WNYC's Brian Lehrer, where she spelled out some of the arguments for representation.

""As an African-American, as a woman, there have been things that have happened to me that people don't think happen because it never happened to them, so it's not necessarily a willful disregard of certain things, it's just that people bring with them their experiences and if they've never had something happen it's very hard to speak to it,"" she said.

She told the anecdote of how when she was first elected, she took an office space that had previously been held by a male legislator and insisted that the office be outfitted with a handicapped-accessible bathroom. ""When I came in a woman came to me and she would not come to the male who was there before me, but she came to me to tell me how important it was that that be there, because of her and her needs,"" she said. ""I think the more opportunities we have to have a varying degree of perspectives the better the policy in the end will be.""

ABOUT THAT L-TRAIN SHUTDOWN...NEVERMIND! Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced Thursday that a new European design to refurbish the L-train tunnels could obviate the need to close the tunnel for 15 months -- a shocking move that comes three years after planning for the shutdown started and just three months before it's scheduled to begin.

The announcement, a seeming boon to the more than 250,000 commuters who ride the L train each day, comes amid speculation that Cuomo may run for president next year, a possibility he's repeatedly denied. He has rolled out a series of major infrastructure projects in New York, casting himself as a politician who knows how to get things done and contrasting himself to President Donald Trump, who has so far held up funding for regional transit improvements.

The decision to halt the full shutdown was apparently a closely guarded secret, and only the governor and a small circle of top aides were briefed on it ahead of time. As of noon on Thursday, some MTA board members had yet to be informed of the substance of Cuomo's announcement. Mayor Bill de Blasio told reporters Thursday he'd been briefed on the announcement earlier that morning in what he described as a ""good conversation"" with the governor. ""I was certainly surprised by the announcement given that the shutdown is scheduled for three months from now and the significant time and planning and expense that has gone into the decision that had been made,"" MTA board member Veronica Vanterpool told POLITICO in an interview Thursday, noting that the decision to pursue the full 15-month shutdown was long ago approved by the public and the MTA's board. POLITICO's Laura Nahmias.

""THE SURPRISE DECISION IS BEING CHEERED BY WILLIAMSBURG LANDLORDS, who have lost significant revenue since the full shutdown plan was announced nearly three years ago. 'This is a major wow for us,' said Carey Larsen, a broker at Citi Habitats, who is based in Williamsburg. 'I can't think of anybody happier to hear this than property owners and real-estate brokers.' The plan for a complete shutdown of the L line, which was expected to begin in April, quickly chilled the market in what had been the hottest neighborhood in Brooklyn, after the details were first announced.The area has become a bit more affordable for renters, after a period in which rents soared as Williamsburg emerged from gritty working-class roots to become a trendy destination. Rents in Williamsburg and nearby neighborhoods in North Brooklyn have fallen 1.5%, while rents in the borough have increased 3.3%, said Grant Long, a senior economist at Streeteasy.com.""

WHY WE'RE STILL TALKING ABOUT CUOMO 2020: ""Gov. Andrew Cuomo has said twice over the past six months in no uncertain terms that he will not run for president, and as recently as Wednesday opined that former Vice President Joseph Biden is the best qualified member of the current field of potential candidates. Yet even as those remarks about Biden broke, there was the gov on the cover of the New York Daily News above the headline 'Cuomo 2020.' The reason the governor can't escape the speculation that he will run for president is that, while he has discouraged it with words, he has in deeds done everything in his power to fuel it. The fact is, on paper at least, Cuomo has as strong a case to be a viable presidential candidate as just about anyone in the current field of potential Democratic candidates.""

GIANARIS: ""OVER THE LAST SEVERAL DECADES, 15 states across the country - both red and blue - have modernized their voting laws, including our neighbors in New Jersey and Massachusetts. Unfortunately, here in New York we remain mired in the past, refusing to implement reforms to fix the state's poor electoral system and erecting arbitrary barriers to voter participation. The results are clear: New York routinely has some of the lowest voter turnout rates in the country. In 2018, New York ranked 48th in turnout. Also important to this discussion is that in the midst of the 2016 election, upwards of 200,000 voters were illegally purged from the voter rolls in Brooklyn due to errors at the New York City Board of Elections. Now, more than ever, New York has an obligation to make it simpler - not harder - for people to vote. This legislative session in Albany, we can make real change. New York can move our elections into the future by passing Automatic Voter Registration, or AVR."" Mike Gianaris and Sean McElwee for the Gotham Gazette

That bill would include a solution for the ""Dreamers"" -- undocumented young people brought to America illegally by their parents -- as well as provisions addressing farm labor and other immigration issues. 'I ask my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to put aside the partisanship and the divide that the border wall has created, and really focus on what we can come together on and agree on what needs to be done in terms of border security as well as fixing the broken immigration policies that got us here,' Reed said.""

A FEDERAL COURT DECISION THURSDAY BLOCKING A NEW LAW THAT WOULD CURB AIRBNB IN ITS BIGGEST MARKET marks a significant win for the home-sharing company as it battles regulatory crackdowns throughout the country. Airbnb -- long a foe of many New York lawmakers and affordable housing advocates -- filed a lawsuit in August against new city regulations that would require it to turn over host names and addresses to the Mayor's Office of Special Enforcement. The company, along with fellow home-sharing platform HomeAway, argued the regulations would violate host privacy.

Judge Paul Engelmayer issued a preliminary injunction against the law Thursday and said the companies are likely to succeed on their challenge that the new requirements violate search and seizure protections under the Fourth Amendment. The ruling represents a unique victory for Airbnb, which has settled similar lawsuits in the past, and comes as several cities around the country have recently passed or are currently considering home-sharing restrictions.

95,politico,https://politi.co/2F6cWkT,"THE BUZZ: Californians now lead both caucuses in the House of Representatives, with Rep. Kevin McCarthy handing the gavel to Speaker Nancy Pelosi yesterday after California members sang ""California, here we come."" And the contrast between them could scarcely be sharper.

-- Pelosi was propelled back to the speakership after an election defined by a national backlash against President Donald Trump and Democrats' embrace of the Pelosi-championed Affordable Care Act. Later Thursday, she reiterated her opposition to Trump's border wall, the dominant issue in the shutdown-shadowed weeks leading up to her elevation: ""We're not doing a wall,"" she told reporters. ""Does anybody have any doubt?""

-- ""Two months ago, the American people spoke, and demanded a new dawn,"" Pelosi said in a speech that lauded Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush while eschewing a single mention of the current president.

-- While Pelosi has returned to power thanks in part to voters rejecting Trump, her fellow Californian from Bakersfield has ascended by wrapping his arms around the president. In her speech saying Republicans should be led by McCarthy -- whose desiccated California delegation is now too small to field a softball team -- Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyo.) heralded McCarthy's commitment to the Trumpian immigration agenda.

-- That includes pushing back on the ""devastating practice of sanctuary cities,"" Cheney said, a line that will play differently outside of California than in the Golden State: The state has followed cities that wall off cops from ICE, beating back a Trump administration challenge. Months after Orange County voted to ally with the feds and the White House hosted dissident California Republicans, the former conservative fortress will not be represented by a single Republican in Congress.

-- ""Leader McCarthy led us in passing legislation to secure our borders,"" Cheney said, adding to applause and boos: ""And yes, Madam clerk: Build the wall.""

-- THE DETAILS on Pelosi's confirmation, including on celebrity attendees like crooner Tony Bennett, from POLITICO's Heather Caygle and Rachael Bade here.

PELOSI PUSHBACK: The entire California delegation backed Pelosi, including the seven new House Democrats -- and national Republicans want their constituents to know. The National Republican Campaign Committee blasted out targeted text messages telling voters in 15 districts nationwide, and five in California, that their new representatives had voted for the San Francisco speaker. One GOP challenger definitely noticed.

THE WOMEN'S ANGLE -- Pelosi cast her own vote with an assist from her 8-year-old granddaughter Bella, the daughter of Christine Pelosi of San Francisco, who jumped up and yelled ""Pelosi!"" to the delight of the chamber. And when she took the gavel, she was surrounded by children -- as she was 12 years earlier when she made history and became the first woman speaker in history. Those kinds of optics aren't lost on women voters, who were significant as an electorate which changed the course of the 2018 election -- and on whom Democrats are counting to be critical in 2020.

96,chicago tribune,https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/nationworld/politics/ct-trump-crisis-20181220-story.html,"President Donald Trump began Thursday under siege, listening to howls of indignation from conservatives over his border wall and thrusting the government toward a shutdown. He ended it by announcing the exit of the man U.S. allies see as the last guardrail against the president's erratic behavior: Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, whose resignation letter was a scathing rebuke of Trump's worldview.

At perhaps the most fragile moment of his presidency - and vulnerable to convulsions on the political right - Trump single-handedly propelled the U.S. government into crisis and sent markets tumbling with his gambits this week to salvage signature campaign promises.

The president's decisions and conduct have led to a fracturing of Trump's coalition. Hawks condemned his sudden decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria. Conservatives called him a ""gutless president"" and questioned whether he would ever build a wall. Political friends began privately questioning whether Trump needed to be reined in.

After campaigning on shrinking America's footprint in overseas wars, Trump abruptly declared Wednesday that he was withdrawing U.S. troops from Syria, a move Mattis and other advisers counseled against. And officials said Thursday that Trump is preparing to send thousands of troops home from Afghanistan as well.

The president also issued an ultimatum to Congress to fund construction of his promised U.S.-Mexico border wall, a move poised to result in a government shutdown just before Christmas. Trump and his aides had signaled tacit support for a short-term spending compromise that would avert the shutdown, but the president abruptly changed course after absorbing a deluge of criticism from some of his most high-profile loyalists.

Leon Panetta, who served as former defense secretary, CIA director and White House chief of staff for Democratic presidents, said, ""We're in a constant state of chaos right now in this country."" He added, ""While it may satisfy [Trump's] need for attention, it's raising hell with the country.""

Panetta said the resignation of Mattis is a singular moment and his letter, which underscores how Mattis sees Trump's approach as misguided, ""puts the security of the nation right now at some degree of risk.""

Trump has been isolated in bunker mode in recent weeks as political and personal crises mount, according to interviews with 27 current and former White House officials, Republican lawmakers and outside advisers to the president, some of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity to offer candid assessments.

""There's going to be an intervention,"" one former senior administration official said speculatively. ""Jim Mattis just sent a shot across the bow. He's the most credible member of the administration by five grades of magnitude. He's the steady, safe set of hands. And this letter is brutal. He quit because of the madness.""

In his resignation letter, Mattis wrote, ""My views on treating allies with respect and also being clear-eyed about malign actors and strategic competitors are strongly held and informed by over four decades of immersion in these issues . . . Because you have the right to a Secretary of Defense whose views are better aligned with yours on these and other subjects, I believe it is right for me to step down from my position.""

Although Trump's relationship with Mattis has been rocky for months, the president spent the first part of Thursday focused on another fraying relationship: with his conservative base.

On Thursday, as criticism over his capitulation on the wall grew louder by the hour, Trump complained to friends and aides that he felt politically shackled. He had no plan, but was spoiling for a fight. By midday, the president picked one.

""I've made my position very clear: Any measure that funds the government must include border security. Has to,"" Trump said Thursday. He added that he had ""no choice"" but to act.

Trump's advisers acknowledged that the funding may not be secured in the end, but boasted that the spectacle would be remembered favorably by his base voters as proof of his mettle. A wall funding proposal was approved by the House late Thursday, but faced uncertain prospects in the Senate.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., habitually careful in his approach to Trump, avoided strong-arming the president in their recent exchanges, knowing that urging him to stand down on the wall funding likely would only embolden him, according to two people familiar with the discussions. At every turn, McConnell confided to Trump that congressional efforts this month - from the passage of the farm bill to bipartisan criminal-justice reform - were a string of victories for him, the people said.

Thanks to McConnell's soothing, there was cautious optimism that the president would eventually sign a funding bill. ""McConnell has a lot to do with it, of course. They talk a lot,"" Rep. Harold Rogers, R-Ky., said. ""It's smart to save the fight for another day.""

House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., - busy this week bidding farewell to Congress after two decades in office - followed McConnell's playbook, pointing out how Trump would be able to battle for wall funding in the new year, a person close to him said.

Both Ryan and House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., told Trump last week that they could not pass a spending bill with $5 billion for wall construction, and McConnell was told by the White House that Trump would sign a short-term bill without it, according to two people familiar with the conversations.

But on Fox News Channel and across conservative media, there was a brewing rebellion. Prominent voices urged Trump to hold firm on his wall money and warned that caving would jeopardize his reelection.

Rush Limbaugh dismissed the compromise bill on his radio program as ""Trump gets nothing and the Democrats get everything."" Another firebrand, Ann Coulter, published a column titled, ""Gutless President in Wall-less Country."" Trump even found resistance on the couch of his favorite show, ""Fox & Friends,"" where reliable Trump-boosting host Brian Kilmeade chided him on the air Thursday.

The president was paying attention. He promptly unfollowed Coulter on Twitter. And he pecked out a series of defensive tweets blaming congressional leaders for not funding the wall, while also staking a defensive posture. He suggested that a massive wall may not be necessary in its entirety because the border already is ""tight"" thanks to the work of Border Patrol agents and troops.

""One of the things he's most vulnerable to is mockery and mockery by his own supporters,"" said Mark Krikorian, a leading anti-immigration activist.

Members of the conservative House Freedom Caucus joined in the rebellion. During House votes on Wednesday evening, caucus chair Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., and other members refused to budge and held court with reporters, railing against the Republican leadership and warning Trump that he was being led astray.

At a Thursday Oval Office meeting with Ryan and McCarthy, Trump was calm and did not yell, but was resolute and ""dug in on what he wants,"" said a Republican official briefed on the discussion.

Trump spent six to seven minutes in the meeting with Ryan and McCarthy talking about ""steel slats"" and saying that the term was preferable to calling the proposed construction a ""wall,"" as the president has done for more than three years.

The administration drama comes at an especially perilous juncture for Trump, following his thumping at the polls in November's midterm elections. Democrats are preparing to take control of the House in January and to use their subpoena power to investigate Trump's finances and conduct in office, as well as alleged corruption in the administration.

Meanwhile, Republicans in their last gasp of unified government are divided. A band of hard-line conservative lawmakers voted against Trump's prison reform legislation, which passed the House and Senate with bipartisan support and is expected to be signed by the president Friday. And many foreign policy hawks, including Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., a Trump confidant, sharply criticized Trump's decision Wednesday to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria.

Inside the Oval Office on Thursday, Trump was in what one Republican close to the White House described as ""a tailspin,"" acting ""totally irrationally"" and ""flipping out"" over criticisms in the media.

Even as aides argued to him that protesting over wall funding could deprive government workers paychecks over Christmas, Trump warned in private conversations with Republican lawmakers that they all would get ""crushed"" if they did not get the wall built.

Trump vented to his advisers that signing the short-term spending bill without wall money would make him look weak and make his base voters think he broke a campaign promise. He also complained that he did not have sufficient bargaining leverage with Congress and blamed senior aides - including White House legislative affairs director Shahira Knight - for not presenting him with better options.

""He's legitimately saying, 'This is ridiculous. Why would I sign this?'"" said American Conservative Union Chairman Matt Schlapp, whose wife, Mercedes Schlapp, is a senior White House staffer. ""If you're the outsider, you don't want to go along with the same old stupid rules. When he does that, he doesn't look like an outsider.""

Marc Short, Trump's former White House legislative affairs director, said, ""He feels he made a promise to voters that he would build the wall. There is a realization that with Congress changing hands, that the challenge of getting funding for the wall only gets larger.""

Trump's pin-balling conduct - veering from a promise of a shutdown to moving toward a deal, and then changing his mind - has vexed members of his own party. Many Republican lawmakers said they sense that Trump is adjusting uneasily to the dynamics of soon-to-be divided government and lashing out to reclaim some of his dominance over the congressional agenda.

The defense secretary's resignation compounded the concern.

""Having Mattis there gave all of us a great deal more comfort than we have now,"" retiring Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., said. ""Chaos has kind of been the norm but it seems to have been heightened. Sometimes you think it's got to settle, and then another thing happens.""

97,economic times,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/world-news/the-latest-trump-says-he-thinks-a-deal-getting-closer/articleshow/67460747.cms,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Latest on President Donald Trump and the partial government shutdown (all times local):

President Donald Trump says he thinks he and the Democrats are ""getting closer"" to a deal to end the budget stalemate that has partially shut down the government despite no evidence that any progress has been made.

And he's suggesting the partial government shutdown could be ""a blessing in disguise"" because, he suggests, it could lead to a broader immigration deal.

Trump spoke Wednesday during an Oval Office bill signing on anti-human trafficking legislation. It's a day after he delivered a prime-time address trying to make the case for his long-stalled U.S.-Mexico border wall.

Trump says that he would like to see ""real immigration reform in this country because we need it."" He says ""Everybody wants to see immigration reform,"" adding that perhaps the stalemate ""will turn out to be a blessing in disguise.""

Gone are the days when the U.S. and Mexican governments regularly exchanged statements over President Donald Trump's insistence on a border wall.

Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said Wednesday he won't be drawn into what he calls a U.S. internal dispute, an apparent reference to the 19-day-old partial U.S. government shutdown over a border barrier.

Lopez Obrador says, ""We are not going to respond to situations arising from internal affairs in the United States.""

Unlike his predecessor, the Mexican leader didn't have to respond to any specific aspersion about Mexico, because Trump didn't make any in his Tuesday night address to the American public. Relations between the two leaders have been surprisingly cordial, given their ideological differences.

Lopez Obrador said, ""Of course, there are those ... who want us to get into a confrontation. We always want a friendly relationship with the United States, a cooperative relationship.""

As a presidential candidate Trump promised Mexico would pay for a border wall, but Mexico refused.

President Donald Trump is using a bill signing focused on curbing human trafficking to push his case for a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border.

Trump says a southern border that is not secured exacerbates the incidents of human trafficking. He says, ""As long as we have a border that is not secure, we're going to suffer the consequences of that.""

Wednesday's bill signing came a day after Trump's prime-time speech designed to persuade Americans that illegal immigration and trafficking at the border are a crisis.

Democrats have called Trump's promised wall costly, ineffective and ""immoral"" and say he's ""manufacturing a crisis.""

The bill Trump signed is designed to enhance an annual State Department report that measures global efforts to eliminate human trafficking.

The White House says it's the fourth bipartisan bill the Republican president has signed in the last few weeks to prevent human trafficking.

Congressional Democrats say they'll head to the White House with the plan to reopen the government -- the same one they've been presenting. They're asking President Donald Trump to accept a bipartisan bill to fund border security without the wall.

Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Wednesday the president ""could end the Trump shutdown and re-open the government today, and he should.""

Pelosi and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer spoke at an event where they were flanked by federal workers going without pay during the shutdown, now in its 19th day.

Schumer called workers the ""collateral damage"" of Trump's ""temper tantrum."" He said the president failed to ""persuade a soul"" during his ""divisive"" prime-time address Tuesday night to the nation.

Trump meets with congressional leaders at the White House Wednesday afternoon. He rejected the Senate's bipartisan funding bill in December, sparking the shutdown.

The White House is trying to keep jittery congressional Republicans from defecting over the toll the partial government shutdown is taking in their states.

President Donald Trump and Democrats have been at an impasse over funding for his proposed border wall, which has led to a partial government shutdown, now in its 19th day.

Trump meets with Senate Republicans Wednesday on Capitol Hill just hours after he argued on national television that a border wall was needed to resolve a security and humanitarian ""crisis.""

Senators say the shutdown has led to disruptions in agricultural payments for farmers, as well as for home buyers trying to secure government-backed home loans. Lawmakers also are worried about missed paychecks for government workers Friday.

As many as half a dozen GOP senators have said the government should reopen while border security negotiations with Democrats continue.

President Donald Trump again linked illegal immigration along the southern border with drugs and violent crime as he urged Democratic lawmakers to fund his proposed border wall.

In his first national address from the Oval Office, the president gave no indication he was softening his stance that the partial government shutdown would continue without money for the wall.

Trump argued Tuesday night that the wall was needed to resolve what he called a security and humanitarian ""crisis.""

He addressed the nation as the shutdown stretched through its third week, with hundreds of thousands of federal workers going without pay and some congressional Republicans growing increasingly jittery about the impasse.

Trump plans to visit Senate Republicans at the Capitol on Wednesday before meeting with Democratic leaders at the White House."
98,aljazeera.com,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/01/barr-hearing-trump-ag-pick-promises-political-independence-190115174737214.html,"Barr vows to allow Russia probe to continue despite president's claim that the investigation is a 'witch-hunt'.

President Donald Trump's nominee for US attorney general, William Barr, told politicians on Tuesday that he would protect a federal probe into Russian election meddling from political pressure, stressing he would bring independence to the job and not shy away from breaking ranks with the administration.

""I will not be bullied into doing anything that I think is wrong - by anybody, whether it be editorial boards or Congress or the president. I'm going to do what I think is right,"" Barr said at his confirmation hearing before the Senate Judiciary Committee.

Barr is expected to win confirmation in the Republican-controlled Senate to serve as the nation's top law enforcement officer, which would put him in charge of Special Counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russia's interference in the 2016 election and any possible collusion between Moscow and Trump's campaign.

""On my watch, Bob will be allowed to complete his work,"" Barr said.

Democrats worry that Trump's administration may try to undercut the investigation, which has been a frequent target of the president and his allies.

Barr, who was attorney general under Republican President George HW Bush in the 1990s, said his primary loyalty would be to the rule of law, not Trump. He said he did not seek out the job and was reluctant to accept when Trump offered it to him.

Trump frequently criticises the Mueller probe as a ""witch-hunt"" and has denied any collusion with Russia or obstruction of justice. Russia has denied US intelligence agencies' findings that it interfered in the 2016 election.

Barr said he doesn't believe Mueller ""would be involved in a witch-hunt"", adding that it was ""unimaginable"" that the special counsel would do anything in the investigation that would justify reeling it in or shutting it down.

Barr said he agreed with Mueller's charge that Russian entities interfered in the election, or at least tried to do so. He said he described Mueller, a longtime friend, as a ""straight shooter"" when Trump asked about him.

Mueller is due to submit a final report to the attorney general, prompting concern from some Democrats that the Trump administration will try to quash his findings. Barr said he would not let Trump modify the report and would make public as many of Mueller's findings as possible.

But Barr faced tough questions from Democrats about an unsolicited, 19-page memo he wrote last year that called Mueller's probe ""fatally misconceived"" for examining whether Trump obstructed justice by firing FBI Director James Comey in 2017.

""It does raise questions about your willingness to reach conclusions before knowing the facts, and whether you prejudge the Mueller investigation,"" said Senator Dianne Feinstein, the Judiciary Committee's top Democrat.

Barr said his memo did not question the legitimacy of the probe as a whole, but only expressed concerns that the special counsel might be improperly interpreting one aspect of the law.

""I think it was entirely proper,"" he said of the memo, saying it was not unusual for former Justice Department officials to share their views of legal matters.

He said he had written a similar memo criticising the department's corruption case against Democratic Senator Bob Menendez, which ended in a mistrial in 2017.

Barr's views of presidential power could be important as prosecutors and Democrats in the House of Representatives, where they hold the majority, intensify investigations of Trump's personal business practices and his presidency.

Barr could benefit from the fact that some Democrats view him as a better option than the man who took over the job after Trump forced out Jeff Sessions last year, acting Attorney General Matt Whitaker.

During his tenure as attorney general, Sessions faced repeated attacks from Trump for recusing himself from oversight of the Russia probe after it emerged that he had met Russian officials while working with the Trump election campaign. Barr said Sessions ""did the right thing"" by recusing himself.

Mueller has secured indictments against or guilty pleas from 33 people and three Russian companies, including former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort.

On immigration, Barr said that reform is ""long overdue"" and expressed support for Trump's hardline policies, including funding a border wall.

Asked about the partial government shutdown, which was prompted by an impasse over funding for a wall on the US-Mexico border, Barr said he would like to see a deal reached where Congress recognised that it was ""imperative to have border security"".

Barr also said he believed so-called sanctuary cities, jurisdictions that limit cooperation with federal immigration authorities, were hurting law enforcement's ability to safeguard the public. Sessions sued California over the policies.

Barr also pledged at his confirmation hearing to support and uphold the False Claims Act, a law that lets whistleblowers file lawsuits to help the federal government recover losses due to fraud.

""I will diligently enforce the False Claims Act,"" Barr told Republican Senator Charles Grassley, marking a reversal from prior comments he made in which he declared the law was an abomination and unconstitutional.

The nominee also said he favours strong enforcement of US antitrust laws and would examine statistics showing that scrutiny of mergers is at historic lows.

""I am for vigorous enforcement of the antitrust laws to preserve competition,"" he said. ""This is going to be an area I want to get into""."

US President Donald Trump said on Monday that he rejected a proposal from a Republican ally in the Senate that would have temporarily reopened closed parts of the government to allow resumption of negotiations on a funding standoff.

As the shutdown, the longest of its type in US history, entered its 24th day, Trump told reporters he disagreed with Republican Senator Lindsey Graham's proposal to reopen the government for three weeks.

If talks failed during that period, Graham said on Sunday, then Trump could go ahead and declare a national emergency to bypass Congress and get money for a wall on the US-Mexico border - the issue that triggered the shutdown on December 22.

Amid swelling criticism, Trump has refused to budge on his demand that a spending bill include $5.7bn for a wall on the country's southern border, a promise on which Trump campaigned.

Democrats have rejected Trump's demand for funding for the border wall in addition to other border funds but have said they would support $1.3bn to bolster border security in other ways, including beefing up the number of Border Patrol agents and increasing surveillance.

The political crisis caused federal workers to miss their first paycheques on Friday, heightening concerns about mounting financial pressures on employees, including air traffic controllers and airport security officials who continue to work without pay.

Roughly 800,000 federal workers are furloughed or required to work without pay. Some employees have resorted to selling their possessions or posting appeals on online crowdfunding sites to help pay their bills.

The shutdown also affected travellers as a jump in unscheduled absences among federal airport security screeners forced partial closures of airports in Houston and Miami.

National parks also remain closed, food and drug inspections have been curtailed and key economic data is on hold. Federal courts are set to run out of money on Friday.

During a rally in Washington, DC on Thursday, federal workers, union leaders and Democrats called on the Trump administration to reopen the government.

""Let's call this shutdown what it is: It's a lockout,"" Richard Trumka, president of the AFL-CIO, a federation of unions, told the crowd.

""Shame on the Senate. Shame on the White House. This lockout has to end, and it has to end now.""

At least two unions have filed lawsuits against the Trump administration over the shutdown.

Later on Monday, Trump is scheduled to address a New Orleans gathering of farmers, a key bloc of Trump supporters who have been hit by the shutdown as federal loan and farm aid applications have stalled and key farming and crop data has been delayed.

The USDA was set to release its views on the projected size of US soybean stockpiles, among other data, following a record-large domestic harvest and a trade war with China that has slowed US exports.

To fill the void on data, traders and farmers are relying on private crop forecasters, satellite imagery firms and brokerages offering analyses on trade and supplies. Some have been scouring Twitter for tidbits on shifting weather patterns and rumors of grain exports, but say it is difficult to replace the USDA.

""We're just doing the best we can, looking for as much information as is available,"" said Brian Basting, economist for Illinois-based broker Advance Trading, which provides customers its own harvest and crop supply estimates.

Dan Henebry, an Illinois corn and soy farmer, said the absence of USDA data was difficult.

""You delay all these reports and the market has no idea where to go, other than trade guesses,"" Henebry said.

Trump has said he could declare a national emergency if he cannot get a deal with politicians, although on Monday he told reporters he was not looking to do so.

He retweeted criticism of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer that urged the top Democratic leaders to negotiate with him.

""I've been waiting all weekend. Democrats must get to work now. Border must be secured!"" Trump wrote in an early morning tweet on Monday.

About one-quarter of the US government shut down last month as Republicans controlled both chambers of Congress as well as the White House. In December, Trump said he would take responsibility for the shutdown but has since shifted the blame to Democrats. A growing proportion of Americans blame Trump for the closures, a recent Reuters/Ipsos poll found.

The president now must win concessions from the Democrats, who took over the US House of Representatives this month following November's midterm elections. He also must win over enough Senate Democrats to secure the 60 votes needed to pass funding legislation in that chamber.

Declaring a national emergency over immigration issues is fiercely opposed by Democrats and remains unpopular with some Republicans. It also would likely face an immediate legal challenge.

Pelosi called on the Republican-led Senate to vote on several bills passed earlier this month by the House to fund affected departments that do not include money for Trump's wall.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said he will not take up any legislation that does not have Trump's support.

Both the Senate and the House were scheduled to reconvene on Monday afternoon, despite a weekend winter storm that shuttered much of the Washington, DC, area and it remained unclear what, if any, steps politicians might take to address the lapsed funding measures for affected agencies.

Senator Chris Coons on Monday reiterated fellow Democrats' call for Trump to reopen the government while negotiations over the wall and immigration continue.

He acknowledged efforts by Graham and other Republicans to forge a temporary solution but said Trump has been unpredictable even among fellow conservatives with ever-shifting positions."
103,economic times,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/world-news/graham-urging-trump-to-reopen-government-for-a-few-weeks/articleshow/67518678.cms,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Republican lawmaker advising President Donald Trump said he is encouraging the president to reopen the government for several weeks to continue negotiating with Democrats over funding for a U.S.-Mexico border wall before the president takes the more drastic step of declaring a national emergency.

But that may be wishful thinking, given that Sen. Lindsey Graham also says Trump still wants to reach a deal for the wall before agreeing to reopen shuttered government departments. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a leading Democratic negotiator, insists that Trump reopen the government first.

The weeks-old standoff over funding led to the partial government shutdown that hit day 23 on Sunday without an end in sight.

""Before he pulls the plug on the legislative option, and I think we're almost there, I would urge him to open up the government for a short period of time, like three weeks, before he pulls the plug, see if we can get a deal,"" said Graham, a South Carolina Republican. ""If we can't at the end of three weeks, all bets are off.""

""See if he can do it by himself through the emergency powers. That's my recommendation,"" added Graham, who has publicly pushed Trump to use his authority to declare a national emergency to build the wall. Such a step would allow Trump to bypass Congress and tap various pots of unspent federal money, including for military construction and disaster relief and from asset seized by law enforcement, to pay for the wall.

Trump has kept Washington on edge over whether he would resort to such a declaration, citing what he says is a ""crisis"" of drug smuggling and the trafficking of women and children at the border. The president initially sounded as though such a move was imminent, but then pulled back. He has said several times since he first mentioned the idea in public earlier this month that he prefers to try to reach a deal with Congress.

A key question is how much more time is Trump willing to give lawmakers. Graham, who said he and Trump talked by telephone on Sunday morning, said the legislative path ""is just about shut off"" and blamed Pelosi.

The speaker's office had no immediate comment.

Democrats oppose an emergency declaration but may be powerless to block it. Some Republicans are wary, too, fearing how a future Democratic president might use that authority. Such a move, should Trump ultimately go that route, would almost certainly be challenged in the courts.

Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., called Graham's idea to reopen the government a ""great place to start.""

""I do think if we reopen the government, if the president ends this shutdown crisis, we have folks who can negotiate a responsible, modern investment in technology that will actually make us safer,"" Coons said.

Trump has maintained that the border cannot be secured without a wall.

Graham said he thinks Trump is willing to accept the $5.7 billion he has insisted on for the wall, along with some immigration measures Democrats might find acceptable, such as helping immigrants who were illegally brought to the U.S. as children.

Trump has expressed interest in a broader immigration overhaul, but says he first wants the Supreme Court to address the class of immigrants known as ""Dreamers."" Pelosi also has shown no interest in accepting a wall -- she has called it an ""immorality"" -- in exchange for immigration fixes.

And, Trump, who was holed up in the White House as snow blanketed Washington on Sunday, appeared to shoot down Graham's suggestion of a ""wall plus"" deal, saying on Twitter that even Democrats don't want to make ""Dreamers"" part of the negotiations.

""The damage done to our Country from a badly broken Border - Drugs, Crime and so much that is bad - is far greater than a Shutdown, which the Dems can easily fix as soon as they come back to Washington!"" Trump said in a separate tweet.

The White House has been laying the groundwork for an emergency declaration, feared by members of both parties.

Senate Homeland Security Committee Chairman Ron Johnson, R-Wis., said he would ""hate to see"" a declaration because then the wall wouldn't get built, presumably because of legal challenges. Democrats voted in the past for border security and should again, he said.

""I actually want to see this wall get built,"" Johnson said. ""I want to keep pressure on Democrats to actually come to the negotiating table in good faith and fund what they have supported in the past.""

But Graham, who favors a presidential declaration, said the time for talk is running out.

""It's the last option, not the first option, but we're pretty close to that being the only option,"" he said.

Graham and Coons spoke on ""Fox News Sunday."" Johnson appeared on CNN's ""State of the Union.""

Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said Trump asked House Speaker Nancy Pelosi at Wednesday's White House meeting whether she would agree to fund his wall.

When she said ""no,"" Schumer says, Trump got up and said, ""Then we have nothing to discuss."" Schumer says, ""And he just walked out.""

Schumer is calling Trump's actions ""really, really unfortunate.""

Trump is also weighing in on the meeting by tweet, calling it ""a total waste of time.""

He tweets that once Pelosi rejected his long-stalled border wall, he ""said bye-bye, nothing else works!""

Congressional leaders from both parties have returned to the White House for another round of negotiations with President Donald Trump on the ongoing partial government shutdown.

The two sides have made no apparent progress in the past week, with Trump sticking to his demand of $5.7 billion for a border barrier and Democrats insisting they won't give him the money.

Trump has been making a public case that there is a ""crisis"" at the southern border. And he's still threatening to declare a national emergency to circumvent Congress if he can't get the wall money from them.

He told reporters during a visit to the Capitol earlier Wednesday that he may turn to a declaration ""at some point"" if top Democrats Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi ""don't agree"" with his assessment about the problems at the border.

President Donald Trump says Republicans are ""totally unified"" in the shutdown standoff over his long-promised southern border wall, though some GOP lawmakers have been expressing concern about the 19-day partial government closure.

Trump traveled to Capitol Hill on Wednesday to meet with Senate Republicans. He says there was ""no discussion about anything other than solidarity.""

Trump has been considering a national emergency declaration to bypass Congress to build the wall. He says he ""may do that at some point"" if he can't get a deal with Democrats.

Trump also plans to meet with top congressional Democrats and Republicans at the White House on Wednesday.

President Donald Trump arrived on Capitol Hill claiming he has ""tremendous"" support as he headed into a meeting with Republican senators uneasy with the government shutdown over his border wall.

Asked how long the shutdown would last, Trump told reporters Wednesday ""whatever it takes.""

The partial shutdown is now in its 19th day, the second longest ever.

Trump and Vice President Mike Pence arrived for the private lunch meeting with the Senate GOP caucus to shore up support.

Several Republican senators have said the government should be re-opened while talks continue over border security and Trump's demand for money to build the wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.

President Donald Trump says he thinks he and the Democrats are ""getting closer"" to a deal to end the budget stalemate that has partially shut down the government despite no evidence that any progress has been made.

And he's suggesting the partial government shutdown could be ""a blessing in disguise"" because, he suggests, it could lead to a broader immigration deal.

Trump spoke Wednesday during an Oval Office bill signing on anti-human trafficking legislation. It's a day after he delivered a prime-time address trying to make the case for his long-stalled U.S.-Mexico border wall.

Trump says that he would like to see ""real immigration reform in this country because we need it."" He says, ""Everybody wants to see immigration reform,"" adding that perhaps the stalemate ""will turn out to be a blessing in disguise.""

Gone are the days when the U.S. and Mexican governments regularly exchanged statements over President Donald Trump's insistence on a border wall.

Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said Wednesday he won't be drawn into what he calls a U.S. internal dispute, an apparent reference to the 19-day-old partial U.S. government shutdown over a border barrier.

Lopez Obrador says, ""We are not going to respond to situations arising from internal affairs in the United States.""

Unlike his predecessor, the Mexican leader didn't have to respond to any specific aspersion about Mexico, because Trump didn't make any in his Tuesday night address to the American public. Relations between the two leaders have been surprisingly cordial, given their ideological differences.

Lopez Obrador said, ""Of course, there are those ... who want us to get into a confrontation. We always want a friendly relationship with the United States, a cooperative relationship.""

As a presidential candidate Trump promised Mexico would pay for a border wall, but Mexico refused.

President Donald Trump is using a bill signing focused on curbing human trafficking to push his case for a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border.

Trump says a southern border that is not secured exacerbates the incidents of human trafficking. He says, ""As long as we have a border that is not secure, we're going to suffer the consequences of that.""

Wednesday's bill signing came a day after Trump's prime-time speech designed to persuade Americans that illegal immigration and trafficking at the border are a crisis.

Democrats have called Trump's promised wall costly, ineffective and ""immoral"" and say he's ""manufacturing a crisis.""

The bill Trump signed is designed to enhance an annual State Department report that measures global efforts to eliminate human trafficking.

The White House says it's the fourth bipartisan bill the Republican president has signed in the last few weeks to prevent human trafficking.

Congressional Democrats say they'll head to the White House with the plan to reopen the government -- the same one they've been presenting. They're asking President Donald Trump to accept a bipartisan bill to fund border security without the wall.

Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Wednesday the president ""could end the Trump shutdown and re-open the government today, and he should.""

Pelosi and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer spoke at an event where they were flanked by federal workers going without pay during the shutdown, now in its 19th day.

Schumer called workers the ""collateral damage"" of Trump's ""temper tantrum."" He said the president failed to ""persuade a soul"" during his ""divisive"" prime-time address Tuesday night to the nation.

Trump meets with congressional leaders at the White House Wednesday afternoon. He rejected the Senate's bipartisan funding bill in December, sparking the shutdown.

The White House is trying to keep jittery congressional Republicans from defecting over the toll the partial government shutdown is taking in their states.

President Donald Trump and Democrats have been at an impasse over funding for his proposed border wall, which has led to a partial government shutdown, now in its 19th day.

Trump meets with Senate Republicans Wednesday on Capitol Hill just hours after he argued on national television that a border wall was needed to resolve a security and humanitarian ""crisis.""

Senators say the shutdown has led to disruptions in agricultural payments for farmers, as well as for home buyers trying to secure government-backed home loans. Lawmakers also are worried about missed paychecks for government workers Friday.

As many as half a dozen GOP senators have said the government should reopen while border security negotiations with Democrats continue.

President Donald Trump again linked illegal immigration along the southern border with drugs and violent crime as he urged Democratic lawmakers to fund his proposed border wall.

In his first national address from the Oval Office, the president gave no indication he was softening his stance that the partial government shutdown would continue without money for the wall.

Trump argued Tuesday night that the wall was needed to resolve what he called a security and humanitarian ""crisis.""

He addressed the nation as the shutdown stretched through its third week, with hundreds of thousands of federal workers going without pay and some congressional Republicans growing increasingly jittery about the impasse.

106,economic times,https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/international/world-news/congress-to-face-same-question-when-will-shutdown-end/articleshow/67521682.cms,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congress returns to Washington for its first full week of legislative business since control of the House reverted to Democrats, but lawmakers will be confronted with the same lingering question: When will the partial government shutdown end?

One Republican senator says he's offered President Donald Trump a possible solution, though it may just be wishful thinking.

Sen. Lindsey Graham is encouraging Trump to reopen government for several weeks to continue negotiating with Democrats over the border wall Trump wants to build on the U.S.-Mexico border. If there's no deal at the end of that time, Graham says Trump would be free to take the more dramatic step of declaring a national emergency to build it.

But the South Carolina Republican says Trump still wants a deal on funding for the wall before agreeing to reopen shuttered government departments. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat, insists Trump reopen the government first.

Their weeks-old standoff led to the partial government shutdown, now on day 24 without a clear end in sight.

""Before he pulls the plug on the legislative option, and I think we're almost there, I would urge him to open up the government for a short period of time, like three weeks, before he pulls the plug, see if we can get a deal,"" Graham said. ""If we can't at the end of three weeks, all bets are off.

""See if he can do it by himself through the emergency powers. That's my recommendation,"" added Graham, who has publicly pushed Trump to use his authority to declare a national emergency to build the wall. Such a step would allow Trump to bypass Congress and tap various pots of unspent federal money, including for military construction and disaster relief as well as from assets seized by law enforcement, to pay for the wall.

Trump has kept Washington on edge over whether he would resort to such a declaration, citing what he says is a ""crisis"" of drug smuggling and the trafficking of women and children at the border. The president initially sounded as though such a move was imminent, but then pulled back. He has said several times since he first mentioned the idea in public this month that he prefers a legislative solution.

A key question is how much more time is Trump willing to give lawmakers. Graham, who spoke with Trump by telephone on Sunday morning, said the legislative path ""is just about shut off"" and blamed intransigence by Pelosi.

The speaker's office had no immediate comment.

Democrats oppose an emergency declaration but may be powerless to block it. Some Republicans are wary, too, fearing how a future Democratic president might use that authority. Such a move, should Trump ultimately go that route, would almost certainly be challenged in the courts.

Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., called Graham's idea to reopen the government a ""great place to start.""

""I do think if we reopen the government, if the president ends this shutdown crisis, we have folks who can negotiate a responsible, modern investment in technology that will actually make us safer,"" Coons said.

Trump says technology is nice, but that the border can't be secured without a wall.

The White House has been laying the groundwork for an emergency declaration, which is feared by lawmakers in both parties.

Senate Homeland Security Committee Chairman Ron Johnson, R-Wis., said he'd ""hate to see"" a declaration issued because the wall wouldn't get built, presumably because of legal challenges. Democrats voted in the past for border security and should again, he said.

""I actually want to see this wall get built,"" Johnson said. ""I want to keep pressure on Democrats to actually come to the negotiating table in good faith and fund what they have supported in the past.""

Graham favors a declaration and said the time for talk is running out.

""It's the last option, not the first option, but we're pretty close to that being the only option,"" he said.

Graham and Coons spoke on ""Fox News Sunday"" and Johnson appeared on CNN's ""State of the Union.""

The House has approved a bill to fund the Treasury Department, the IRS and other agencies for the next year as part of a Democratic strategy to reopen the government on a piecemeal basis.

Eight Republicans joined 232 Democrats to support the bill.

House Appropriations Committee Chairwoman Nita Lowey says taxpayers rely on the IRS to assist them in filing taxes and financial planning but now ""don't have anyone they can turn to"" for answers.

Steve Daines introduced a bill on the Senate floor Thursday that would withhold the pay of members of Congress during future government shutdowns.

Daines' introduction of the bill, sponsored by Republican Texas Sen. John Cornyn, comes hours after Daines announced he sent a letter requesting the secretary of the U.S. Senate withhold his pay during the ongoing partial shutdown of the federal government.

""Members of Congress are sent to Washington, D.C., to represent the great people of their state and keep the federal government open, working, and funded. So it's simple. If they can't do that, they shouldn't get paid. No work, no pay,"" Daines told The Daily Caller News Foundation after the bill was introduced.

The ""No Work, No Pay Act,"" introduced by Daines, would make it so members of Congress would not be paid if they cannot keep the government funded.

His move to not accept pay was followed by many of his colleagues, such as Cornyn, who said he was excited to join Daines in co-sponsoring the bill. He echoed Daines' message that members of Congress should not be paid while government agencies are shut down.

""The senator is very hopeful his colleagues will follow suit as this is a very important issue in bringing accountability to Washington, D.C.,"" Katie Schoettler, Daines' deputy communications director, told The Daily Caller News Foundation.

In the House, Republican Utah Rep. John Curtis introduced a similar bill, which would make it unlawful to pay U.S. senators and representatives during government shutdowns.

Republican Texas Rep. Dan Crenshaw also announced Thursday he would refuse to be paid until the government is open, saying he asked the chief administrative officer to withhold his pay until both sides can come to an agreement on border security.

""Democrats aren't the only people who want this shutdown to end. Republicans have tried to compromise, but Democrats won't come to the table and negotiate in good faith. I cannot let federal employees take the fall for Democrats' grandstanding, so I am withholding my pay until this partial shutdown ends,"" Crenshaw told The Daily Caller News Foundation.

Republican Indiana Rep. Greg Pence, another freshman congressman, released a video Thursday, saying he too would not accept his pay until the southern border is secured, echoing President Donald Trump's message. Trump traveled to the southern border to meet with Immigration and Customs Enforcement officials.

Pence campaigned on fighting the opioid crisis plaguing the country, something he considers a top priority and not a partisan issue.

""We are facing a serious opioid crisis and it seems that some Democrats refuse to acknowledge this,"" Pence told The Daily Caller News Foundation Thursday afternoon. ""It's important that we work to solve the crisis, which includes securing our border. Hancock County, for example, had 50 overdose deaths between 2014-2017, and in 29 of the cases, opioids were found. This isn't a partisan issue.""

Oklahoma Republican Rep. Kevin Hern is donating his salary from the shutdown to veterans organizations, saying they deserve the money over members of Congress in the midst of a partial government shutdown.

""I've long held the belief that if you don't do your job, you shouldn't get paid. Being elected to Congress shouldn't exempt us from the standards that any employer would hold. If Congress can't fund the government, we shouldn't be paid for failing to do our constitutional duty,"" Hern told The Daily Caller News Foundation Thursday night.

As the government entered its 19th day of a partial shutdown Wednesday, five Republican lawmakers -- Ohio Rep. Bob Gibbs, North Carolina Rep. Mark Meadows, Indiana Rep. Susan Brooks, Colorado Rep. Scott Tipton, and Virginia Rep. Morgan Griffith -- introduced legislation that would require federal workers to be paid during the shutdown.

""While Democrats continue to play politics with border security, federal employees dedicated to their mission of keeping America safe and our border secure are still going to work knowing they will be missing their paychecks,"" Gibbs said in a Wednesday statement.

Trump was on Capitol Hill Wednesday meeting with Republican senators to discuss the shutdown and border wall funding. After the meeting, he said Republicans were ""unified.""

The president also warned Democrats he might declare a national emergency if they cannot come to an agreement soon."

The government shutdown that has halted paychecks for hundreds of thousands of federal workers began its third week Saturday with no end in sight, as Vice President Pence, top White House officials and senior congressional aides met for more than two hours without reaching a deal to reopen the government.

Inside the meeting at the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, Pence refused to budge from the more than $5 billion President Trump has demanded from Congress to pay for a portion of his promised wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, according to two Democratic officials briefed on the negotiations.

The standoff -- which has heavily affected national parks and other operations and threatens to halt payments as varied as food stamps and tax refunds -- has made Trump's unrealized border wall the linchpin of his presidency as he seeks to make good on a signature campaign promise.

Administration officials have acknowledged that they were not prepared for the potential consequences of an extended shutdown and Trump's decision to demand wall funding. Democrats, meanwhile, are standing firm on offering no taxpayer money for the project, which Trump had long asserted would be funded by Mexico.

Pence was deputized by Trump to oversee Saturday's talks, but he did not have the president's blessing to float new or specific numbers as he did last month in a meeting with Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), according to two Trump aides who were not authorized to speak publicly. That meant few specifics were actually discussed Saturday, as Democratic staffers repeatedly pushed the administration to reopen the federal government and negotiate differences over the border after the shutdown ends.

But the administration -- represented by Pence, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and senior adviser Jared Kushner -- refused, according to multiple officials.

""Not much headway made today,"" Trump tweeted Saturday afternoon. ""Second meeting set for tomorrow. After so many decades, must finally and permanently fix the problems on the Southern Border!""

Before the meeting began Saturday morning, Trump took a combative tone in several Twitter messages and claimed that news coverage documenting cracks in Republican support for his hard-line position were inaccurate.

""Great support coming from all sides for Border Security (including Wall) on our very dangerous Southern Border,"" Trump tweeted. ""Teams negotiating this weekend! Washington Post and NBC reporting of events, including Fake sources, has been very inaccurate (to put it mildly)!""

A number of Republicans, including Sen. Cory Gardner (R-Colo.), who is up for reelection in 2020, have said in recent days that the government should be reopened and that a shutdown is not the ""right answer,"" worrying GOP leaders about the depth of support for Trump's position.

Trump spent much of Saturday on the phone with allies, talking through his positioning on the shutdown and hearing their reviews of his Friday news conference in the Rose Garden, according to a person close to him. Two people regularly on his call list -- Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) and Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) -- have encouraged Trump to hold fast and refuse to agree to reopen the government unless wall funding is secured, the person said.

""I've never seen the president as resolved on any issue as he is on this,"" Meadows said Saturday. ""But he is open to new ideas about how to end the impasse.""

Trump told reporters Friday that he wants to reopen government but is prepared to maintain the shutdown for weeks or even years. He also told congressional leaders at the White House on Friday that he preferred the term ""strike"" over ""shutdown,"" people briefed on the meeting said.

In conversations with top aides on Friday and Saturday, House Democratic leaders said Trump and GOP leaders seem eager to be seen as making progress even if the talks remained stalled, allowing Republican lawmakers back home over the weekend to reassure nervous constituents, according to two Democratic officials briefed on those discussions who were not authorized to speak publicly.

""There is the reality of what the White House is doing, which is very little, and the image they're trying to send, which is, 'Look at us, we're busy, and the vice president is rolling up his sleeves,'"" one Democratic official said. ""They're worried about defections.""

During Saturday's meeting, Democratic staffers asked the White House to lay out in formal detail the administration's funding request for the border -- including its specific security requests, what the money would be used for, and what in the Homeland Security budget the administration would cut to make the numbers work, people familiar with the meeting said.

Democrats ""emphasized that it's important for us to have an updated budget request from the White House because they have been all over the map,"" said another official briefed on the discussion. The White House plans to provide those figures before the group meets again Sunday afternoon.

Some centrist Republicans on Saturday urged Trump and congressional leaders to reopen the government, reflecting growing unease in their ranks about the prolonged shutdown and the political cost the GOP might pay.

""With Nancy Pelosi as speaker, it's going to have to be a compromise solution,"" Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick (R-Pa.), a moderate and former FBI agent who represents the Philadelphia suburbs, said in an interview. ""It's our most basic function as members of Congress to fund the government, and we need to have these battles on immigration and other issues on their own turf, separately.""

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said in a statement Saturday that the House will begin passing separate bills to reopen the government next week, starting with the funding bill that covers the Treasury Department ""so that the American people can receive their tax refunds on schedule.""

""The senseless uncertainty and chaos of the Trump Shutdown must end, now,"" Pelosi said.

Mulvaney said in an interview to air Sunday on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" that Trump would ""take a concrete wall off the table"" in negotiations with Democratic leaders if that would help end the shutdown.

""If he has to give up a concrete wall, replace it with a steel fence to do that so that Democrats can say, 'See? He's not building a wall anymore,' that should help us move in the right direction.' "" Mulvaney said.

But Trump is annoyed by news reports about the negotiations that make it seem that he is backing away from his demands and wants to avoid stories about new numbers for wall funding being discussed, Trump aides said. The president instead encouraged Pence and senior aides to focus on the $5.6 billion for border security that was the focal point of legislation passed last month by House Republicans, the aides said.

Trump exasperated members of both parties with his comments Friday, but Trump spent that evening boasting to friends that he was in a strong negotiating position because he was able to capture attention and make a flurry of points that he feels his core voters appreciate, White House officials said.

White House senior staffers were to depart late Saturday for Camp David for a staff retreat where discussions about policy and priorities for 2019 are to be planned, and the president is expected to join them Sunday. Mulvaney is spearheading the gathering as a way of connecting with his new deputies and colleagues, according to officials.

The president is asking advisers about further ways to battle for wall funding in the coming days, whether it is meeting with family members of people killed by undocumented immigrants, huddling with sheriffs or visiting the border, the officials said.

As Saturday's meeting unfolded, Trump was eyeing his own options for trying to force the Democrats' hand, including declaring a national emergency to begin wall construction without congressional approval, a possible course he mentioned at his Friday news conference.

According to two confidants of Trump's, who have spoken to him in recent days but were not authorized to speak publicly, Trump is looking at how such a move would play out and has told his aides that such a drastic turn could rattle the Democrats and compel them to offer him wall funding. The legality of such a move is unclear, however, and Trump would almost certainly face immediate legal challenges in the courts.

Still, there are signs within the White House that more-comprehensive deals are at least being discussed, more likely for after the shutdown concludes and the government reopens.

Kushner, the president's son-in-law, continues to tell his allies that he thinks there could eventually be a deal for border wall funding in exchange for immigration protections for undocumented immigrants who were brought to the United States as children, according to two people who were briefed on those discussions. Another person familiar with the discussions emphasized, however, that Kushner was not pushing for a deal on Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, at this time.

Chatter about an agreement involving protections for young immigrant beneficiaries of the DACA program have risen a bit in recent days, although the administration has rejected previous wall-for-DACA deals and Democratic leadership is in no mood for one now.

After his work on a bipartisan criminal justice reform bill, Kushner is as engaged as ever with Capitol Hill, the people said. Still, Kushner's interest in brokering a possible deal on immigration has caused some anxiety among conservatives close to Trump, several of whom said Saturday they feared the president could eventually be intrigued by Kushner's position as the shutdown drags on and Trump searches for a way out.

A fundraiser to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border has raised over $3 million in 3 days on the online platform GoFundMe.

The fundraiser, titled ""We The People Will Fund The Wall,"" was started by Brian Kolfage, an Iraq war veteran and triple amputee. Kolfage's personal website describes him as a motivational speaker.

""It's time we uphold our laws, and get this wall BUILT!,"" Kolfage wrote on the fundraiser page. ""It's up to Americans to help out and pitch in to get this project rolling.""

The fundraiser comes as the White House and Capitol Hill remain deadlocked over President Donald Trump's threat to shut down the government if Congress does not approve $5 billion in funding for a border wall.

tweet

As of Thursday morning, more than 60,000 people have donated roughly $3.8 million to the GoFundMe, which is still far shy of the $25 billion President Trump himself has said is needed for the border wall. ""If we can fund a large portion of this wall, it will jumpstart things and will be less money Trump has to secure from our politicians,"" Kolfage wrote.

While building a wall along the southern border was one of President Trump's main campaign promises, his attempts to secure funding have so far been unsuccessful. President Trump assured voters on the campaign trail that Mexico would pay for the wall, but he has since walked backed that assertion and looked toward Congress for funding.

Most recently, the president has threatened to shut down the government unless Congress approves $5 billion for a border wall. Congress, on the other hand, is set to pass a short-term bill to fund the government through February 8 that does not include any money for the wall. President Trump has not said whether or not he will sign the bill, but he has recently taken a more restrained approach to his demands. ""With so much talk about the Wall, people are losing sight of the great job being done on our Southern Border by Border Patrol, ICE and our great Military,"" he tweeted on Thursday.

The GoFundMe page gives no clear indication of how exactly the donations will be used. ""We have contacted the Trump Administration to secure a point of contact where all funds will go upon completion,"" Kolfage wrote. ""When get this information secured we will update.""

Kolfage assured supporters that the fundraiser ""is not a scam"" because he is providing his real name and social media profiles. Last month, a New Jersey couple and homeless man were arrested for allegedly using a fake story to raise over $400,000 on GoFundMe. The company's policy states that it will refund donors up to $1,000 each if ""the campaign organizer doesn't deliver funds to the intended beneficiary."""

Elon Musk revels in bad boy behavior on Twitter, with fart jokes, accusations of pedophilia, insults directed at the Securities and Exchange Commission, and much more.

Load Error

""Twitter is a war zone,"" he said in a recent ""60 Minutes"" TV interview. ""If somebody's going to jump into the war zone, it's like, OK, you're in the arena, let's go.""

On Friday, Tesla's board of directors took on the uncomfortable role of peacekeeper. Under a fraud settlement Musk signed with the SEC in September, Tesla's board must now ""oversee"" Musk's public communications, including his Twitter feed.

Most of the details are left to the directors. There is no requirement that the company review all of Musk's tweets. The company is, however, required to ""pre-approve"" written communications from Musk that include ""information material to Tesla or its shareholders.""

Whether the oversight will fundamentally alter Musk's Twitter activity is open to doubt. He's been tweeting freely since the settlement was signed. The only tweets that would call for review, he told ""60 Minutes,"" are those that might move the stock price. Any further restrictions, Musk said, would violate his 1st Amendment rights.

Musk took the opportunity on ""60 Minutes"" to toss another taunt: ""I do not respect the SEC,"" he said. ""I do not respect them.""

Exactly why Musk lacks respect for the SEC is unclear. If he was asked to explain that in the interview, ""60 Minutes"" didn't broadcast it.

Jay Dubow, a lawyer at Pepper Hamilton who served with the SEC's enforcement division early in his career, offers one possibility: The settlement, he said, is weak.

""I thought it was weak from the outset,"" he said. Although Musk lost his chairman title, he remains chief executive and still sits on the board, which will soon gain two new independent directors, also part of the SEC settlement. He continues to own about 20 percent of Tesla shares.

© Branimir Kvartuc/Zuma Press/TNS Elon Musk, co-founder and chief executive officer of Tesla Inc., speaks during an unveiling event for the Boring Co. test tunnel in Hawthorne, Calif., on Tuesday, Dec. 18, 2018.

It is unclear what additional obligations the Tesla board might place on Musk or how such oversight might work. The settlement requires Musk to ""comply with all mandatory procedures implemented by Tesla"" pertaining to his public communications but leaves the board to establish the procedures as it sees fit.

Also required: the creation of a board committee comprising independent directors to oversee the terms of the settlement. On Friday, Tesla proposed the appointment of Larry Ellison, founder and executive chairman of Oracle, and Kathleen Wilson-Thompson to its board.

Under the SEC deal, the company must designate an experienced securities lawyer to review Musk's communications ""consistent with"" procedures approved by the board. On Dec. 6, Tesla hired a new general counsel: Dane Butswinkas, chairman of Williams & Connolly and a well-known trial lawyer.

If the board has approved any procedures under the settlement, they have not been made public. Asked whether the procedures would be made public, Tesla declined to respond.

The tweet that caused Musk trouble shocked Tesla followers on Aug. 7, when he claimed he had ""funding secured"" for a mega-deal to take Tesla private at a valuation estimated around $70 billion. The stock surged on the tweet, then fell back as it became clear that Musk hadn't secured any funding for any private deal.

Dubow pointed out, along with many other securities law experts, that the funding-secured tweet presents an obvious example of an untrue statement that had material consequences for shareholders, a clear violation of SEC rules. But most cases that involve ""material"" information are not so clear-cut, and that could give Musk some leeway on his public statements.

Supreme Court decisions and guidance from the Financial Accounting Standards Board and the SEC boil down to two main thresholds for determining when information is material to shareholders, Dubow said. First, the information must be something a reasonable shareholder or potential shareholder would want to know when making decisions to buy or sell. Second, the material must ""alter the total mix of information"" available to investors about the company in question.

The funding-secured tweet ""very clearly"" met both thresholds, Dubow said. But what about shifting promises about how many Model 3s Tesla will produce and sell? Or Musk's Nov. 19 tweet promising to double Supercharger capacity by the end of 2019?

""Materiality is often a hindsight test,"" Dubow said. ""Sometimes you don't know if stockholders are going to react to it.""

That's what Musk was getting at in the ""60 Minutes"" interview, when he answered a question about how the company could determine whether a tweet would move the stock price if it wasn't reviewing all his tweets. ""I guess we might make some mistakes,"" he said. ""Who knows? Nobody's perfect.""

Anyone who thought the SEC settlement would result in a neutered Twitter feed from Musk might be in for a surprise.

115,msn.com,http://www.msn.com/en-xl/northamerica/top-stories/congress-to-face-same-question-when-will-shutdown-end/ar-BBSduZ3,"WASHINGTON -- Congress returns to Washington for its first full week of legislative business since control of the House reverted to Democrats, but lawmakers will be confronted with the same lingering question: When will the partial government shutdown end?

One Republican senator says he's offered President Donald Trump a possible solution, though it may just be wishful thinking.

Sen. Lindsey Graham is encouraging Trump to reopen government for several weeks to continue negotiating with Democrats over the border wall Trump wants to build on the U.S.-Mexico border. If there's no deal at the end of that time, Graham says Trump would be free to take the more dramatic step of declaring a national emergency to build it.

But the South Carolina Republican says Trump still wants a deal on funding for the wall before agreeing to reopen shuttered government departments. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat, insists Trump reopen the government first.

Their weeks-old standoff led to the partial government shutdown, now on day 24 without a clear end in sight.

""Before he pulls the plug on the legislative option, and I think we're almost there, I would urge him to open up the government for a short period of time, like three weeks, before he pulls the plug, see if we can get a deal,"" Graham said. ""If we can't at the end of three weeks, all bets are off.

""See if he can do it by himself through the emergency powers. That's my recommendation,"" added Graham, who has publicly pushed Trump to use his authority to declare a national emergency to build the wall. Such a step would allow Trump to bypass Congress and tap various pots of unspent federal money, including for military construction and disaster relief as well as from assets seized by law enforcement, to pay for the wall.

Trump has kept Washington on edge over whether he would resort to such a declaration, citing what he says is a ""crisis"" of drug smuggling and the trafficking of women and children at the border. The president initially sounded as though such a move was imminent, but then pulled back. He has said several times since he first mentioned the idea in public this month that he prefers a legislative solution.

A key question is how much more time is Trump willing to give lawmakers. Graham, who spoke with Trump by telephone on Sunday morning, said the legislative path ""is just about shut off"" and blamed intransigence by Pelosi.

The speaker's office had no immediate comment.

Democrats oppose an emergency declaration but may be powerless to block it. Some Republicans are wary, too, fearing how a future Democratic president might use that authority. Such a move, should Trump ultimately go that route, would almost certainly be challenged in the courts.

Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., called Graham's idea to reopen the government a ""great place to start.""

""I do think if we reopen the government, if the president ends this shutdown crisis, we have folks who can negotiate a responsible, modern investment in technology that will actually make us safer,"" Coons said.

Trump says technology is nice, but that the border can't be secured without a wall.

The White House has been laying the groundwork for an emergency declaration, which is feared by lawmakers in both parties.

Senate Homeland Security Committee Chairman Ron Johnson, R-Wis., said he'd ""hate to see"" a declaration issued because the wall wouldn't get built, presumably because of legal challenges. Democrats voted in the past for border security and should again, he said.

""I actually want to see this wall get built,"" Johnson said. ""I want to keep pressure on Democrats to actually come to the negotiating table in good faith and fund what they have supported in the past.""

Graham favors a declaration and said the time for talk is running out.

""It's the last option, not the first option, but we're pretty close to that being the only option,"" he said.

Contending that Democrats ""have simply shut down the discussions,"" he sought to place the blame on House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., who is expected to be elected speaker in the new Congress.

""Nancy Pelosi, in fairness, does not have the votes for the speakership yet,"" Mulvaney said. ""She cannot be seen by her party as being weak on negotiating with Donald Trump. So we fully expect that until she is elected speaker and has locked that vote up, we don't expect to hear from the Democrats again.""

According to a Washington Post tally, Pelosi, who won the Democratic caucus's nomination for the speakership in late November, appears to have secured enough support to be elected speaker in January.

Pelosi's spokesman, Drew Hammill, said in a statement Friday that Democrats ""are united against the President's immoral, ineffective and expensive wall -- the wall that he specifically promised that Mexico would pay for.""

Democrats will not consider any offers that have not been publicly endorsed by Trump himself, he said.

""While we await the president's public proposal, Democrats have made it clear that, under a House Democratic majority, we will vote swiftly to reopen government on Day One,"" Hammill said.

At the heart of the stalemate is Trump's demand for $5 billion in funding for his proposed wall at the U.S.-Mexico border. Congressional Democrats have rejected that figure and in recent weeks have refused to publicly endorse a figure above $1.3 billion, which continues existing funding levels and includes money for new border fencing and levee walls, but not the concrete wall Trump once demanded before he started more recently talking about ""steel slats.""

Mulvaney said Friday that ""some folks use the term 'wall' and they mean different things.""

""Everyone agrees that what we can and should be building on that southern border is that steel barrier that the president tweeted out. That's what he wants to build. The Democrats, believe it or not, don't call that a wall,"" he said."
117,msn.com,http://www.msn.com/en-xl/northamerica/top-stories/partial-government-shutdown-assured-after-lawmakers-leave-capitol-without-budget-deal/ar-BBRhWTo,"Large parts of the federal government are shutting down overnight after President Trump torpedoed a bipartisan spending deal because it lacked the money he demanded for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.

Funding for numerous agencies, including those that operate parks, homeland security, law enforcement, tax collection and transportation, was set to expire at midnight. Close to 400,000 federal workers are expected to be sent home without pay until a deal is reached, and numerous services will be halted in that time, with the impacts broadening the longer the funding lapse lasts.

The shutdown intensifies a standoff between Trump, who is demanding $5.7 billion for a border wall, and congressional Democrats, who have vowed to block any wall funding and have the votes to do so. It marks a deflating final chapter for Republicans as they complete two years of unified GOP control in Washington -- as well as an acrimonious prelude to the upcoming era of divided government, after Democrats take the House in January.

Trump saw the final days of this year as his last chance to try to extract funding for the wall, while Democrats, united against the wall and buttressed by big wins in the midterm elections, showed no signs of buckling to his demands amid a flurry of attacks this week.

The White House and congressional leaders continued negotiations late Friday, but by 8:30 p.m., the House and the Senate had adjourned for the night. That made it impossible to vote on any spending agreement until Saturday, and it remained unclear whether any deal would materialize by then.

It is unclear how long a shutdown might last. Trump predicted earlier Friday that it could drag on for a ""very long time.""

About two hours before the shutdown was set to take effect, Trump distributed a video on Twitter in which he blamed Democrats but expressed hope that the lapse in government funding would be brief.

""We're going to have a shutdown,"" he said. ""There's nothing we can do about that because we need the Democrats to give us their votes. ... Let's be bipartisan, and let's get it done. The shutdown hopefully will not last long.""

The Senate on Friday considered legislation that would fund the government agencies through Feb. 8 and appropriate $5.7 billion for the erection of 215 miles of wall structures along the Mexico border.

The House passed that legislation Thursday evening, but Senate Democrats successfully unified on Friday and refused to back that measure.

Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) said Friday that Democrats were open to discussions with the White House and Republicans but would not agree to any measure that funded the construction of a new border wall.

Schumer said Friday that the Senate had unanimously agreed to a spending bill earlier in the week and accused Trump of having a ""temper tantrum"" because he wasn't getting money for the wall.

""President Trump, you will not get your wall,"" Schumer said. ""You're not getting your wall today, next week or on Jan. 3 when Democrats take control of the House.""

Democrats tried to make clear to the White House for weeks that they had the votes to block any measure that contained money for the wall.

As their power became clear to White House officials, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders signaled Tuesday that Trump was planning to withdraw his request for the funds in an effort to keep the government open.

But he received a torrent of criticism from conservative lawmakers and commentators following this decision, and he reversed course on Thursday, scuttling a temporary, bipartisan spending bill that would have extended funding through Feb. 8 but did not contain wall money.

Trump on Friday urged Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) to change long-standing Senate rules to pass the House's measure providing $5.7 billion for the wall.

McConnell refused, making it impossible for Senate Republicans to marshal the measure through because Democrats control 49 seats in the 100-member chamber.

""We're going to be working very hard to get something passed in the Senate,"" Trump said earlier Friday in the Oval Office. ""Now it's up to the Democrats as to whether or not we have a shutdown tonight. I hope we don't, but we've very much prepared for a long shutdown.""

Republicans were frustrated by the reversal, and Democrats warned Friday that the president's erratic and unvetted decisions in recent days were unsettling financial markets, foreign allies and even members of his Cabinet.

""This is tyranny of talk radio hosts, right? And so, how do you deal with that?"" said Sen. Bob Corker (R-Tenn). ""You have two talk radio hosts who completely flipped the president. And so, do we succumb to tyranny of talk radio hosts?""

Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis announced his resignation Thursday. The Dow Jones industrial average had one of its worst weeks in recent decades and has fallen almost 4,400 points, or 16 percent, since October.

Multiple federal parks and monuments are slated to close, some as soon as Saturday morning. The Securities and Exchange Commission posted a list of the services it will soon suspend, including the processing of certain business records. The Justice Department, Commerce Department and Internal Revenue Service are preparing to send thousands of workers home without pay.

And Trump's prediction that a shutdown would last ""for a very long time"" meant that hundreds of thousands of federal employees risk missing at least one paycheck. Even the Border Patrol agents and Transportation Security Administration officials who are directed to continue working during the shutdown will not be paid until Congress funds their agencies.

About 400,000 federal workers would be furloughed, according to a Washington Post projection. But a number of federal agencies, including the Pentagon, will not be directly affected, because Congress already passed multiple other spending bills this year that secured funding through September.

As the funding lapse lengthens, the negotiations will prove to be a major test for Trump, Schumer, McConnell and House conservatives as they jostle for footing in Washington's new power structure.

Friday afternoon saw a flurry of discussions begin in the afternoon when McConnell, Democrats and Vice President Pence began huddling separately in the Capitol.

Pence separately joined Trump adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner and White House budget director Mick Mulvaney for a meeting with House conservatives. But the talks yielded no clear evidence of progress, and eventually Pence and his entourage left the Capitol.

""We don't have a deal,"" Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Richard C. Shelby (R-Ala.) told reporters after emerging from a late meeting with the vice president. ""There are a lot of moving parts, and we're trying to get them moving together.""

The construction of a wall along the border with Mexico was one of Trump's top campaign promises in 2016, and he had promised that Mexico would finance the entire project. But since taking office, he has demanded the money from Congress.

Senate Democrats have blocked every attempt so far. Trump has also threatened to shut the government down numerous times if he doesn't receive money for the border wall, but before Friday night, he had backed down every time.

In recent days, Trump has tried a number of different tactics to try to secure the money. He called on Cabinet secretaries to search their budgets for extra funds, and on Wednesday, he said the entire project would be built by the military. But by Thursday he was back to demanding that Congress provide the funding, leaving many GOP lawmakers scrambling to accede to his demands.

The shutdown followed a day of posturing and unsuccessful negotiations in the Senate on Friday.

After meeting with Trump at the White House, McConnell called a vote aimed at advancing the bill with $5.7 billion for the border wall, saying the legislation would not be considered controversial in more normal times.

""I'm proud to vote for it,"" McConnell said.

But after hours of maneuvering, it became clear that the legislation would not command the support needed to pass, although the Senate advanced it on a procedural vote -- with Pence breaking a tie -- to keep a legislative vehicle alive in case a deal does emerge.

Trump, meanwhile, ratcheted up public pressure on Democrats to cave on the wall.

In a spate of morning Twitter posts, Trump sought to pin blame on Democrats for a potential shutdown, even though he said last week that he would accept responsibility for a shutdown.

""The Democrats, whose votes we need in the Senate, will probably vote against Border Security and the Wall even though they know it is DESPERATELY NEEDED,"" Trump wrote. ""If the Dems vote no, there will be a shutdown that will last for a very long time. People don't want Open Borders and Crime!""

But Democrats showed no signs of relenting, and on Friday night, they continued to blame Trump and the Republicans for the partial shutdown.

""I think we ought to make it clear that it's the president's abrupt change in position and refusal to accept the deal he's already told his leadership he'd accept,"" said Sen. Christopher A. Coons (D-Del.)

""Look, this is the last week we have a Republican-controlled Senate and House and White House -- they've got to work this out."""
118,macleans.ca,https://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/canadian-politics-in-2018-the-year-in-12-chapters/,"Justin Trudeau greets Donald Trump during the official welcoming ceremony at the G7 Leaders Summit in La Malbaie, Que., on June 8, 2018. (THE CANADIAN PRESS/Sean Kilpatrick)

Of the dozen countries Prime Minister Justin Trudeau visited overseas in 2018, how many can you name? What, only India? Odd that nobody seems to recall his jaunts to Peru or Argentina, Latvia or Papua New Guinea. Yet quite a few of us can fake our way through the entire ""Twelve Days of Christmas."" Memory is a funny thing.

Speaking of 12, that happens also to be the number of hours Conservative MPs held up parliamentary business last June, by keeping the House voting on sundry motions, as their way of protesting the Liberals' refusal to release detailed estimates of the cost of a carbon tax. But let's not dwell on disputation in this festive season -- not even to recall the 12 FBI audio recordings, from Michael Cohen's home, office and hotel room, that helped U.S. prosecutors send Donald Trump's former personal lawyer to jail for three years.

While this annual review of Canadian federal politics leans heavily on the evocative 12 -- the traditional tally of Jesus's apostles and Israel's tribes -- it's only as a way to put a firm lid on the number of stories selected to tell the tale of federal politics in 2018. Here they are, just one from each month of the calendar about to go into the recycling bin:

January: We added the word ""attestation"" to our political lexicon

As 2018 began with the Trudeau government embroiled in a bitter fight with faith-based groups, angry over, of all things, a new application form for federal summer jobs funding. To qualify, applicants were asked to ""attest"" that their ""core mandate"" respected certain rights -- specifically including ""reproductive rights.""

Catholic and evangelical lobbies that oppose abortion protested. And, late in the year, the Liberals relented, dropping the reviled ""attestation"" requirement. Still, the furor left little doubt about the gap between this government and Canadians who don't self-identify as ""progressive.""

February: We saw that clothes also sometimes unmake the man

Nobody can deny Trudeau wears suits well. Yet even for him there's a limit, and he exceeded it repeatedly in his lastingly notorious February trip to India. Opting for a series of celebratory Indian outfits, Trudeau looked plain silly. To make matters worse, Jaspar Atwal, a B.C. man convicted of trying to murder an Indian cabinet minister in 1986, had to be uninvited from events on Trudeau's official Indian itinerary.

Tories still raise the trip at every opportunity. For them, at least, it stands as evidence that Trudeau's most serious vulnerability might be doubts about his seriousness.

March: We heard a plea to make room for complexity in politics

By winning the NDP leadership in late 2017, Jagmeet Singh jumped from Ontario politics to the national stage as the first member of a visible minority group to head a federal party. And in March, his Sikh roots became a big issue. Asked why he participated in Sikh activist meetings where pictures of militant leaders were on show, Singh rejected terrorism, but asked Canadians to see the complexity in India's history.

He struggled, too, with managing the NDP caucus from outside parliament. From last spring on, Singh's year was uneven at best -- leaving him a steep climb in 2019.

April: We noticed that new guy taking a thorny issue to court

Not many Canadians had heard of Scott Moe in early 2018 when he took over from Brad Wall as premier of Saskatchewan and leader of the right-of-centre Saskatchewan Party. Only a few more paid attention when, in April, Moe went to court to contest the federal Liberal government's plan to impose a carbon tax on any province that didn't implement one of its own.

He was often overshadowed by allies like Ontario Premier Doug Ford or Alberta Conservative Leader Jason Kenney, but Moe opened a key front in the battle that could largely define Canadian politics in 2019.

May: We tried to estimate how much credibility $4.5 billion buys

The federal government's purchase of Kinder Morgan's Trans Mountain pipeline for $4.5-billion made Trudeau directly responsible for completing the much-delayed tripling of Trans Mountain's capacity for getting Albertan oil to a tanker port just up the coast from Vancouver. Trudeau's grand bargain: a national-wide carbon price to cut greenhouse gas emissions, but, during a transition to the promised low-carbon economy, a serious push to sell more of Alberta's bitumen overseas. It's a tricky, controversial policy -- and a pillar of the Liberals' 2019 re-election pitch.

June: We watched Trump give Trudeau a (quite unintentional) boost

This year's summit of the Group of Seven leading democratic economic nations, held at Charlevoix, Que., ended with the U.S. president throwing a tantrum about the Canadian Prime Minister on Twitter. Trump didn't like Trudeau saying Canada ""will not be pushed around"" by American tariffs on steel and aluminum.

The upshot? Trudeau had what Liberal insiders later said was his best week in the polls. The lesson? Most Canadians really despise Trump. It was a cautionary moment for any Canadian Conservative tempted to tap into Trumpian populism on this side of border.

July: We noted how timely cabinet changes can clarify what matters

When a prime minister switches up his cabinet, the moment is often assessed as though politics were a volume business. Not many changes, can't be too important, right? But consider Trudeau's July shuffle. He gave Dominic LeBlanc, his lifelong friend, Intergovernmental Affairs. Bill Blair, the former Toronto police chief, got the new Border Security portfolio. Thus, LeBlanc would have to finesse Trudeau's increasingly tense relationship with the provinces, and Blair handle the border-crossing migrant issue, which Tories say constitutes a ""crisis."" Thus, this small shuffle directed our attention precisely where it needs to be.

August: We asked how populist a Tory needs to sound in the Age of Trump

Conservative Leader Andrew Scheer went into his party's big policy convention in Halifax having to react to news that Quebec MP Maxime Bernier was leaving the Tory fold. Bernier would go on to launch his People's Party of Canada, bidding for support from Canadian right-wingers feeling the global populist vibe.

How dangerous is that for Scheer? In Halifax, his national campaign manager, Hamish Marshall, urged Conservatives not to lapse into arguments about ""ideological purity and who's more virtuous or not."" Still, Bernier's potential drain on support will test Scheer in 2019.

September: We were, as usual, suckers for a good nail-biting finale

Even though trade talks always seem to go down to the wire, the drama is hard to resist. So it was with the renegotiation of NAFTA, which finally resulted in a deal late on Sept. 30, with a midnight deadline imposed by Trump's White House bearing down on the Canadian government.

No task had more dominated the attention of the Trudeau Liberals. Failure to secure a new pact would have jeopardized 1.9 million export-dependent Canadian jobs. Success secured Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland cabinet's best public-opinion rating, and turned managing Canada-U.S. trade into the Liberals' top economic bragging point.

October: We cracked stoner jokes about a watershed moment in law

When the federal Cannabis Act took effect on Oct. 17, officially making pot legal across Canada, there was a lot of kidding around. International media treated the story light-heartedly, too. But this was a serious social turning point -- and the culmination of the very first major policy goal Trudeau set out when he was only seeking the Liberal leadership.

Of course, there were problems. Too little legal supply. Early uncertainty about what's allowed when it comes to promoting weed. But, with many other Trudeau policy initiatives in question, this was an ambitious one that came fully to fruition.

November: We assessed a muted response to Trump's major tax cuts

When Canadians think of Trump's impact, it's usually to marvel at the heat of his invective and depth of his dishonesty. In at least one way, though, his challenge to Canada is pure policy: he cut U.S. corporate taxes sharply. Business lobbyists urged the Canadian government to follow suit. In response, Finance Minister Bill Morneau announced, not sweeping tax relief, but three targeted breaks allowing companies to write off capital investments more quickly. The implicit bet: a more cautious approach from Ottawa will stand the test of time better than Trump's expensive stimulus, which is what's heating up the U.S. economy.

December: We caught, just out the corner of our eye, a meeting in Poland

Despite another year of increasingly intense forest fires and weirdly violent weather, the full reality of climate change never quite seems to sink in. The latest Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change report urged much greater efforts to cut fossil-fuel burning in half in less than 15 years, and phase them out almost entirely in 30 years. In December, UN talks in Poland nudged the world closer to real action, with Environment Minister Catherine McKenna representing Canada.

""We're running out of time,"" UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres told the meeting Katowice, a coal-mining town. But are Canadians seized with the urgency of the planet's biggest problem? With climate-change policy looking likely to dominate the 2019 federal election, we're about to find out.

There's something about the 12 months before an election year. For some, it's a welling sense of anticipation and pressing need for preparation. For others, alas, there's only trepidation. But, for almost all, the end of the year affords glorious moments of freedom. If you absolutely can't stop yourself, use yours to look back and compare 2018's 12 chapters with our editions from 2017, 2016, 2015, 2014, 2013, 2012, 2011 and 2010. A more wise choice, however, given what 2019 has in store, would be to exploit every remaining opportunity to rest up."
119,breitbart,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/01/15/beto-orourke-border-already-fully-secured-building-wall-will-ensure-death/,"In an extensive interview with The Washington Post, the 46-year-old reportedly expressed his belief that the ""border is already fully secured and that further investment would take it even further 'past the point of diminishing returns,' pushing migrants seeking to cross the border illegally into more dangerous and desolate territory.""

""You will ensure death,"" he said of President Donald Trump's desire to construct a border wall in an effort to stop the continuous flow of illegal immigration. ""You and I, as Americans, have caused the deaths of others through these walls.""

Democrats' refusal to make a deal with Trump over the border wall is the reason for the longest government shutdown in history. As a result, around 800,000 federal workers are not getting paid, while many essential government departments are not receiving the necessary funding to carry out their activities.

During the interview, O'Rourke also questioned the usefulness of the ""principles"" of the U.S. Constitution, describing it as the real ""question of the moment.""

""Can an empire like ours with a military presence in over 170 countries around the globe, with trading relationships ... and security agreements in every continent, can it still be managed by the same principles that were set down 230-plus years ago?"" he posited when asked whether the U.S. could ever see the implementation of radical change.

The former El Paso Congressman, who was defeated by Republican Ted Cruz in their competitive Senate race last November, is currently considering whether to run for the 2020 Democratic presidential nomination.

Last week, The Wall Street Journal reported that O'Rourke is planning a road trip to meet voters outside of Texas. He is also scheduled for a one-to-one Q&A with Oprah Winfrey in New York next month as part of her star-studded interview series ""Oprah's SuperSoul Conversations from Times Square."""
120,breitbart,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/01/13/exclusive-gov-jan-brewer-our-country-going-collapse-without-border-wall/,"Former Gov. Jan Brewer (R-AZ) says the United States ""is going to collapse"" as a nation without a border wall and end to mass illegal immigration.

In an exclusive interview with SiriusXM Patriot's Breitbart News Tonight, Brewer said the importance of a border wall should not be understated, noting that the U.S. has had ""a crisis for a long time"" on the U.S.-Mexico border.

Brewer said:

I often used to say, a country with a border secured is like a house without walls, it collapses. You have to have your houses protected or it will collapse. And if you don't have a wall on the border, our country is going to collapse. It's as simple as that. And it doesn't seem to be something that's very hard to understand. [Emphasis added]

The Democrats, the left-leaning liberal Democrats just want open borders. I think that's very plain. [Emphasis added]

Brewer said the U.S. has a right to enforce its immigration laws, saying that for decades, the federal government has not adequately protected American citizens from illegal immigration.

""It is the federal government's responsibility to protect the citizens of the United States,"" Brewer said. ""And they haven't done it and it's about time they step up and do their job.""

""We've had a crisis for a long time. It's ruining our country. Illegal immigration is wrong,"" Brewer said. ""If I go to Mexico, I have to go through the Port of Entry, I have to show my ID ... Mexico, Canada they all have these rules, but no we can't do that because we have to be what, compassionate. Well, let's show a little compassion for our fellow citizens.""

Currently, the federal government has remained partially shut down as House Democrats block any funding for physical barriers at the U.S.-Mexico border. A handful of Senate Republicans, meanwhile, crafted a plan to give amnesty to illegal aliens that ultimately failed to gain traction.

President Donald Trump has said he is reviewing a plan to deem the border and illegal immigration a national emergency in order to fund a wall along the southern border."
121,the blaze,https://www.theblaze.com/news/trump-threatens-to-close-southern-border,"Government shutdown will likely carry into next year as congressional Democrats refuse to budge

President Donald Trump threatened Friday to close the U.S. border with Mexico, holding firm on his insistence that congressional Democrats get on board with funding a wall to help stave off illegal immigrants pouring into the country from the south.

Meanwhile, America's government shutdown -- now in Day 7 -- will likely carry into next week and the new year as Congress refuses to budge in the standoff.

In a series of tweets, President Trump announced that his administration could be forced to seal America's U.S.-Mexico border if ""obstructionist Democrats do not give us the money to finish the wall and also change the ridiculous immigration laws that our country is saddled with.""

He went on to say that he would consider such closure to be a ""profit making operation"" given how much the U.S. loses in trade with Mexico under NAFTA.

The president then reiterated his threat to close the border if wall funding isn't secured, and added that his administration would also cut off foreign aid to Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador for taking money from the U.S. while not preventing its citizens from migrating to America in caravans.

The Senate held a pro-forma session Thursday. According to ABC News, no lawmakers showed up during the holiday break, and the office of House Majority Whip Steve Scalise (R-La.) notified members Thursday that there would be no votes this week."

Marsha Blackburn (R-TN) criticized House Democrats for their refusals to negotiate with President Donald Trump and Senate Republicans on funding for a wall at the U.S.-Mexico border.

Blackburn noted that the $5 billion requested by Trump was one-tenth of 1 percent of the budget. She also warned that without border security, there are consequences.

""What you're seeing is that because we have this open border, you have every town a border town, and every state a border state,"" she said to host Sean Hannity. ""And these gangs and drug traffickers, human traffickers, sex traffickers are coming to a community near you, and they're all across our country, and people know that, and law enforcement knows that. This is why you have our Border Patrol and law enforcement saying secure that border. We need a wall. We need to have a barrier because that will help keep people from coming in. It will serve as a way to stop the traffickers.""

""And I - when you talk to Angel Moms and individuals that have lost their children or their spouses or loved ones to these illegal aliens, many of them criminal illegal aliens that should have been deported, it is heartbreaking,"" Blackburn added. ""And Tennesseans want to see the border secured."""
124,ctv news,https://www.ctvnews.ca/world/graham-urging-trump-to-reopen-government-for-a-few-weeks-1.4251407,"WASHINGTON -- A Republican lawmaker advising U.S. President Donald Trump said he is encouraging the president to reopen the government for several weeks to continue negotiating with Democrats over funding for a U.S.-Mexico border wall before the president takes the more drastic step of declaring a national emergency.

But that may be wishful thinking, given that Sen. Lindsey Graham also says Trump still wants to reach a deal for the wall before agreeing to reopen shuttered government departments. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a leading Democratic negotiator, insists that Trump reopen the government first.

The weeks-old standoff over funding led to the partial government shutdown that hit day 23 on Sunday without an end in sight.

""Before he pulls the plug on the legislative option, and I think we're almost there, I would urge him to open up the government for a short period of time, like three weeks, before he pulls the plug, see if we can get a deal,"" said Graham, a South Carolina Republican. ""If we can't at the end of three weeks, all bets are off.""

""See if he can do it by himself through the emergency powers. That's my recommendation,"" added Graham, who has publicly pushed Trump to use his authority to declare a national emergency to build the wall. Such a step would allow Trump to bypass Congress and tap various pots of unspent federal money, including for military construction and disaster relief and from asset seized by law enforcement, to pay for the wall.

Trump has kept Washington on edge over whether he would resort to such a declaration, citing what he says is a ""crisis"" of drug smuggling and the trafficking of women and children at the border. The president initially sounded as though such a move was imminent, but then pulled back. He has said several times since he first mentioned the idea in public earlier this month that he prefers to try to reach a deal with Congress.

A key question is how much more time is Trump willing to give lawmakers. Graham, who said he and Trump talked by telephone on Sunday morning, said the legislative path ""is just about shut off"" and blamed Pelosi.

The speaker's office had no immediate comment.

Democrats oppose an emergency declaration but may be powerless to block it. Some Republicans are wary, too, fearing how a future Democratic president might use that authority. Such a move, should Trump ultimately go that route, would almost certainly be challenged in the courts.

Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., called Graham's idea to reopen the government a ""great place to start.""

""I do think if we reopen the government, if the president ends this shutdown crisis, we have folks who can negotiate a responsible, modern investment in technology that will actually make us safer,"" Coons said.

Trump has maintained that the border cannot be secured without a wall.

Graham said he thinks Trump is willing to accept the $5.7 billion he has insisted on for the wall, along with some immigration measures Democrats might find acceptable, such as helping immigrants who were illegally brought to the U.S. as children.

Trump has expressed interest in a broader immigration overhaul, but says he first wants the Supreme Court to address the class of immigrants known as ""Dreamers."" Pelosi also has shown no interest in accepting a wall -- she has called it an ""immorality"" -- in exchange for immigration fixes.

And, Trump, who was holed up in the White House as snow blanketed Washington on Sunday, appeared to shoot down Graham's suggestion of a ""wall plus"" deal, saying on Twitter that even Democrats don't want to make ""Dreamers"" part of the negotiations.

""The damage done to our Country from a badly broken Border - Drugs, Crime and so much that is bad - is far greater than a Shutdown, which the Dems can easily fix as soon as they come back to Washington!"" Trump said in a separate tweet.

The White House has been laying the groundwork for an emergency declaration, feared by members of both parties.

Senate Homeland Security Committee Chairman Ron Johnson, R-Wis., said he would ""hate to see"" a declaration because then the wall wouldn't get built, presumably because of legal challenges. Democrats voted in the past for border security and should again, he said.

""I actually want to see this wall get built,"" Johnson said. ""I want to keep pressure on Democrats to actually come to the negotiating table in good faith and fund what they have supported in the past.""

But Graham, who favours a presidential declaration, said the time for talk is running out.

""It's the last option, not the first option, but we're pretty close to that being the only option,"" he said.

Graham and Coons spoke on ""Fox News Sunday."" Johnson appeared on CNN's ""State of the Union."""
125,breitbart,https://www.breitbart.com/politics/2019/01/07/exclusive-mike-braun-enough-is-enough-time-to-secure-the-border/,"Braun, a populist businessman similar to President Donald Trump, spoke with Breitbart News on Monday in an extensive conversation over securing America's southern border and combatting illegal immigration.

Braun defeated former Sen. Joe Donnelly (D-IN) by nearly six points during the 2018 midterm elections and rose his way through the Indiana Senate Republican primary by ousting two popular conservative congressmen, Reps. Todd Rokita (R-IN) and Luke Messer (R-IN), by over ten points each.

Braun's victory against Donnelly, as well as Trump's double-digit victory in the 2016 presidential election, suggests that Hoosiers want to secure the country's southern border and end illegal immigration.

Braun, who campaigned in Indiana with President Trump several times over the 2018 midterms, told Breitbart News that border security was a top priority for Hoosier voters.

""I think in Indiana, border security was right up there with jobs and the economy. I think the cost of health care was too when I campaigned. I'm disappointed that we're just talking about $5.7 [billion] when it's going to take more than that to really address it and to make sure that we have a secure border and promote legal immigration the way it's always been,"" Braun told Breitbart News. ""It's always been on the part of the Democrats, where everyone agrees on what we ought to do, the president is calling their bluff, and they're digging in politically.""

Braun's comments arise as the federal government continues to experience a partial government shutdown over Trump's $5.7 billion in requested border security funding. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) have refused to give in to Trump's demands.

Former red-state Democrats, such as Sens. Donnelly and Heidi Heitkamp (D-ND), shocked voters as they relented on their pledge to back Trump's partial border wall funding and instead voted against advancing the Republican spending bill that contains $5.7 billion in border wall funding.

The Indiana senator said that many red-state Democrats use ""political calculation"" to get elected. Meanwhile, Sen. Braun has signed a term limit pledge which allows him to focus on representing Hoosier interests in the Senate, especially on immigration.

Sen. Braun said, ""It says they'll do everything with political calculation so, get elected then come back into the party fold with some convenient excuse. I think that's really a turnoff I know Hoosiers have with the federal government. It's one of the reasons I decided to run; I have the blessing of signing a term limits pledge and hopefully we'll have more steadfastness than most politicians here.""

The Hoosier businessman said that he thinks that ""Indiana is a law and order state that believes in simple things like a border that should be respected and secured.""

Sen. Braun charged that he believes that securing the border and tackling illegal immigration ranks as a top issue for Hoosiers and GOP voters.

President Trump announced on Monday that he will deliver a prime time address on Tuesday night on America's insecure southern border, in which he will explain directly to the American people why the country needs border security.

The Indiana Republican said that ""enough is enough"" and that America needs to secure its southern border.

""I am pleased to inform you that I will Address the Nation on the Humanitarian and National Security crisis on our Southern Border,"" Trump tweeted on Monday.

Braun said that Hoosiers ""also need something that addresses a lot of the issues due to not having a sound immigration plan. I believe President Trump ran on it and carried Indiana by 19 points back in '16 and came in several times for me and immigration was always a discussion. When we tried to measure that we were talking about the right things, like I said it was right up with two or three other things, all of equal importance. I think Hoosiers are practical folks... it's clear that we have a border that is systematically not respected and breached for decades. And enough is enough.""

The senator continued, suggesting that the conservation of illegal immigration has reached a ""boiling point,"" and that the Democrats' plan for illegal immigration is basically ""no border security.""

""I think it's easier to talk about now than it's ever have been. It's reaching a culmination, it's reaching a boiling point of sort, and I'm interested to see if the Democrats are willing to do anything other than just beleaguer the process. And, you got to remember just two years ago most of them wanted to spend $25 billion and believed in a physical impediment; now all of that is gone and all they propose is $1.6 [billion],"" Braun said. ""That is a real about-face. I think the real political fishtailing is from the Democrats. It's going to be on their shoulders to see if they can dig in and keep their plan, which is basically no border security. Period."""
126,the blaze,https://www.theblaze.com/news/trump-path-to-citizenship-foreign-worker-visa,"President Donald Trump's administration wants to change the foreign worker visa program to include a pathway to citizenship that's more direct. The announcement comes as Trump continues to spar with Democrats over his plan for a $5.7 billion wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.

""H1-B holders in the United States can rest assured that changes are soon coming which will bring both simplicity and certainty to your stay, including a potential path to citizenship,"" Trump wrote Friday on Twitter. ""We want to encourage talented and highly skilled people to pursue career options in the U.S.""

The H1-B visa program allows companies to hire foreign workers for some skilled occupations.

Trump has said he will consider a broader reform of immigration, but not before funding is secured for a concrete or steel wall along the border and more technology and personnel to oversee the barrier.

His tweet arrives at the end of week three in the partial government shutdown. Trump and Congress are deadlocked over how to fund the border wall, one of his key 2016 campaign promises. Trump suggested this week that emergency disaster funds could be used to help fund the project. He has also said he might declare a national emergency to push through the border wall project if Congress cannot reach an agreement to fund it.

The president didn't say specifically how the visa program would be overhauled. But his administration has talked about it since last year.

During his presidential campaign, Trump suggested an increase in prevailing wages for H-1B visa-holders. That would force companies to consider unemployed U.S. workers for entry-level jobs instead of bringing in workers from overseas.

""This will improve the number of black, Hispanic and female workers in Silicon Valley who have been passed over in favor of the H-1B program,"" the Trump campaign stated in August 2015.

His campaign website also stated:

When politicians talk about 'immigration reform' they mean: amnesty, cheap labor and open borders. The Schumer-Rubio immigration bill was nothing more than a giveaway to the corporate patrons who run both parties.

Real immigration reform puts the needs of working people first - not wealthy globetrotting donors. We are the only country in the world whose immigration system puts the needs of other nations ahead of our own. That must change."
127,channel newsasia,https://www.channelnewsasia.com/news/world/us-government-shutdown-drags-into-fourth-week-amid-stalemate-11121820,"WASHINGTON: A partial government shutdown entered its 24th day on Monday (Jan 14) as talks between US President Donald Trump and congressional Democrats remained stalled even as some of Trump's fellow Republicans called on the president to cut a deal and strains mounted nationwide.

Trump appeared unmoved to act, however, retweeting criticism of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer that urged the top Democratic leaders to negotiate with him over funding for his long-promised wall along the US-Mexico border.

""I've been waiting all weekend. Democrats must get to work now. Border must be secured!"" Trump wrote in an early morning tweet on Monday.

Democrats have rejected Trump's demand for US$5.7 billion for the border wall in addition to other border funds but have said they would support US$1.3 billion to bolster border security in other ways, including beefing up the number of Border Patrol agents and increasing surveillance.

About one-quarter of the US government shut down last month as Republicans controlled both chambers of Congress as well as the White House.

In December, Trump said he would take responsibility for the shutdown but has since shifted the blame to Democrats. A growing proportion of Americans blame Trump for the closures, a Reuters/Ipsos poll found.

He now must win concessions from the Democrats, who took over the US House of Representatives this month following November's elections. He also must win over enough Senate Democrats to secure the 60 votes needed to pass funding legislation there.

The stress from the shutdown became more visible as 800,000 federal employees across the United States missed their first paychecks on Friday. The cut government services also affected travelers as a jump in unscheduled absences among federal airport security screeners forced partial closures of airports in Houston and Miami.

National parks also remain shuttered, food and drug inspections have been curtailed and key economic data is on hold, among other impacts. Federal courts are set to run out of money on Friday.

ADDRESS TO FARMERS

Later on Monday, Trump is scheduled to address a New Orleans gathering of farmers, a key bloc of Trump supporters who have been hit by the shutdown as federal loan and farm aid applications have stalled and key farming and crop data has been delayed.

Republican US Senator Lindsey Graham, who last week had called on Trump to declare a national emergency as a way to get money to build his wall, on Sunday urged the president to instead reopen the government for a short period of time in an effort to restart talks before taking such action.

Declaring a national emergency over immigration issues is fiercely opposed by Democrats and remains unpopular with some Republicans. It also would likely face an immediate legal challenge.

Pelosi called on the Republican-led Senate to vote on several bills passed earlier this month by the House to fund affected departments that do not include money for Trump's wall. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said he will not take up any legislation that does not have Trump's support.

Representatives for Schumer could not be immediately reached for comment on Monday.

Both the Senate and the House were scheduled to reconvene on Monday afternoon, despite a weekend winter storm shuttered much of the Washington area and it remained unclear what, if any, steps lawmakers might take to address the lapsed funding measures for affected agencies.

Senator Chris Coons on Monday reiterated fellow Democrats' call for Trump to reopen the government while negotiations over the wall and immigration continue.

He acknowledged efforts by Graham and other Republicans to forge a temporary solution but said Trump has been unpredictable even among fellow conservatives with ever-shifting positions.

""Every time they make progress, the president throws cold water on it,"" Coons told CNN in an interview."
128,nationalreview.com,https://www.nationalreview.com/magazine/2019/01/28/the-week-21/,"* Planned Parenthood mistreats its pregnant employees? You should see what they do to their pregnant customers.

* Does Representative Rashida Tlaib (D., Mich.) represent the future of her party, as so many profiles have announced? The Palestinian-American was known primarily for her advocacy of a ""one-state solution"" in Israel, but she more recently grabbed headlines with her comments at a rally hosted by liberal group MoveOn. ""We're gonna go in there and we're going to impeach the motherf***er,"" Tlaib said. When pressed, Tlaib stuck to her guns while admitting that her vulgarity might have been a ""distraction."" Democratic leadership sought to downplay her comments and deny that impeaching the president is in their plans. But the appetite for aggressive tactics among the Democratic base is insatiable, a group of backbencher Democrats has already drafted articles of impeachment, and we doubt the party will be able to resist the resistance forever. On this issue, at least, Tlaib's voice is set to become the authentic voice of her party.

* In the Washington Post, freshman Republican senator Mitt Romney reiterated that he supports many of Trump's policies, objects to aspects of his character, and will not make a practice of commenting on each Trump Twitter controversy. He may have thought that putting those views on record would make it easier for him to implement that last decision. Instead the op-ed stoked speculation that Romney is angling to challenge Trump in the 2020 primaries -- an ambition Romney promptly disavowed. At the moment, at least, any such challenge looks quixotic. Many Republicans, including Trump, reacted harshly to Romney's criticisms of Trump, either attacking Romney's suitability as a messenger or faulting his message as counterproductive. What they almost never did was fault the criticisms as untrue. Perhaps Trump and his strongest allies would have done better to let Romney have the quiet reception he probably wanted.

* Senator Elizabeth Warren said she was forming an exploratory committee to run for president and began exploring Iowa. Her decision in October to release an analysis of her genetic background is generally, and across the political spectrum, judged to have backfired: It failed to end conservative ridicule of her claims of Native American ancestry while also violating inscrutable intersectional taboos of the Left. But Warren can be shrewd, and her lack of emphasis on Trump during her campaign launch is a case in point. What she recognizes is that voters already know Democrats can't stand him, and to win they are going to need something more.

* Senator Bernie Sanders faced accusations that his 2016 campaign mishandled sexual-harassment complaints from female staffers. It is an especially fraught controversy for two reasons: In intra-Left disputes, one group of feminists who backed Hillary Clinton have portrayed many of their opponents as misogynistic ""Bernie bros""; and Democrats are debating whether they should nominate a white man. A bigger problem for Sanders: He is polling poorly, which suggests that many Democrats supported him not because he was a socialist but because he was not Clinton. He will not have the luxury of having her as his main opponent next time, a misfortune he will almost certainly share with President Trump.

* Tucker Carlson set off a debate by delivering a monologue on what ails the nation. Our elites, he argued on Fox News, no longer care for our populace, have come to worship free markets rather than seeing them as a tool, and treat the maximization of GDP as the highest social goal. The results: We have more ""plastic garbage from China,"" but male wages have declined and, since women tend to prefer mates who make more than they do, so has marriage. Now our leaders are pushing for marijuana legalization, even as it threatens to increase social dysfunction. The particulars of Carlson's indictment, it must be said, mostly do not hold up. Marijuana legalization is not an elite plot: Most Americans favor it while most politicians have hung back, and many people favor it because they have decided that the costs of the war on drugs to decidedly non-elite Americans are too high. Elites are not responsible, either, for gains in female wages relative to male ones, and it's not an overvaluation of free markets that is keeping us from reversing those gains. But Carlson has articulated an excruciating truth: The social landscape of much of America, and especially of rural people without college degrees, has become shockingly grim, even amid a growing economy. The anguish is real, and Carlson is right to try to make his elite peers see it.

* Just after the New Year, House Democrats passed the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2019, the new majority's first effort to end the partial government shutdown. This bill predictably included none of the funding that Trump had requested to strengthen and extend existing physical barriers along the southern border. But it did include a provision to repeal the ""Mexico City policy,"" which the Trump administration applied to prevent U.S. foreign-aid funding from going to organizations that provide or promote abortion overseas. Time to build another wall, between taxpayers and abortion.

* Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, the socialist recently elected as a Democrat to the House, is famous for being lightly informed about things that are relevant to her job, e.g., what Congress does, how a bill becomes a law, etc. Her mathematics education does not seem to have been much better than her civics education: She has proposed to raise the marginal income-tax rate on a very small group of U.S. taxpayers -- those earning $10 million or more per year -- to 70 percent. But the tax she proposes would raise -- at most, assuming no change in taxpayer behavior -- about 2 percent of the cost of her Medicare-expansion plans alone, to say nothing of the tuition benefit and such other delightful goodies as a radically expanded welfare state might provide. Representative Ocasio-Cortez et al. have a problem with rich people: There aren't enough of them. There are a relative handful of Americans who earn astounding paydays, but their combined incomes are not high enough that raising their taxes, even to confiscatory levels, would fund the Democrats' dreams. Doing that would require a policy that the Democrats do not wish to contemplate: an enormous tax hike on the middle class. Rather than a tuition subsidy, Representative Ocasio-Cortez might ask for a refund from Boston University.

* In January, progressive complaints about the ""unjust"" nature of the U.S. Senate moved from the Idle Griping category into the Dangerous Fiction section. Writing in The Atlantic, a Wharton professor named Eric Orts insisted not only that the ""malapportionment"" of the Senate -- by which he means that Wyoming and California have the same number of senators -- can be remedied more easily than anyone has previously thought. Specifically, Orts maintained that, although Article V of the U.S. Constitution presents a nominal obstacle to the reform he covets, it is nevertheless ""arguable"" that Congress could bypass the amendment process with ordinary legislation and entirely recast the upper chamber. Indeed, Orts added, this may be mandatory given the equality protections contained elsewhere in the Constitution's text. Yet the Senate cannot be ""malapportioned,"" because, by design, it is not ""apportioned"" in the first place. Ordinary legislation cannot serve as a substitute for the amendment process, and if it could, there would be no point in our having a Constitution. And additions to the Constitution's text cannot be held to have repealed, sub silentio, unrelated parts by implication -- especially when the integrity of the Senate's structure is protected more comprehensively in the U.S. Constitution than that of any other part of government and confirmed in the Seventeenth Amend­ment. What Orts has made clear is that the progressive hostility to the make-up of the Senate is really hostility to the Constitution.

* Some senators, Democrats Kamala Harris (Calif.) and Mazie Hirono (Hawaii) most notably, are hounding federal judicial nominee Brian Buescher because of his membership in the Knights of Columbus, which they characterize as an extremist organization composed of troublesome priests and laymen opposed to women's rights. Founded in 1882 for the care of widows, orphans, and the disabled, the Knights are a Catholic fraternal organization loyal to the teachings of the Church. Knights calculated their charitable giving in 2017 at nearly $186 million. Members volunteered over 75 million hours of service. American war heroes have belonged to the Knights, President Kennedy among them. The senators' assault on religious liberty and the Constitution is an affront to America's greatness, dependent on and defined by a vibrant civil society and volunteer associations.

* Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis resigned over Trump's decision to withdraw from Syria and penned a carefully worded but scathing letter dissenting from Trump's foreign policy. Mattis is an honorable man with a superb military record, but also a sharp bureaucratic player. Whether he simply sought to restrain Trump's worst instincts, or was obstructive of the administration's worthwhile goals as well, depends on which insider you talk to. But the gravamen of his critique of Trump's foreign policy as often too alienating to allies and too forgiving of adversaries is hard to dispute. Since that basic approach comes from the top, it will endure no matter who, or how impressive, cabinet secretaries and other top officials are.

* In a commendable piece of reporting, the New York Times published an exposé of feminist organizations that discriminate against pregnant women, including allegations from more than a dozen current and former Planned Parenthood staffers who say the abortion provider has been ""sidelining, ousting or otherwise handicapping pregnant employees."" Women who worked for Planned Parenthood affiliates in California, Texas, North Carolina, and New York said that managers ""declined to hire pregnant job candidates, refused requests by expecting mothers to take breaks and in some cases pushed them out of their jobs after they gave birth."" It turns out there's a choice they're not ""pro,"" even for their own employees.

* In years past, this magazine spilled a lot of ink on the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. Incredibly, we must spill a little more now -- because President Trump defended that invasion, in terms that must have bewildered Russians themselves: ""The reason Russia was in Afghanistan was because terrorists were going into Russia. They were right to be there."" No, the Soviets went into Afghanistan to prop up a Communist regime that was under threat, pursuant to the Brezhnev Doctrine. Jimmy Carter responded, as Ronald Reagan did after him. In reference to our present allies, Trump was belittling: ""They tell me 100 times, 'We sent you soldiers, we sent you soldiers.'"" They have indeed been at our side in Afghanistan, Iraq, and elsewhere. And though the United States is necessarily the leading force, our allies have made sacrifices in the interest of burden-sharing. More than 450 Brits have died in Afghanistan. Halfway through his term, our president has a lot to learn.

* Rarely has a leader of the PRC threatened Taiwan so explicitly. Speaking in the Great Hall of the People, Xi Jinping said, ""The country is growing strong, the nation is rejuvenating, and unification between the two sides of the strait is the great trend of history."" (Beware all those who speak of ""the great trend of history."") He further said, ""We make no promise to abandon the use of force, and retain the option of taking all necessary measures."" In words aimed at the United States, he warned against ""intervention by external forces."" For her part, democratic Taiwan's president, Tsai Ing-wen, said, ""It is impossible for me -- or, in my view, any responsible politician in Taiwan -- to accept President Xi Jinping's recent remarks without betraying the trust and the will of the people of Taiwan."" She added, ""We hope the international community will pay attention and combine efforts to speak out on our behalf."" So do we.

* In the latest demonstration of American tech and entertainment companies caving to de facto censorship by autocratic foreign governments, Netflix has pulled from its feed to Saudi Arabia content that Riyadh said violated the nation's laws. Hasan Minhaj had dedicated an episode of his weekly show Patriot Act to a scathing critique of the Saudi regime, focusing on its long record of human-rights abuses, including atrocities in Yemen and the murder of dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi in October. How Minhaj's monologue impinged on ""public order, religious values, public morals, and privacy,"" the interests enumerated in the statute that Netflix allegedly contravened, remains for the Saudi government to explain. In agreeing to pull the episode, Netflix may have calculated that it was only protecting its position in the global market, but no one is fooled. Minhaj, a Muslim, noted that Muslims are more alert than most other people to the oppressive nature of the Saudi kingdom. Remember this the next time the entertainment industry congratulates itself for its courage.

* Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, the Egyptian strongman, agreed to go on 60 Minutes. Then the Egyptian government asked CBS not to air the interview. CBS went ahead regardless. Sisi had said many incredible things, including, ""We don't have political prisoners or prisoners of opinion."" Egypt has 60,000 of them, give or take. An Iranian leader was once quoted as saying that there were no homosexuals in Iran. Sisi's claim is equally credible.

* Japan has long dissented from the international norm that discourages whaling, and it made its dissent official in December by withdrawing from the International Whaling Commission. Japan will resume, for the first time in 30 years, commercial-whaling activity in the Pacific Ocean. Unlike some tribes in, say, Alaska, Japanese people don't need to hunt whales for subsistence. Friends of Japan, among whom we count ourselves, can only be disappointed.

* We've come a long way since the days of Hunter S. Thompson. Apparently book and magazine publishers, including Simon & Schuster, HarperCollins, Penguin Random House, and Condé Nast, have taken to including ""morality clauses"" in their contracts with writers -- under which the company may terminate an agreement if the writer, say, ""becomes the subject of public disrepute, contempt, complaints or scandals."" In other words: If you say something politically incorrect and the social-media mob seizes on your words, we retain the right to sacrifice you. Maybe they should call it a cowardice clause instead.

* Louis C.K. was not a Trump voter, but he has joined the ranks of the irredeemable. After doing desultory penance following his turn in the Me Too stocks owing to some gross, indefensible, and very odd behavior, the comedian is back at work -- and being de­nounced as a ""reactionary"" by Slate in what we assume is an unintentional tribute to the Maoist mood of the day. His fellow comedian Jim Carrey savaged him for mocking the omnipresent young witnesses to the Parkland shooting by maintaining that proximity to a horror does not give one special status to pronounce upon it (C.K.'s formulation was, as you might imagine, cruder than that). The thing about Louis C.K. and Parkland is: He's right. The failures of the criminal-justice and mental-health systems -- and the defects of human nature -- involved in these murderous episodes raise complex and sometimes recondite public-policy questions, and simply witnessing such an episode does not confer relevant knowledge or wisdom. The Parkland survivors merit our sympathy, not our deference. And while it is not obvious that Louis C.K. merits either, the point stands.

* The American Psychological Association has issued guidelines for psychologists working with men and boys, drawing on ""more than 40 years of research"" and showing that ""traditional masculinity -- marked by stoicism, dominance and aggression -- is, on the whole, harmful."" Of course, the depiction of ""traditional masculinity"" just quoted is itself a gross stereotype. But never mind that. The APA recommends ""changing the culture,"" and that clinicians ""be aware of dominant masculine ideals, and cognizant of their own potential biases."" If more psychologists were cognizant of their biases, these guidelines wouldn't have been issued.

* In our previous issue, we spoke of the demise of The Weekly Standard, the conservative magazine that ran from 1995 to just a month ago. We said, ""We know that Standard people will shine on,"" regardless. Some of them are shining on at a new site, The Bulwark. These include William Kristol, Jonathan Last, and the new site's editor in chief, Charlie Sykes. When the Standard was born, WFB wrote an editorial headed ""Come On In."" We say the same to the Bulwarkers.

* It has been a trend for years now: College football players refuse to play in their teams' bowl games, lest they get injured before they can be drafted by the NFL. This year, two of Michigan's captains refused to play in the Peach Bowl. Are they part of the team -- leaders of the team -- or not? Anyone can understand the economic rationale. Star athletes have a short time in which to make money, and they had better not blow it. But there are other considerations, such as loyalty, competition, and pride.

* Mount Holyoke College won't say how much it paid a consultant to design a new logo, but it was probably enough to pay the tuition of at least a couple of fourth-wave feminists in training. In return, the college got the letters ""MHC,"" squashed together a bit, with the ""C"" and part of the ""H"" tinted in a way that suggests, with the exercise of some imagination (squinting also helps), the cross-plus-circle ""female"" symbol. One might think that at a self-described ""highly selective, nondenominational, residential, research liberal arts college for women,"" a logo that vaguely suggests femaleness would be uncontroversial. But that's 20th-century thinking. Mount Holyoke's transgender community expressed shock and outrage at the suggestion that students at a women's college have to be women, and the administration yielded instantly: ""It is now evident to us that this symbol has a long history of exclusion connected to movements that, while trailblazing for some groups, represents the erasure of others."" Translation: A few women decided that they are men, and immediately started hogging the spotlight.

* For today's 18- to 25-year-olds, military life is a tough sell. There's the regimentation, the confusing geopolitics, the decidedly non-artisanal food, being stationed halfway around the world, plus the whole getting-shot-at thing. So army recruiters in the U.K. have taken a new tack: Instead of appealing to prospects' patriotism, spirit of adventure, or desire for self-improvement, why not appeal to their vanity? The result is a series of posters featuring photos of winsome, diverse twentysomethings with taglines such as ""Snowflakes / Your army needs you and your compassion,"" and ""Me Me Me Millennials / Your army needs you and your self-belief."" We suspect that very few ""Me Me Me Millennials"" would voluntarily describe themselves that way, and that absolutely no one would willingly be labeled a ""Snowflake"" -- certainly not the flinty Scots Guardsman whose photo was used in that poster without his consent (he says; the army disagrees), and who has in consequence resigned from the service. Other target groups include ""phone zombies"" (valued for ""your focus""), ""selfie addicts"" (""your confidence""), and ""binge gamers"" (""your drive""). It seems that the playing fields of Eton have been replaced with the gaming screens of Red Dead Redemption.

* Speaking of snowflakes and the British Army, Captain Louis Rudd, M.B.E., has crossed Antarctica alone, on skis, unaided, without even a kite to help the wind pull him along (a method used by some previous Antarctica crossers). Rudd took along all the food, supplies, and equipment he would need for the eight-week journey, and whenever his spirit seemed about to flag, he restored his courage by listening to an audiobook of Boris Johnson's biography of Winston Churchill. There'll always be an England . . . When Rudd arrived at the finish line, however, he saw that he had been beaten: by Colin O'Brady, an American who a few years ago suffered severe burns to his legs and was told he would never walk again, which goaded him into a grueling rehab regimen that eventually included competing in triathlons. The two men, friendly rivals, started their transcontinental treks at the same time, and O'Brady emerged as the first person ever to cross Antarctica solo and unaided, by a margin of two days. When Rudd arrived, however, O'Brady was away from his tent: He had decided it was time to celebrate his 921-mile trek over barren, snowy wasteland -- by doing a little skiing. There'll always be an America . . .

* Twitter exploded in horror in Great Britain at the deliverance of the queen's Christmas speech. Not because of anything Her Majesty said, mind you, but because she gave the address in Buckingham Palace in front of a golden piano. Queen Victoria bought the offending instrument in 1856; it has a gold-leaf finish and was made by the same Frenchman (Sébastien Érard) who crafted Chopin's piano. One Twitter user said that the queen's palace furnishings were ""glazed with tears of the poor."" Another said the queen ought to sell the piano and take the homeless off the streets for a year. The 92-year-old monarch spoke of self-sacrifice, the dangers of tribalism, and the importance of good will, faith, family, and friendship. Most significantly, she paid tribute to the birth of Jesus, which, she says, has brought hope into the world and meaning to her life. This is the same Jesus, incidentally, who said, ""For ye have the poor always with you; but me ye have not always."" There's an argument for constitutional monarchy and an argument for republicanism, but there's no argument for a monarchy without fancy pianos.

* Eleanor Maccoby, an eminent psychologist, died at 101. Her specialty was gender differences. There are differences between boys and girls, whether people like it or not. A paragraph in the New York Times' obit read, ""Dr. Maccoby said in an oral history at Stanford in 2011 that a female colleague had advised her to suppress any of her research that might be disadvantageous for women. Dr. Maccoby refused, she said, determined to publish whatever she found."" There was a scholar. R.I.P.

* Amos Oz was an Israeli who loved his country, fought for it in two wars, and in almost 40 books of fiction and journalism embellished its language and its literature. Art and artistry compensated for a childhood with deep emotional wounds. Although never a pacifist, he was a peacenik. With skill and passion he argued that Jews and Palestinians have exactly the same rights. To some in the ongoing thunderstorm over the future political shape of the neighborhood, he is a traitor; to others he was the national conscience, not just a spokesman but a modern prophet. Dead at 79, R.I.P.

The American military intervention in Syria represents one of the most successful and cost-effective military operations of the post-9/11 era. At a minimal price in American lives -- through maximum cooperation with courageous Kurdish and Arab allies -- the ISIS ""caliphate"" has been reduced to rubble, Russian and Iranian ambitions in Syria have been checked, and the United States has gained valuable territorial leverage in the negotiation for a permanent settlement in the Syrian civil war.

But there is work left to be done. ISIS is down but not out, our Syrian allies remain vulnerable, and Russia and Iran retain their own ambitions for regional domination. That's why it was deeply disturbing when Donald Trump appeared to change policy abruptly and ordered an immediate American withdrawal from Syria, in a decision that was clearly contrary to the national interest.

And that's why it is somewhat reassuring that Trump appears to have partially reversed course. National Security Adviser John Bolton has announced that the withdrawal will depend on the final defeat of ISIS and security guarantees for our Kurdish allies, conditions that could prolong the American deployment for many months.

The facts on the ground require a continued American presence. Yes, the political state ISIS tried to build in 2014-15 is largely in ruins, but ISIS the terrorist organization still exists, and it still has thousands of fighters. In fact, it's far stronger now than al-Qaeda was in 2011, when Barack Obama ordered Americans out of Iraq. ISIS is still a threat, and an American retreat would grant it the potential to reestablish safe havens in Syrian territory.

Moreover, a retreat would empower both Iran and Russia, granting a great strategic gift to two of America's chief geopolitical foes. When Vladimir Putin intervened in Syria's civil war to save the Assad regime, Barack Obama famously warned that Russia was getting sucked into a ""quagmire."" In fact, Russia's intervention has so far been an unmitigated success. It helped tip the balance of power in the civil war, secured continued access to Russia's naval base in Tartus, and restored Russian influence in the region to a level not seen since the Cold War.

A retreat would also seriously weaken the very same Kurdish allies who have fought and bled by our side in the campaign against ISIS. They'd be vulnerable to Assad's regime in the south and Turkish forces in the north. Without strong security guarantees, we would abandon the Kurds in Syria to a grim fate.

America's military presence in Syria does suffer from one quite serious flaw: It has not been approved by Congress. The invasion and occupation of the territory of a hostile foreign state is an act of war, and only Congress is constitutionally empowered to declare war. The proper course of action for the president is to stay the course and seek congressional approval.

The Trump administration must remember the bitter lessons of Obama's reckless withdrawal from Iraq. American retreats often create power vacuums that are filled by American enemies. Now, after all the blood spilled and tears shed since the rise of ISIS, President Trump must not make his own version of Obama's deadly mistake.

The (very) partial shutdown over funding for a border wall, or, to be more precise, more extensive fencing, has dragged on for weeks now.

President Trump is right to want more physical barriers at the border, and Democrats are showing how far left they've gone on immigration now that they equate a border fence with the Berlin Wall and call it inherently immoral.

Yet Trump has set himself up for disappointment. The first rule for winning a government-shutdown battle is not to take responsibility for the shutdown, which Trump did in his Oval Office confrontation with Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer before the onset of this showdown. Having gone on the record about how proud he'd be to shut down the government over border security, his subsequent attempts to blame the Demo­crats have gotten no traction, and at the margins, he's been shedding the support of congressional Republicans rather than picking off Democrats.

The best case is an unappetizing compromise, which is perhaps why the administration has been floating the idea of declaring a national emergency and erecting the fence with redirected military funds. Even if this were clearly legal -- and that's dubious -- it would functionally be an abusive end run around the spending powers of Congress.

All of this comes against the backdrop of a genuine crisis at the border. That crisis is not an influx of terrorists, and Trump-administration representatives have tripped themselves up by trying to make the numbers show large numbers of suspected terrorists caught at the border. It is not a wave of immigrants from Mexico, as in the past, so the fact that migration from Mexico is close to net zero doesn't have the significance that the media want to attribute to it. It is an ongoing surge of minors and families from Central America that we are ill equipped as a matter of law and resources to handle.

This category of migrant is the new normal. Twenty years ago, single men accounted for the vast majority of illegal immigrants; now families or minors are almost 60 percent of apprehensions. Because of court-dictated rules limiting how long we can hold children, an anti-trafficking law that makes it impossible to send Central American minors home easily, and a broken asylum process -- on top of strained resources across the board -- we are routinely releasing migrants into the country, even though this is a policy that the Trump administration (rightly) opposes and desperately wants to reverse. Our inability to control the flow encourages more migrants to come.

More physical barriers are part of the solution. It gives us more control if it is harder for migrants to cross illegally and if they can be made to apply at ports of entry. We saw a real-time example of the usefulness of a barrier when the caravan that arrived late last year in Tijuana was prevented from simply walking into the country by border fencing. The experience in places such as Yuma, Ariz., is that fencing has significantly diminished illegal crossings.

Even if Trump gets all the fence he wants in the current confrontation, though, it will take years to build and, at roughly an additional 200 miles, obviously not cover the entire border. It is more important to fix the rules around asylum and our handling of Central American families and minors so we aren't so hamstrung.

In its little-noticed latest offer to Democrats in Congress, the administration proposes measures to encourage Central American minors to apply for asylum in their home countries instead of showing up here after an incredibly dangerous journey. But this kind of policy change is being treated as a sideshow. However the shutdown fight ends, it is almost certain that the crisis at the border will rumble on."
129,nationalreview.com,https://www.nationalreview.com/2018/12/government-shutdown-trump-border-wall-funding-fight/,"The hope of achieving major policy goals via a government shutdown usually involves a huge dollop of wishful thinking. This time is no different.

President Trump wants to come out the other end of this (very) partial shutdown with substantially more funding for a border wall, but everything is set up for a disappointment.

The first rule for winning a government-shutdown battle is not to take responsibility for the shutdown, which Trump did in his Oval Office confrontation with Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer a week or so ago. Having gone on the record about how proud he'd be to shut down the government over border security, his subsequent attempts to blame the Democrats have gotten no traction (even if the Democrats are, indeed, wholly recalcitrant on the wall).

Party unity is necessary to weathering a shutdown fight and the congressional GOP leadership is unenthused, at best, over Trump's tactics over the last few days.

Finally, Democrats know that with every day that passes, they get a little closer to having more power when Nancy Pelosi takes the speaker's gavel on January 3, so they have no incentive to budge even if they were feeling political pressure. (It also, by the way, makes no sense to end the Senate filibuster just when unwelcome legislation will begin coming over from the House.)

This is why the shutdown is likely a box canyon for the White House. We sympathize with the desire for more structure on the border -- wall, fencing, whatever -- but it has taken on an outsized symbolic significance for both sides.

Democrats oppose it as if a wall designed to keep illegal immigrants and drug traffickers out would transform us into the moral equivalent of East Germany, which tried to wall its impoverished and repressed people in.

For their part, Trump supporters often speak of the wall as if it is the alpha and omega of immigration enforcement. Actually, regarding the migrant crisis, changing the rules around how we handle family units from Central America and asylum-seekers would be more important. In general, an E-Verify system to get employers to confirm the legal status of their employees would be the single most effective enforcement measure by turning off the jobs magnet.

All that said, the White House could have easily secured more funding if it had made it a concerted aim from the beginning. Instead, its initial budget request was for $1.6 billion, which it was on track to get before the president recently decided that $5 billion was the only acceptable number.

His seat-of-the-pants decision-making is another factor making a good outcome unlikely. He hopes, despite all of this, to wait out the Democrats until they buckle. We wish him luck, but the chances of success would be much greater if wishful thinking were a strategy."
130,thinkprogress,https://thinkprogress.org/homeland-security-immigration-border-false-claims-71a82cd0747d/,"The only existing immigration crisis was created by the government.

One day after President Donald Trump and congressional Democrats failed to strike a deal on funding for Trump's border wall and reopen the federal government, the White House released the PowerPoint presentation Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen prepared to brief Democratic leadership on border security.

Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-CA) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY), however, reportedly interrupted the presentation, titled ""A Border Security and Humanitarian Crisis,"" after they objected to what was being discussed.

Nielsen tweeted that she was ""disappointed"" Democrats did not want hear from DHS about the ""security and humanitarian crisis"" of ""criminal aliens"" at the border.

""The crisis is not going away -- it is getting worse. The status quo in funding & authorities for #DHS is irresponsible & makes our country less secure. Kicking the can down the road is not the answer,"" she added in a second tweet. ""I look forward to engaging w Members who want to listen & be part of the solution.

Taking a look a the presentation, it is easy to see why Pelosi and Schumer chose not to participate in Nielsen's briefing. It utilizes inflated numbers to justify its fear-mongering rhetoric about immigrants.

According to the first slide, the only way to address the influx of ""drugs, criminals, gangs, and terrorists"" coming across the U.S.-Mexico border is to build a physical border wall.

To bolster their claims, DHS cites data from Customs and Border Protection (CBP) that suggests a dramatic increase in the amount of illegal drugs seized at the southern border. According to the data, 1.7 million pounds of narcotics were seized by CBP in FY18.

CBP's own website, however, shows substantially lower figures -- only 47,945 lbs of cocaine, as opposed to 282,000 lbs, and 67,292 lbs of methamphetamine instead of 248,000 lbs.

CBP's website also shows that these drugs are arriving in the U.S. through ports of entry, meaning Trump's multi-billion dollar wall along the border will not prevent illegal drugs from entering the country.

""The most common method employed by Mexican TCOs [Transnational Criminal Organizations] involves transporting drugs in vehicles through U.S. ports of entry (POEs),"" the U.S. Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) reported in a 2016 assessment. ""Illicit drugs are smuggled into the United States in concealed compartments within passenger vehicles or commingled with legitimate goods on tractor trailers.""

The presentation also reflects the administration's ongoing effort to label all Central American immigrants as gang affiliated. According to the PowerPoint, 17,000 adult migrants with ""existing criminal records"" were arrested by CBP last year.

As Aaron Reichlin-Melnick, a policy analyst at the American Immigration Council points out, labeling all 17,000 immigrants as criminals is a lie by omission, considering the number could include individuals whose only criminal infraction is illegal entry into the U.S.

DHS also claims to have prevented 3,755 ""known or suspected terrorists"" from traveling to or entering the U.S., but the agency has never provided the data before. Additionally, the number applies to mostly air travel and is not exclusive to the southern border.

In a Friday press conference in the Rose Garden, Nielsen described the 3,755 individuals as having ""travel patterns that are identified as terrorist travel patterns or they have known or suspected ties to terrorism.""

The Trump administration has never shied away from conflating terrorism and immigration. In a controversial report issued a year ago, the Justice Department implied a link between terrorism in the U.S. and the country's current immigration policies by providing misleading data out of context. The report was written to accompany Trump's March 2017 Muslim Ban.

Several government watchdog and civil liberty groups sued the Justice Department, seeking a retraction or correction, but the agency refused. Rather than retract or correct the document, ""in future reports, the department can strive to minimize the potential for misinterpretation,"" according to a letter Michael H. Allen, deputy assistant attorney general for policy, management, and planning, wrote to the groups.

On the final slide, DHS suggests overturning the Flores Settlement Agreement, which prohibits the government from detaining minors indefinitely and requires minors are supplied with basic needs like access to food, water, and medical assistance. The administration has argued that overturning Flores is necessary because it prevents families from being separated, but without Flores, immigrant families would be detained together while their cases go through the court system, allowing for indefinite detention.

Even without the proposed rule change, the number of migrant children in detention has skyrocketed under the Trump administration.

The administration also suggested in the PowerPoint that amending the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act (TVPRA), which protects migrant children who arrive in the U.S. without parents, could be a solution to the ""crisis"" at the border. In practice, amending the legislation would allow unaccompanied minors to be swiftly deported and sent back to dangerous and even life-threatening living conditions.

These falsehoods are the basis of the Trump administration's justification for the ongoing partial federal government shutdown, now entering its third week. During Friday's Rose Garden press conference, Trump and key members of his administration doubled down on this fear-mongering rhetoric and threatened to prolong the shutdown for months or even years if the $5 billion for the border wall is not secured."
131,independent.ie,https://www.independent.ie/world-news/trump-ally-urges-president-to-reopen-us-government-37707122.html,"But Lindsey Graham admitted Mr Trump still wants to reach a deal for the wall before agreeing to reopen closed government departments.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a leading Democratic negotiator, insists that Mr Trump reopen the government first.

The weeks-old stand-off over funding led to the partial government shutdown that hit day 23 on Sunday without an end in sight.

""Before he pulls the plug on the legislative option, and I think we're almost there, I would urge him to open up the government for a short period of time, like three weeks, before he pulls the plug, see if we can get a deal,"" said Mr Graham, a South Carolina Republican. ""If we can't at the end of three weeks, all bets are off.""

Mr Graham, who has publicly pushed Mr Trump to use his authority to declare a national emergency to build the wall, continued: ""See if he can do it by himself through the emergency powers. That's my recommendation.""

Such a step would allow Mr Trump to bypass Congress and tap various pots of unspent federal money, including for military construction and disaster relief and from assets seized by law enforcement, to pay for the wall.

Mr Trump has kept Washington on edge over whether he would resort to such a declaration, citing what he says is a ""crisis"" of drug smuggling and the trafficking of women and children at the border.

The president initially sounded as though such a move was imminent, but then pulled back. He has said several times since he first mentioned the idea in public earlier this month that he prefers to try to reach a deal with Congress.

A key question is how much more time is Mr Trump willing to give Congress. Mr Graham, who said he and Mr Trump talked by telephone on Sunday morning, said the legislative path ""is just about shut off"" and blamed Ms Pelosi.

Democrats oppose an emergency declaration but may be powerless to block it. Some Republicans are wary, too, fearing how a future Democratic president might use that authority. Such a move, should Mr Trump ultimately go down that route, would almost certainly be challenged in the courts.

Senator Chris Coons, called Mr Graham's idea to reopen the government a ""great place to start"".

""I do think if we reopen the government, if the president ends this shutdown crisis, we have folks who can negotiate a responsible, modern investment in technology that will actually make us safer,"" Mr Coons said.

Mr Trump has maintained that the border cannot be secured without a wall."
132,the baltimore sun,https://www.baltimoresun.com/news/nation-world/ct-trump-crisis-20181220-story.html,"President Donald Trump began Thursday under siege, listening to howls of indignation from conservatives over his border wall and thrusting the government toward a shutdown. He ended it by announcing the exit of the man U.S. allies see as the last guardrail against the president's erratic behavior: Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, whose resignation letter was a scathing rebuke of Trump's worldview.

At perhaps the most fragile moment of his presidency - and vulnerable to convulsions on the political right - Trump single-handedly propelled the U.S. government into crisis and sent markets tumbling with his gambits this week to salvage signature campaign promises.

The president's decisions and conduct have led to a fracturing of Trump's coalition. Hawks condemned his sudden decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria. Conservatives called him a ""gutless president"" and questioned whether he would ever build a wall. Political friends began privately questioning whether Trump needed to be reined in.

After campaigning on shrinking America's footprint in overseas wars, Trump abruptly declared Wednesday that he was withdrawing U.S. troops from Syria, a move Mattis and other advisers counseled against. And officials said Thursday that Trump is preparing to send thousands of troops home from Afghanistan as well.

The president also issued an ultimatum to Congress to fund construction of his promised U.S.-Mexico border wall, a move poised to result in a government shutdown just before Christmas. Trump and his aides had signaled tacit support for a short-term spending compromise that would avert the shutdown, but the president abruptly changed course after absorbing a deluge of criticism from some of his most high-profile loyalists.

Leon Panetta, who served as former defense secretary, CIA director and White House chief of staff for Democratic presidents, said, ""We're in a constant state of chaos right now in this country."" He added, ""While it may satisfy [Trump's] need for attention, it's raising hell with the country.""

Panetta said the resignation of Mattis is a singular moment and his letter, which underscores how Mattis sees Trump's approach as misguided, ""puts the security of the nation right now at some degree of risk.""

Trump has been isolated in bunker mode in recent weeks as political and personal crises mount, according to interviews with 27 current and former White House officials, Republican lawmakers and outside advisers to the president, some of whom spoke on the condition of anonymity to offer candid assessments.

""There's going to be an intervention,"" one former senior administration official said speculatively. ""Jim Mattis just sent a shot across the bow. He's the most credible member of the administration by five grades of magnitude. He's the steady, safe set of hands. And this letter is brutal. He quit because of the madness.""

In his resignation letter, Mattis wrote, ""My views on treating allies with respect and also being clear-eyed about malign actors and strategic competitors are strongly held and informed by over four decades of immersion in these issues . . . Because you have the right to a Secretary of Defense whose views are better aligned with yours on these and other subjects, I believe it is right for me to step down from my position.""

Although Trump's relationship with Mattis has been rocky for months, the president spent the first part of Thursday focused on another fraying relationship: with his conservative base.

On Thursday, as criticism over his capitulation on the wall grew louder by the hour, Trump complained to friends and aides that he felt politically shackled. He had no plan, but was spoiling for a fight. By midday, the president picked one.

""I've made my position very clear: Any measure that funds the government must include border security. Has to,"" Trump said Thursday. He added that he had ""no choice"" but to act.

Trump's advisers acknowledged that the funding may not be secured in the end, but boasted that the spectacle would be remembered favorably by his base voters as proof of his mettle. A wall funding proposal was approved by the House late Thursday, but faced uncertain prospects in the Senate.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., habitually careful in his approach to Trump, avoided strong-arming the president in their recent exchanges, knowing that urging him to stand down on the wall funding likely would only embolden him, according to two people familiar with the discussions. At every turn, McConnell confided to Trump that congressional efforts this month - from the passage of the farm bill to bipartisan criminal-justice reform - were a string of victories for him, the people said.

Thanks to McConnell's soothing, there was cautious optimism that the president would eventually sign a funding bill. ""McConnell has a lot to do with it, of course. They talk a lot,"" Rep. Harold Rogers, R-Ky., said. ""It's smart to save the fight for another day.""

House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., - busy this week bidding farewell to Congress after two decades in office - followed McConnell's playbook, pointing out how Trump would be able to battle for wall funding in the new year, a person close to him said.

Both Ryan and House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., told Trump last week that they could not pass a spending bill with $5 billion for wall construction, and McConnell was told by the White House that Trump would sign a short-term bill without it, according to two people familiar with the conversations.

But on Fox News Channel and across conservative media, there was a brewing rebellion. Prominent voices urged Trump to hold firm on his wall money and warned that caving would jeopardize his reelection.

Rush Limbaugh dismissed the compromise bill on his radio program as ""Trump gets nothing and the Democrats get everything."" Another firebrand, Ann Coulter, published a column titled, ""Gutless President in Wall-less Country."" Trump even found resistance on the couch of his favorite show, ""Fox & Friends,"" where reliable Trump-boosting host Brian Kilmeade chided him on the air Thursday.

The president was paying attention. He promptly unfollowed Coulter on Twitter. And he pecked out a series of defensive tweets blaming congressional leaders for not funding the wall, while also staking a defensive posture. He suggested that a massive wall may not be necessary in its entirety because the border already is ""tight"" thanks to the work of Border Patrol agents and troops.

""One of the things he's most vulnerable to is mockery and mockery by his own supporters,"" said Mark Krikorian, a leading anti-immigration activist.

Members of the conservative House Freedom Caucus joined in the rebellion. During House votes on Wednesday evening, caucus chair Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., and other members refused to budge and held court with reporters, railing against the Republican leadership and warning Trump that he was being led astray.

At a Thursday Oval Office meeting with Ryan and McCarthy, Trump was calm and did not yell, but was resolute and ""dug in on what he wants,"" said a Republican official briefed on the discussion.

Trump spent six to seven minutes in the meeting with Ryan and McCarthy talking about ""steel slats"" and saying that the term was preferable to calling the proposed construction a ""wall,"" as the president has done for more than three years.

The administration drama comes at an especially perilous juncture for Trump, following his thumping at the polls in November's midterm elections. Democrats are preparing to take control of the House in January and to use their subpoena power to investigate Trump's finances and conduct in office, as well as alleged corruption in the administration.

Meanwhile, Republicans in their last gasp of unified government are divided. A band of hard-line conservative lawmakers voted against Trump's prison reform legislation, which passed the House and Senate with bipartisan support and is expected to be signed by the president Friday. And many foreign policy hawks, including Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., a Trump confidant, sharply criticized Trump's decision Wednesday to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria.

Inside the Oval Office on Thursday, Trump was in what one Republican close to the White House described as ""a tailspin,"" acting ""totally irrationally"" and ""flipping out"" over criticisms in the media.

Even as aides argued to him that protesting over wall funding could deprive government workers paychecks over Christmas, Trump warned in private conversations with Republican lawmakers that they all would get ""crushed"" if they did not get the wall built.

Trump vented to his advisers that signing the short-term spending bill without wall money would make him look weak and make his base voters think he broke a campaign promise. He also complained that he did not have sufficient bargaining leverage with Congress and blamed senior aides - including White House legislative affairs director Shahira Knight - for not presenting him with better options.

""He's legitimately saying, 'This is ridiculous. Why would I sign this?'"" said American Conservative Union Chairman Matt Schlapp, whose wife, Mercedes Schlapp, is a senior White House staffer. ""If you're the outsider, you don't want to go along with the same old stupid rules. When he does that, he doesn't look like an outsider.""

Marc Short, Trump's former White House legislative affairs director, said, ""He feels he made a promise to voters that he would build the wall. There is a realization that with Congress changing hands, that the challenge of getting funding for the wall only gets larger.""

Trump's pin-balling conduct - veering from a promise of a shutdown to moving toward a deal, and then changing his mind - has vexed members of his own party. Many Republican lawmakers said they sense that Trump is adjusting uneasily to the dynamics of soon-to-be divided government and lashing out to reclaim some of his dominance over the congressional agenda.

The defense secretary's resignation compounded the concern.

""Having Mattis there gave all of us a great deal more comfort than we have now,"" retiring Sen. Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., said. ""Chaos has kind of been the norm but it seems to have been heightened. Sometimes you think it's got to settle, and then another thing happens.""

133,nymag,http://nymag.com/intelligencer/2017/05/inside-uber-lawsuits-travis-kalanick.html,"In early March, Travis Kalanick, the 40-year-old CEO of Uber, was riding in an SUV to Palo Alto for the company's Technology Day, thinking about how to help Uber survive one of the worst periods a corporation had ever experienced. In January, some 500,000 users had joined a campaign to #DeleteUber from their phones, in response to the company's perceived lack of support for protests at JFK against the Trump administration's immigration ban (Kalanick had recently joined Trump's economic council), which seemed to underscore the long-standing view that Uber didn't care much for its drivers. The deletions were still coming three weeks later when Susan Fowler, a female engineer who'd left the company, accused it of rampant sexism and sexual harassment. Then, over the next two weeks, Google sued Uber, alleging it had stolen the company's self-driving-car technology; a video surfaced of Kalanick getting into a profane argument with a driver; and the New York Times revealed that Uber had moved into cities where it was not allowed to operate with the help of a tool called Greyball. (The program showed government officials a fake version of Uber's app with ""ghost cars"" so its drivers couldn't be apprehended.)

When Kalanick got to Palo Alto, he told the assembled engineers that, seven years after the app launched, it was time for ""Uber Version 2.0."" Just as Kalanick's ambition was no longer to become ""Everyone's Private Driver,"" as an early slogan suggested, but to change the way people and things move around the world, he said that Uber would become not simply a better place to work but ""the most just place to work in the world."" In a blue V-neck sweater over a white undershirt, Kalanick cited Harriet Tubman, Gandhi, and Martin Luther King Jr. as inspirations, said he had spoken to Sheryl Sandberg about unconscious bias, and joked that he hoped to find a way to quantify justice -- he just needed to figure out the unit of measurement.

Coming from Kalanick, who is described by even his supporters as an ""asshole,"" the talk sounded forced (""I talk a lot about justice -- I'm just about it""), especially when he put up a photograph on a projector screen of the Fearless Girl statue that had recently been installed in downtown Manhattan, across from the Wall Street bull. ""When I saw it, I was inspired,"" Kalanick said. He wanted Uber's employees, especially its women, to ""be that fierce girl standing up to the bull,"" while adding that he intended to make Uber a place that ""doesn't have bulls all over the freaking place."" He sat back as the crowd applauded.

In its brief history, Uber has morphed from a simple service that allowed users to press a button to summon a car into what is on paper the most valuable start-up of all time. It also spawned an entire category of start-up pitch -- Uber, but for doctors, for cookies, for private jets -- bent on solving First World problems via app. Uber has created vast theoretical fortunes and helped remake the American economy. Its most recent valuation, of $68 billion in 2015, was the highest ever given to a private company. Silicon Valley's obsession with ""unicorns"" -- companies valued north of a billion dollars -- was very 2012. We had entered the era of the ""decacorn.""

Uber itself, however, has lately become a monument not only to the power of technology and confidence in the face of adversarial forces but possibly to the dangers of hubris: When you're worth that much money on imaginary paper, and buoyed by the belief that you're on a mission to change the world, it can be easy to sweep aside concerns like ""rampant sexual harassment"" and ""public relations"" and ""profits."" In the past, Kalanick has said that, on bad days, he found comfort by looking at the company's revenue graph, which continues to go up and up, even through Uber's tumultuous 2017. And yet Uber lost at least $2 billion in 2015, a shocking deficit it followed last year with a loss of $2.8 billion -- a number that didn't even include its star-crossed attempt to break into the Chinese market. Much of those losses had come in the form of subsidies: Uber was paying bonuses to drivers to get them on the road and keep them there, while subsidizing rides for users by charging well below the true cost. The idea was to get people so addicted to the Ubering lifestyle that the app would be baked into their lives, to such a degree that no one would much care if and when the subsidies went away and the price went up. Or Uber would simply drown its competitors in cash until the advent of autonomous cars got rid of its biggest cost: drivers.

But should any business have to work as hard, ignore as many laws, and spend as much money as Uber has simply to become a viable business? Conversations with several dozen current and former Uber employees and executives suggested that though there is time to right the ship, and a war chest of venture capital to do so, Silicon Valley has found itself at least preparing for the notion that it mispriced its darling. Uber could be the next MySpace, some say, a company that created a market but was foiled by its own missteps and overtaken by savvier competition. Or the recent PR disasters could be more than just flesh wounds, and instead reveal an aggressiveness that has both created and masked a deeply flawed business model. Either way, a report in April said private Uber shares were trading at a discount.

Earlier this month, while I was riding an elevator up to Uber's headquarters in downtown San Francisco, a short young woman in a floral-printed dress asked me if I was interviewing for a job, too. As we signed nondisclosure agreements on iPads in the company's lobby, she said that she had applied for a job as a project manager months ago, but Uber's series of unfortunate events had led her to put off entreaties from the company's recruiters. Eventually, she relented and decided she might as well see what it's like on the inside. ""There's a lot of smart people here,"" she said. ""So it might not be that bad, right?""

To anyone paying attention, many of the recent problems at the company weren't entirely shocking. Uber's workplace had long been considered one of tech's toughest, it had always flouted governments and regulators -- the company's first cease-and-desist order hangs on a wall at headquarters -- and it often seemed to treat drivers with disregard, opposing unionization efforts and denying employee benefits to full-time drivers, who are responsible for about half of the company's trips. Its reputation was burnished, however, by a cohort of former political operatives, led by David Plouffe, once President Obama's campaign manager, who successfully lobbied state and local regulators, arguing that the company didn't just put more fossil-fuel-burning cars on the road; it represented the future of work, offered part-time postrecession employment to those who needed it most, and cut down on DUIs (and would eventually reduce the number of cars on the road, if people were to give up their own cars in favor of ride-sharing). But the real trick was offering a product with undeniable appeal, particularly to young urbanites, which helped reinforce the company's sense of inevitability. ""Uber riders are the most affluent, influential people in their cities,"" Kalanick once said. ""When we get to a critical mass, it becomes impossible to shut us down."" David Weil, a former Labor Department official tasked with helping to judge whether ride-hailing drivers should be considered full-time employees or independent contractors, told me he had been surprised by the uniformity of support for the company in meetings with young Capitol Hill staffers. ""The first question I'd be asked was, 'Well, what have we got against Uber?' "" Weil said.

The uproar over Uber's response to the protests at JFK in January was thus something of a dramatic correction in how the company was perceived. Shortly after New York's taxi-drivers association announced a strike in support of the protests, Uber tweeted that it would not be turning on surge pricing. The intention was to avoid taking advantage of a delicate situation, as the company had been accused of doing by up-charging users during hurricanes and blizzards, but thanks to the tinderbox quality of the political moment, it was perceived as an attempt to break the strike. ""It was 100 percent in the spirit of helpfulness,"" one former executive told me. ""And it became the poster child for why reputation matters."" Kalanick's role on President Trump's economic advisory council only made matters worse, and some at the company suggested that he should attend the council's upcoming meeting, demand that Trump rescind the ban, and, when he refused, get up and walk out -- a plan that was ultimately deemed too brash even for Kalanick, who simply resigned his position.

The company's image suddenly posed a threat to the bottom line, at a moment when it wasn't difficult for many users to delete Uber and download Lyft -- nevermind that two of Lyft's biggest investors included Peter Thiel and Carl Icahn, both prominent Trump supporters -- without noticing much of a difference. After Bloomberg published a video in which Kalanick ended an argument with an Uber driver who felt the company had unfairly lowered its rates after he leased a new car by saying, ""Some people don't like to take responsibility for their own shit,"" an MLB team backed out of a partnership with the company, according to an Uber manager with knowledge of the deal. ""Uber used to have this sex appeal,"" the manager said. ""People would pay to work with us.""

The video had also connected Kalanick to the worst parts of the company's reputation. In addition to his penchant for working well past midnight and demanding the same of his employees -- known internally as ""Uberettos"" -- Kalanick had also displayed the kind of immaturity more associated with Silicon Valley's barely legal founders. ""We call that Boob-er,"" he told GQ in 2014, when he was 37, of how Uber had helped his dating life. One executive said that several times in the past year, including in February, when the company was in turmoil, Kalanick had been unreachable in the morning. ""We were trying to find him and get him to approve something, but he'd been out late, apparently, and the answer was 'He's not up yet,' "" the executive said.

The company's rapid growth -- it went from 600 employees in 2014 to more than 12,000 today -- meant that almost two-thirds of its managers were in positions of authority for the first time, which led to a variety of organizational issues. Kalanick, for one, insisted on being kept aware of anything going on at the company, and had a habit of inserting himself into other people's jobs: Four different Uber employees told me they had at times found themselves writing something in a Google Doc, only to suddenly realize Kalanick was editing the document at the same time. ""He would go in there all the time and say, 'Stop typing,' and I'm like, 'I'm editing your shitty grammar,' "" one said.

In 2014, Kalanick unveiled a list of 14 company values at a Las Vegas retreat that included ""toe-stepping,"" ""always be hustlin',"" and ""super pumped."" There was also ""principled confrontation,"" which one former manager said was ""the one people used as an excuse to just be assholes."" The manager, who recently left Uber, said that he had conducted a survey of his subordinates at his new company, and they had complained that he was ""really aggressive,"" which he thought was accurate. At Uber, however, ""people were telling me I wasn't aggressive enough."" Several engineers -- one who had worked on designing a system to enable users to delete their ride history, ""for if you took an Uber to your mistress, basically"" -- told me that managers sometimes demanded that employees work through holidays and weekends and that they often worked as much as 100 hours a week.

Now the company's relentless culture, to which many credited its growth, was unraveling, especially after Susan Fowler published her blog post in February detailing blatant sexual harassment and sexism at the company and a lack of responsiveness from the human-resources department. ""I've rarely seen an organization just so viscerally hit by something that was coming in from outside,"" Liane Hornsey, the company's new head of HR, told me in reference to the reaction to Fowler's blog post. We were in a conference room on the 15th floor of Uber's headquarters, where recruiters sit among putting greens that dot the floor. (Uber declined to make Kalanick available for an interview.) To turn around morale, Hornsey and various deputies had conducted 200 listening sessions in recent months and committed to a variety of changes: a promise of equal pay; tweaking the corporate values to give a nod to teamwork.

Still, Uber had continued to lose employees. In March, Jeff Jones, a well-regarded marketing executive who had been brought in to serve as a sort of Sheryl Sandberg figure to Kalanick's Mark Zuckerberg, left after just seven months, declaring in a statement that ""the beliefs and approach to leadership that have guided my career are inconsistent with what I saw and experienced at Uber."" Others who had previously chugged the company Kool-Aid had come to believe Uber would never change. ""I've never been at a place where it was so clear that people don't matter -- that nothing matters -- so long as we can make an extra two cents a trip,"" said a manager who left the company in March. ""Uber is the most capitalist company on the face of the earth. It's just the concept of supply and demand embodied.""

And yet, those massive subsidies, so crucial to Uber's growth, don't exactly sound like a pure version of capitalism, a problem that is beginning to dawn on observers both inside and outside the building. But there are still true believers in Uber's promise: Among the former and current employees I spoke to, the most optimistic were its engineers. ""This business model and technology is absolutely necessary for the world,"" Brian McClendon, the company's former head of mapping, told me one day in April over barbecue in Kansas City. McClendon had left Uber a few weeks earlier, to lend his 30 years of Silicon Valley experience to politics in his native Kansas. While Uber says it has become profitable in some large cities, where the system is wired into the lives of young users in particular, McClendon admitted that he had not given up his car while living in Silicon Valley, and said that Kansas City was ""the least Uber-friendly city in the country,"" because it has more highway miles than any other major city. One former Uber manager who oversaw growth in a number of smaller, non-coastal cities where the cost of owning a car is low told me that the business there was almost exclusively taking people to and from bars.

But McClendon argued that for people in urban areas, the cost of Ubering was beginning to make as much financial sense as owning a car, especially if riders were willing to use Uber Pool, a service that matches riders traveling to and from similar locations to share a car and split the cost. Uber says that Pool now makes up a quarter of all rides in New York, and it hopes that Pool will one day become a majority of its business, which is the most winning argument for not only its alleged environmentalism and corporate citizenship -- a study by transit expert Bruce Schaller found that Uber and other ride-hailing services accounted for 600 million miles driven in New York City alone last year, likely contributing to the city's congestion and pollution and sapping resources from public transit -- but also its ultimate profitability. If Uber can put more people into a car and pay only one driver, margins go up. Ronak Trivedi, a product manager for Uber Pool, told me the company had devoted ""our best data scientists"" to figuring out how to make Pool a more convenient service for both drivers and riders. He said Uber had recently started getting feedback from drivers on the product, which it considered a novel idea, but according to Uber the secret to solving carpooling -- which Americans have never widely adopted, even in times of high oil prices and public campaigns encouraging the practice -- was still in the algorithm.

But more than any technical advantage, the key to Uber's growth has been its $15 billion of venture-capital funding. The company has long acknowledged that most of its losses come from subsidizing rides. (The most progressive argument for using Uber may be the fact that it has been a considerable redistribution of wealth from investors to working-class drivers.) But even close observers were surprised last November when a transportation-industry analyst named Hubert Horan published an examination on Naked Capitalism of the limited financial information Uber had made public and determined that it was covering around 60 percent of the cost of each Uber ride. Horan's article expanded into a nine-part series that went as viral as 39,000 words with 89 footnotes on transit economics can. The 60 percent number was widely cited in various prominent outlets, and Uber has never contested Horan's math.

More worrying to Horan than the losses themselves, which any growing company has to endure, was the fact that it didn't seem Uber had brought significant efficiencies that would lower the cost of driving people from point A to point B, a difficult business with thin margins. Hailing a car with an app had been a magical experience when it was first released, but to Horan, it hadn't changed the economics much more than the Domino's app for ordering a large pepperoni. ""You go through this checklist of stuff and the old bullshit meter goes into overdrive,"" Horan told me. ""They haven't done anything to solve any underlying problems. It's all people who have this quasi-religious belief that technology will solve every problem known since the dawn of time.""

To explain its massive losses, Uber and its investors have often cited Amazon, which didn't turn a year-end profit for ten years as it built out an infrastructure that made the selling of more and more books -- and eventually, of everything -- cheaper and more efficient the larger it got. But Amazon's biggest-ever loss was $1.4 billion, half of Uber's 2016 deficit, and Jeff Bezos responded by cutting 15 percent of his workforce. Plus, Uber's economics barely resemble Amazon's. The taxi business doesn't scale in the same way, and while Uber's technology is sophisticated, the barriers to entry are relatively low, and Uber has had to fend off various competitors. So far as Horan could tell, there was only one possible path for Uber to meet that $68 billion valuation: eliminate competition.

Uber's potential aspirations toward monopoly are a sensitive matter -- in discussing how Uber Pool became more efficient the more people used it, McClendon referred to Uber's ideal state as a ""monopoly,"" before correcting himself to call it ""not a monopoly, but a heavily used service"" -- and while every company dreams of owning its entire market, the question of whether Uber can do so has become murky. One Uber investor told me he no longer sees ride-hailing as winner-take-all but didn't want to speak for the company; when I put the question to Rachel Holt, Uber's head of North American operations, she ducked it by praising the value of competition and saying she didn't have a crystal ball.

Recent events have made a monopoly harder to imagine, to say nothing of how regulators might react. While Uber said its business in the United States was briefly profitable early last year, the company had been forced back into the red by Lyft, which had secured a new round of venture funding and begun offering more subsidies of its own to attract drivers and riders. Uber's woeful early 2017 had also helped Lyft, which saw ridership increase 137 percent compared to the year prior. And while so far Lyft remains content to focus on the U.S., Uber's ambitions for a global reach have added further costs. It is now in 75 countries, and faces an array of regional and local operators in each market. Its most formidable rival may actually be Didi Chuxing, a Chinese company that has already clocked more rides than Uber and recently raised $5.5 billion to help it compete in new markets. Uber spent two years, and $2 billion, trying to break into the Chinese market but eventually called a truce last year and agreed to sell its Chinese business to Didi in exchange for a stake in the company.

Meanwhile, in an effort to show potential investors in an IPO that it has multiple revenue streams, Uber has expanded into a variety of industries tangentially related to its core business. In 2015, the company launched Uber Everything, an initiative to figure out how it could move things in addition to people, and when I visited Uber headquarters, the guest Wi-Fi password was a reference to Uber Freight, the company's attempt to get into trucking. (A former employee said the password often seemed to be a subliminal message encouraging employees to focus on the company's newest initiatives.) But moving things had its own complications. One former Uber Everything manager said the company had looked at transporting flowers or prescription drugs or laundry but found that the demographic of people who, for example, couldn't afford a washer and dryer but would pay to have their laundry delivered was a small one. Uber Rush, a delivery service in New York, had become ""a nice little business,"" the manager said, ""but at Uber, you're looking for a billion-dollar business, not a nice little business.""

It turned out that food delivery was the only area that made much sense, though even that was difficult. In the past year, food-delivery companies SpoonRocket, TinyOwl, Take Eat Easy, and Maple have all ceased operations. Postmates said in 2015 that it could be profitable in 2016, at which point it pushed the date to 2017. Its target is now 2018. ""It absolutely does not work as a one-to-one business -- picking up a burrito from Chipotle and delivering it,"" a former Uber Eats manager said. ""It has to be 'I'm picking up ten orders from Chipotle, and I'm picking up this person next to Chipotle, and I'm gonna drop the burritos off along the way.' "" Uber Eats has grown significantly, but getting the business up and running had required considerable subsidies, and the manager said it was rumored that a significant portion of the company's domestic losses were coming from Uber Everything.

Uber's expansion into an ever-widening gyre of business interests makes sense for a company looking to justify a huge valuation, but it has drawn criticism from some who wonder why the company is moving into so many different markets without becoming profitable in its first one. ""It's a Ponzi scheme of ambition,"" Anand Sanwal, a venture-capital analyst, told me. "" 'We're gonna raise money on the promise of dominating an industry to come in order to pay for this thing that doesn't make us money right now.' "" He had recently conducted an unscientific poll of subscribers to his newsletter asking how many would invest in Uber today, even at a discounted valuation, and 77 percent said they wouldn't. But the new initiatives have the benefit of keeping everyone excited about the future: In April, Uber held a conference in Dallas to explain why it planned to one day get into flying cars.

Back on land, Kalanick had already discovered perhaps his company's biggest opportunity and gravest threat: self-driving cars. On the one hand, getting rid of ""the other dude in the car,"" as Kalanick once callously referred to the drivers on whose backs he built the company, would cut out Uber's biggest costs. On the other, he realized the technology was ""basically existential for us"": If Google, or another tech company, or an automaker, developed a driverless car, there was no guarantee they would offer the cars to Uber's network rather than develop their own. The company launched its effort to build a self-driving car in February 2015, poaching 40 robotics researchers from Carnegie Mellon University with six-figure bonuses, and set up a research facility in Pittsburgh, but by that point it was already behind. To jump-start Uber's research, Kalanick began courting Anthony Levandowski, a star engineer from Google's self-driving program, in whom he found a kindred spirit: While Kalanick had broken up with his girlfriend to work at Uber full time, noting that ""I should probably find someone I like at least as much as my job,"" Levandowski had once worried that a member of his team wasn't focusing enough on his work and offered the man's girlfriend $5,000 to break up with him until the end of the project. (She didn't; the couple got married.)

Levandowski left Google in January 2016 to work on his own self-driving project, but soon began showing up at Uber's self-driving facility, where one engineer said Kalanick told everyone to give him a ""complete brain dump of everything we've done to date."" Levandowski began consulting for the company, and a former Uber engineer said he attended meetings during which Levandowski strategized with Uber on how it could recruit Google engineers. The engineer said he was asked to delete messages discussing any possible collaboration. In August, Uber paid $680 million to acquire Otto, Levandowski's start-up, and put him in charge of its self-driving program.

Soon after, in Pittsburgh, Uber scored a PR coup by becoming the first U.S. company to pick up a passenger in a self-driving car, with a safety driver there just in case. (While the company does not offer drivers employee status or benefits, a recent job posting for an ""Uber Autonomous Vehicle Operator"" offered a 401(k) plan, medical coverage, and a steady salary of $20 an hour.) According to one engineer, Levandowski suggested that Uber quickly prepare for a splashy self-driving launch in San Francisco by December. ""He said it would be a big bang and a massive fuck-you to all our competitors,"" the engineer said.

It turned out to be a disaster. On the first day, one of Uber's cars ran a red light in front of the Museum of Modern Art. ""The San Francisco car was a piece of shit,"" the engineer said. ""The problem with Anthony is he's super-focused on building a cool demo, but building a cool demo is contradictory to building good technology."" Several engineers left Uber, many to start their own self-driving competitors, upset by a feeling that Levandowski was pushing the technology too fast in order to close the gap with Uber's competitors. The company had launched the test without approval from California regulators and was told to cease operations; in Pittsburgh, which had warmly welcomed Uber's self-driving effort, the company became a political football in the city's mayoral election as various candidates criticized the company as a bad corporate citizen. Last summer, after a man died in a Tesla that was using the car's Autopilot system, which allows for autonomous driving on highways, Levandowski told several Uber engineers that they were not pushing aggressively enough. ""I'm pissed we didn't have the first death,"" Levandowski said, according to a person familiar with the conversation. (Levandowski denies saying this.)

Uber's problems got even worse in February, when Google's driverless program, now called Waymo, filed a lawsuit alleging that Levandowski had stolen files from Google and that Uber had used them in the design of its self-driving car. Shortly before leaving the company, Levandowski had allegedly plugged an external hard drive into a company laptop for eight hours and downloaded 14,000 files. (Levandowski said he needed the files to work from home.)

In court, Google argued Otto had been a front and that Levandowski and Uber had conspired for him to join the company all along. In May, a federal judge issued a partial injunction barring Levandowski from working on the technology in question, clearing the way for a public trial in the fall. The judge also took the unusual step of referring part of the case to the U.S. Attorney for possible criminal prosecution. If Uber is found to have knowingly stolen trade secrets, various executives, including Kalanick, could face criminal charges, and Levandowski, who remains employed at Uber, has already invoked his Fifth Amendment rights, citing the possibility that he could be charged. In the course of a five-hour deposition by Google's lawyers, he repeated the sentence ""On the advice and direction of my counsel, I respectfully decline to answer"" 393 times.

Regardless of the case's outcome, it has hampered Uber's self-driving efforts at a time when they can scarcely afford to be stalled: Experts predict that self-driving cars will begin picking up passengers without safety drivers in small, geo-fenced areas in the next five years. ""We were seven years behind Google when I started,"" one former engineer said of the company's driverless technology. ""When I left, I think we closed the gap to five years."" During one week in March, Uber's cars had to be taken over by human drivers every .8 miles, according to internal documents obtained by Recode. Waymo's cars, by comparison, drove more than 600,000 miles in 2016 and required human intervention only 124 times. According to one recent report, Uber was just the 16th-most-likely company to develop a driverless car, behind not only Waymo and Tesla but also Ford, General Motors, and other traditional auto manufacturers. In April, Waymo deployed a fleet of driverless cars in Phoenix, with a test group of residents able to order a car at any time through its own proprietary app. ""I always thought the biggest threat to Uber was if Google bought Lyft,"" one engineer told me in May. A few days later, Waymo announced a partnership with Lyft.

Does all that mean Uber -- so synonymous with this tech boom, and with the modern city itself -- is going to become a relic of this decade? Will it be an app that you delete less out of protest than simply because your phone gets too crowded? ""I don't think it's doomed,"" Erik Gordon, a business professor at the University of Michigan, told me recently. ""But I think it's stunted. It was within an arm's length of absolute dominance -- of being Microsoft in Microsoft's best days -- but I think it's going to be a case study we teach in business school of a company that could have crushed all comers but because of their repeated botch-ups, they aren't in that position and will not be in that position."" The botch-ups have continued. On May 24, Uber announced that it had incorrectly calculated payments to drivers in New York City, to the tune of $45 million -- the company quickly apologized and gave individual drivers back pay of as much as $7,000 -- an embarrassing admission for a company that proclaimed itself to be built on data. The error came in the wake of a lawsuit brought by a drivers-advocacy group alleging that Uber had engaged in wage theft -- one of countless legal issues the company faces, or may face in the future. The European Union's top court is currently considering whether Uber should be regulated as a traditional taxi service; its classification of drivers as non-employees is likely to undergo further scrutiny; and it faces a Department of Justice investigation into Greyball.

A report on the company's culture, stemming from Susan Fowler's blog post and conducted by former attorney general Eric Holder's law firm, is expected to be released soon, but it's unclear what will change. Uber's appointment of Arianna Huffington, a board member, to oversee the report has proved controversial. Huffington considers herself a ""close friend"" of Kalanick's and has said in interviews that sexism is not a ""systemic problem"" at Uber and that she did not expect Kalanick's resignation to be on the table. ""She blew the independence of the investigation from the beginning,"" one former executive said. Kalanick is trying to hire a COO to be his No. 2, but some have argued Uber might be better off with a new No. 1. That scenario would likely require Kalanick to step down, given that the makeup of votes on the company's board is weighted heavily in his favor. According to the tech site the Information, Kalanick recently told an ex-girlfriend that while some of the company's employees might want him to leave, the majority wanted him to stick around -- and he felt an obligation to do so, for the employees' own well-being. ""You'll know when you're a mother,"" she said he told her.

""So rarely do we stop and give Darth Vader credit,"" Chris Messina, a former Uber developer who left the company in January, told me over coffee around the corner from Uber's San Francisco office. Messina, who previously spent three years at Google and is credited with inventing the hashtag, said that in his view, Kalanick had built a remarkably complex company through smarts and sheer force of will, and that if he had cut a few corners, that was merely the price of progress. If there is good news for Uber, it is the fact that despite its losses, more and more people continue to use its service, and it still claims to have a shocking $7 billion to spend. Messina had heard from people still at the company that Kalanick had been cowed and that the organization was committed to changing, but he suspected that in the end, Uber could only be Uber. ""The people there now, it's like the Spartans in 300,"" Messina said. ""Everybody's got their backs to each other, spears out, and they're yelling, 'Fuck the world, man. They don't get it.' ""

134,global research,https://www.globalresearch.ca/president-trumps-losing-strategy-embracing-brazil-confronting-china/5665064,"Introduction

The US embraces a regime doomed to failure and threatens the world's most dynamic economy. President Trump has lauded Brazil's newly elected President Jair Bolsonaro and promises to promote close economic, political, social and cultural ties. In contrast the Trump regime is committed to dismantling China's growth model, imposing harsh and pervasive sanctions, and promoting the division and fragmentation of greater China.

Washington's choice of allies and enemies is based on a narrow conception of short-term advantage and strategic losses.

In this paper we will discuss the reasons why the US-Brazilian relation fits in with Washington's pursuit for global domination and why Washington fears the dynamic growth and challenge of an independent and competitive China.

Brazil in Search of a Patron

Brazil's President, Jair Bolsonaro from day one, has announced a program to reverse nearly a century of state directed economic growth. He has announced the privatizationof the entirepublic sector, including the strategic finance, banking, minerals, infrastructure, transport, energy and manufacturing activities. Moreover, the sellout has prioritized the centrality of foreign multi-national corporations. Previous authoritarian civilian and military regimes protected nationalized firms as part of tripartite alliances which included foreign, state and domestic private enterprises.

In contrast to previous elected civilian regimes which strived - not always successfully - to increase pensions, wages and living standards and recognized labor legislation, President Bolsonaro has promised to fire thousands of public sector employees, reduce pensions and increase retirement age while lowering salaries and wages in order to increase profits and lower costs to capitalists.

President Bolsonaro promises to reverse land reform, expell, arrest and assault peasant households in order to re-instate landlords and encourage foreign investors in their place. The deforestation of the Amazon and its handover to cattle barons and land speculators will include the seizure of millions of acres of indigenous land.

In foreign policy, the new Brazilian regime pledges to follow US policy on every strategic issue: Brazil supports Trump's economic attacks on China, embraces Israel's land grabs in the Middle East, (including moving its capital to Jerusalem), back US plots to boycott and policies to overthrow the governments of Cuba, Venezuela and Nicaragua. For the first time, Brazil has offered the Pentagon military bases, and military forces in any and all forthcoming invasions or wars.

The US celebration of President Bolsonaro's gratuitous handovers of resources and wealth and surrender of sovereignty is celebrated in the pages of the Financial Times, the Washington Post and the New York Timeswho predict a period of growth, investment and recovery - if the regime has the 'courage' to impose its sellout.

As has occurred in numerous recent experiences with right wing neo-liberal regime changes in Argentina, Mexico, Colombia and Ecuador, financial page journalists and experts have allowed their ideological dogma to blind them to the eventual pitfalls and crises.

The Bolsonaro regime's economic policies ignore the fact that they depend on agro-mineral exports to China and compete with US exports ...Brazilian ago-business elites will resent the switch of trading partners.. They will oppose, defeat and undermine Bolsonaro's anti-China campaign if he dares to persists.

Foreign investors will takeover public enterprises but are not likely to expand production given the sharp reduction of employment, salaries and wages, as the consumer market declines.

Banks may make loans but demand high interest rates for high 'risks' especially as the government will face increased social opposition from trade unions and social movements, and greater violence from the militarization of society.

Bolsonaro lacks a majority in Congress who depend on the electoral support of millions of public employees, wage and salaried workers ,pensioners,and gender and racial minorities. Congressional alliance will be difficult without corruption and compromises ...Bolsonaro's cabinet includes several key ministers who are under investigation for fraud and money laundering. His anti-corruption rhetoric will evaporate in the face of judicial investigations and exposés.

Brazil is unlikely to provide any meaningful military forces for regional or international US military adventures. The military agreements with the US will carry little weight in the face of deep domestic turmoil.

Bolsanaro's neo-liberal policies will deepen inequalities especially among the fifty million who have recently risen out of poverty. The US embrace of Brazil will enrich Wall Street who will take the money and run, leaving the US facing the ire and rejection of their failed ally.

The US Confronts China

Unlike Brazil, China is not prepared to submit to economic plunder and to surrender its sovereignty. China is following its own long-term strategy which focuses on developing the most advanced sectors of the economy - including cutting edge electronics and communication technology.

Chinese researchers already produce more patents and referred scientific articles than the US. They graduate more engineers, advanced researchers and innovative scientists than the US based on high levels of state funding. China with an investment rate of over 44% in 2017, far surpasses the US. China has advanced, from low to high value added exports including electrical cars at competitive prices. For example, Chinese i-phones are outcompeting Apple in both price and quality.

China has opened its economy to US multi-national corporations in exchange for access to advanced technology, what Washington dubs as 'forced' seizures.

China has promoted multi-lateral trade and investment agreement ,including over sixty countries, in large-scale long-term infrastructure agreements throughout Asia and Africa.

Instead of following China's economic example Washington whines of unfair trade, technological theft, market restrictions and state constraints on private investments.

China offers long-term opportunities for Washington to upgrade its economic and social performance - if Washington recognized that Chinese competition is a positive incentive. Instead of large-scale public investments in upgrading and promoting the export sector, Washington has turned to military threats, economic sanctions and tariffs which protect backward US industrial sectors. Instead of negotiating for markets with an independent China, Washington embraces vassal regimes like Brazil's under newly elected President Jair Bolsonaro who relies on US economic control and takeovers.

The US has an easy path to dominating Brazil for short-term gains - profits, markets and resources, but the Brazilian model is not viable or sustainable. In contrast the US needs to negotiate, bargain and agree to reciprocal competitive agreements with China. The end result of cooperating with China would allow the US to learn and grow in a sustainable fashion.

Conclusion

Why has the US chosen the road of embracing a backward-looking Brazil rather than a future leader-nation?

Basically, the US is structurally embedded in a high militarized political system which is driven by the quest for world domination - 'imperialism'. The US does not want tocompetewith an innovative China, it seeks to coerce China to dismantlethe institution, policies and priorities which make China great.

Washington demands that China surrender the relative autonomy of the state, increase US penetration of strategic sectors and rely on free market bankers and academics. US economic policy is shaped by bankers,corrupt speculators and lobbyists for special regional interests, including regimes like Israel. China's economic policy is shaped by industrial interests, guided by the strategic goals of the central state authority capable and willing to arrest hundreds of top officials on the take.

The US cannot contain China's upward trajectory with military encirclement - because Beijing's economic strategy neutralizes US military bases and defeats tariff constraints through the diversification of major new trading deals. For example, China is negotiating with India to vastly increase imports of agricultural commodities, including rice, sugar, milk, soy beans meal and cotton.India currently has a major trade deficit with China especially machinery and industrial goods and is eager to replace US exporters China has major trade and investment agreements throughout Southeast Asia, South Korea, Japan, Pakistan, Russia and Australia as well as Africa, Latin America (Brazil and Argentina) and the Middle East (Iran, Iraq and Israel).

The US has little leverage for 'squeezing' China, even in high tech sectors as China is less dependent on the US know-how. Washington has secured agreements with China, increasing exports of cars and entertainment; China can easily agree to enforce curbing so-called 'property theft' especially since it is no longer an important factor since most of China innovations are domestically created. Moreover, big business and Wall Street demand the Trump regime reach an open markets agreement with China and ignore its autarkic enemies.

Given China's continued buoyant economy (6.5% GDP in 2018), its increased emphasis in expanding social services, the consumer market and easing of credit , Trump's coercive tariff policies are doomed and the military threats will only encourage China to expand and upgrade its military defense and superior space programs.

Whatever temporary and limited trade agreements emerge from US-China negotiations, the Trump regime will continue to pursue its unipolar imperial agenda of embracing vassal regimes, like Brazil, and confronting China.

The future belongs to independent, innovative and competitive China not to vassal, militarized and submissive regimes like Brazil.

A wall by any other name would probably not smell as sweet, which is why President Trump keeps applying the name to things that are not walls. His latest compromise on his signature campaign promise -- a roughly 2,000-mile, Mexico-funded wall of ""precast concrete slabs"" along the southern U.S. border -- is now actually a fence, a series of ""artistically designed steel slats, so that you can easily see through it,"" he tweeted on Tuesday.

It has been a frustrating few days for Trump's border security ambitions. As of Thursday, he seemed close to torpedoing a Senate-passed, GOP-backed funding deal to avoid a partial government shutdown because it included none of the $5 billion in wall funds he had requested. ""At this moment, the President does not want to go further without border security, which includes steel slats or a wall,"" White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said in a statement, according to CNN. The preceding week went no better. A series of high-profile spats with congressional Democrats -- who have said repeatedly that they will not give Trump wall money -- alongside resistance from fellow Republicans have all but guaranteed he will have to get creative with his funding sources. ""Mexico is paying (indirectly) for the wall through the new USMCA, the replacement for NAFTA!"" Trump tweeted on Wednesday, embracing this inevitability.

But like something out of a conservative fantasy -- where the functions of government become so inept and immiserating that everyday Americans must assume its duties themselves -- Trump's supporters have opened their own wallets to bankroll his infrastructure demands. They are far from funding whatever barrier he ends up concocting. But with almost $6 million and counting raised on GoFundMe from nearly 100,000 donations in three days (a cursory scroll suggests some donors were responsible for multiple contributions), it is no small sum. ""If the 63 million people who voted for Trump each pledge $80, we can build the wall,"" Brian Kolfage, the campaign's organizer, wrote.

However far from its $1 billion-goal it may be, Kolfage's GoFundMe campaign demonstrates how galvanizing Trump's border wall promise still is for his base, even years after he first committed to it, and following several conceptual readjustments -- including that Mexico will almost certainly not pay for it, and that it will likely not stretch uninterrupted from the Pacific Ocean to the Gulf of Mexico. But it also suggests that rhetoric is more important than the logistics. The nuts and bolts of how the structure gets built, what it's made of, and who funds it seem as malleable for Trump's acolytes as they are for Trump. As long as something gets constructed, somewhere along the border, that gives an unwelcoming impression to those who would enter undocumented, his supporters will throw their weight behind it. The president has already denied that a wall per se was his preferred plan -- ""beautiful"" steel slats are better, he claims, plus they will ""save us billions."" The $1.6 billion he secured earlier this year for barrier fortification has gone toward strengthening already-existing structures and fencing near San Diego and Texas's Rio Grande Valley -- not wall construction. But if current patterns hold, the president will continue rebranding whatever compromised version of a concrete wall he is forced to settle for as a ""wall,"" while his base spends its money covering whatever he fails to coax out of Mexico or Congress. Mexico, purportedly, will end up reimbursing construction expenses through some labyrinthine sequence of trade deals into which Trump will inevitably seduce them. What could go wrong?

But wall aside, more immediate immigration overhauls loom. Trump continues to narrow the options for asylum seekers at American ports of entry, a dynamic that resulted in several Central American migrants rushing the U.S.-Mexico border at San Ysidro in November and being tear-gassed by Border Patrol agents. On Thursday, the administration formalized a long-gestating deal with Mexico to refuse entry to the U.S. for people seeking asylum at the southern border until their applications are processed. The measure will force travelers to stay in Mexico indefinitely while they wait, likely for weeks, months, or even years. A senior administration official described the decision as ""one of the most significant border security developments in decades,"" according to Vox. Indeed, it will drastically reorient the calculus many asylum-seekers use to decide whether a trip to the U.S. is worth the trouble. Spending months in Mexico's border towns -- where the Mexican government will grant them ""humanitarian visas, work authorization, and other protections,"" according to a statement from Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen -- is far less appealing than being able to establish a foothold in the United States while their claims are processed. The extent to which this will deter future seekers is to be seen. But between this and the perilous desert trek that already awaits immigrants crossing the border, who needs a wall?"
136,the epoch times,https://www.ntd.com/trump-if-walls-are-immoral-then-why-do-wealthy-politicians-build-them-around-their-homes_274590.html,"President Donald Trump slammed a Democratic talking point during his speech to the nation on Jan. 8, hitting at the theme of a border wall supposedly being immoral.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.), the leader of the Democratic Party in Congress, has repeatedly called the proposed barrier along the southern border immoral.

""Then why do wealthy politicians build walls, fences, and gates around their homes? They don't build walls because they hate the people on the outside, but because they love the people on the inside. The only thing that is immoral is the politicians to do nothing and continue to allow more innocent people to be so horribly victimized,"" he said.

Trump used the point to segue into how horrific it is when illegal aliens, who have already broken the law by entering the country without permission, commit crimes. He noted that an illegal alien is suspected of gunning down Newman police officer Ronil Singh, a legal immigrant, just weeks ago.

""America's heart broke the day after Christmas when a young police officer in California was savagely murdered in cold blood by an illegal alien, who just came across the border. The life of an American hero was stolen by someone who had no right to be in our country,"" Trump said.

""Day after day, precious lives are cut short by those who have violated our borders. In California, an Air Force veteran was raped, murdered, and beaten to death with a hammer by an illegal alien with a long criminal history. In Georgia, an illegal alien was recently charged with murder for killing, beheading, and dismembering his neighbor. In Maryland, MS-13 gang members who arrived in the United States as unaccompanied minors were arrested and charged last year after viciously stabbing and beating a 16-year-old girl.""

Appealing to the Democrats who have refused to negotiate with him on funding for the wall, Trump added, ""To those who refuse to compromise in the name of border security, I would ask: Imagine if it was your child, your husband, or your wife whose life was so cruelly shattered and totally broken?""

He asked members of Congress to pass a bill that includes funding for the wall and U.S. citizens to call Congress and tell them they want the border secured.

Trump's comments came about a week after he noted that the house of former President Barack Obama has a wall around it.

While Pelosi has said a wall is immoral, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) admitted recently that while he's against a wall, a barrier will work along the border.

""A fence works. You ask the experts,"" he told CBS 2. ""A big, concrete wall is expensive and it doesn't work. You don't just need fencing. You need drones, you need helicopters, and you need roads. The agents can't get people crossing the border because they can't get there.""

In addition to asking for funds for the wall, Trump wants to use some funding for more Border Patrol agents and technology as support for personnel and the barrier.

Along with Trump, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) also hit at the immoral talking point during a speech on the Senate floor earlier Tuesday, noting that many Democratic leaders previously voted for a barrier along the southern border.

""Walls and barriers are not immoral. How silly. Enforcing our laws wasn't immoral back in 2006 when then-Senator Clinton and Senator Obama and our friend the Democratic leader were proud to vote for physical barriers,"" he said.

""The only things that have changed between then and now are the political winds, and of course, the occupant of the White House. So this is no new-found principled objection, it is just political spite. A partisan tantrum being prioritized over the public interest."""

Fromsuccession planning and digesting megamergers,to repairing embattled businesses and learning from#MeToo-related scandals, 2019 is set to be a consequential year for theheads of some of the most iconic American companies.We'vescanned the stars for clues to what lies ahead for a select group of them based on their zodiac signs. What follows is our third annualcompilation of CEO horoscopes:

Capricorn (December 22 - January 19): Mary Barra, Chairman and CEO of General Motors Co.

Capricorn, your best quality is pragmatism. It's a trait that can make youseem cold, but some decisions -like reshaping General Motors for the future-require practicality.In 2018, you chose toshutter several U.S. plantsin a shift away from sedans and hybrid cars, in favour of higher-margin SUVsand a bet on fully electric vehicles. The move willcause pain to those working-class communities, and since it runs counter to President Donald Trump's rhetoric about restoring manufacturing jobs, you knew itwould instigate a Twitter tirade. But you also know that for GM to remain a leaderand survivethe next potential recession without another bailout, this is what it must do. It's not enough, though.Investors show little faith in the long-term earnings prospects of U.S. automakers, and the $6 billion in annual savings you project from the plant closures probably isn't enough to truly transform GM. Meanwhile in China, the electric-car market is booming, but theChevy Bolt isn't.You must work faster to get costs under control and pursue a profitable electric-vehicle strategyunencumbered by White House bluster and an outdated image of GM.

Aquarius (January 20 - February 18): Bob Iger, Chairman and CEO of Walt Disney Co.

Aquarius is the visionary of the zodiac, and that trait wason displayin your dealmaking at Disney. First with Pixar, then Marvel andLucasfilm (Star Wars), your acquisitions have allowedthe company to dominate the box office and continue drawing swarms of fans to Disney'stheme parks. But your vision is less understood when it comes to your recent $85 billion takeover of21st Century Fox Inc.'s TV and film studios. In theory, owning these assets will cement Disney's position as it pursues a new audience of TV streamers through the soon-to-come Disney+ app. Yet, this megadeal and Disney+also complicate a previously meticulous strategy. This year, you must focus on tidying up the Magic Kingdom so that its success can outlastyour time at the helm. Retirement is just a couple of years away and there's much work to be done, including grooming a successor. That will only get more difficult if Disney+causes strife within the empire by forcing different divisions to compete for content and resources. You must also take care not to alienate fans as you start to preserve some of Disney's best movies and TV shows for the app. More reflection on this new streaming strategy may serve the company -and your legacy -better in the long run.

Pisces (February 19 - March 20): Larry Culp, Chairman and CEO of General Electric Co.

Pisces, you'll set the tone for the year early on when you unveil your much-anticipated plan for steering the embattled industrial giant out of its current crisis. You've made some missteps in your first fewmonths as CEO: you ruled out an equity raise only to put one back on the table; your attempt to ease investors' anxiety via a CNBC appearance backfired; and your decision to re-hire a long-time insider to chair the eyesore gas-turbine business confounded investors expecting deep-rooted cultural change. But there have also been signs of progress, including your decision to appoint a power and insurance expert to the board and to start shopping for a new auditor. To regain investors' confidence, you must inject more transparency into GE's earnings, provide clarity on its liabilities and, most importantly, present a viable plan for reducing its bloated debt load. An equity raise would give you breathing room, as would scrapping the spinoff portion of a planned GE Healthcare divestiture. But your most difficult challenge is finding a way to balance restructuring and debt repayment with growth investments, so that whatever remains of GE once you're done has a competitive leg to stand on.-Brooke Sutherland

Aries (March 21 - April 19): Shari Redstone, Vice Chair and controlling shareholder of CBS Corp. and Viacom Inc.

The last few years have a been a struggle, but an Aries doesn'tback down. Just when you finished cleaning house at Viacom and started seeing the fruit of theregime change, arguablyworse problems arose at CBS. Now, with the removal of Les Moonves following the numerous sexual-misconduct allegations made against him, and the overhaul of aboard that had turned hostile to you, you're probably through the worst of it. CBS is inculture-repair mode, and Viacom is making progress turning around its Paramount film studio and ramping up TV production. Still,you know that neither company can thrive on its ownin the long run as Disney and AT&T get bigger and join Netflix and Amazon.com Inc. in streaming domination. This is the year to finally do what you've long wanted-to recombine CBS and Viacom. It may even make sense to form a three-way merger involving CBS's new chairman, Strauss Zelnick, and his $12 billion video-game company, Take-Two Interactive Software Inc. as another step toward buildingdirect-to-consumer relationships.Scale and content are the themes in the industry, and CBS and Viacom could use more of both. Take your cue from the ram andcharge ahead.

Taurus (April 20 - May 20): Randall Stephenson, Chairman and CEO of AT&T Inc.

You have difficult days ahead. While youimagined this would be one of the most exciting times for AT&T, the stock instead finished 2018near an almost eight-year low. Investors don't yet grasp your vision for turning a stable wireless-service carrier into a cyclical and challenged media conglomerate that is now trying to go head-to-head with Disney, Netflix and Amazon - especially when Verizon Communications Inc. seems to be movingin the opposite direction. The pressure is on to prove that the Time Warner assets and beleaguered DirecTV businesscan bothflourish within AT&T, and also that the company's mountain of debt and wireless spending needs - related to the crucial build-out of AT&T's 5G network - won't get in the way of shareholders' beloved dividend payments. You'll launch a new video-streaming service in 2019 that will offer three pricing tiers with varying assortments of movies and shows, which does help attract a wider audience and serves as a threat to other offeringsout there. Butit may also cause further confusion for consumers in an already muddled marketplace of streaming packages. There's little room for error, so in the event ofany unforeseen setbacks or economic disruptions, you may have to look to the dividend as thesacrificial lamb.

Gemini (May 21 - June 20): Stefano Pessina, Vice Chairman and CEO of Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc.

Geminis are said to always be looking for theirother half, and it's true that you've been no stranger to corporate tie-ups. You built Alliance Boots through mergers, then combined it with Walgreens four years ago. But lately, the company has taken a back seat from dealmaking, preferring partnerships over acquisitions, whileothers in the health-care space have done industry-shifting vertical megadeals. Rival CVS Health Corp. is re-imagining the health-care business with its $77 billion takeover ofinsurer Aetna Inc. Meanwhile, Walgreens was left with a consolation prize of justunder 2,000Rite Aid Corp. stores after regulators stood in the way of a larger transaction between the pharmacy chains. Since then, you'vebeentalking with Humana Inc. about taking mutual investment stakes and expanding an existing senior-focused health-care alliance. You argue that partnerships provide many of the advantages of a merger without having to shell out billions of dollars, and you're not wrong about that. But they are fundamentally half-measures that may leave Walgreens ill-prepared to deal with the retail and pharmacy threat of Amazon, and the heft of other vertically consolidated health-care giants.-Max Nisen

Since this sign is represented by the twins, here's another Gemini horoscope:

Howard Willard,Chairman and CEO of Altria GroupInc.

Like your Gemini peer above, you have been forging alliances with businesses around your industry, seeking toremake Altria as cigarettes become less relevant and a real cannabis industry rises from their ashes. Altria hasn't often made big acquisitions, but in 2018that changed as you recognizedthe urgent need to diversify Altria's portfolio of Marlboro cigarettes, Skoal rings and other traditional tobacco products. First, Altria agreed to pay $1.8 billion for a 45 percent stake in Cronos Group Inc., one of Canada's fast-growing cannabis producers. Just a few weeks later, youclosed a$12.8 billiondeal for a 35 percent stake in Juul Labs Inc., the maker of electronic cigarettes that are popular among younger smokers. It was a smart move; the only question is, why did you stop at 35 percent? Buying Juul Labs outright may be down the road, and it would even be a logical precursor to a recombination with Philip Morris International Inc.The two of you are already partnering on the iQos tobacco-heating device to target older smokers, a product that may complement Juul's. Deepening all these ties would give you greater control over Altria's future.

Cancer (June 21 - July 22): Elon Musk,CEO of Tesla Inc.

Cancers can be a bit impulsive - like the times you pickedfights with sell-siders, spelunkers and the SEC,tweetedout ""funding secured""andblazed up liveon air. Tesla's shareholders were understandably unnerved by some of your actions in 2018, but all seemingly was forgiven after unexpectedly good third-quarter results. Investors clearly foresee those becoming a regular fixture, judging by the multiples they're paying for the stock. Whether thatunusually strong performance can be sustained is, therefore, a big question for 2019. The picture is hazy, with federal tax credits for Tesla's vehicles due to decline and Model 3 sales likely shifting toward lower-spec versions (though the vaunted $35,000 version remains elusive). Another,related,mystery is whether Tesla will raise more capital. You say it isn't necessary, but prudence suggests Tesla should have capitalized on its sky-high stock price and sold more already. You closed the year in unexpected, yet familiar, fashion by sending a modified Model X on a bumpy ride through a short Boring Co. tunnel in Los Angeles, thereby demonstrating a new future for transportation, we are told. As useful as an uneventful 2019 might be, that's the one thing we can't see in the stars.- Liam Denning

Leo (July 23 - August 22): Ginni Rometty, Chairman and CEO of International Business Machines Corp.

Your nearly seven years leading IBM have been defined by falling revenue, massive cost cuts and a stream of hogwash about how IBM is transforming into a technology leader. It is not. But then, Leo, youroared in 2018 by striking a $34billion acquisition of business-software firm Red Hat Inc. It was one of the largest corporate acquisitions of the year, and by far the largest in IBM's 107-year history. The price you paid was steep, but an expensiveroll of the dice is better than the status quo, and IBM and Red Hat together would seem to make a more compelling cloud-computing alternative than they could on their own. Your legacy rests on proving that the combined company can become a go-to shepherd for corporations that badly want to modernize their technology. Right now, that role is mostly filled by rivals such as Microsoft Corp. and Oracle Corp. Leos are reputed to be fierce and passionate, and you'll need all those qualities and more to integrate the two wildly different cultures of IBM and Red Hat, and keep IBM going well into its second century.- Shira Ovide

Virgo (August 23 - September 22): Warren Buffett, Chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway Inc.

Virgo, you'll turn 89 this year,making it more important than ever that Berkshire Hathaway's next generation of leadership begiven a chance to get properly acquainted with investors. Virgos are known to be methodical perfectionists, a quality that's been keyto your decades of successful investing and dealmaking, but you could do better when it comes to messaging around your succession plan. You aren't ready to pass the torch and there's no sign you need to, but at least start toshare the stageat appearances like Berkshire's annual investor meeting. Greg Abel and Ajit Jain, the executives you'll most likely nameas your replacements, were notably absent from the feature moment of last year's meeting -the Q&A session - which draws investors from around the world looking to hear your market musings, outlook for Berkshire's array of businesses and about your hunt for takeover targets. After the S&P 500 index fell in 2018 by the most since the financial crisis, it's time to strike at least one last megadeal. To put a dent in Berkshire's cash, which long ago reached unproductive levels, would be the greatest gift to your successorsothat he's not left toresort to a largedividend payout. Surely there are some Buffett-worthy bargains out there now - perhaps even one from this old wishlist.

Libra (September 23 - October 22): Reed Hastings, Chairman and CEO of Netflix Inc.

Netflix has tried to give TV fans close to everything they wantat an affordable price and without ads. It's only appropriate that as co-founderand CEO of the business, you'rea Libra, a sign characterized bypeople-pleasers.But in 2019, the sustainability of Netflix's generosity -and that of its lenders -will be tested. Disney and AT&Tare both launching streaming services aimed at Netflix'sAchilles' heel: Many of its most-watched shows arethe property of other companies, such as Disney and AT&T, that are in the early days of cutting off their supply to Netflix and confining their content totheir own products. You've tried to neutralize some of thatcompetition by signing deals directly with top content creators. Netflix's value proposition may also still ultimately be better for consumers should it sustain the variety and breadth of its library. However, as subscriber growth slowsand some users defect to these new services, you may need to turn to price increases. Investors have always explainedaway Netflix's cash burn rate, but they may not be so willing to give the benefit of the doubt when Disneystarts flexing its muscle.

Scorpio (October 23 - November 21): Tim Cook, CEO of Apple Inc.

In your seven years in the corner office, the challenges have never been more daunting than they are now, and I know that can sting, Scorpio. Apple propelled itself intothe most profitable company in the U.S. - and the most valuable in the world, until recently-thanks to the sales power of the iPhone, but it's running out of steam. Investors believe iPhone sales will decline in 2019, and it'll be tough for Apple to make up the difference with your higher-priced phones. You don't typically make big-ticket acquisitions, but the Apple holiday helpers have been busy writing checks not for companies, but for high-profile projects for Apple's coming Netflix-like web video service. There's programming coming from Oprah Winfrey, from the ""Peanuts"" cartoon kids, an elephant documentary and a lot more. You might need a strategy to go with that high-priced programming, though. With investors betting that Apple's growth relies on its ability to sell subscriptions to web video, news and other internet services, all eyes are on how you'll manage to offset the waning growth of the smartphone product that delivers two-thirds of Apple's revenue.- Shira Ovide

Sagittarius (November 22 - December 21): Abigail Johnson, Chairman and CEO of Fidelity Investments

As a Sagittarius, you don't like to be held back. That's why Fidelity in 2018 pioneered the zero-fee index fund, bringing the management cost war to its logical conclusion. But now may not be the best time to try to pitch investors a broad market index fund. Thoseproducts launched in August, just onemonth before the S&P 500 index peaked at its all-time high and then sold off. Volatile environments are when Fidelity's stock pickers have shined brightest - that's how the firm built its reputation, after all. If things remain rocky, will you try to get your zero-cost funds out of the limelight and pivot back to the active management side of the business? That's more than enough to keep you busy in the new year, but as themost powerful woman in investing,you also have a platform to helpfixthe gender imbalance on Wall Street. Fund management is still a men's club, even though diversity and client returns are shown togo hand in hand.Even your firm has grappled withculturalissues followingallegations of sexual harassmentmade against former portfolio managers. Continue to help Fidelity do its part as theindustry-and the business world as a whole - slowly becomes a more equitable place. -Brian Chappatta

-- With assistance from Shira Ovide, Brooke Sutherland, Liam Denning, Brian Chappatta and Max Nisen."
138,san francisco gate,https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Shutdown-suspends-federal-cleanups-at-US-13525668.php,"BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) -- The government shutdown has suspended federal cleanups at Superfund sites around the nation and forced the cancellation of public hearings, deepening the mistrust and resentment of surrounding residents who feel people in power long ago abandoned them to live among the toxic residue of the country's factories and mines.

""We are already hurting, and it's just adding more fuel to the fire,"" says 40-year-old Keisha Brown, whose wood-frame home is in a community nestled among coking plants and other factories on Birmingham's north side.

The mostly African-American community has been forced to cope with high levels of arsenic, lead and other contaminants in the soil that the Environmental Protection Agency has been scraping up and carting away, house by house.

As President Donald Trump and Congress battle over Trump's demand for a wall on the southern U.S. border, the nearly 3-week-old partial government shutdown has stopped federal work on Superfund sites except for cases where the administration deems ""there is an imminent threat to the safety of human life or to the protection of property.""

EPA's shutdown plans said the agency would evaluate about 800 Superfund sites to see how many could pose an immediate threat. As an example of that kind of threat, it cited an acid leak from a mine that could threaten the public water supply. That's the hazard at Northern California's Iron Mountain mine, where EPA workers help prevent an unending flow of lethally acidic runoff off the Superfund site from spilling into rivers downstream.

Practically speaking, said Bonnie Bellow, a former EPA official who worked on Superfund public outreach at the agency, the impact of the stoppage of work at sites across the nation ""wholly depends"" on the length of the shutdown.

""Unless there is immediate risk like a storm, a flood, a week or two of slowdowns is not going to very likely affect the cleanup at the site,"" Bellow said.

In north Birmingham, Brown said it's been a couple of weeks since she's spotted any EPA crews at people's houses. It wasn't clear if state workers or contractors were continuing work.

But long before the shutdown began, Brown harbored doubts the cleanup was working anyway. ""My main concern is the health of the people out here,"" said Brown, who has asthma. ""All of us are sick, and we've got to function on medicine every day.""

In terms of time, the federal government shutdown is a chronological blip in the long history of the site -- which includes ethics charges in a local bribery scandal to block federal cleanup efforts -- but adds to the uncertainty in an area where residents feel forgotten and betrayed.

At the EPA, the shutdown has furloughed the bulk of the agency's roughly 14,000 employees. It also means the EPA isn't getting most of the daily stream of environmental questions and tips from the public. Routine inspections aren't happening. State, local and private emails to EPA officials often get automated messages back promising a response when the shutdown ends.

In Montana, for instance, state officials this month found themselves fielding calls from a tribal member worried about drinking water with a funny look to it, said Kristi Ponozzo, public-policy director at that state's Department of Environmental Quality. The EPA normally provides tribes with technical assistance on water supplies.

With most EPA colleagues idled, Ponozzo said, her agency also had to call off an environmental review meeting for a mining project, potentially delaying the project.

But it's the agency's work at Superfund sites -- lessening the threat from old nuclear-weapons plants, chemical factories, mines and other entities -- that gets much of the attention.

Absent imminent peril, it would be up to state governments or contractors to continue any cleanup during the shutdown ""up to the point that additional EPA direction or funding is needed,"" the EPA said in a statement.

""Sites where cleanup activities have been stopped or shut down will be secured until cleanup activities are able to commence when the federal government reopens,"" the agency said.

For federal Superfund sites in Michigan, the shutdown means there are no EPA colleagues to consult, said Scott Dean, a spokesman for that state's Department of Environmental Quality.

At Michigan Superfund sites, day-to-day field operations were continuing since private contractors do most of the on-the-ground work, Dean said.

Bellow, the former EPA official, said the cancellation of hearings about Superfund sites posed immediate concerns.

In East Chicago, Indiana, for example, the EPA called off a planned public hearing set for last Wednesday to outline how the agency planned to clean up high levels of lead and arsenic in the soil.

The EPA has proposed a seven-month, $26.5 million cleanup that includes treating and removing tainted soil from the area, where a lead smelter previously was located.

During a public meeting Nov. 29, some residents complained that the EPA's approach would leave too much pollution in place. But others didn't get a chance to speak and were hoping to do so at the meeting this week, said Debbie Chizewer, a Northwestern University environmental attorney who represents community groups in the low-income area.

The EPA announced the cancellation in an online notice and gave no indication that it would be rescheduled.

Leaders of the East Chicago Calumet Community Advisory Group asked for a new hearing date and an extension of a Jan. 14 public comment deadline in a letter to the EPA's regional Superfund division.

Calls by The Associated Press to the agency's regional office in Chicago this week were not answered.

Local critics fear the EPA will use the delay caused by the shutdown as justification for pushing ahead with a cleanup strategy they consider flawed, Chizewer said, even though the agency has designated the affected area as an ""environmental justice community"" -- a low-income community of color that has been disproportionately harmed by pollution.

The EPA has a ""special obligation"" when dealing with such communities, Chizewer said. ""This would be an example of shutting them out for no good reason.""

In North Birmingham, former longtime neighborhood resident Charlie Powell said most of the people living in and around the Superfund site had already ""just got tired and fed up.""

Powell left the area but started a group called PANIC, People Against Neighborhood Industrial Contamination. He believes money would be better spent helping residents move away from the pollution.

""Can I say hell?"" Powell said when asked what residents have been through.

139,san francisco gate,https://www.sfgate.com/news/crime/article/The-Latest-WH-tries-to-keep-Hill-Republicans-13520262.php,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Latest on President Donald Trump and the partial government shutdown (all times local):

12:25 p.m.

President Donald Trump is using a bill signing focused on curbing human trafficking to push his case for a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border.

Trump says a southern border that is not secured exacerbates the incidents of human trafficking. He says, ""As long as we have a border that is not secure, we're going to suffer the consequences of that.""

Wednesday's bill signing came a day after Trump's prime-time speech designed to persuade Americans that illegal immigration and trafficking at the border are a crisis.

Democrats have called Trump's promised wall costly, ineffective and ""immoral"" and say he's ""manufacturing a crisis.""

The bill Trump signed is designed to enhance an annual State Department report that measures global efforts to eliminate human trafficking.

The White House says it's the fourth bipartisan bill the Republican president has signed in the last few weeks to prevent human trafficking.

Congressional Democrats say they'll head to the White House with the plan to reopen the government -- the same one they've been presenting. They're asking President Donald Trump to accept a bipartisan bill to fund border security without the wall.

Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Wednesday the president ""could end the Trump shutdown and re-open the government today, and he should.""

Pelosi and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer spoke at an event where they were flanked by federal workers going without pay during the shutdown, now in its 19th day.

Schumer called workers the ""collateral damage"" of Trump's ""temper tantrum."" He said the president failed to ""persuade a soul"" during his ""divisive"" prime-time address Tuesday night to the nation.

Trump meets with congressional leaders at the White House Wednesday afternoon. He rejected the Senate's bipartisan funding bill in December, sparking the shutdown.

The White House is trying to keep jittery congressional Republicans from defecting over the toll the partial government shutdown is taking in their states.

President Donald Trump and Democrats have been at an impasse over funding for his proposed border wall, which has led to a partial government shutdown, now in its 19th day.

Trump meets with Senate Republicans Wednesday on Capitol Hill just hours after he argued on national television that a border wall was needed to resolve a security and humanitarian ""crisis.""

Senators say the shutdown has led to disruptions in agricultural payments for farmers, as well as for home buyers trying to secure government-backed home loans. Lawmakers also are worried about missed paychecks for government workers Friday.

As many as half a dozen GOP senators have said the government should reopen while border security negotiations with Democrats continue.

President Donald Trump again linked illegal immigration along the southern border with drugs and violent crime as he urged Democratic lawmakers to fund his proposed border wall.

In his first national address from the Oval Office, the president gave no indication he was softening his stance that the partial government shutdown would continue without money for the wall.

Trump argued Tuesday night that the wall was needed to resolve what he called a security and humanitarian ""crisis.""

He addressed the nation as the shutdown stretched through its third week, with hundreds of thousands of federal workers going without pay and some congressional Republicans growing increasingly jittery about the impasse.

Trump plans to visit Senate Republicans at the Capitol on Wednesday before meeting with Democratic leaders at the White House."
140,the seattle times,https://www.seattletimes.com/nation-world/nation/congress-to-face-same-question-when-will-the-shutdown-end/,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congress returns to Washington for its first full week of legislative business since control of the House reverted to Democrats, but lawmakers will be confronted with the same lingering question: When will the partial government shutdown end?

One Republican senator says he's offered President Donald Trump a possible solution, though it may just be wishful thinking.

Sen. Lindsey Graham is encouraging Trump to reopen government for several weeks to continue negotiating with Democrats over the border wall Trump wants to build on the U.S.-Mexico border. If there's no deal at the end of that time, Graham says Trump would be free to take the more dramatic step of declaring a national emergency to build it.

But the South Carolina Republican says Trump still wants a deal on funding for the wall before agreeing to reopen shuttered government departments. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat, insists Trump reopen the government first.

Their weeks-old standoff led to the partial government shutdown, now on day 24 without a clear end in sight.

""Before he pulls the plug on the legislative option, and I think we're almost there, I would urge him to open up the government for a short period of time, like three weeks, before he pulls the plug, see if we can get a deal,"" Graham said. ""If we can't at the end of three weeks, all bets are off.

""See if he can do it by himself through the emergency powers. That's my recommendation,"" added Graham, who has publicly pushed Trump to use his authority to declare a national emergency to build the wall. Such a step would allow Trump to bypass Congress and tap various pots of unspent federal money, including for military construction and disaster relief as well as from assets seized by law enforcement, to pay for the wall.

Trump has kept Washington on edge over whether he would resort to such a declaration, citing what he says is a ""crisis"" of drug smuggling and the trafficking of women and children at the border. The president initially sounded as though such a move was imminent, but then pulled back. He has said several times since he first mentioned the idea in public this month that he prefers a legislative solution.

A key question is how much more time is Trump willing to give lawmakers. Graham, who spoke with Trump by telephone on Sunday morning, said the legislative path ""is just about shut off"" and blamed intransigence by Pelosi.

The speaker's office had no immediate comment.

Democrats oppose an emergency declaration but may be powerless to block it. Some Republicans are wary, too, fearing how a future Democratic president might use that authority. Such a move, should Trump ultimately go that route, would almost certainly be challenged in the courts.

Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., called Graham's idea to reopen the government a ""great place to start.""

""I do think if we reopen the government, if the president ends this shutdown crisis, we have folks who can negotiate a responsible, modern investment in technology that will actually make us safer,"" Coons said.

Trump says technology is nice, but that the border can't be secured without a wall.

The White House has been laying the groundwork for an emergency declaration, which is feared by lawmakers in both parties.

Senate Homeland Security Committee Chairman Ron Johnson, R-Wis., said he'd ""hate to see"" a declaration issued because the wall wouldn't get built, presumably because of legal challenges. Democrats voted in the past for border security and should again, he said.

""I actually want to see this wall get built,"" Johnson said. ""I want to keep pressure on Democrats to actually come to the negotiating table in good faith and fund what they have supported in the past.""

Graham favors a declaration and said the time for talk is running out.

""It's the last option, not the first option, but we're pretty close to that being the only option,"" he said.

Graham and Coons spoke on ""Fox News Sunday"" and Johnson appeared on CNN's ""State of the Union.""

141,the straits times,https://www.straitstimes.com/world/united-states/pelosi-set-to-make-history-in-return-as-house-speaker,"Some call her a San Francisco latte liberal. But her daughter Alexandra says all you need to know about Nancy Pelosi is: ""She'll cut your head off and you won't even know you're bleeding.""

The 78-year-old Ms Pelosi was set to be elected Speaker of the House of Representatives in Washington yesterday (this morning Singapore time) - and has already found herself toe to toe with President Donald Trump in a showdown over funding for the border wall with Mexico that he promised his base.

She will be wielding the gavel in a House that will have a record number of women - 102, comprising 23.4 per cent of the chamber's voting members. Before the November 2018 midterm elections, the record for women in the House was 19 per cent of seats.

Ms Pelosi, a mother of five, with nine grandchildren, is a formidable political operator who has been in Congress for 31 years and the leader of the Democratic Party for 16 years.

""No one ever won betting against Nancy Pelosi,"" her daughter Alexandra Pelosi, a film-maker, told CNN.

Ms Nancy Pelosi will be the first lawmaker in more than half a century to hold the office of Speaker of the House twice.

Her signature achievement legislatively is the Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare, which was passed towards the end of her first term as Speaker from 2007 to 2011.

TINKLE CONTEST

It goes to show you: You get into a tinkle contest with a skunk, you get tinkle all over you.

MS NANCY PELOSI, returning House Speaker, telling a CNN reporter about her meeting with President Donald Trump.

BUILDING A LEGACY

If she can be the person who is remembered for holding Trump accountable, or not letting him put forward facts that are not facts, if she can be the one who just calmly sits there and holds his feet to the fire, in a lot of ways, that's just as important as anything else she does.

PROFESSOR JENNIFER LAWLESS, an expert on women in politics at the University of Virginia.

Still, with the stunning victory in 2016 of the insurgent Republican presidential candidate Mr Trump, many in the Democratic Party were beginning to question whether Ms Pelosi should step aside for someone younger.

But on the coat-tails of the November 2018 victory in which the party wrested back control of the House, she secured enough support to get the Speakership by promising to stay for only one term.

""This is legacy-building time,"" Professor Jennifer Lawless, an expert on women in politics at the University of Virginia, told The New York Times.

""If she can be the person who is remembered for holding Trump accountable, or not letting him put forward facts that are not facts, if she can be the one who just calmly sits there and holds his feet to the fire, in a lot of ways, that's just as important as anything else she does.""

Ms Pelosi already had a face-to-face showdown with the President before Christmas at the White House where she and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer argued with Mr Trump over funding for the wall.

At one point, she said curtly to the President: ""Please don't characterise the strength that I bring to this meeting."" Later, she told a CNN reporter: ""It goes to show you: You get into a tinkle contest with a skunk, you get tinkle all over you.""

While operating on a divided Capitol Hill - the Senate is still majority Republican - Ms Pelosi will have a new-look Congress.

More than a third of the 102 women in the House won their seats for the first time in the midterm elections - making them the largest female freshman class in history, according to the Centre for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University. They include new stars of the left like 29-year-old New York congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a Democrat.

There are more women in the Democratic ranks in both the House and Senate. Together, there are 108 Democratic women and 23 Republican women in the new Congress.

""The strong majority of new women members are Democrats so they will have success in the House because they are a majority,"" Dr Kelly Dittmar, assistant research professor at the Centre for American Women and Politics at Rutgers University, told The Straits Times.

But a lot of what they want to get done will be challenged in the Senate and by the President, she said. Just like their male counterparts, the women will be under the constraint of divided control of Congress.

It is always positive for legislative institutions to better reflect the constituents they serve, she added.

Said Dr Dittmar: ""Now you see not only an increase in representation by gender, but the women bring other layers of diversity in terms of race, age and professional background. Collectively, that diversity should yield better decision-making and agendas that better reflect the needs of the fuller population.""

She added: ""I hope (this) encourages other women to consider ways to get more engaged in electoral politics, whether it is by running themselves or supporting other women candidates."""

A supporter of President Trump's border wall proposal has started a GoFundMe to help pay for the project -- and the fund skyrocketed to more than $3 million by Thursday morning after being live for four days.

Brian Kolfage, a Trump voter and disabled Iraq War veteran with no connection to the administration, wrote that he set up the page because ""President Trump's main campaign promise was to BUILD THE WALL. And as he's followed through on just about every promise so far, this wall project needs to be completed still.""

Trump campaigned on building a ""great wall"" on the southern border during the 2016 presidential election.

As the end of Trump's second year in office comes to a close, his administration has not built the wall or secured funds for it -- and a budget proposal passed Wednesday by the Senate did not fulfill Trump's call to provide funds for it.

Kolfage wrote on his fundraising page that if every Trump voter donates $80 to his wall-building campaign, they will raise $5 billion needed to build the border wall.

""Even if we get half, that's half the wall. We can do this,"" Kolfage wrote on the GoFundMe page.

As of Wednesday night, the campaign had raised nearly $2 million, with large and small donations pouring in nearly every minute.

Kolfage assured donors that he has contacted the Trump administration and every penny of their donations would go to funding the ""Trump wall.""

""We have many very high level contacts already helping,"" he wrote.

In this photo, President Trump and China's President Xi Jinping held a high-stakes dinner meeting at the end of the G-20 Summit in Buenos Aires, on Dec. 1. Trade tensions between the U.S. and China have simmered and caused investor anxiety throughout the year -- and the December meeting was considered a crucial opportunity for Trump and Xi to settle those concerns. After that meeting, the U.S. postponed its plans to increase tariffs on China. China also agreed to purchase a ""very substantial"" amount of agricultural, energy and industrial goods from the U.S., the White House said. The Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, -2.02% and the S&P SPX, -1.91% have been volatile of late as investors try to gauge the direction of the trade negotiations, seemingly reacting to every new twist in the road.

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez thanked her supporters in this photo from the midterm elections on Nov. 6, the night she became the youngest woman ever elected to Congress. Ocasio-Cortez, who represents New York's 14th Congressional district, caused debate before, during and after her election because of her ""Democratic socialist"" ideals. But she has drawn the support of younger voters, many of whom in recent years have said in surveys that they favor socialism over capitalism.

Facebook FB, -0.66% CEO Mark Zuckerberg testified before Congress in April in the aftermath of the Cambridge Analytica scandal, in which it was revealed that the political firm gained access to the private data of millions of Facebook users without their permission. ""It's clear now that we didn't do enough to prevent these tools from being used for harm,"" Zuckerberg said in his opening remarks. ""We didn't take a broad enough view of our responsibility, and that was a big mistake."" His appearance was intended to calm backlash against the social-media platform (and ease investor concerns), but many Americans still say they lost faith in Facebook this year, and have used the service less. Facebook -- and the other FAANG stocks -- have had a rough few months, but at least one big bank is predicting that the stock will have a much better 2019.

In a historic meeting, Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un convened in Singapore in June. After the meeting, North Korea's state media channels said that Kim Jong Un told Trump he intended to stop U.S.-South Korea military exercises. He also said he would lift sanctions against the North. Meanwhile, Trump said Kim agreed to destroy a mission-engine testing site. The two men signed a written agreement, and stocks rallied after these reports. But investors may have gotten optimistic too soon. Talks between the U.S. and North Korea have since stalled, as new research and satellite imagery has shown North Korea has continued to develop nuclear weapons and facilities.

Elon Musk had ... an eventful year. That includes a podcast interview he taped with host Joe Rogan, where he smoked marijuana on camera, as this photo shows. Musk's increasingly public persona, especially on social media, and his willingness to take risks with what he does online has raised questions and concerns for Tesla TSLA, -2.94% investors this year. Musk surprised investors in August when he tweeted that he was considering taking Tesla private at $420 a share. He later tweeted that the buyout had ""funding secured,"" but gave no other details. In came the Securities and Exchange Commission, which charged him with fraud. They settled for $40 million in penalties, but Musk was allowed to remain Tesla's CEO.

It was a tough year for some of the U.S.'s most iconic retail giants. Sears announced it is closing 40 stores in February 2019 ... in addition to the 142 closures it had already announced. It will include both Sears and Kmart locations. Lowe's LOW, -0.99% also announced it is closing 51 stores in the U.S. and Canada.

On Oct. 17, Canada became the second country, after Uruguay, to legalize recreational marijuana for adults. That same day, executives from marijuana companies gathered to ring the opening bell at the Toronto Stock Exchange. The occasion was not just a celebration but also an act of validation for an industry that at one point in the not-too-distant past was run by outlaws, smugglers and drug dealers, but is currently transforming into just another sector. Since then, trade in marijuana stocks has been... volatile.

You thought America was already at peak fighting-about-the-NFL? Enter: A Nike ad campaign featuring unsigned NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick along with the slogan, ""Believe in something. Even if it means sacrificing everything."" Kaepernick famously drew controversy for taking a knee during the National Anthem before games, in order to bring attention to police brutality in the U.S., particularly against people of color. Initially, some Americans on social media said they would boycott Nike, even creating videos of themselves burning or otherwise destroying Nike gear. But data showed Nike's online sales actually jumped in the months after the company unveiled the campaign.

General Motors announced in November it was cutting 14,700 jobs -- the seventh-largest cut in the automotive sector since 2001. The company also plans to cut five plants. Part of the reason? Demand for cars has fallen dramatically in the U.S. Wall Street largely cheered the move, with GM GM, -0.03% shares closing at their highest in three months after the company announced the layoffs. Trump threatened to cut all subsidies to GM after it announced the cuts, and said he was ""very disappointed.""

Eighty-six people died in a wildfire that covered 117,000 acres in Northern California in November. Some 18,800 buildings were damaged beyond repair, and the city of Paradise, California, was effectively destroyed. Trump caused some controversy during the devastation, when he said on Twitter that the ""gross mismanagement"" of California forests were partly to blame. However, others pointed out the majority of California's forests are owned and managed by federal agencies. Trump did approve California's request for federal disaster aid, and visited the damaged areas, where he called firefighters ""unbelievably brave."" In December, PG&E Corp. said one of its power lines was damaged just 15 minutes before the fires were reported. California law makes PG&E PCG, -1.89% potentially responsible for damages if its equipment started the fire, and the stock has come under enormous pressure.

Jeff Bezos in July officially became the richest person in modern history. The Amazon founder and CEO reached that milestone as the company's stock rallied before Amazon's Prime Day, an annual day of sales for subscription members. On July 16, Bezos's net worth topped $150 billion. The next-richest person in the world, Microsoft founder Bill Gates, at that time was worth $95 billion. So just how rich is the 54-year-old Amazon founder? He would have to spend nearly $28 million per day just to keep from accumulating more wealth.

Trump nominated Brett Kavanaugh, a judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, to replace retiring Justice Anthony Kennedy. Kavanaugh previously served as staff secretary to President George W. Bush and was a former law clerk for Kennedy. College professor Christine Blasey Ford in July sent a letter to the office of Senator Dianne Feinstein, alleging that Kavanaugh had sexually abused Ford when they were in high school. In that letter, she requested confidentiality. But in September, Blasey Ford testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee, at their request, detailing the alleged incident. ""I have had to relive my trauma in front of the entire world, and have my life picked apart by people on television, in the media, and in this body who have never met me or spoken with me,"" she later said. Ultimately, Kavanaugh was confirmed to the Supreme Court.

In this photo, two young penguins checked out a camera on Ardley Island in the Antarctic. On the continent, different animal species are appearing where they usually don't, because of warmer temperatures and higher sea levels. In fact, the rate that Antarctica is melting has tripled since just 2007, according to a report published in June. Trump has said he does not believe climate change could cause large damage to the U.S. economy. But a report in November, the Fourth National Climate Assessment, showed the U.S. could actually lose hundreds of billions of dollars per year due to the impact of greenhouse gases and extreme weather.

In this photo, migrant children sat in front of Mexican riot police on Nov. 22 in Tijuana, Mexico. They were close to ""El Chaparral,"" an entry point close to the U.S. border in southern California. An estimated 4,000 migrants from Honduras formed a caravan in mid-October, on foot and in trucks, many of them hoping to make it to the U.S. to escape poverty and violence. Additional caravans formed after that first one, with thousands more migrants making the journey through Mexico. U.S. Border Patrol intercepted the caravan at the border in late November, at times using tear gas to disperse the migrants.

George H.W. Bush, the 41st president of the United States, died Nov. 30, and during his funeral, all eyes were on the presidents who came to honor him. It was the first time in public, and by all accounts in private as well, former President Barack Obama and Trump had been face-to-face since Trump's inauguration. Trump also shook hands with former First Lady Michelle Obama, who in her recent biography denounced the current president for his ""birther"" campaign against her husband. Trump did not, however, appear to exchange any greetings with former President Bill Clinton, or Trump's opponent in the 2016 election, Hillary Clinton.

144,vox,https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/1/19/16905584/government-shutdown-history-clinton-obama-explained,"We are currently in the middle of the third longest-running government shutdown in American history. With 16 full days down, and no clear end in sight, the odds are good that the 2018-'19 shutdown will outlast 2013's (also 16 days) or even 1995's (21 days) by the time it's done.

The shutdown began on December 22, 2018, with Donald Trump's demand for $5 billion to pay for his much-promised full-length border wall with Mexico, and while both parties in Congress had floated $1.6 billion as a compromise, Trump rejected it. His $5 billion isn't enough for a full wall, but would block off 215 additional miles that are currently unfenced (in addition to the 120 miles the administration is currently building with existing funds). Most recently Democrats offered a spending package that would maintain current funding levels for border security, which Trump rejected out of hand.

In the meantime, sound 420,000 federal workers are working without pay; another 380,000 are furloughed without pay; tax refunds might be delayed and food stamps payments could soon be cut for lack of funds.

Government shutdowns are familiar to most Americans, but they're a relatively recent development. They are the result of the Congressional Budget Act of 1974. Since then, Congress has failed to authorize funding for the federal government on 18 separate occasions.The first six of those didn't actually affect the functioning of government at all. It wasn't until a set of opinions issued by Attorney General Benjamin Civiletti in 1980 and '81 that the government started treating ""funding gaps"" -- periods when Congress has failed to allocate funds for the ongoing functions of government -- as necessitating the full or partial shutdown of government agencies.

Here are all 20 funding gaps, and why they happened. When not otherwise cited, the explanations below come courtesy of this helpful piece by some dude named Dylan Matthews.

Why: Ford vetoed a funding bill for the Departments of Labor and Health, Education, and Welfare (which has since been divided into the Department of Education and the Department of Health and Human Services). That alone didn't cause a funding gap because Democrats rapidly overrode his veto, but it took until October 11 for Congress to pass a continuing resolution funding the rest of the government, whose funding had lapsed amid the HEW/Labor funding fight.

Why: The Senate wanted to loosen restrictions on the use of Medicaid dollars to cover abortions (restrictions known informally as ""the Hyde Amendment""), by allowing funding in cases of rape, incest, and when the health of the mother is in danger; at the time, only abortions necessary to save the life of the mother were funded. The House, however, insisted on maintaining the stricter ban.

The issue was addressed in amendments to a bill funding the Labor and HEW departments. The two houses couldn't agree to a deal by the September 30 deadline, prompting a funding gap at the two departments. The gap ended when Congress agreed to punt the abortion issue to October 31.

Why: Punting the abortion dispute didn't work! It came back. This gap ended when Carter signed yet another short-term extension.

Why: Congress still didn't agree on abortion funding. But the dispute was eventually resolved and funding extended to cases of rape, incest, and mother's health. Four years later, when Reagan took office, that funding was once again taken away.

Why: The first Carter shutdown not about abortion! Well, not entirely about it; that did factor into a dispute about HEW funding. But beyond that, Carter vetoed a defense spending bill because it funded a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier he considered wasteful, and a public works bill because of projects he considered pork. Carter ultimately prevailed, and funding for the carrier and the projects he opposed was stripped. The rape/incest/mother's health exceptions on abortion were retained.

Why: Abortion, again -- the House wanted to return to only allowing one exception, for the mother's life, and the Senate wanted to retain a looser standard. The House also wanted higher pay for congressional and civil service staff. It got that change enacted but had to accept funding for abortions in the case of rape and incest (but not when the mother's health is at risk).

Why: This was the first shutdown, in the current sense of the term, when federal government functions were seriously curtailed. Reagan furloughed 241,000 federal workers, the first time a funding gap had led to so severe a reduction in the federal government's operations. Reagan had demanded $8.4 billion in domestic spending cuts and promised to veto any bill that didn't include at least half of that amount in cuts. The Senate was willing to comply, but the House insisted on bigger defense cuts and on pay increases for itself and the civil service.

The two branches reached a deal that fell $2 billion short of Reagan's threshold, so he vetoed the deal and shut down the government. The shutdown ended quickly after Congress passed a continuing resolution for a little less than a month, giving them time to negotiate.

Why: This one literally happened because Reagan and Congress had social engagements and forgot to keep funds flowing in the meantime. I swear to God. Here's Martin Tolchin writing in the New York Times:

Congress missed the deadline tonight for action on a catch-all spending bill needed to finance the Government in the next two and a half months, even though House and Senate conferees adopted a compromise measure resolving differences in the legislation approved by each chamber.

The House and Senate will not act on the measure until Friday. Congressional leaders barred a late-night session because of major social events tonight by both Republicans and Democrats. President Reagan invited all members of Congress to a barbecue at the White House, while Democrats were having a $1,000-a-plate fund-raising dinner.

Why: This dispute concerned money both the House and Senate wanted for a public works jobs program, which Reagan threatened to veto. The House also wanted to block funding for the MX and Pershing II missile programs, which were major defense priorities for Reagan. Reagan grudgingly signed a funding bill that didn't fund the missiles, increased foreign aid to Israel beyond the level he requested, and added funding for the Legal Services Corporation, which offers civil legal services to poor Americans and which Reagan had wanted to eliminate.

Why: A variety of issues this time: House Democrats wanted more education funding, more aid for Israel and Egypt, less aid to Syria and El Salvador, and less defense spending than Reagan did. The two parties reached a compromise in which the MX missile was funded, and Democrats got a lot less money for education and secured their defense and foreign cuts, along with a ban on oil and gas drilling on federal animal refuges.

Why: Reagan wanted a crime bill; House Democrats wanted water projects and a law reversing a recent Supreme Court decision allowing exemptions from Title IX of the Civil Rights Act for colleges that didn't get federal funding directly but whose students did. Reagan didn't like the latter two provisions, and a three-day spending extension was passed to give more time to negotiate after the funding gap.

Why: Three days wasn't long enough! And this time, 500,000 workers were furloughed. Ultimately, the Democrats relented on all three issues -- the crime bill, the civil rights bill, and the water projects -- and even acquiesced to temporary funding for Nicaragua's anti-communist Contra guerrillas.

Why: House Democrats were pushing a number of White House-opposed provisions, including expansion of Aid to Families With Dependent Children, the name used at the time for welfare. They were promised a vote on the welfare expansion and a concession relating to the government's privatization of the railway Conrail, and in exchange passed a funding bill. About 500,000 workers were furloughed for half a day.

Why: Congressional Democrats were resisting further funding for the Contras in Nicaragua, and insisted on reinstating the Fairness Doctrine, a Federal Communications Commission rule that had recently been abandoned, which required broadcasters to show balanced perspectives on political issues. Democrats lost on the Fairness Doctrine, and agreed to ""nonlethal"" aid to the Contras.

Why: Bush pledged to veto any continuing resolution that did not come with a plan to reduce the deficit. The House tried to override his veto and failed, forcing a shutdown in which millions of workers were furloughed. The House and Senate agreed to a joint budget resolution outlining a declining deficit, and Bush signed a continuing resolution

Why: Gingrich and Dole sent Clinton a continuing resolution including hikes to Medicare premiums, rollbacks of environmental regulations, and a requirement to balance the budget within seven years. Clinton vetoed it, and the government went into shutdown. The shutdown ended with a deal among the three leaders to fund the government at 75 percent levels for four weeks so that negotiations could keep going. Clinton acceded to the seven-year balanced budget requirement. About 800,000 employees were furloughed.

Why: This shutdown, which lasted the better part of a month, was all about whether to use economic forecasts from the Congressional Budget Office or the Office of Management and Budget to determine whether the White House's budget plan would balance. The CBO was more cautious, and projected that Clinton would still have a $115 billion deficit in seven years under his plan. Republicans eventually caved after 21 days, and Clinton then proposed a plan that the CBO agreed balanced the budget. Some 284,000 workers were furloughed, in the longest shutdown in history.

Why: Ted Cruz, basically. While House Republicans, led by Boehner, had pressured the White House into agreeing to lower levels of discretionary spending, and conservatives in the House led by Rep. Tom Graves (R-GA) demanded that any funding bill delay implementation of Obamacare by a year. It was set to roll out the following year, and conservatives, most vocally led by Cruz and Heritage Action, were desperate to stop it before it gained beneficiaries who could defend it politically. Enough House conservatives got on board with the plan to make it impossible to pass a continuing resolution, and the government shut down.

After 17 days, Boehner folded and passed a funding bill that did not defund Obamacare and that most of his caucus opposed. Roughly 850,000 workers, or about 40 percent of the federal workforce, were furloughed.

Why: This one was over immigration. As Vox's Andrew Prokop explained at the time, Democrats, spurred on by outside activists, wanted to force the Trump Administration and Congress to protect beneficiaries of DACA (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrival), which barred deportation of unauthorized immigrants who came to the US as kids, after the Trump administration decided to end the program. Because Democrats easily had enough votes to filibuster a funding bill in the Senate, they (and a handful of Republican senators who also voted no) were able to block a bill lacking protections for DACA recipients and force a shutdown.

But they folded relatively quickly after that, agreeing to fund the government (and the Children's Health Insurance Program, which was also up for renewal) after Majority Leader McConnell promised to hold a vote on an immigration bill.

Why: The second shutdown of the Trump years was a Rand Paul special. Indeed, calling it a ""shutdown"" is kind of generous, as it only lasted a few hours and mostly involved Paul forcing his colleagues to stay until until nearly 6 in the morning.

But in any case, Paul was angry that congressional leaders had negotiated a deal to exceed budget caps adopted as part of the 2011 fiscal cliff deal. Most Republicans accepted the deal as a necessary price of getting higher defense spending, but Paul, among the most dovish Republicans in the chamber, is a fierce critic of defense spending too.

So Paul filibustered the bill, delaying passage to 5:30AM and technically causing a brief shutdown, even though there were easily enough votes in the Senate to pass the bill."
145,vox,https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2019/1/9/18175617/trump-national-emergency-border-politics,"President Donald Trump inadvertently admitted the emergency declaration he's considering about the situation on the southern border is all about politics on Wednesday, saying it's ""the people that are unreasonable"" who will determine if he declares one.

Asked by a reporter why he didn't declare a national emergency during his Oval Office speech on Tuesday night, Trump said, ""because I think we might work a deal, and if we don't, I may go that route.""

""I have the absolute right to do national emergency if I want,"" Trump added.

The reporter followed up by asking the president what his ""threshold"" will be to declare one. But instead of citing the possibility that conditions could deteriorate at the southern border, Trump cited political considerations -- rather than anything that's happening on the ground.

""My threshold will be if I can't make a deal with people that are unreasonable,"" Trump said, alluding to Democrats who thus far have shown no sign of caving to his demand that more than $5 billion in wall funding be included in a government funding bill.

Trump has been floating a national emergency declaration, something he has broad legal authority to do, since this weekend. As the partial government shutdown is soon to become one of the longest in history, Trump said on Wednesday he's still hopeful that funding for his border wall will be secured through a deal of some sort with congressional Democrats, but he left the door open to declaring a national emergency if that doesn't happen.

While nobody doubts that the president has the power to declare a national emergency, whether he could use one to bypass Congress and build a wall along the southern border is a dicier question.

As Vox's Emily Stewart detailed in her explainer about national emergencies, Trump would surely face stiff legal challenges if he goes this route. And the fact he admitted that his considerations are all about politics won't help his case.

Ultimately, as my colleague Dara Lind has written, the idea that there is currently a ""crisis"" at the border is largely manufactured by the Trump administration. To the extent there is one, it's largely a result of administration policies like ""metering"" asylum seekers or holding children in Border Patrol custody for days -- issues that won't be addressed by spending billions of dollars to build just over 200 miles of wall.

Still, hearing the president admit that he's considering a national emergency for purely political reasons on camera during a White House event reflects how much Trump is making it up as he goes -- sometimes to his own detriment."
146,vox,https://www.vox.com/2019/1/2/18165019/trump-border-wall-messaging-incoherent,"President Donald Trump wants you to believe that a wall along the southern border is already mostly built, but that he also definitely needs at least $5 billion for it, and Mexico is still going to pay for it, but also a government shutdown is necessary to fund it.

But if the wall is already largely built and the border is secure, then why drag out a government shutdown for the funding?

Trump's wild swings on what he says about the wall have become a feature of the partial government shutdown, which began at midnight the Friday before Christmas and seems destined to stretch on until either Trump or Democrats budge on border wall funding.

On Wednesday morning, Trump falsely claimed on Twitter that Mexico is already paying for the wall, adding that ""Much of the Wall has already been fully renovated or built.""

This goes back to Trump's campaign promise to ""make Mexico pay"" for the wall, an idea that has practically been abandoned since Trump became president and that Mexico said it will not do.

Moreover, the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement has not even been approved by Congress, and even if it is, it will not result in Mexico paying for the wall. Meanwhile, Trump is demanding American taxpayers foot the bill.

It is also not true that ""Much of the Wall has already been fully renovated or built."" While prototypes for the wall have been commissioned by the Department of Homeland Security, an omnibus spending bill Trump signed last March contained $1.6 billion for border security measures. That money was only available for fencing and improvement to existing barriers -- not to build the wall prototypes that Trump made a big show of inspecting that same month. Congress in fact hasn't appropriated a cent directly for Trump's wall.

The construction status of the wall isn't the only respect in which Trump's messaging about border security has been incoherent. He wants you to believe that the southern border is now secured because of his tough measures. But he also wants you to believe the same border is in crisis and requires the construction of an expensive border wall to secure it.

On the morning of December 11, Trump claimed on Twitter that ""Our Southern Border is now secure and will remain that way.""

Less than an hour later, however, he insisted a border wall is so desperately needed that he'd have the military build it if Congress refuses to pay for it. (There's just one problem: The president doesn't have the authority to do that without congressional approval.)

Before the month was through, Trump posted another tweet claiming the wall is ""desperately needed.""

But if it's true that the border is already secure, then it's unclear why Congress allocating billions of dollars for a wall is a desperate need.

One thing does seem clear -- with the government shutdown in its 12th day and Democrats showing no signs of caving to Trump's demands, the president is flailing to find a way out.

On Tuesday, Trump resorted to begging incoming House Speaker Nancy Pelosi on Twitter to make a deal with him.

But Pelosi has already ruled out agreeing to funding for the wall, saying during a news conference last month that Democrats in her caucus find it to be ""immoral, ineffective, and expensive."" Even Republicans don't seem that enthused about the idea.

Meanwhile, Trump is repeating his fearmongering about immigrants that lost Republicans 40 seats in the House.

Trump's position on the shutdown and border wall doesn't have much appeal beyond his base. An NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll released last month found that 57 percent of Americans wanted Trump to ""compromise on the border wall to prevent gridlock,"" and support for the wall has consistently polled below 40 percent."
147,san francisco gate,https://www.sfgate.com/news/article/Congress-to-face-same-question-When-will-the-13531052.php,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congress returns to Washington for its first full week of legislative business since control of the House reverted to Democrats, but lawmakers will be confronted with the same lingering question: When will the partial government shutdown end?

One Republican senator says he's offered President Donald Trump a possible solution, though it may just be wishful thinking.

Sen. Lindsey Graham is encouraging Trump to reopen government for several weeks to continue negotiating with Democrats over the border wall Trump wants to build on the U.S.-Mexico border. If there's no deal at the end of that time, Graham says Trump would be free to take the more dramatic step of declaring a national emergency to build it.

But the South Carolina Republican says Trump still wants a deal on funding for the wall before agreeing to reopen shuttered government departments. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat, insists Trump reopen the government first.

Their weeks-old standoff led to the partial government shutdown, now on day 24 without a clear end in sight.

""Before he pulls the plug on the legislative option, and I think we're almost there, I would urge him to open up the government for a short period of time, like three weeks, before he pulls the plug, see if we can get a deal,"" Graham said. ""If we can't at the end of three weeks, all bets are off.

""See if he can do it by himself through the emergency powers. That's my recommendation,"" added Graham, who has publicly pushed Trump to use his authority to declare a national emergency to build the wall. Such a step would allow Trump to bypass Congress and tap various pots of unspent federal money, including for military construction and disaster relief as well as from assets seized by law enforcement, to pay for the wall.

Trump has kept Washington on edge over whether he would resort to such a declaration, citing what he says is a ""crisis"" of drug smuggling and the trafficking of women and children at the border. The president initially sounded as though such a move was imminent, but then pulled back. He has said several times since he first mentioned the idea in public this month that he prefers a legislative solution.

A key question is how much more time is Trump willing to give lawmakers. Graham, who spoke with Trump by telephone on Sunday morning, said the legislative path ""is just about shut off"" and blamed intransigence by Pelosi.

The speaker's office had no immediate comment.

Democrats oppose an emergency declaration but may be powerless to block it. Some Republicans are wary, too, fearing how a future Democratic president might use that authority. Such a move, should Trump ultimately go that route, would almost certainly be challenged in the courts.

Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., called Graham's idea to reopen the government a ""great place to start.""

""I do think if we reopen the government, if the president ends this shutdown crisis, we have folks who can negotiate a responsible, modern investment in technology that will actually make us safer,"" Coons said.

Trump says technology is nice, but that the border can't be secured without a wall.

The White House has been laying the groundwork for an emergency declaration, which is feared by lawmakers in both parties.

Senate Homeland Security Committee Chairman Ron Johnson, R-Wis., said he'd ""hate to see"" a declaration issued because the wall wouldn't get built, presumably because of legal challenges. Democrats voted in the past for border security and should again, he said.

""I actually want to see this wall get built,"" Johnson said. ""I want to keep pressure on Democrats to actually come to the negotiating table in good faith and fund what they have supported in the past.""

Graham favors a declaration and said the time for talk is running out.

""It's the last option, not the first option, but we're pretty close to that being the only option,"" he said.

Graham and Coons spoke on ""Fox News Sunday"" and Johnson appeared on CNN's ""State of the Union.""

148,inquirer.net,https://newsinfo.inquirer.net/1072737/trump-urged-to-reopen-government-for-a-few-weeks,"WASHINGTON -- A Republican lawmaker advising President Donald Trump said he is encouraging the president to reopen the government for several weeks to continue negotiating with Democrats over funding for a U.S.-Mexico border wall before the president takes the more drastic step of declaring a national emergency.

But that may be wishful thinking, given that Sen. Lindsey Graham also says Trump still wants to reach a deal for the wall before agreeing to reopen shuttered government departments. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a leading Democratic negotiator, insists that Trump reopen the government first.

The weeks-old standoff over funding led to the partial government shutdown that hit day 23 on Sunday without an end in sight.

""Before he pulls the plug on the legislative option, and I think we're almost there, I would urge him to open up the government for a short period of time, like three weeks, before he pulls the plug, see if we can get a deal,"" said Graham, a South Carolina Republican.

Trump has kept Washington on edge over whether he would resort to such a declaration, citing what he says is a ""crisis"" of drug smuggling and the trafficking of women and children at the border. The president initially sounded as though such a move was imminent, but then pulled back. He has said several times since he first mentioned the idea in public earlier this month that he prefers to try to reach a deal with Congress.

A key question is how much more time is Trump willing to give lawmakers. Graham, who said he and Trump talked by telephone on Sunday morning, said the legislative path ""is just about shut off"" and blamed Pelosi.

The speaker's office had no immediate comment.

""I do think if we reopen the government, if the president ends this shutdown crisis, we have folks who can negotiate a responsible, modern investment in technology that will actually make us safer,"" Coons said.

Trump has maintained that the border cannot be secured without a wall.

Graham said he thinks Trump is willing to accept the $5.7 billion he has insisted on for the wall, along with some immigration measures Democrats might find acceptable, such as helping immigrants who were illegally brought to the U.S. as children.

Trump has expressed interest in a broader immigration overhaul, but says he first wants the Supreme Court to address the class of immigrants known as ""Dreamers."" Pelosi also has shown no interest in accepting a wall -- she has called it an ""immorality"" -- in exchange for immigration fixes.

And, Trump, who was holed up in the White House as snow blanketed Washington on Sunday, appeared to shoot down Graham's suggestion of a ""wall plus"" deal, saying on Twitter that even Democrats don't want to make ""Dreamers"" part of the negotiations.

""The damage done to our Country from a badly broken Border - Drugs, Crime and so much that is bad - is far greater than a Shutdown, which the Dems can easily fix as soon as they come back to Washington!"" Trump said in a separate tweet.

The White House has been laying the groundwork for an emergency declaration, feared by members of both parties.

Senate Homeland Security Committee Chairman Ron Johnson, R-Wis., said he would ""hate to see"" a declaration because then the wall wouldn't get built, presumably because of legal challenges. Democrats voted in the past for border security and should again, he said.

149,the straits times,https://www.straitstimes.com/world/united-states/trump-crossed-political-line-in-visit-to-troops-critics-say,"WASHINGTON (NYTIMES) - During his surprise visit to American troops in Iraq and Germany this week, President Donald Trump singled out red ""Make America Great Again"" caps in a sea of military fatigues, signed a ""Trump 2020"" patch and accused House of Representatives Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi and other leading Democrats of being weak on border security.

Now the president is facing accusations he was playing politics with the military.

""When that starts happening, it's like the politicisation of the judicial branch,"" said Mark Hertling, a retired three-star Army lieutenant general.

Visiting troops abroad is a presidential tradition in which the commander in chief puts aside politics to thank a military that represents a broad spectrum of the country. But Trump's political comments and his encouragement of supporters in the crowd veered from those norms.

""He has to understand that there exist some audiences that should not be addressed as part of his base, because they are not,"" Hertling said. ""It's a violation of protocol by the president.""

Then there was the president's boast, which was incorrect, that the troops would be getting their first raise in more than a decade thanks to his leadership.

""You haven't gotten one in more than 10 years - more than 10 years,"" he told about 100 uniformed troops at Al Asad Air Base in Iraq. ""And we got you a big one. I got you a big one."" In fact, the military has received steady pay increases for decades.

Trump also turned a customary Christmas greeting into a broadside against Democrats, who are refusing to fund a wall along the southern border. The stalemate over the wall, Trump's signature campaign promise, has resulted in a partial government shutdown.

""I don't know if you folks are aware of what's happening,"" Trump said. ""We want to have strong borders in the United States. The Democrats don't want to let us have strong borders."" ""You know why?"" he added. ""Because I want it.""

Trump joked that his solution to obtaining funding for a wall was to claim that he did not want one anymore. ""Tell Nancy Pelosi I don't want the wall,"" he said, adding: ""And then we get the wall. That's another way of doing it."" ""You're fighting for borders in other countries, and they don't want to fight, the Democrats, for the border of our country,"" he added. ""It doesn't make a lot of sense.""

Pelosi's deputy chief of staff, Drew Hammill, accused Trump of turning uniformed troops into scenery for a campaign speech. ""He offered our brave men and women in uniform the bitter insult of using them as political pawns to push his radical right-wing, anti-immigrant agenda,"" Hammill said. ""The president turned his first visit to our troops into another cringeworthy Donald Trump reality-show special.""

Some commentators on Fox News also criticised the president for injecting politics into the event. ""He talked about the border wall as well, which didn't have a place there,"" Julie Banderas, a Fox News contributor, said on the show ""Outnumbered.""

Another Fox News contributor on the show, Jessica Tarlov, criticised the president for using the visit ""as a campaign rally."" The political paraphernalia on display, which Trump appeared to encourage during his speech by referencing the caps he had signed, has raised questions at the Defence Department about violations of military protocol by the troops who greeted him. One woman in uniform at Ramstein Air Base in Germany, for instance, welcomed Trump with a ""Make America Great Again"" flag, according to a photograph posted on Twitter by a Bloomberg News reporter who accompanied Trump on the trip.

A directive from the department prohibits active-duty personnel from engaging in ""partisan political activities"" and advises that ""all military personnel should avoid the inference that their political activities imply or appear to imply DoD sponsorship, approval or endorsement of a political candidate, campaign or cause."" Defence Department and Army regulations also prohibit military personnel from showing any political leanings while in uniform, Hertling said.

An official said the department was aware of the situation and ""trying to figure it out"" by tracking down photographs of troops holding red caps and campaign flags, and piecing together where the campaign paraphernalia came from.

Trump said Thursday that he could not turn down any requests from the soldiers. ""If these brave young people ask me to sign their hat, I will sign,"" he tweeted. ""Can you imagine my saying NO? We brought or gave NO hats as the Fake News first reported!""

The White House press secretary, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, said administration officials did not distribute any campaign gear to the troops and noted that ""these were their personal belongings.""

On her Twitter feed, Sanders addressed a CNN.com report that raised questions about whether the red caps displayed for Trump to sign may have violated a military rule.

""CNN will attack anyone who supports President Trump, including the brave men and women of our military who fight every day to protect our freedom,"" Sanders wrote. She declined to comment further on the president's speech.

In his remarks, Trump also boasted that he had secured ""billions and billions of dollars of new equipment"" for the military. ""You're getting such new equipment, your eyes are popping, right?"" he asked the troops."
150,the christian science monitor,https://www.csmonitor.com/USA/Politics/2018/1224/Christmas-shutdown-Why-Washington-let-the-government-close,"In many Republican leaders' eyes, Friday was the GOP's last chance to take the lead on budget negotiations before the start of the new session under a Democratic House. And by midweek, a deal seemed imminent. On Thursday, however, a day before temporary funding was set to run out, Mr. Trump again doubled down on one of his key campaign promises: the wall at the Mexican border. This latest stalemate follows a series of similar deadlocks in the budget process over the past three months and has resulted in a partial shutdown of the government. Failed budgetary negotiations have resulted in 19 government shutdowns since Congress introduced the modern budget process in 1976. The Departments of State, Agriculture, Justice, Transportation, Treasury, Homeland Security, and Interior are all affected. About 420,000 or so federal workers who fall under ""essential services"" - mainly those involved with public safety, such as law enforcement, in-hospital care, and air traffic control - will work without pay until a spending bill is passed. More than 380,000 others - including about 80 percent of National Park Service employees - will be furloughed.

The government partially shut down at midnight Friday after Congress and the White House failed to agree on a spending package, the third shutdown this year. The sticking point: President Trump's border wall.

In many Republican leaders' eyes, Friday was the GOP's last chance to take the lead on budget negotiations before the start of the new session under a Democratic House. And by midweek, a deal seemed imminent.

On Thursday, however, a day before temporary funding was set to run out, Mr. Trump again doubled down on one of his key campaign promises: the wall at the Mexican border. He announced he wasn't going to sign any bill without $5 billion to begin construction. Democrats have opposed the plan from the start, saying that a physical wall is both too expensive and ineffective.

The House passed a bill that included $5 billion, as well as $8 billion for disaster relief. The Senate, however, didn't have the votes Friday to pass a similar bill by the midnight deadline. So the government shut down.

This latest stalemate followed a series of similar snags in the budget process over the past three months. At the end of the government's fiscal year on Sept. 30, Congress needs to pass annual appropriation to fund federal agencies and programs. The House and Senate Appropriations Committees each divide into 12 subcommittees that deal with different parts of the budget. Each chamber passes their own version of each bill, usually as part of a larger omnibus or ""minibus"" bill. A final bill is then approved by the House and Senate before going to the president to be signed into law.

This year, Congress was able to pass five of the 12 appropriations bills by the September deadline. Lawmakers then approved a temporary measure - called a continuing resolution, or CR - to fund the remaining seven at last year's levels through Dec. 7, and then again through Dec. 21.

This is a partial shutdown, because Congress approved 70 percent of spending for the coming fiscal year in those first five appropriations bills. Those departments that are still on the hook include State, Agriculture, Justice, Transportation, Treasury, Homeland Security, and Interior.

About 420,000 or so federal workers who fall under ""essential services"" - mainly those involved with public safety, such as law enforcement, in-hospital care, and air traffic control - will still work without pay until a spending bill is passed. More than 380,000 others - including about 80 percent of National Park Service employees - will be furloughed. (The Senate passed a measure Saturday to ensure that these workers will receive back pay after an appropriations bill is passed. The House seems poised to follow suit.)

Core services such as Social Security, Medicare, and the military will still be funded, though some of their functions may be affected.

Failed budgetary negotiations have resulted in 19 government shutdowns since Congress introduced the modern budget process in 1976. Most of those, including the two that took place earlier this year, happened over very short periods - three days or less - or over the weekend, so government operations weren't really affected.

There have been three major shutdowns in modern memory. The first two took place in the winter of 1995 to '96, when a GOP-led Congress vowed to balance the federal budget through the Republican Party's ""Contract for America."" Then-President Bill Clinton agreed with Republicans about the end but not with the means - they wanted to cut social programs and repeal Mr. Clinton's 1993 tax law. The conflict resulted in a shutdown from Nov. 14 through Nov. 20, 1995, then again from Dec. 16, 1995, until Jan. 5, 1996, for a total of 26 days.

The October 2013 shutdown, which lasted 16 days, happened after the House and Senate deadlocked over the Affordable Care Act. Republicans in the House secured enough votes to fold a one-year delay in the health-care mandate into the spending bill. The Democrat-led Senate refused to entertain the House provisions, while the House refused to go forward without them. Eventually both chambers managed to pass a resolution to fund the government for a few more months until they could resume the fight.

As of Monday there doesn't seem to be an end in sight. Over the weekend, Senate majority leader Mitch McConnell (R) of Kentucky said the chamber wouldn't reconvene until Dec. 27, and acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney said Sunday that it's possible the shutdown could go on until after the New Year.

A few things make this shutdown unusual. One is Trump, who in a televised meeting last week with House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi and Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer said he would be ""proud"" to shut down the government in defense of his border wall. Shutdowns are unpopular, and politicians typically try to shift the blame for running out of funding to the other party. The president later backed off, and as the deadline loomed lawmakers seemed close to cutting a deal that he would support.

But this conflict is also taking place at the end of a congressional session. Democrats officially take over the House on Jan. 3 for the 116th Congress, and some Republicans see this as their last real shot at getting funding approved for the wall. Far-right commentators, such Ann Coulter, as well as members of the Freedom Caucus, called the president out on his campaign pledge as negotiations were taking place. Shortly afterward, Trump declared he would not sign any bill that did not have $5 billion for the wall.

Not much has changed since, except that Democratic leaders released a joint statement saying that if the shutdown spills into January, ""the new House Democratic majority will swiftly pass legislation to re-open government.""

While shutdowns can be and have been avoided through compromise and dealmaking, the stopgap measure is unlikely to go away entirely. Shutdowns are often the result of political disputes tacked onto the budget process - a negotiating tactic that lawmakers have used for decades. Usually they can find some sort of compromise to keep the government running. But as Congress grows more divided and it gets harder to compromise on bipartisan legislation, legislators will increasingly use the spending process - a core part of their job - as a vehicle to push tough bills through. That's only going to become more likely as each party takes control of one chamber.

""The fact that it's the only train leaving makes it a very inviting target for all kinds of shenanigans,"" says Patrick Griffin, who teaches a graduate course on the legislative process at American University. ""There's nowhere else to have these fights, so it becomes more and more attractive as less and less gets done."""

The campaign, called We The People Will Fund The Wall, was created Sunday by Brian Kolfage, a Purple Heart recipient and triple-amputee veteran who is also a motivational speaker. The campaign has a goal of raising $1 billion--the maximum allowed by GoFundMe.

""Like a majority of those American citizens who voted to elect President Donald J Trump, we voted for him to Make America Great Again,"" Kolfage wrote. ""President Trump's main campaign promise was to BUILD THE WALL. And as he's followed through on just about every promise so far, this wall project needs to be completed still.""

Kolfage claims that if the 63 million people who voted for Trump each pledge $80, there will be enough funding to build the wall.

""Even if we get half, that's half the wall. We can do this,"" Kolfage wrote.

Kolfage assured potential donors that the campaign is not a scam because he is using his real name and real information, and he can be contacted and held accountable. He also assured that the government does accept private donations for such projects, citing a large donation made by a billionaire in 2012 to fund repairs on the Washington Monument.

According to Kolfage's website, he is a retired United States Air Force member who was injured during his second deployment for Operation Iraqi Freedom in 2004.

""This won't be easy, but it's our duty as citizens,"" Kolfage wrote. ""This needs to be shared every single day by each of you on social media. We can do it, and we can help President Trump make America safe again!""

Trump ran for president on a campaign promise of building a wall on the border that Mexico would pay for. However, as 2017 comes to a close, his administration has not secured funds for the wall. A budget proposal passed on Wednesday did not fulfill Trump's call for such funds.

153,belfast telegraph,https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/world-news/trump-ally-urges-president-to-reopen-us-government-37707126.html,"https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/world-news/article37707123.ece/e6118/AUTOCROP/h342/bpanews_c587737a-e674-4ae9-aba2-829dbe1cfb38_1

A Republican senator advising Donald Trump has said he is encouraging the president to reopen the government for several weeks to continue negotiating with Democrats over funding for a US-Mexico border wall.

But Lindsey Graham admitted Mr Trump still wants to reach a deal for the wall before agreeing to reopen closed government departments.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a leading Democratic negotiator, insists that Mr Trump reopen the government first.

The weeks-old stand-off over funding led to the partial government shutdown that hit day 23 on Sunday without an end in sight.

""Before he pulls the plug on the legislative option, and I think we're almost there, I would urge him to open up the government for a short period of time, like three weeks, before he pulls the plug, see if we can get a deal,"" said Mr Graham, a South Carolina Republican. ""If we can't at the end of three weeks, all bets are off.""

Mr Graham, who has publicly pushed Mr Trump to use his authority to declare a national emergency to build the wall, continued: ""See if he can do it by himself through the emergency powers. That's my recommendation.""

Such a step would allow Mr Trump to bypass Congress and tap various pots of unspent federal money, including for military construction and disaster relief and from assets seized by law enforcement, to pay for the wall.

Mr Trump has kept Washington on edge over whether he would resort to such a declaration, citing what he says is a ""crisis"" of drug smuggling and the trafficking of women and children at the border.

The president initially sounded as though such a move was imminent, but then pulled back. He has said several times since he first mentioned the idea in public earlier this month that he prefers to try to reach a deal with Congress.

A key question is how much more time is Mr Trump willing to give Congress. Mr Graham, who said he and Mr Trump talked by telephone on Sunday morning, said the legislative path ""is just about shut off"" and blamed Ms Pelosi.

Democrats oppose an emergency declaration but may be powerless to block it. Some Republicans are wary, too, fearing how a future Democratic president might use that authority. Such a move, should Mr Trump ultimately go down that route, would almost certainly be challenged in the courts.

Senator Chris Coons, called Mr Graham's idea to reopen the government a ""great place to start"".

""I do think if we reopen the government, if the president ends this shutdown crisis, we have folks who can negotiate a responsible, modern investment in technology that will actually make us safer,"" Mr Coons said.

Mr Trump has maintained that the border cannot be secured without a wall."
154,wnd,http://www.wnd.com/2019/01/liberty-lovers-must-support-trump-on-shutdown/,"Once a high-level Reagan-era diplomat, Alan Keyes is a long-time leader in the conservative movement. He is well-known as a staunch pro-life champion and an eloquent advocate of the constitutional republic, including respect for the moral basis of liberty and self-government. He has worked to promote an approach to politics based on the initiative of citizens of goodwill consonant with the with the principles of God-endowed natural right.

President Trump continues to refine the substance behind the ""Wall"" meme he has used so effectively to dramatize the urgent need to regain control of our nation's southern border. In an article I wrote in January of last year, I observed and supported his efforts to do so:

""Whatever anxiety it causes his understandably worried supporters - as I wrote recently, promising legislation, repeatedly betrayed, has been the pattern of GOP betrayal re immigration for decades - refining the wall meme with references to some actual components of effective border security may be a reassuring sign that work is being done to put the rhetorical trope into action.""

Whatever lies they tell America's citizenry, the Democrat Party's contingent in Congress supports the globalist elitist faction's effort to surrender control of the borders of our country, along with the sovereignty of the people of the United States. If President Trump succeeds in his efforts to refortify our borders, that success will thwart the effort to bring down the government - of, by and for the people - the U.S. Constitution is supposed to implement. This will thwart the globalists' scheme to put the U.N. in charge of regulating the flow of migrants into the U.S.

As the globalist former German Prime Minister Angela Merkel recently admitted, President Trump's policies are already thwarting the imposition of the so-called ""New"" World Order. Actually, it aims to return all the earth to age-old oligarchic despotism. Indeed, the new technologies of the information age empower elitists to impose more pervasive and effective totalitarian control than ever before.

As Merkel asserts, President Trump's resolve to defend our sovereignty as a free people shatter this totalitarian elitist nightmare. That resolve could allow us to preserve our Union, reassert effective control over all its territory and preserve intact the representative, democratic republic ordained and established by the U.S. Constitution. But if the elitist totalitarians succeed in wresting sovereign control from our constitutional self-government, they will be in a position to pressure our Union until it disintegrates. With ""sanctuary cities"" and states abetting illegal immigration in defiance of federal law, that disintegration has already begun.

It is exacerbated by the encouragement of ""identity politics."" However specious in fact, such politics rely on ideological memes that emphatically discard any effort to promote and maintain the sense of common humanity that must inform our identity as a people. Instead, ""identity politics"" promotes into matters of public policy, strenuous, angry and sometimes violent racial, ethnic and even whimsically individual sensitivities. This is bound to foment intractable strife, given the multi-ethnic composition of our population. As issues for public law and enforcement, rather than private choice, agreement and mutual self-arbitration, such sensitivities foment the disintegration of our body politic. This is precisely the result elitist faction globalists mean to produce.

With this aim in mind, they fund and organize the push to erase our borders and increase the flow of illegal immigration into our country. But if President Trump's policies for border control succeed, that will thwart both results. With the flow of illegals curtailed, our electoral process will be less susceptible to illegal manipulation by blatantly anti-constitutional schemers eager to allow illegal immigrants to vote in our national elections. Their actions are already tainting our electoral outcomes, as the mess in Broward County, Florida, during the recent midterms made abundantly clear.

President Trump's use of the ""Wall"" meme effectively highlights the purpose of securing our safety and sovereignty as a people. It focuses the mind on what is ultimately at stake. Along with their media parrots, elitist faction tools in both the Democratic and Republican parties want everyone to see the issue simply in terms of people striving to escape poverty by coming to the United States. But the strategic objective of the globalist totalitarian elitists who are exploiting, organizing and leading them against our borders, is to overthrow the sovereignty of the American people. So, in fact, they seek to erase the experiment in constitutional, republican and democratic government that allowed Americans to produce the stable, energetic regime of individual liberty that has made us the focus of hope for people elsewhere still harshly burdened by oppressive elitist tyrannies.

Democrats who refuse to give priority to restoring control of our borders should be called to account for what, in effect, amounts to aiding and abetting elitists' scheme to discredit and erase the example of our right use of freedom. Their pretense of compassion for people seeking a better life serves to mask the real objective, which is to reassert the age-old lie that regular folks must depend, for their safety, on the wicked rule of elite, self-worshiping tyrants, whose abuse of power inevitably destroys the happiness of the people they purport to secure. The people of the United States are the one people in the history of the earth who, by their self-government, combined safety and happiness, with results that approve the right of all humanity to live without the insult of dictatorship, no matter what party or demagogue offers to impose it upon them.

That result required a combination of goodwill, prevalent decency and courage Americans have, in the past, always managed to achieve. The battle over funding for the ""Wall"" requires that we do so now. Some call it Trump's Wall. But it actually represents the resolve of the American people. Will we hold fast to the God-endowed responsibilities and hopes we more than once secured and which our Constitution challenges us to pass to our posterity? Or will we succumb to the deceitful slurs of treacherous leaders who deplore our decent liberty and think they now stand on the brink of extinguishing it?

President Trump's insistence on controlling our borders offers Americans the chance to prove them wrong - but only if the people who elected him work strenuously to encourage and support his stand. If the government shutdown is prolonged, so be it. After all, self-government requires, from time to time, that a people determined to be free prove that it knows how to survive without any government but what corresponds to their own goodwill."
155,ndtv,https://www.ndtv.com/opinion/opinion-elon-musk-warren-buffet-tim-cook-your-2019-horoscopes-1971994,"From succession planning and digesting megamergers, to repairing embattled businesses and learning from #MeToo-related scandals, 2019 is set to be a consequential year for the heads of some of the most iconic American companies. We've scanned the stars for clues to what lies ahead for a select group of them based on their zodiac signs. What follows is our third annual compilation of CEO horoscopes:

Capricorn: Mary Barra, Chairman and CEO of General Motors Co

Capricorn, your best quality is pragmatism. It's a trait that can make you seem cold, but some decisions - like reshaping General Motors for the future - require practicality. In 2018, you chose to shutter several US plants in a shift away from sedans and hybrid cars, in favor of higher-margin SUVs and a bet on fully electric vehicles. The move will cause pain to those working-class communities, and since it runs counter to President Donald Trump's rhetoric about restoring manufacturing jobs, you knew it would instigate a Twitter tirade. But you also know that for GM to remain a leader and survive the next potential recession without another bailout, this is what it must do. It's not enough, though. Investors show little faith in the long-term earnings prospects of US automakers, and the $6 billion in annual savings you project from the plant closures probably isn't enough to truly transform GM. Meanwhile in China, the electric-car market is booming, but the Chevy Bolt isn't. You must work faster to get costs under control and pursue a profitable electric-vehicle strategy unencumbered by White House bluster and an outdated image of GM.

Aquarius: Bob Iger, Chairman and CEO of Walt Disney Co

Aquarius is the visionary of the zodiac, and that trait was on display in your dealmaking at Disney. First with Pixar, then Marvel and Lucasfilm (""Star Wars""), your acquisitions have allowed the company to dominate the box office and continue drawing swarms of fans to Disney's theme parks. But your vision is less understood when it comes to your recent $85 billion takeover of 21st Century Fox Inc.'s TV and film studios. In theory, owning these assets will cement Disney's position as it pursues a new audience of TV streamers through the soon-to-come Disney+ app. Yet, this megadeal and Disney+ also complicate a previously meticulous strategy. This year, you must focus on tidying up the Magic Kingdom so that its success can outlast your time at the helm. Retirement is just a couple of years away and there's much work to be done, including grooming a successor. That will only get more difficult if Disney+ causes strife within the empire by forcing different divisions to compete for content and resources. You must also take care not to alienate fans as you start to preserve some of Disney's best movies and TV shows for the app. More reflection on this new streaming strategy may serve the company -- and your legacy -- better in the long run.

Pisces: Larry Culp, Chairman and CEO of General Electric Co

Pisces, you'll set the tone for the year early on when you unveil your much-anticipated plan for steering the embattled industrial giant out of its current crisis. You've made some missteps in your first few months as CEO: you ruled out an equity raise only to put one back on the table; your attempt to ease investors' anxiety via a CNBC appearance backfired; and your decision to re-hire a long-time insider to chair the eyesore gas-turbine business confounded investors expecting deep-rooted cultural change. But there have also been signs of progress, including your decision to appoint a power and insurance expert to the board and to start shopping for a new auditor. To regain investors' confidence, you must inject more transparency into GE's earnings, provide clarity on its liabilities and, most importantly, present a viable plan for reducing its bloated debt load. An equity raise would give you breathing room, as would scrapping the spinoff portion of a planned GE Healthcare divestiture. But your most difficult challenge is finding a way to balance restructuring and debt repayment with growth investments, so that whatever remains of GE once you're done has a competitive leg to stand on.

Aries: Shari Redstone, Vice Chair and controlling shareholder of CBS Corp. and Viacom Inc

The last few years have a been a struggle, but an Aries doesn't back down. Just when you finished cleaning house at Viacom and started seeing the fruit of the regime change, arguably worse problems arose at CBS. Now, with the removal of Les Moonves following the numerous sexual-misconduct allegations made against him, and the overhaul of a board that had turned hostile to you, you're probably through the worst of it. CBS is in culture-repair mode, and Viacom is making progress turning around its Paramount film studio and ramping up TV production. Still, you know that neither company can thrive on its own in the long run as Disney and AT&T get bigger and join Netflix and Amazon.com Inc. in streaming domination. This is the year to finally do what you've long wanted - to recombine CBS and Viacom. It may even make sense to form a three-way merger involving CBS's new chairman, Strauss Zelnick, and his $12 billion video-game company, Take-Two Interactive Software Inc. as another step toward building direct-to-consumer relationships. Scale and content are the themes in the industry, and CBS and Viacom could use more of both. Take your cue from the ram and charge ahead.

Taurus: Randall Stephenson, Chairman and CEO of AT&T Inc

You have difficult days ahead. While you imagined this would be one of the most exciting times for AT&T, the stock instead finished 2018 near an almost eight-year low. Investors don't yet grasp your vision for turning a stable wireless-service carrier into a cyclical and challenged media conglomerate that is now trying to go head-to-head with Disney, Netflix and Amazon - especially when Verizon Communications Inc. seems to be moving in the opposite direction. The pressure is on to prove that the Time Warner assets and beleaguered DirecTV business can both flourish within AT&T, and also that the company's mountain of debt and wireless spending needs - related to the crucial build-out of AT&T's 5G network - won't get in the way of shareholders' beloved dividend payments. You'll launch a new video-streaming service in 2019 that will offer three pricing tiers with varying assortments of movies and shows, which does help attract a wider audience and serves as a threat to other offerings out there. But it may also cause further confusion for consumers in an already muddled marketplace of streaming packages. There's little room for error, so in the event of any unforeseen setbacks or economic disruptions, you may have to look to the dividend as the sacrificial lamb.

Gemini: Stefano Pessina, Vice Chairman and CEO of Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc

Geminis are said to always be looking for their other half, and it's true that you've been no stranger to corporate tie-ups. You built Alliance Boots through mergers, then combined it with Walgreens four years ago. But lately, the company has taken a back seat from dealmaking, preferring partnerships over acquisitions, while others in the health-care space have done industry-shifting vertical megadeals. Rival CVS Health Corp. is re-imagining the health-care business with its $77 billion takeover of insurer Aetna Inc. Meanwhile, Walgreens was left with a consolation prize of just under 2,000 Rite Aid Corp. stores after regulators stood in the way of a larger transaction between the pharmacy chains. Since then, you've been talking with Humana Inc. about taking mutual investment stakes and expanding an existing senior-focused health-care alliance. You argue that partnerships provide many of the advantages of a merger without having to shell out billions of dollars, and you're not wrong about that. But they are fundamentally half-measures that may leave Walgreens ill-prepared to deal with the retail and pharmacy threat of Amazon, and the heft of other vertically consolidated health-care giants. (By Max Nisen)

Since this sign is represented by the twins, here's another Gemini horoscope:

Howard Willard, Chairman and CEO of Altria Group Inc

Like your Gemini peer above, you have been forging alliances with businesses around your industry, seeking to remake Altria as cigarettes become less relevant and a real cannabis industry rises from their ashes. Altria hasn't often made big acquisitions, but in 2018 that changed as you recognized the urgent need to diversify Altria's portfolio of Marlboro cigarettes, Skoal rings and other traditional tobacco products. First, Altria agreed to pay $1.8 billion for a 45 percent stake in Cronos Group Inc., one of Canada's fast-growing cannabis producers. Just a few weeks later, you closed a $12.8 billion deal for a 35 percent stake in Juul Labs Inc., the maker of electronic cigarettes that are popular among younger smokers. It was a smart move; the only question is, why did you stop at 35 percent? Buying Juul Labs outright may be down the road, and it would even be a logical precursor to a recombination with Philip Morris International Inc. The two of you are already partnering on the iQos tobacco-heating device to target older smokers, a product that may complement Juul's. Deepening all these ties would give you greater control over Altria's future.

Cancer: Elon Musk, CEO of Tesla Inc

Cancers can be a bit impulsive - like the times you picked fights with sell-siders, spelunkers and the SEC, tweeted out ""funding secured"" and blazed up live on air. Tesla's shareholders were understandably unnerved by some of your actions in 2018, but all seemingly was forgiven after unexpectedly good third-quarter results. Investors clearly foresee those becoming a regular fixture, judging by the multiples they're paying for the stock. Whether that unusually strong performance can be sustained is, therefore, a big question for 2019. The picture is hazy, with federal tax credits for Tesla's vehicles due to decline and Model 3 sales likely shifting toward lower-spec versions (though the vaunted $35,000 version remains elusive). Another, related, mystery is whether Tesla will raise more capital. You say it isn't necessary, but prudence suggests Tesla should have capitalized on its sky-high stock price and sold more already. You closed the year in unexpected, yet familiar, fashion by sending a modified Model X on a bumpy ride through a short Boring Co. tunnel in Los Angeles, thereby demonstrating a new future for transportation, we are told. As useful as an uneventful 2019 might be, that's the one thing we can't see in the stars. (By Liam Denning)

Leo: Ginni Rometty, Chairman and CEO of International Business Machines Corp

Your nearly seven years leading IBM have been defined by falling revenue, massive cost cuts and a stream of hogwash about how IBM is transforming into a technology leader. It is not. But then, Leo, you roared in 2018 by striking a $34 billion acquisition of business-software firm Red Hat Inc. It was one of the largest corporate acquisitions of the year, and by far the largest in IBM's 107-year history. The price you paid was steep, but an expensive roll of the dice is better than the status quo, and IBM and Red Hat together would seem to make a more compelling cloud-computing alternative than they could on their own. Your legacy rests on proving that the combined company can become a go-to shepherd for corporations that badly want to modernize their technology. Right now, that role is mostly filled by rivals such as Microsoft Corp. and Oracle Corp. Leos are reputed to be fierce and passionate, and you'll need all those qualities and more to integrate the two wildly different cultures of IBM and Red Hat, and keep IBM going well into its second century. (By Shira Ovide)

Virgo: Warren Buffett, Chairman and CEO of Berkshire Hathaway Inc

Virgo, you'll turn 89 this year, making it more important than ever that Berkshire Hathaway's next generation of leadership be given a chance to get properly acquainted with investors. Virgos are known to be methodical perfectionists, a quality that's been key to your decades of successful investing and dealmaking, but you could do better when it comes to messaging around your succession plan. You aren't ready to pass the torch and there's no sign you need to, but at least start to share the stage at appearances like Berkshire's annual investor meeting. Greg Abel and Ajit Jain, the executives you'll most likely name as your replacements, were notably absent from the feature moment of last year's meeting - the Q&A session - which draws investors from around the world looking to hear your market musings, outlook for Berkshire's array of businesses and about your hunt for takeover targets. After the S&P 500 index fell in 2018 by the most since the financial crisis, it's time to strike at least one last megadeal. To put a dent in Berkshire's cash, which long ago reached unproductive levels, would be the greatest gift to your successor so that he's not left to resort to a large dividend payout. Surely there are some Buffett-worthy bargains out there now - perhaps even one from this old wish list.

Libra: Reed Hastings, Chairman and CEO of Netflix Inc

Netflix has tried to give TV fans close to everything they want at an affordable price and without ads. It's only appropriate that as co-founder and CEO of the business, you're a Libra, a sign characterized by people-pleasers. But in 2019, the sustainability of Netflix's generosity - and that of its lenders - will be tested. Disney and AT&T are both launching streaming services aimed at Netflix's Achilles' heel: Many of its most-watched shows are the property of other companies, such as Disney and AT&T, that are in the early days of cutting off their supply to Netflix and confining their content to their own products. You've tried to neutralize some of that competition by signing deals directly with top content creators. Netflix's value proposition may also still ultimately be better for consumers should it sustain the variety and breadth of its library. However, as subscriber growth slows and some users defect to these new services, you may need to turn to price increases. Investors have always explained away Netflix's cash burn rate, but they may not be so willing to give the benefit of the doubt when Disney starts flexing its muscle.

Scorpio: Tim Cook, CEO of Apple Inc

In your seven years in the corner office, the challenges have never been more daunting than they are now, and I know that can sting, Scorpio. Apple propelled itself into the most profitable company in the US -- and the most valuable in the world, until recently - thanks to the sales power of the iPhone, but it's running out of steam. Investors believe iPhone sales will decline in 2019, and it'll be tough for Apple to make up the difference with your higher-priced phones. You don't typically make big-ticket acquisitions, but the Apple holiday helpers have been busy writing checks not for companies, but for high-profile projects for Apple's coming Netflix-like web video service. There's programming coming from Oprah Winfrey, from the ""Peanuts"" cartoon kids, an elephant documentary and a lot more. You might need a strategy to go with that high-priced programming, though. With investors betting that Apple's growth relies on its ability to sell subscriptions to web video, news and other internet services, all eyes are on how you'll manage to offset the waning growth of the smartphone product that delivers two-thirds of Apple's revenue. (By Shira Ovide)

Sagittarius: Abigail Johnson, Chairman and CEO of Fidelity Investments

As a Sagittarius, you don't like to be held back. That's why Fidelity in 2018 pioneered the zero-fee index fund, bringing the management cost war to its logical conclusion. But now may not be the best time to try to pitch investors a broad market index fund. Those products launched in August, just one month before the S&P 500 index peaked at its all-time high and then sold off. Volatile environments are when Fidelity's stock pickers have shined brightest - that's how the firm built its reputation, after all. If things remain rocky, will you try to get your zero-cost funds out of the limelight and pivot back to the active management side of the business? That's more than enough to keep you busy in the new year, but as the most powerful woman in investing, you also have a platform to help fix the gender imbalance on Wall Street. Fund management is still a men's club, even though diversity and client returns are shown to go hand in hand. Even your firm has grappled with cultural issues following allegations of sexual harassment made against former portfolio managers. Continue to help Fidelity do its part as the industry - and the business world as a whole - slowly becomes a more equitable place. (By Brian Chappatta)

Smith considers himself just an average Joe with no formal journalism background - but rather than simply complain about the state of our nation, he took to the Internet to battle the left. Check out Brent Smith's blog.

I've heard many conservative commentators and pundits speaking about Trump's national emergency powers and how he should use them.

Top of the list appears to be this scenario.

Negotiations, if you can even call them that, have gone nowhere. So, it's posited, Trump will appear to back down and agree to end the shutdown - after which he will then invoke his presidential authority under the 1976 National Emergencies Act, [50 U.S.C. 1601, 1621, 1622] and declare a national emergency on the border, secure funding from a number of government sources and get the wall built.

Rather, Trump should declare an emergency prior to signing an agreement to end the government shutdown. Anything less would be ill-advised.

Every party in a negotiation either goes in with leverage or seeks leverage throughout. Trump should not just give away his only point of leverage, which is his power to end the shutdown. Regardless of their foolish rhetoric, Pelosi, Schumer et al., know this, which is why they must continue to hammer Trump on this singular point: ending the shutdown.

And why is supposed legal expert leftist Jeffrey Toobin of CNN insisting that Trump in fact does have the authority to declare a national emergency? Is he being honest, or is this sophism? Are the Democrats purposely setting a trap for Trump to fall into? Is this a potential scenario the dems are trying to set up?

First, Chuck and Nancy's job is to continue to shutdown negotiations with the president, insisting that he will never get a dime for a wall or any other structure. Next, send out Toobin, the Trump-hating CNN legal beagle. But this time, much to the bemusement of his CNN colleagues, when asked, he surprises everyone by insisting that Trump has the emergency authority.

So Trump ends the shutdown and declares a national emergency. However, Democrats have already secured a leftist judge to declare the emergency unconstitutional. Trump falls into their trap, and it's tied up in court for months or longer. Democrats win. Rush Limbaugh believes this is what is going on.

But there's a problem with a court challenge. First, the 1976 National Emergencies Act has gone unchallenged since it was passed by the federal legislature and signed into law by President Gerald Ford 43 years ago. And second, the act is not specific as to presidential authority to declare an emergency. There are only two provisions provided to end a declaration.

[50 U.S.C. 1622] SEC. 202. (a) Any national emergency declared by the President in accordance with this title shall terminate if - (1) there is enacted into law a joint resolution terminating the emergency; or (2) the President issues a proclamation terminating the emergency.

And lest anyone think that a joint resolution might then be possible, think again. A joint resolution is treated identically to that of a bill. It must be passed by both Houses and then signed by the president. Trump isn't going sign his own termination of emergency.

And because of the vagueness of the 1976 National Emergencies Act, if this specific declaration is deemed unconstitutional, the entire law would have to be.

So in lieu of a declaration of emergency, is there anything more Trump can do in the interim? Not practically, but politically.

What hasn't been discussed in a while is the DACA kids, although a lot of them are hardly kids anymore.

It was established a while ago that the total cost of the border wall is about $25 billion. Why doesn't Trump propose a win-win compromise?

Rather than the usual talk of some for all, as in some wall money in exchange for legalizing all the DACA kids, suggest an incremental exchange. For every $5 billion allotted for the wall, 20 percent of the DACA kids would be legalized. And of course the shutdown will be ended, but not before the wall cash is secured and entirely irrevocable. And the next allotment of legalizations can't happen until the entire $5 billion wall section is completed.

I know the Democrats will never go for it, but it's just one more compromise put forth that shows the president to be the reasonable one. It also shows the people that his administration is the only party in these negotiations that cares enough to come up with some fresh ideas."
157,deseret news,https://www.deseretnews.com/article/900050497/congress-to-face-same-question-when-will-shutdown-end.html,"WASHINGTON -- Congress returns to Washington for its first full week of legislative business since control of the House reverted to Democrats, but lawmakers will be confronted with the same lingering question: When will the partial government shutdown end?

One Republican senator says he's offered President Donald Trump a possible solution, though it may just be wishful thinking.

Sen. Lindsey Graham is encouraging Trump to reopen government for several weeks to continue negotiating with Democrats over the border wall Trump wants to build on the U.S.-Mexico border. If there's no deal at the end of that time, Graham says Trump would be free to take the more dramatic step of declaring a national emergency to build it.

But the South Carolina Republican says Trump still wants a deal on funding for the wall before agreeing to reopen shuttered government departments. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat, insists Trump reopen the government first.

Their weeks-old standoff led to the partial government shutdown, now on day 24 without a clear end in sight.

Trump insisted on Twitter Monday that he wanted to deal, declaring: ""I've been waiting all weekend. Democrats must get to work now. Border must be secured!""

Targeting Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, Trump also argued that the shutdown ""has become their, and the Democrats, fault!"" Trump weeks ago asserted that he would ""own"" the shutdown and polls show that he is taking most of the blame.

Graham, who has publicly pushed Trump to use his authority to declare a national emergency to build the wall, is suggesting a short-term fix.

""Before he pulls the plug on the legislative option, and I think we're almost there, I would urge him to open up the government for a short period of time, like three weeks, before he pulls the plug, see if we can get a deal,"" Graham said. ""If we can't at the end of three weeks, all bets are off.

""See if he can do it by himself through the emergency powers. That's my recommendation,"" added Graham, who has publicly pushed Trump to use his authority to declare a national emergency to build the wall. Such a step would allow Trump to bypass Congress and tap various pots of unspent federal money, including for military construction and disaster relief as well as from assets seized by law enforcement, to pay for the wall.

Trump has kept Washington on edge over whether he would resort to such a declaration, citing what he says is a ""crisis"" of drug smuggling and the trafficking of women and children at the border. The president initially sounded as though such a move was imminent, but then pulled back. He has said several times since he first mentioned the idea in public this month that he prefers a legislative solution.

A key question is how much more time is Trump willing to give lawmakers. Graham, who spoke with Trump by telephone on Sunday morning, said the legislative path ""is just about shut off"" and blamed intransigence by Pelosi.

The speaker's office had no immediate comment.

Democrats oppose an emergency declaration but may be powerless to block it. Some Republicans are wary, too, fearing how a future Democratic president might use that authority. Such a move, should Trump ultimately go that route, would almost certainly be challenged in the courts.

Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., called Graham's idea to reopen the government a ""great place to start.""

""I do think if we reopen the government, if the president ends this shutdown crisis, we have folks who can negotiate a responsible, modern investment in technology that will actually make us safer,"" Coons said.

Trump says technology is nice, but that the border can't be secured without a wall.

The White House has been laying the groundwork for an emergency declaration, which is feared by lawmakers in both parties.

Senate Homeland Security Committee Chairman Ron Johnson, R-Wis., said he'd ""hate to see"" a declaration issued because the wall wouldn't get built, presumably because of legal challenges. Democrats voted in the past for border security and should again, he said.

Comment on this story

""I actually want to see this wall get built,"" Johnson said. ""I want to keep pressure on Democrats to actually come to the negotiating table in good faith and fund what they have supported in the past.""

Graham favors a declaration and said the time for talk is running out.

""It's the last option, not the first option, but we're pretty close to that being the only option,"" he said.

Graham and Coons spoke on ""Fox News Sunday"" and Johnson appeared on CNN's ""State of the Union.""

The women wing of All India Muslim Personal Law Board (AIMPLB) on Tuesday criticised the triple talaq Bill, which is likely to be tabled in Rajya Sabha on Wednesday, stating that the ""ill-drafted legislation gives a false sense of women empowerment"".

AIMPLB Women Wing chief organiser, Dr Asma Zohra, told ANI, ""We oppose and condemn the triple talaq Bill which is likely to be tabled for the second time in Rajya Sabha tomorrow (Wednesday). The ill-drafted bill may break marriages rather than empowering women. The government has not taken the stakeholders into consideration and brought this bill with communal intention. The marriage is a civil contract in Muslims and the bill is not going to help the Muslim women in any way.""

Zohra further criticised Prime Minister Narendra Modi for not replying to AIMPLB president Maulana Rabe Hasani Nadvi's letter regarding the loopholes in the bill. ""Rather than this bill, there are several burning issues in our country that seek attention. Unfortunately, the prime minister has no courtesy to reply to a letter from the representative of 20 crores Muslim population. The government cannot take us for granted. We just cannot sit idle when a fundamental right is infringed upon by some bill, we have a right to religious freedom that's why our voice needs to be heard,'' she said.

Rajasthan govt sets up panel to review decisions taken by previous BJP regime

The Rajasthan government on Tuesday appointed three cabinets and one inter-departmental committee of ministers and officials for various matters, including reviewing the decisions taken by the previous BJP government in the last six months.

Urban Development and Housing Minister Shanti Kumar Dhariwal will be the coordinator of the committee set up to review the decisions taken by the previous government, headed by Vasundhara Raje, in the last six months. Energy Minister BD Kalla and Food and Civil Supply Minister Ramesh Meena will be the members of the committee.

The inter-departmental committee of ministers and officers headed by Dhariwal will set the eligibility criteria of farmers claiming loan waivers, and also set the directions according to the loan waiver announcement. The committee will have six ministers as members, according to a release issued by the government on Tuesday night.

The other committees will look into the issues of contractual employees in the government and finalising the governor's speech in the upcoming Assembly session.

EU, US denounce Bangladesh election violence, irregularities

Western powers condemned election day violence in Bangladesh and described a range of other irregularities that marred a vote in which Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina's alliance secured more than 90 percent of parliamentary seats.

The strongly worded assessments of the election from the United States and European Union could hurt the image of Hasina, who has been in power since 2009 and also ruled from 1996-2001.

""Violence has marred the election day, and significant obstacles to a level playing field remained in place throughout the process and have tainted the electoral campaign and the vote,"" the EU said in a statement, calling for ""a proper examination of allegations of irregularities"".

The United States, Bangladesh's largest foreign investor, expressed concern about ""credible reports of harassment, intimidation, and violence in the pre-election period that made it difficult for many opposition candidates and their supporters to meet, hold rallies, and campaign freely.""

""We are also concerned that election-day irregularities prevented some people from voting, which undermined faith in the electoral process,"" it said.

PM to hold rallies in West Bengal amid uncertainty over BJP rath yatras

With its Bengal rath yatras stuck in legal tangles, the BJP's state unit is planning two to three rallies of Prime Minister Modi in January and February.

Ahead of the national polls, the BJP planned rath yatras that would have touched all 42 constituencies in the state. However, the saffron party's plans got stuck in legal battles after the state government denied permission.

""We are hopeful that the prime minister's first rally might take place on 29 January. We have sent the schedule to Delhi. Nothing has, however, been fixed so far,"" state BJP chief Dilip Ghosh said.

The prime minister's first rally is expected to be held at the Brigade Parade ground in the heart of Kolkata. Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee will also hold a rally at the same venue on 19 January, and has invited leaders of all Opposition parties in the country.

Trump seeks end to govt shutdown, calls for talks with Congress leaders

President Donald Trump on Tuesday invited Republican and Democratic leaders from Congress for a meeting to seek an end to the federal government shutdown now in its second week.

The two sides have been stuck in an impasse, with Trump's Democratic foes seeking a vote on spending bills to keep the government open -- without addressing the hot-button issue of border wall funding -- as soon as they take control of the House of Representatives, on Thursday. But the legislation's future appears uncertain, as it does not contain funding for a wall along the US-Mexico border, as demanded by Trump.

However, Trump appeared to strike a more conciliatory tone seeking to bring Democrats to the table after acerbic remarks over the weekend. ""Border Security and the Wall 'thing' and Shutdown is not where Nancy Pelosi wanted to start her tenure as Speaker! Let's make a deal?"" he tweeted.

US media reported the lawmakers were invited to a session at the White House, though it was unclear who would attend, and whether any Democrats would be present.

US fires tear gas across Mexico border to stop migrants

US authorities fired tear gas into Mexico during the first hours of the new year to repel about 150 migrants who tried to breach the border fence in Tijuana.

US Customs and Border Protection said in a statement later Tuesday that the gas was used to target rock throwers apart from the migrants who were trying to cross. ""No agents witnessed any of the migrants at the fence line, including children, experiencing effects of the chemical agents, which were targeted at the rock throwers further away,"" the statement said.

An Associated Press photographer saw at least three volleys of gas launched onto the Mexican side of the border near Tijuana's beach that affected the migrants, including women and children, as well as journalists.

The AP saw rocks thrown only after US agents fired the tear gas. The, US customs body, however, said that agents saw ""toddler sized children"" being passed over concertina wire with difficulty. It said its agents could not assist the children because of the rocks being thrown. Agents responded with smoke, pepper spray and tear gas, it said. The AP journalist also saw plastic pellets fired by US agents.

159,13 wthr indianapolis,https://www.wthr.com/article/latest-house-passes-bill-fund-agencies-amid-shutdown-1,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Latest on President Donald Trump and the partial government shutdown (all times local):

5:25 p.m.

The House has approved a bill to fund the Treasury Department, the IRS and other agencies for the next year as part of a Democratic strategy to reopen the government on a piecemeal basis.

The Democratic-controlled House voted 240-188 on Wednesday to approve the funding bill, which also would reopen the Federal Communications Commission, the Small Business Administration and the federal judiciary, among other agencies.

Eight Republicans joined 232 Democrats to support the bill.

House Appropriations Committee Chairwoman Nita Lowey says taxpayers rely on the IRS to assist them in filing taxes and financial planning but now ""don't have anyone they can turn to"" for answers.

The bill is unlikely to move forward in the Republican-controlled Senate, where Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has dismissed it as political theater.

Vice President Mike Pence says Democrats were ""unwilling to even negotiate"" an end to the partial government shutdown and the standoff over President Donald Trump's desire for a border barrier.

Pence spoke outside the West Wing after a contentious meeting Wednesday between Trump and congressional leaders.

Pence says, ""I think the president made his position very clear today that there will be no deal without a wall.""

Pence says Trump asked House Speaker Nancy Pelosi whether she would be willing to agree to funding for a wall or a barrier on the southern border if he re-opened the government quickly.

Pence says, ""When she said 'No,' the president said 'Goodbye.""

Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said Trump had a ""temper tantrum."" Pence says of the president, ""I don't recall him ever raising his voice.""

Top Democrats say President Donald Trump walked out of a meeting with congressional leaders as talks to end the partial government shutdown remain at an impasse.

Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said Trump asked House Speaker Nancy Pelosi at Wednesday's White House meeting whether she would agree to fund his wall.

When she said ""no,"" Schumer says, Trump got up and said, ""Then we have nothing to discuss."" Schumer says, ""And he just walked out.""

Schumer is calling Trump's actions ""really, really unfortunate.""

Trump is also weighing in on the meeting by tweet, calling it ""a total waste of time.""

He tweets that once Pelosi rejected his long-stalled border wall, he ""said bye-bye, nothing else works!""

Congressional leaders from both parties have returned to the White House for another round of negotiations with President Donald Trump on the ongoing partial government shutdown.

The two sides have made no apparent progress in the past week, with Trump sticking to his demand of $5.7 billion for a border barrier and Democrats insisting they won't give him the money.

Trump has been making a public case that there is a ""crisis"" at the southern border. And he's still threatening to declare a national emergency to circumvent Congress if he can't get the wall money from them.

He told reporters during a visit to the Capitol earlier Wednesday that he may turn to a declaration ""at some point"" if top Democrats Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi ""don't agree"" with his assessment about the problems at the border.

President Donald Trump says Republicans are ""totally unified"" in the shutdown standoff over his long-promised southern border wall, though some GOP lawmakers have been expressing concern about the 19-day partial government closure.

Trump traveled to Capitol Hill on Wednesday to meet with Senate Republicans. He says there was ""no discussion about anything other than solidarity.""

Trump has been considering a national emergency declaration to bypass Congress to build the wall. He says he ""may do that at some point"" if he can't get a deal with Democrats.

Trump also plans to meet with top congressional Democrats and Republicans at the White House on Wednesday.

President Donald Trump arrived on Capitol Hill claiming he has ""tremendous"" support as he headed into a meeting with Republican senators uneasy with the government shutdown over his border wall.

Asked how long the shutdown would last, Trump told reporters Wednesday ""whatever it takes.""

The partial shutdown is now in its 19th day, the second longest ever.

Trump and Vice President Mike Pence arrived for the private lunch meeting with the Senate GOP caucus to shore up support.

Several Republican senators have said the government should be re-opened while talks continue over border security and Trump's demand for money to build the wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.

President Donald Trump says he thinks he and the Democrats are ""getting closer"" to a deal to end the budget stalemate that has partially shut down the government despite no evidence that any progress has been made.

And he's suggesting the partial government shutdown could be ""a blessing in disguise"" because, he suggests, it could lead to a broader immigration deal.

Trump spoke Wednesday during an Oval Office bill signing on anti-human trafficking legislation. It's a day after he delivered a prime-time address trying to make the case for his long-stalled U.S.-Mexico border wall.

Trump says that he would like to see ""real immigration reform in this country because we need it."" He says, ""Everybody wants to see immigration reform,"" adding that perhaps the stalemate ""will turn out to be a blessing in disguise.""

Gone are the days when the U.S. and Mexican governments regularly exchanged statements over President Donald Trump's insistence on a border wall.

Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said Wednesday he won't be drawn into what he calls a U.S. internal dispute, an apparent reference to the 19-day-old partial U.S. government shutdown over a border barrier.

Lopez Obrador says, ""We are not going to respond to situations arising from internal affairs in the United States.""

Unlike his predecessor, the Mexican leader didn't have to respond to any specific aspersion about Mexico, because Trump didn't make any in his Tuesday night address to the American public. Relations between the two leaders have been surprisingly cordial, given their ideological differences.

Lopez Obrador said, ""Of course, there are those ... who want us to get into a confrontation. We always want a friendly relationship with the United States, a cooperative relationship.""

As a presidential candidate Trump promised Mexico would pay for a border wall, but Mexico refused.

President Donald Trump is using a bill signing focused on curbing human trafficking to push his case for a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border.

Trump says a southern border that is not secured exacerbates the incidents of human trafficking. He says, ""As long as we have a border that is not secure, we're going to suffer the consequences of that.""

Wednesday's bill signing came a day after Trump's prime-time speech designed to persuade Americans that illegal immigration and trafficking at the border are a crisis.

Democrats have called Trump's promised wall costly, ineffective and ""immoral"" and say he's ""manufacturing a crisis.""

The bill Trump signed is designed to enhance an annual State Department report that measures global efforts to eliminate human trafficking.

The White House says it's the fourth bipartisan bill the Republican president has signed in the last few weeks to prevent human trafficking.

Congressional Democrats say they'll head to the White House with the plan to reopen the government -- the same one they've been presenting. They're asking President Donald Trump to accept a bipartisan bill to fund border security without the wall.

Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Wednesday the president ""could end the Trump shutdown and re-open the government today, and he should.""

Pelosi and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer spoke at an event where they were flanked by federal workers going without pay during the shutdown, now in its 19th day.

Schumer called workers the ""collateral damage"" of Trump's ""temper tantrum."" He said the president failed to ""persuade a soul"" during his ""divisive"" prime-time address Tuesday night to the nation.

Trump meets with congressional leaders at the White House Wednesday afternoon. He rejected the Senate's bipartisan funding bill in December, sparking the shutdown.

The White House is trying to keep jittery congressional Republicans from defecting over the toll the partial government shutdown is taking in their states.

President Donald Trump and Democrats have been at an impasse over funding for his proposed border wall, which has led to a partial government shutdown, now in its 19th day.

Trump meets with Senate Republicans Wednesday on Capitol Hill just hours after he argued on national television that a border wall was needed to resolve a security and humanitarian ""crisis.""

Senators say the shutdown has led to disruptions in agricultural payments for farmers, as well as for home buyers trying to secure government-backed home loans. Lawmakers also are worried about missed paychecks for government workers Friday.

As many as half a dozen GOP senators have said the government should reopen while border security negotiations with Democrats continue.

President Donald Trump again linked illegal immigration along the southern border with drugs and violent crime as he urged Democratic lawmakers to fund his proposed border wall.

In his first national address from the Oval Office, the president gave no indication he was softening his stance that the partial government shutdown would continue without money for the wall.

Trump argued Tuesday night that the wall was needed to resolve what he called a security and humanitarian ""crisis.""

He addressed the nation as the shutdown stretched through its third week, with hundreds of thousands of federal workers going without pay and some congressional Republicans growing increasingly jittery about the impasse.

Trump plans to visit Senate Republicans at the Capitol on Wednesday before meeting with Democratic leaders at the White House."

One pundit describes the national parks as like the Wild West: heavily populated and thinly-policed.

National parks, national monuments, Washington's National Mall, and other federally-managed public spaces are overflowing with trash thanks to the government shutdown, Business Insider is reporting.

With the federal government unable to operate in the absence of a budget, that means that ""non-essential"" government employees are furloughed unless and until Congress and the president come to an agreement on a budget. That seems unlikelier by the day, as the two parties appear no closer to coming to an agreement over the $5 billion Donald Trump wants in the budget to fund his proposed border wall.

And with a new, Democratic-controlled House of Representatives due to convene this week, Trump is even less likely to get his border wall, meaning the shutdown likely has no end in sight.

Unfortunately, the ""non-essential"" government employees who are laid off include the maintenance workers, security personnel, custodians, and other people who keep America's public spaces spic & span and with functioning toilets stocked with toilet paper.

In Washington, as WUSA-TV (Washington, D.C.) reports, the National Mall is so littered with trash that reporter Evan Koslof, who went out to inspect the mess for himself, was told by a Texas visitor that the National Mall is more like a ""national disgrace.""

However, in what will be a theme repeated throughout this article, someone else is stepping in: D.C.'s Department of Public Works will collect the trash from federal spaces until the shutdown is over.

Over at California's Yosemite National Park, trash is indeed a problem, as this Twitter user showed in the photo below.

There's another problem as well: poop. As reported by the Inquisitr, with no one to manage the park's toilets, most are overflowing or locked. That means visitors have been doing their business on the side of the road. To stem the tide, however minimally, volunteers have been picking up trash, supplying toilet paper, and doing what they can.

And then there's the problem of lawlessness. As the Washington Post reports, in the absence of security, the campgrounds in the national parks are basically the Wild West. So far, there don't appear to be any reports of rampant crime at national park campgrounds, but at Antietam National Battlefield in Maryland, visitors are warned to ""use extreme caution if choosing to enter.""

Meanwhile, another stately national institution, the Smithsonian, remains open, for now. That's because private funding was secured to keep it open. Unfortunately, that private money is due to dry up soon, meaning that the museums and the National Zoo will soon be closed as well."

The weeks-old stand-off over funding led to the partial government shutdown that hit day 23 on Sunday without an end in sight.

One Republican senator says he's offered President Donald Trump a possible solution, though it may just be wishful thinking.

Sen. Lindsey Graham is encouraging Trump to reopen government for several weeks to continue negotiating with Democrats over the border wall Trump wants to build on the U.S.-Mexico border. If there's no deal at the end of that time, Graham says Trump would be free to take the more dramatic step of declaring a national emergency to build it.

163,the kansas city star,https://www.kansascity.com/news/nation-world/article223193915.html,"White House digs in on border wall demand, risking shutdown

WASHINGTON (AP) -- The White House on Sunday pushed the federal government closer to the brink of a partial shutdown later this week, digging in on its demand for $5 billion to build a border wall as congressional Democrats stood firm against it.

""We're going to do whatever is necessary to build the border wall to stop this ongoing crisis of illegal immigration,"" said White House senior adviser Stephen Miller.

Asked if that meant having a government shutdown, he said: ""If it comes to it, absolutely.""

Trump said last week he would be ""proud"" to have a shutdown to get Congress to approve a $5 billion down payment to fulfill his campaign promise to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. But the president doesn't have the votes from the Republican-controlled Congress to support funding for the wall at that level.

Democratic congressional leaders, Sen. Chuck Schumer and Rep. Nancy Pelosi, have proposed no more than $1.6 billion, as outlined in a bipartisan Senate bill. The money would not go for the wall but for fencing upgrades and other border security. Democrats also offered to simply keep funding at its current level, $1.3 billion.

Trump lawyer Giuliani rules out Mueller interview with Trump

WASHINGTON (AP) -- With a number of probes moving closer to the Oval Office, President Donald Trump and his attorney unleashed a fresh series of attacks on the investigators, questioning their integrity while categorically ruling out the possibility of a presidential interview with the special counsel.

Trump and Rudy Giuliani used Twitter and television interviews Sunday to deliver a series of broadsides against special counsel Robert Mueller and federal prosecutors in New York. Giuliani said he was ""disgusted"" by the tactics used by Mueller in his probe into Russian election interference, including in securing guilty pleas from the president's former national security adviser Michael Flynn on a charge of lying to federal investigators.

Trump, Giuliani said, would not submit to an interview by Mueller's team.

""They're a joke,"" Giuliani told ""Fox News Sunday."" ''Over my dead body, but, you know, I could be dead.""

The special counsel, who is investigating possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russia, has continued to request an interview with the president. Last month, the White House sent written answers in response to the special counsel's questions about possible collusion. The White House has resisted answering questions on possible obstruction of justice.

Child's death highlights communication barriers on border

Shortly before a 7-year-old Guatemalan girl died in U.S. custody, her father signed a form stating that his daughter was in good health. But it's unclear how much the man understood on the form, which was written in English and read to him in Spanish by Border Patrol agents.

The death of Jakelin Caal highlights the communication challenges along the U.S.-Mexico border as agents come in contact with an increasing number of migrants who speak neither English nor Spanish.

Her father's native language is the Mayan tongue known as Q'eqchi'. His second language is Spanish. It's unclear whether something was lost in translation or whether it would have made a difference in saving Jakelin after the two were detained and underwent a health screening along a remote stretch of U.S.-Mexico border. But the case raises questions about the Border Patrol's use of English-only forms.

All agents are required to speak Spanish, and they receive formal Spanish training. Reading forms in Spanish is often enough to pose basic questions. But some other Spanish-speaking migrants reported signing paperwork that they later said they did not understand.

Scores of immigrant parents who were separated from their children after crossing the border in the spring said they signed forms agreeing to be deported with the understanding that their kids would be returning with them, only to find themselves deported without them. Many had to wait months before being reunited with them in their homelands.

Talks adopt 'rulebook' to put Paris climate deal into action

KATOWICE, Poland (AP) -- Almost 200 nations, including the world's top greenhouse gas producers, China and the United States, have adopted a set of rules meant to breathe life into the 2015 Paris climate accord by setting out how countries should report their emissions and efforts to reduce them.

But negotiators delayed other key decisions until next year -- a move that frustrated environmentalists and countries that wanted more ambitious goals in light of scientists' warnings that the world must shift sharply away from fossil fuels in the coming decade.

""The majority of the rulebook for the Paris agreement has been created, which is something to be thankful for,"" said Mohamed Adow, a climate policy expert at Christian Aid. ""But the fact countries had to be dragged kicking and screaming to the finish line shows that some nations have not woken up"" to the dire consequences of global warming as outlined in a report by the U.N Panel on Climate Change, or IPCC.

Officials at the talks, which ended late Saturday in the Polish city of Katowice, agreed upon universal rules on how nations can cut emissions. Poor countries secured assurances on financial support to help them reduce emissions, adapt to changes such as rising sea levels and pay for damage that has already happened.

""Through this package, you have made a thousand little steps forward together,"" said Michal Kurtyka, a senior Polish official who led the talks.

French city honors victims of Christmas market attack

PARIS (AP) -- People filled a square in the French city of Strasbourg on Sunday to show respect and sympathy for the victims of last week's shooting attack near a famous Christmas market as the death toll rose to five.

French authorities said a Polish man died in a Strasbourg hospital Sunday, one of a dozen people wounded in last Tuesday's attack. Poland's Foreign Ministry extended condolences Sunday on Twitter to his family.

According to the newspaper DNA, more than 1,000 people attended the memorial, which ended with a minute of applause and a rendition of France's national anthem, ""La Marseillaise.""

The hour-long ceremony took place in Kleber Square, not far from where a gunman opened fire on Tuesday evening. Strasbourg Mayor Roland Ries praised the city's resilience in the face of hardship.

The ""extremely large crowd in the Christmas market"" on Saturday ""was an illustration of our commitment to these values ??on which our living together is based, which we will continue to defend against all those who want to attack it,"" Ries said.

Not into bingo, 84-year-old Texas woman gets college degree

RICHARDSON, Texas (AP) -- After raising five kids and retiring at age 77 from her secretarial job, Janet Fein couldn't be blamed for finally relaxing, but that's not her.

Fein, now 84, went to back to school and will accomplish a long-held goal this week when she graduates from the University of Texas at Dallas with a bachelor's degree.

""I didn't have anything to do in retirement and I didn't think that playing bingo was up to my speed,"" said Fein, who majored in sociology because she felt it was ""substantial.""

She said she enjoyed all the reading and writing papers. ""With each class I already knew a lot, but then I also learned a lot. And that made me happy,"" she said.

People 65 and older make up less than one percent of U.S. college students. In 2015, they accounted for about 67,000 of about 20 million college students, according to the National Center for Education Statistics.

Next-generation of GPS satellites are headed to space

DENVER (AP) -- After months of delays, the U.S. Air Force is about to launch the first of a new generation of GPS satellites, designed to be more accurate, secure and versatile.

But some of their most highly touted features will not be fully available until 2022 or later because of problems in a companion program to develop a new ground control system for the satellites, government auditors said.

The satellite is scheduled to lift off Tuesday from Cape Canaveral, Florida, aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. It's the first of 32 planned GPS III satellites that will replace older ones now in orbit. Lockheed Martin is building the new satellites outside Denver.

GPS is best-known for its widespread civilian applications, from navigation to time-stamping bank transactions. The Air Force estimates that 4 billion people worldwide use the system.

But it was developed by the U.S. military, which still designs, launches and operates the system. The Air Force controls a constellation of 31 GPS satellites from a high-security complex at Schriever Air Force Base outside Colorado Springs.

After fraud probe, new primary may replace GOP candidate

RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- Legislation quickly passed by North Carolina's lawmakers this week would prepare a path for Republicans to dump their nominee in a still-undecided U.S. House race marred with ballot fraud allegations.

""I think (legislators are) worried that Mark Harris might be damaged goods and they want to have the opportunity to have a different Republican nominee,"" said Carter Wrenn, a Republican operative and consultant to former U.S. Sen. Jesse Helms and others for more than 40 years. ""That's how I read those tea leaves.""

If the state elections board decides ballot irregularities or other problems cast the true outcome into doubt and force a redo, the legislation -- if allowed to go into law by Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper -- would require new primary elections in the 9th Congressional District race, in addition to a new general election.

That would allow Republicans another look at Mark Harris, the Republican who led Democrat Dan McCready by 905 votes in unofficial results. Harris hasn't been certified the winner, and an investigation is looking into missing absentee ballots in rural Bladen County and whether unsealed ballots illegally handled by collection teams there could have been altered.

Bladen was the only county among the eight within the 9th District where Harris won a majority of mail-in absentee ballots over McCready.

Top of mind: 'Justice' is Merriam-Webster's word of the year

NEW YORK (AP) -- Racial justice. Obstruction of justice. Social justice. The Justice Department. Merriam-Webster has chosen ""justice"" as its 2018 word of the year, driven by the churning news cycle over months and months.

The word follows ""toxic,"" picked by Oxford Dictionaries, and ""misinformation,"" plucked by Dictonary.com.

Peter Sokolowski, Merriam-Webster's editor at large, told The Associated Press ahead of Monday's announcement that ""justice"" consistently bubbled into the top 20 or 30 lookups on the company's website, spiking at times due to specific events but also skating close to the surface for much of the year.

While it's one of those common words people likely know how to spell and use correctly in a sentence, Sokolowski pointed to other reasons that drive search traffic. Among them is an attempt to focus a train of thought around a philosophical problem, or to seek aspirational motivation. Such well-known words are often among the most looked up every year, including those that are slightly abstract, including ""love,"" he said.

The designation for ""justice"" came soon after President Trump's one-time fixer, Michael Cohen, was sentenced to three years in prison for crimes that included arranging the payment of hush money to conceal his boss' alleged sexual affairs. He told a judge he agreed time and again to cover up Trump's ""dirty deeds"" out of ""blind loyalty.""

'Spider-Verse' swings to the top; 'Mortal Engines' tanks

LOS ANGELES (AP) -- ""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse"" swung to the top of the domestic box office in its first weekend in theaters, proving that there is widespread audience interest in big screen animated versions of Marvel's marquee superheroes.

The film led a host of newcomers that debuted to varying success on this pre-Christmas holiday weekend, including Clint Eastwood's drug smuggling drama ""The Mule"" and the Peter Jackson-produced epic ""Mortal Engines"" which bombed in North American theaters.

""Into the Spider-Verse"" earned an estimated $35.4 million from 3,813 theaters against a $90 million production budget according to Sony Pictures on Sunday, which is a record for animated movies in December (although the hybrid ""Alvin and the Chipmunks"" movies were higher). The film features an innovative animation style -- both CGI and hand-drawn -- and focuses on the Miles Morales character as he learns to become the famed web-slinger. It's another financial win for the studio's latest ""expanded Spider-Man universe"" strategy following ""Venom"" and ""Spider-Man: Homecoming.""

And ""Spider-Verse"" has been very well-received among critics, and audiences in exit surveys gave it a rare A+ CinemaScore -- a first for a Spider-Man film. It's also been nominated for a Golden Globe award for best animated feature and picked up a few honors from critics' groups as well, including the New York Film Critics Circle.

""We are playing to both families and fanboys. We're an all-audience film,"" said Adrian Smith, Sony's president of domestic distribution."
164,washington examiner,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/washington-secrets/maga-list-205-historic-results-help-trump-make-case-for-2020-reelection,"At two years into his first term, President Trump and his top White House team are turning to the 2020 reelection campaign with a new focus on the 2016 promises they have kept and the impact they have had around the country and on the world stage.

""Together, we are building a safe, strong, and proud America,"" said Trump in his new list of ""historic results,"" provided exclusively to Washington Secrets.

It highlights 14 major issue areas and lists 205 accomplishment points and initiatives all aimed at bolstering the president's statements and tweets that his has been a successful administration despite the recent stock market volatility, his staff shake-ups and the Russia election probe.

The document outlines a 2020 platform to run on and is a revision of previous formats. Instead of just listing ""accomplishments,"" for example, there is more perspective on changes that have helped ordinary Americans.

It also highlights key areas, such as immigration, that he played up in the 2018 congressional midterm elections. While he helped candidates he campaigned for, some analysts have criticized his focus as the reason the GOP lost control of the House.

The administration's refocus has support among those who believe the campaign criticism is wrong, including GOP pollsters John McLaughlin and Jim McLaughlin.

Armed with new polling that shows Republicans erred in refusing to follow the president's model, driving away some 12 million 2016 Trump voters, the duo are urging critics in the party to stand down and let Trump dictate the 2020 messaging.

""He understands branding and he understands messaging better than anyone,"" said John McLaughlin.

While still long, the new list goes to the Trump campaign's 2020 theme of ""Keeping America Great"" and McLaughlin's argument that Republican president win on two issues, peace and prosperity.

If Trump sticks to those key issues, and bumps his approval rating from 48 percent to 51 percent, like former Presidents Obama and George W. Bush did before their reelections, he ""will win,"" added the pollster.

The list reinforces the president's 2016 applause lines of promising to fix broken trade accords, kill costly regulations and boost energy production. ""Unleashing American Energy: President Trump is rolling back costly and burdensome regulations to unleash America's incredible energy resources,"" said one category that included 15 highlights, several of which noted moves to reverse Obama-era regulations.

Those topics, along with these others, said a Trump adviser, will become the basis of the 2020 campaign report card: Ending Obamacare, stopping opioid abuse, protecting religious liberty, cutting crime, rebuilding the military and helping vets, and tacking worldwide bullies like North Korea.

The New York Times on a judge's rebuke of Michael Flynn and President Donald Trump's charitable foundation:

A bit of common sense and common decency intruded on Tuesday into the crazy world of Donald Trump.

In New York, the state attorney general announced that the president had agreed that the ""charity"" he used as a piggy bank has no reason to exist.

In Washington, a federal judge let a former top presidential aide know that you can parrot political spin or you can tell the truth, but you can't do both to someone who can send you to prison.

Michael Flynn, Mr. Trump's former national security adviser, appeared before Judge Emmet Sullivan to be sentenced to what he expected would be a term of probation, after pleading guilty to lying to federal investigators about conversations with the Russian ambassador. The office of the special counsel, Robert Mueller, had earlier filed a memo that said it would be right for Mr. Flynn to avoid prison after his extensive cooperation in the investigation of Trump ties to Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential campaign and after.

Then last week, in a memo about their client's sentencing, Mr. Flynn's lawyers implied that he had been tricked into lying and that the F.B.I. acted improperly in interviewing him -- points raised by pro-Trump commentators elaborating on the president's claims of being victimized by a witch hunt.

Judge Sullivan was having none of it.

""I cannot recall an instance of a court ever accepting a guilty plea from someone who did not maintain he was guilty,"" Judge Sullivan said, ""and I do not intend to start today.""

Chastened, Mr. Flynn told the judge that nobody tricked him, that he lied and that he knew he shouldn't have.

The judge was not upset only about Mr. Flynn's sneaky prevarication. He said he felt ""disgust"" at Mr. Flynn's offenses, that a retired three-star general would lie to the F.B.I. ""while on the physical premises of the White House,"" and, acting as an unregistered agent of a foreign country, Turkey, while he was an adviser to Mr. Trump (to which he admitted but was not charged). It was a bracing reminder of the brazenness of his misdeeds and of the standards the public should be able to expect of those who serve them.

Realizing that Judge Sullivan was considering a term of up to six months in prison, Mr. Flynn accepted his offer to delay the sentencing for 90 days until he has completed his cooperation with the special counsel.

""Good luck today in court to General Michael Flynn,"" Mr. Trump had tweeted first thing Tuesday morning.

""Thanks for nothing, Mr. President,"" Mr. Flynn might have thought as he left court.

Mr. Flynn should be grateful the judge offered him the chance to come clean. By contrast, the Donald J. Trump Foundation, a charity that provided no charity, quite properly received none from the New York attorney general's office.

Attorney General Barbara Underwood accused it of ""a shocking pattern of illegality"" that ""amounted to the Trump Foundation functioning as little more than a checkbook to serve Mr. Trump's business and political interests.""

Whatever money that remains will be disbursed under the supervision of Ms. Underwood's office and the judge overseeing the continuing lawsuit her office filed in June, seeking $2.8 million in restitution and a ban on Mr. Trump and his three oldest children serving on the boards of other nonprofit organizations.

In a series of stories exposing the foundation's true nature, The Washington Post found that its largest donation was to fix a fountain in front of the Plaza Hotel in Manhattan, which Mr. Trump owned at the time, that its funds were used to buy a portrait of Mr. Trump, and that it illegally provided political donations and paid for personal legal settlements.

All this comes just days after prosecutors announced that they believed that Mr. Trump had conspired with the owner of The National Enquirer and his fixer Michael Cohen to violate campaign finance laws by paying hush money to two women who said they had affairs with him. It's also just been reported that prosecutors are investigating spending by the Trump inaugural committee. The president still faces lawsuits on the constitutionality of his enriching himself while in office. Meanwhile, the special counsel's inquiry may be expanding rather than winding down.

It's fitting that despite all his bluster and threats, a president who's demonstrated such contempt for the rule of law is finding it so formidable.

That this goes to the essence of American governance was best summed up by Paula Duncan, the Trump enthusiast who was among the jurors who found Mr. Trump's former campaign chief Paul Manafort guilty of fraud, even though she had hoped he wouldn't be convicted.

Explaining her decision after the verdict, she told Fox News, ""No one's above the law.""

The Wall Street Journal on a judge's ruling on the Affordable Care Act's individual mandate:

No one opposes ObamaCare more than we do, and Democrats are now confirming that it was designed as a way-station to government-run health care. But a federal judge's ruling that the law is unconstitutional is likely to be overturned on appeal and may boomerang politically on Republicans.

Judge Reed O'Connor ruled for some 20 state plaintiffs that the Affordable Care Act's individual mandate is no longer legal because Republicans repealed its financial penalty as part of the 2017 tax reform. Recall that Chief Justice John Roberts joined four Justices to say ObamaCare's mandate was illegal as a command to individuals to buy insurance under the Commerce Clause. ""The Framers gave Congress the power to regulate commerce, not to compel it,"" he wrote.

Yet the Chief famously salvaged ObamaCare by unilaterally rewriting the mandate to be a ""tax"" that was within Congress's power. Never mind that Democrats had expressly said the penalty was not a tax. Majority Leader Roberts declared it to be so.

Enter Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, who argues in Texas v. U.S. that since Congress has repealed the mandate, the tax is no longer a tax, and ObamaCare is thus illegal. Judge O'Connor agreed with that logic, and he went further in ruling that since Congress said the mandate is crucial to the structure of ObamaCare, then all of ObamaCare must fall along with the mandate.

We'll admit to a certain satisfaction in seeing the Chief Justice hoist on his own logic. But his ruling in NFIB v. Sebelius was in 2012 and there is more at issue legally now than the ""tax"" issue in that opinion. One legal complication is that Congress in 2017 repealed the financial part of the individual mandate, not the structure of the mandate itself. Republicans used budget rules to pass tax reform so they couldn't repeal the mandate's express language.

The Affordable Care Act has also been up and running since 2014, which means so-called reliance interests come into play when considering a precedent. Millions of people now rely on ObamaCare's subsidies and rules, which argues against judges repealing the law by fiat.

Judge O'Connor breezes past this like a liberal Ninth Circuit appeals judge handling a Donald Trump appeal. He's right that Democrats claimed the individual mandate was essential to the Affordable Care Act. But when Congress killed the financial penalty in 2017 it left the rest of ObamaCare intact. When judging congressional intent, a judge must account for the amending Congress as well as the original Congress.

In any case, the Supreme Court's ""severability"" doctrine calls for restraint in declaring an entire law illegal merely because one part of it is. Our guess is that even the right-leaning Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals judges will overturn Judge O'Connor on this point.

As for the politics, Democrats claim to be alarmed by the ruling but the truth is they're elated. They want to use it to further pound Republicans for denying health insurance for pre-existing conditions if the law is overturned. Democrats campaigned across the country against Mr. Paxton's lawsuit to gain House and Senate seats in November, and they will now press votes in Congress so they can compound the gains in 2020.

President Trump hailed the ruling in a tweet, but he has never understood the Affordable Care Act. His Administration has done good work revising regulations to reduce health-care costs and increase access, but the risk is that the lawsuit will cause Republicans in Congress to panic politically and strike a deal with Democrats that reinforces ObamaCare. This is what happens when conservatives fall into the liberal trap of thinking they can use the courts to achieve policy goals that need to be won in Congress.

The Washington Post on withdrawing all 2,000 U.S. troops out of Syria:

PRESIDENT TRUMP'S sudden move to yank U.S. troops out of Syria undermined at a stroke several foreign policy goals he has championed. The president promised to finish the job of destroying the Islamic State, but the withdrawal will leave thousands of its fighters still in place. He vowed to roll back Iran's aggression across the Middle East, but his decision will allow its forces to entrench in the country that is the keystone of Tehran's ambitions. He promised to protect Israel, but that nation will now be left to face alone the buildup by Iran and its proxies along its northern border.

The president's top national security advisers had carefully developed and articulated a strategy of maintaining a U.S. presence in Syria until the Islamic State was beyond revival and Iran withdrew its forces -- a plan they were defending up until this week. Mr. Trump has again demonstrated, to them and to the world, that no U.S. policy or foreign commitment is immune from his whims.

Mr. Trump claimed the Islamic State had been defeated, but that is not the view of the Defense and State Departments. Thousands of jihadist fighters are still in Syria and control splotches of territory in the Euphrates Valley. A U.S. withdrawal will give the extremists an opportunity to reconstitute, as they did in Iraq following the premature U.S. withdrawal ordered by President Barack Obama.

Until Wednesday, a prime talking point of senior national security officials was that, ""if we've learned one thing over the years, (the) enduring defeat of a group like this means you can't just defeat their physical space and then leave,"" as the State Department's special envoy for the global campaign against the Islamic State, Brett McGurk, put it last week. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said it another way in September: ""Getting rid of the caliphate doesn't mean you then blindly say, 'Okay, we got rid of it,' march out, and then wonder why the caliphate comes back.""

Mr. Trump has justified some of his most controversial decisions, including his continued support for Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, as needed to contain Iran's threat to the United States and its allies. But the Syrian withdrawal hands Tehran and its ally Russia a windfall. Iran has deployed thousands of fighters and allied militiamen to Syria and aspires to create a corridor to Lebanon and the Mediterranean, as well as a new front against Israel along the Golan Heights. In reaction to that threat, Mr. Trump's national security adviser, John Bolton, announced Sept. 24 that ""We're not going to leave (Syria) as long as Iranian troops are outside Iranian borders, and that includes Iranian proxies and militias.""

U.S. ambitions in Syria have never been backed by adequate resources, and a case could be made that neither Congress nor the American public were prepared to support the mission suggested by Mr. Bolton. But Mr. Trump's decision appears to have been precipitated by the bellicose rhetoric of Turkey's Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who last week threatened -- not for the first time -- a military operation against Syrian Kurds, even though U.S. troops are positioned around them. The autocratic Turkish ruler appears to have extracted multiple favors from Mr. Trump in recent days, including the sale of U.S. Patriot missiles and a promise to reexamine the possible extradition of his rival, Fethullah Gulen, from Pennsylvania. If Mr. Trump received anything in return, he hasn't disclosed it.

The Syrian Kurdish forces, which have fought alongside the United States and played a crucial role in liberating most of eastern Syria from the jihadists, will be perhaps the foremost victims of Mr. Trump's decision. Betrayed by Washington, they will now be subject to a military offensive by Turkey. The stab in the back will send an unforgettable message to all who are asked to cooperate with the United States in the fight against terrorism: Washington is an unreliable and dangerous partner.

The Orange County (California) Register on Mick Mulvaney as Trump's choice for chief of staff:

President Trump has found a new chief of staff, albeit an interim one, in his director of the Office of Management and Budget, Mick Mulvaney.

That of chief is a terribly important post, perhaps government's most consequential aside from that of his boss. In theory, at least, the chief of staff is the gatekeeper for everything the president does, everyone he sees, everyone he talks to on the phone.

Perhaps, though few would expect this to be the case, the arbiter of every time he sends out a tweet, and of what it should say.

A Washington insider, a former congressman, Mulvaney is in many ways ideal for the job. He wants it, badly, whereas others with similarly impressive resumes touted for the job have indicated a strong desire to spend more time with their families, from Vice President Pence's staff chief Nick Ayers of Georgia to former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie.

Mulvaney shares the conservative values currently espoused by the president and was a founder of the House Freedom Caucus in 2013, the group that always taunted the Republican leadership, opposing much government funding, including debt limit increases and budget agreements made with the Democrats.

But he also, after Trump secured the Republican nomination in 2016, called the candidate ""a terrible human being"" who he only was voting for out of an even greater dislike of Hillary Clinton.

It's not as if other presidential allies of today haven't said bad things about him in the past. On the campaign trail, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz called his rival ""a narcissist at a level I don't think this country's ever seen,"" for instance.

But if you were the nation's chief executive -- or the CEO of a much smaller entity, for that matter -- could you hire as your top aide and work with a person who had once dubbed you ""terrible""?

Or does this kind of talk come with the territory in politics, where many strange bedfellows are made because of having to run in elections against once and perhaps future allies? Should Trump indeed elevate this practical choice for staff chief to permanent status immediately?

Los Angeles Times on banning bump stocks, which allow semi-automatic weapons to fire like machine guns:

The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives said Tuesday that it had finalized a rule reclassifying so-called bump stocks -- the devices that can make a semiautomatic rifle fire nearly as quickly a fully automatic weapon -- as machine guns, which makes it illegal to manufacture, sell or possess them. The agency said a year ago it had the authority to reclassify the devices, and President Trump -- in the wake of the Parkland, Fla., school shooting -- directed the ATF to speed up the process. Tuesday's announcement -- a rare bit of welcome news from the Trump administration -- makes it official; White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters that owners of the conversion devices will have until March 21 to destroy them or turn them in to the ATF.

This is a good step. Unfortunately, it's all but certain to be challenged in the courts, and it's on shaky legal ground because of the way the new rule evolved. The Obama administration determined that because bump stocks have ""no automatically functioning mechanical parts and (perform) no automated mechanical functions when installed,"" they did not fit the definition of a machine gun in federal law, which meant the ATF lacked the authority to regulate them. Tuesday's announcement, by contrast, hinges not on the technical specifications, but on the functionality. In essence, if it fires like a machine gun, it's a machine gun. Cue the lawyers.

We hope the administration prevails in whatever challenges emerge, but the sure-fire way to resolve this would be for Congress to legislate bump stocks and related gadgets out of existence. Such devices serve no function other than to evade the strict congressional limit on machine guns by, as the ATF said, harnessing ""the recoil energy of the semiautomatic firearm in a manner that allows the trigger to reset and continue firing"" without the shooter having to pull the trigger for each shot.

A mass shooter in Las Vegas used bump stocks affixed to semiautomatic rifles to fire more than 1,000 rounds in a matter of minutes from a 32nd-floor suite of the Mandalay Bay Hotel into a crowd of some 20,000 people, killing 58 concertgoers and injuring hundreds of others. It was the largest single mass shooting in the modern era, drawing attention to bump stocks and sparking outraged demands by many -- the Los Angeles Times included -- that the devices be banned.

As welcome as this new rule is, it will do little to corral our national problem with gun violence. The vast majority of gun deaths come in ones and twos, led by suicides. ...

But it is progress. And the president deserves credit for sticking with his promise to find a way to ban bump stocks. ...

China Daily says telecommunications giant Huawei is a victim of U.S. panic attacks:

This year has not been an annus mirabilis for China's Huawei Technologies Ltd, the world's largest supplier of telecommunications network equipment and second-biggest maker of smartphones.

Although it has been constantly in the news and it is said there is no such thing as bad publicity, it has been making headlines because of the spurious claims it somehow poses a threat to the West, even world peace. It has never been explained exactly how.

In fact it is not because of anything it has done, but because its success has brought it into the crosshairs of the United States' anxiety attacks against China.

Huawei is at the forefront of 5G technology. This latest generation mobile network technology promises to bring the much anticipated and heralded internet of things to life and the US is determined to be the 5G leader.

Not only because whichever country develops the technology that is adopted as standard will have a huge commercial advantage. But also because by setting the standard it will have a knowledge advantage.

As a result, first the US and then one after another its most obedient allies have blocked Huawei from entering their 5G markets on security grounds.

None of them have offered any specific justification for blocking Huawei. They just repeat their claim that the company poses a security risk. That is why objective observers have concluded that those countries are politicizing a commercial issue.

It sets a harmful precedent. What if other countries used the same excuse to block US companies (not confined to the telecom sector)? The US companies are very competitive in many fields, including those that could pose huge security risks, such as finance.

While Huawei will not go unscathed from being prevented from entering key markets, as a competitive player, it still has a vast market to access in other parts of the world. It has signed contracts to supply 5G equipment to 25 telecom carriers, and more than 10,000 5G base stations have been shipped.

In stark contrast to the US and its allies, India for instance, has invited Huawei to conduct 5G trials in the country and complimented it on the role it has played in helping to develop its telecom industry.

The efforts of the US and its allies to try to shield their companies against a Chinese competitor are politically motivated, not the result of a fact-based or transparent decision-making process. And they are counterproductive to the concerted efforts that are needed to ensure the security of 5G networks."
166,yeni şafak,https://www.yenisafak.com/en/world/us-government-shutdown-drags-into-fourth-week-amid-stalemate-3471749,"A partial government shutdown entered its 24th day on Monday as talks between U.S. President Donald Trump and congressional Democrats remained stalled even as some of Trump's fellow Republicans called on the president to cut a deal and strains mounted nationwide.

Trump appeared unmoved to act, however, retweeting criticism of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer that urged the top Democratic leaders to negotiate with him over funding for his long-promised wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.

""I've been waiting all weekend. Democrats must get to work now. Border must be secured!"" Trump wrote in an early morning Tweet on Monday.

Democrats have rejected Trump's demand for $5.7 billion for the border wall in addition to other border funds but have said they would support $1.3 billion to bolster border security, including beefing up the number of Border Patrol agents and increasing surveillance.

About one-quarter of the U.S. government shut down last month as Republicans controlled both chambers of Congress as well as the White House. Trump must now win concessions from the Democrats, who took over the U.S. House of Representatives this month following November's elections. He must also win over enough Senate Democrats to secure the 60 votes needed to pass funding legislation there.

The stress from the shutdown became more visible as 800,000 federal employees across the United States missed their first paychecks on Friday. The cut government services also affected travelers as a jump in unscheduled absences among federal airport security screeners forced closures in Houston and Miami airports.

Republican U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham, who last week had called on Trump to declare a national emergency as a way to get money to build his wall, on Sunday urged the president to instead reopen the government for a short period of time in an effort to restart talks before taking such action.

Declaring a national emergency over ongoing immigration issues is fiercely opposed by Democrats and remains unpopular with some other Republicans. It would also likely face an immediate legal challenge.

Trump had said in a televised meeting with Pelosi and Schumer that he would be ""proud"" to shut down the government but has since blamed the Democrats, reportedly storming out of a White House meeting with them last week.

""Nancy and Cryin' Chuck can end the Shutdown in 15 minutes. At this point it has become their, and the Democrats, fault!"" he tweeted on Monday.

Representatives for Pelosi and Schumer could not be immediately reached for comment on Monday.

U.S. Senator Chris Coons on Monday reiterated fellow Democrats' call for Trump to reopen the government while negotiations over the wall and larger immigration issues continue.

He acknowledged efforts by Graham and other Republicans to forge a temporary solution but said Trump has been unpredictable even among fellow conservatives and keeps shifting positions.

""Every time they make progress, the president throws cold water on it,"" Coons told CNN in an interview."
167,the kansas city star,https://www.kansascity.com/latest-news/article223310670.html,"Don't answer that question ""No"" without visiting the fundraiser site first.

As President Donald Trump is said to be mulling ""other options"" for funding his border wall between the U.S. and Mexico, according to the Associated Press, a dark horse arises on the internet.

A GoFundMe campaign popped up Sunday, hoping to raise funds for Trump's proposed wall between the U.S. and Mexico, which isn't news in and of itself. There are plenty of those around.

But the organizers of this campaign are so encouraged that they've raised more-than $700,000 in just three days that they've bumped their original goal of $200 million up to a cool billion.

The GoFundMe organizer is listed as triple-amputee Air Force veteran Brian Kolfage, who lost both legs and his right arm in a blast at Balad Air Force Base in Iraq in 2004, according to the Arizona Daily Star.

The contact listing for the organizer says ""The Wall Funding Team"" is located in Miramar, Fla.

""As a veteran who has given so much, 3 limbs, I feel deeply invested to this nation to ensure future generations have everything we have today,"" Kolfage wrote in the GoFundMe campaign description. ""Too many Americans have been murdered by illegal aliens and too many illegals are taking advantage of the United States taxpayers with no means of ever contributing to our society.

""I have grandparents who immigrated to America legally, they did it the correct way and it's time we uphold our laws, and get this wall BUILT! It's up to Americans to help out and pitch in to get this project rolling.""

Multiple studies and reports have shown, though, that illegal immigrants commit crime, violent or nonviolent, at lesser rates than do native-born Americans.

Kolfage's GoFundMe campaign was listed as the ""Top fundraiser"" on the front page of the crowd-sourced social fundraising website as of Wednesday afternoon, despite Kolfage's claims that the platform was trying to hide his fundraiser from potential donors.

Kolfage's Facebook page, where he posts content relevant to his conservative political beliefs, has more than 90,000 followers.

""We have contacted the Trump Administration to secure a point of contact where all funds will go upon completion,"" the campaign says. ""When get this information secured we will update. We have many very high level contacts already helping."""
168,washington examiner,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/congress/mcconnell-vows-senate-will-block-house-funding-bill-that-excludes-wall-money,"Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell Wednesday said he'll reject legislation proposed by House Democrats to fund nine partially closed government departments without money included for a border wall.

""The legislation that the House Democrats are reportedly planning to introduce and vote on tomorrow will not be a serious contribution to the negotiations that are ongoing between the administration and the incoming Democratic majority in the House,"" McConnell, R-Ky., said Wednesday. ""It isn't comprehensive, it ignores the needs of border security, it's exactly the kind of proposal you'd expect if the incoming House Democrats are choosing to stage a political sideshow rather than doing the hard work of helping govern the country. In other words, a total nonstarter.""

McConnell met with incoming House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., at the White House with President Trump Wednesday but leaders emerged without a deal to pass funding for about 25 percent of the federal government.

The 116th Congress convenes at noon on Thursday.

The Senate will remain under the control of the GOP but the House will flip to a Democratic majority for the first time since 2010.

Pelosi, who is expected to be elected speaker, will bring up two bills for a vote that would fund eight of the nine agencies for the rest of the fiscal year and would fund the Homeland Security Department until Feb. 8.

Democrats argued this would provide additional time for Trump and Congress to negotiate a deal on border security, which is handled by the Homeland Security Department.

Trump won't support the idea and wants wall funding secured before any of the lapsed funding is restored.

Pelosi, along with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., refused to listen to a presentation by the administration on the border wall and why they believe it is necessary.

Republicans, meanwhile, told Democrats they won't back their funding legislation because it does not include money for the wall.

""I made it clear to the speaker we're not interested in having show votes here in the Senate,"" McConnell said Wednesday. ""We are interested in bringing up something that the House has passed, the Senate will support and the president will sign.""

Pelosi, leaving the White House meeting, told reporters the proposal put forward by Democrats has been backed by Senate Republicans, either in a floor vote or in Committee. Pelosi called the bill ""a Republican path"" to re-open the government.

But Republican support of those funding measures came prior to the demand by Trump to include robust wall funding and the House passage in December of a bill that would provide $5.7 billion for border security, including a wall.

Democrats insist there should be no wall funding.

McConnell said Thursday's House votes will provide ""an early signal"" as to whether Democrats will engage in ""partisan show votes that will do nothing to move the country in a forward direction."""
169,the kansas city star,https://www.kansascity.com/news/state/kansas/article224069750.html,"With illegal immigration at its lowest level in a decade, it's nothing short of stunning that the federal government is shut down over funding for a border wall.

Yet here we are, entering a third week of the shutdown because President Donald Trump has inexplicably chosen to dig his heels in on getting $5 billion to build a wall along stretches of the U.S. border with Mexico that do not already have such a barrier in place.

""As long as it takes,"" Trump said last week when asked how long he was willing to let the shutdown last. ""I mean, look, I'm prepared. I think the people of the country think I'm right. I think the people of this country think I'm right.""

Except, polling shows the opposite. Major polls conducted last month by Quinnipiac, Harvard, NPR and others all showed that a majority of Americans do not support the wall. And the number of wall supporters shrinks even more when asked if it is worth shutting down the government over.

The reality is that immigration from Mexico has been decreasing since 2007, and the number of unauthorized immigrants living in the U.S. is at its lowest level since 2004, according to the Pew Research Center.

Further, the majority of illegal immigration to the United States from Mexico occurs in and around heavily secured ports of entry like San Diego, El Paso and Brownsville, Texas, where 654 miles of wall, fencing and other barriers already exist. Spending billions to build a structure along vast, rural stretches of the border doesn't help with security at the sections of the border that most need help.

No one is arguing for unsecure borders. The newly installed Democratic Congress voted Thursday to approve a stopgap funding bill that would reopen the federal government and provide $1.3 billion for border security in the form of manpower and equipment but not a wall. Trump has said he won't sign it, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell refuses to let a bill come to the Senate floor that the president won't sign.

It's hard to know what the president's end game is. He couldn't get the border wall approved when Republicans controlled both the House and the Senate, so it seems odd to take this stance on the heels of a midterm election in which Democrats made their biggest gains in 40 years and took control of the House.

Trump may feel he is being true to his base of ardent supporters, among whom the border wall ranked high on their list of priorities. But his focus is sorely misplaced. Rather, his attention should be focused on the independent voters who took a chance on him in 2016 believing his style could prove effective at getting things done in Washington. Shutting down the federal government in an effort to get $5 billion for a wall that most Americans don't feel the country needs is the opposite of getting things done.

Laura Kelly is already on the case for Kansas kids with decision to name new DCF leader ' The Kansas City Star

This is why voters elected incoming Gov. Laura Kelly: Because we need to do so much better for Kansas children, because we badly need transparency in state government and because there is zero time to waste in recovering all that was lost under Governors Sam Brownback and Jeff Colyer.

So good for her for marching so briskly into 2019. On Thursday, Kelly announced that she will replace Gina Meier-Hummel as head of the state's child welfare system. The Kansas Department for Children and Families was on what seemed like permanent crisis footing long before Meier-Hummel got there in fall of 2017. But it has remained troubled under her sometimes questionable leadership, and a change was in order.

Meier-Hummel had a difficult job and did make some improvements, which began with a top-to-bottom audit.

But she talked about transparency and didn't show enough of it. She decided to hire inexperienced and unlicensed social workers to fill jobs investigating reports of abuse and neglect. And she replaced contracts for foster care, family preservation and other services with grants that got around rules on no-bid arrangements.

Kelly asked the Colyer administration that she'll soon supplant -- in 11 days, her announcement noted, and we're glad she's counting -- not to implement those grants at this point. Meier-Hummel immediately said she'd honor that request.

The governor-elect also said outright that the state's procurement process wasn't followed and that agency officials had tried to keep her from learning more about how the grantees were chosen.

We wanted Kelly to clean house and name names, for the sake of the state's struggling families, and she's already doing that.

As The Star has reported, the agency gave a major grant to a Florida nonprofit already facing heavy criticism for its foster care. An agency spokeswoman argued that they'd been hired to provide family preservation services, not foster care, but it's still the same nonprofit group.

Meier-Hummel will be succeeded on an interim basis by Laura Howard, who for now will head both the DCF and the Kansas Department for Aging and Disability Services. A former regional administrator in a federal agency overseeing substance abuse and mental health services, Howard is currently director of the Public Management Center in the School of Public Affairs and Administration at the University of Kansas.

Meier-Hummel responded to Kelly's no-nonsense announcement with a news release of her own. It listed her achievements, including starting a new Wichita abuse and neglect reporting line, ""changing key policies and procedures and implementing further mandated training"" and reducing the number of missing and runaway kids by just over a quarter. The suspended grants are in the ""absolute best interest"" of Kansas children and families, the DCF's announcement said.

That's a matter of opinion, but ours is that Kelly has done the right thing and is off to a promising start even before being sworn in as governor."
170,the kansas city star,https://www.kansascity.com/news/nation-world/article224499960.html,"Congress returns to Washington for its first full week of legislative business since control of the House reverted to Democrats, but lawmakers will be confronted with the same lingering question: When will the partial government shutdown end?

One Republican senator says he's offered President Donald Trump a possible solution, though it may just be wishful thinking.

Sen. Lindsey Graham is encouraging Trump to reopen government for several weeks to continue negotiating with Democrats over the border wall Trump wants to build on the U.S.-Mexico border. If there's no deal at the end of that time, Graham says Trump would be free to take the more dramatic step of declaring a national emergency to build it.

But the South Carolina Republican says Trump still wants a deal on funding for the wall before agreeing to reopen shuttered government departments. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat, insists Trump reopen the government first.

Their weeks-old standoff led to the partial government shutdown, now on day 24 without a clear end in sight.

""Before he pulls the plug on the legislative option, and I think we're almost there, I would urge him to open up the government for a short period of time, like three weeks, before he pulls the plug, see if we can get a deal,"" Graham said. ""If we can't at the end of three weeks, all bets are off.

""See if he can do it by himself through the emergency powers. That's my recommendation,"" added Graham, who has publicly pushed Trump to use his authority to declare a national emergency to build the wall. Such a step would allow Trump to bypass Congress and tap various pots of unspent federal money, including for military construction and disaster relief as well as from assets seized by law enforcement, to pay for the wall.

Trump has kept Washington on edge over whether he would resort to such a declaration, citing what he says is a ""crisis"" of drug smuggling and the trafficking of women and children at the border. The president initially sounded as though such a move was imminent, but then pulled back. He has said several times since he first mentioned the idea in public this month that he prefers a legislative solution.

A key question is how much more time is Trump willing to give lawmakers. Graham, who spoke with Trump by telephone on Sunday morning, said the legislative path ""is just about shut off"" and blamed intransigence by Pelosi.

The speaker's office had no immediate comment.

Democrats oppose an emergency declaration but may be powerless to block it. Some Republicans are wary, too, fearing how a future Democratic president might use that authority. Such a move, should Trump ultimately go that route, would almost certainly be challenged in the courts.

Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., called Graham's idea to reopen the government a ""great place to start.""

""I do think if we reopen the government, if the president ends this shutdown crisis, we have folks who can negotiate a responsible, modern investment in technology that will actually make us safer,"" Coons said.

Trump says technology is nice, but that the border can't be secured without a wall.

The White House has been laying the groundwork for an emergency declaration, which is feared by lawmakers in both parties.

Senate Homeland Security Committee Chairman Ron Johnson, R-Wis., said he'd ""hate to see"" a declaration issued because the wall wouldn't get built, presumably because of legal challenges. Democrats voted in the past for border security and should again, he said.

""I actually want to see this wall get built,"" Johnson said. ""I want to keep pressure on Democrats to actually come to the negotiating table in good faith and fund what they have supported in the past.""

Graham favors a declaration and said the time for talk is running out.

""It's the last option, not the first option, but we're pretty close to that being the only option,"" he said.

Graham and Coons spoke on ""Fox News Sunday"" and Johnson appeared on CNN's ""State of the Union."""
171,washington examiner,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/trumps-pen-and-phone,"As President Trump's shutdown gamble appears unlikely to secure funding for his border wall, and as Democrats are poised to take control of the House, allies of the president say he may have to act alone.

""I have a hard time believing that the base will turn out at 2016 levels in 2020 if the central promise of the campaign is not fulfilled,"" a source close to the White House said.

The president made repeated promises during the 2016 campaign to build a wall across the U.S.-Mexico border -- one Mexico would pay for -- and he has continued to demand Congress over the first two years of his presidency provide the money for it.

Congress, however, has bucked the president's $5 billion request, one that will be made more difficult to fulfill once Democrats take control of the House in January.

That could put the president in a precarious situation for re-election in 2020 as he tries to reinforce his base.

""These people want to see a fight. They want to see an actual effort,"" the source close to the White House said. ""I think most Trump voters can understand that the numbers are against us. But they want to look at Trump and the administration and the Republican Party and see them fighting for the wall the same way they fought for [Brett] Kavanaugh.""

The fight over Justice Brett Kavanaugh's nomination to the Supreme Court showed voters what it looks like when Republicans punch back, the source said.

""If they don't see the same effort for the wall, you better believe they're going to be deflated,"" the source continued.

Trump seemed to signal a willingness to fight when, during a meeting in the Oval Office in December with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., he said he would be ""proud"" to take responsibility for shutting down the government over border security.

But as Congress hurled toward a partial government shutdown last month, Trump tweeted it was Democrats who would ""now own it.""

The source close to the White House said for Trump, there ""has to be follow-through.""

The source continued: ""If you're saying you're going to shut down the government over the wall, then you better shut down the government. That's how you deflate people when you say you're going to do something and don't do it.""

For Trump, mounting a fight over wall funding through the spending bill, then, ""may be the last chance to show his supporters that he's willing to go to the mat for this.""

As Congress approached the deadline to pass a government spending bill, allies in conservative media and on Capitol Hill ramped up the pressure on Trump to follow through with his demands for $5 billion for the border wall.

Conservative columnist and author Ann Coulter, who wrote a book called In Trump We Trust, warned last month she wouldn't vote for Trump in 2020 if he didn't build the wall.

She also professed in a blistering column for Breitbart that ""one of two things is true: Either Trump never intended to build the wall and was scamming voters all along, or he has no idea how to get it done and zero interest in finding out.""

The pressure appeared to work. The president torpedoed a Senate-passed spending bill because it didn't include money for the wall. Instead, he forced the House to include $5.7 billion in a spending measure, though it lacked the support to clear the Senate.

As a result of the impasse, a partial government shutdown took effect Dec. 22, leading Trump to cancel plans to spend Christmas at Mar-a-Lago and remain in Washington, D.C., where he continued to hold firm on his demand for wall funding.

""I am all alone (poor me) in the White House waiting for the Democrats to come back and make a deal on desperately needed Border Security,"" Trump tweeted on Christmas Eve. ""At some point the Democrats not wanting to make a deal will cost our Country more money than the Border Wall we are all talking about. Crazy!""

But the president and other top members of his administration have indicated they're expecting a prolonged shutdown.

""I can't tell you when the government is going to be open. I can tell you it's not going to be open until we have a wall, a fence, whatever they'd like to call it,"" he told reporters at the White House on Christmas Day.

White House budget director and acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney, meanwhile, did not rule out the shutdown continuing into January.

While Trump and the White House have put the onus on Democrats, the president's congressional opponents pinned the blame for the lapse in funding on Trump.

""Instead of bringing certainty into people's lives, he's continuing the Trump Shutdown just to please right-wing radio and TV hosts,"" Schumer and Pelosi said in a joint statement just before Christmas.

The Democratic leaders accused Trump of ""plunging the country into chaos.""

""As long as the president is guided by the House Freedom Caucus, it's hard to see how he can come up with a solution that can pass both the House and Senate and end his Trump Shutdown,"" Schumer and Pelosi said.

But Trump's continued insistence that a spending measure include funding for his wall has earned him praise from his conservative allies.

Rep. Matt Gaetz, R-Fla., a member of the House Freedom Caucus who met with Trump at the White House just before Christmas, described the president's attitude as ""resolute.""

""He's in this for the long haul, and he is not going to sign a bad deal that does not include border security with a physical barrier,"" Gaetz told Fox News in an interview.

Gaetz said $5 billion, as Trump has demanded, is the ""right number.""

Many believe the government spending fight before Christmas marked the last time Trump could secure the $5 billion for the border wall, though even the president acknowledged doing so would require backing from several Senate Democrats.

Pelosi has stressed on numerous occasions her party would not support legislation that included funding for Trump's border wall.

But the new installation of a Democrat-controlled House should not deter the president from acting unilaterally, some say.

""When you have national security concerns like we have now and something that Congress seemed, on both sides of the aisle, not to want to do their jobs, the president is the commander-in-chief,"" Sam Nunberg, a former Trump campaign official, said. ""His No. 1 responsibility is to protect America's national security, particularly the homeland. It's not protected every day we don't have that wall.""

Nunberg said it's ""high time"" the president find a way to pay for the border wall, even if it means taking money out of other agency budgets and facing subsequent court challenges.

""Obama showed leadership, the wrong kind of leadership, when he did DACA before the 2012 election. George W. Bush showed what he thought was leadership when he said he supported a ban on gay marriage and would support a constitutional ban, and that's what the president better do,"" Nunberg said.

Some of the president's allies believe it's time for the president to take a page out of his predecessor's playbook.

""I think Trump supporters look at what Democrats do when they're in power. They look at the fact that Obama was willing to swing for the fences, whether it was DACA or gun control or Obamacare,"" the source close to the White House said. ""He did not care about some of the blow back, some of the negative. I think in a lot of ways, Trump supporters want to see the same type of fight from Trump.""

Ford O'Connell, a Republican strategist, said it's a ""missed opportunity"" for Trump not to have secured funding for his border wall when Republicans controlled both chambers of Congress, but said reforming the immigration system requires more than just a wall.

O'Connell also contended that a major factor playing into whether Trump wins re-election in 2020 will be if he can avoid economic downtown.

""The irony is, even if he got the $5 billion, he still has to keep focus on this issue for the next two years and rub a rabbit's foot and hope the economy doesn't tank,"" he said."
172,washington examiner,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/policy/defense-national-security/trump-blames-dems-for-shutdown-says-it-can-end-if-they-get-to-work,"President Trump on Monday blamed the government shutdown on Democrats and said that they could end it ""in 15 minutes"" if they would return to Washington and negotiate a deal that includes funding for the border wall.

""Nancy and Cryin' Chuck can end the Shutdown in 15 minutes. At this point it has become their, and the Democrats, fault!""

""I've been waiting all weekend. Democrats must get to work now. Border must be secured!"" Trump tweeted Monday morning.

On Saturday, Trump told Fox News that he had not left Washington in months because he has been working hard on a deal to secure a border wall. For weeks now, he has said that Democrats could end the partial government shutdown by negotiating with him.

The partial government shutdown, now in its fourth week, is the longest in U.S. history. It began on Dec. 22 when Trump and Democrats could not agree on a funding bill that included money for a physical barrier at the southern border."
173,the kansas city star,https://www.kansascity.com/news/business/national-international/article224126560.html,"The Latest on President Donald Trump and the partial government shutdown (all times local):

3:16 p.m.

Congressional leaders from both parties have returned to the White House for another round of negotiations with President Donald Trump on the ongoing partial government shutdown.

The two sides have made no apparent progress in the past week, with Trump sticking to his demand of $5.7 billion for a border barrier and Democrats insisting they won't give him the money.

Trump has been making a public case that there is a ""crisis"" at the southern border. And he's still threatening to declare a national emergency to circumvent Congress if he can't get the wall money from them.

He told reporters during a visit to the Capitol earlier Wednesday that he may turn to a declaration ""at some point"" if top Democrats Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi ""don't agree"" with his assessment about the problems at the border.

President Donald Trump says Republicans are ""totally unified"" in the shutdown standoff over his long-promised southern border wall, though some GOP lawmakers have been expressing concern about the 19-day partial government closure.

Trump traveled to Capitol Hill on Wednesday to meet with Senate Republicans. He says there was ""no discussion about anything other than solidarity.""

Trump has been considering a national emergency declaration to bypass Congress to build the wall. He says he ""may do that at some point"" if he can't get a deal with Democrats.

Trump also plans to meet with top congressional Democrats and Republicans at the White House on Wednesday.

President Donald Trump arrived on Capitol Hill claiming he has ""tremendous"" support as he headed into a meeting with Republican senators uneasy with the government shutdown over his border wall.

Asked how long the shutdown would last, Trump told reporters Wednesday ""whatever it takes.""

The partial shutdown is now in its 19th day, the second longest ever.

Trump and Vice President Mike Pence arrived for the private lunch meeting with the Senate GOP caucus to shore up support.

Several Republican senators have said the government should be re-opened while talks continue over border security and Trump's demand for money to build the wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.

President Donald Trump says he thinks he and the Democrats are ""getting closer"" to a deal to end the budget stalemate that has partially shut down the government despite no evidence that any progress has been made.

And he's suggesting the partial government shutdown could be ""a blessing in disguise"" because, he suggests, it could lead to a broader immigration deal.

Trump spoke Wednesday during an Oval Office bill signing on anti-human trafficking legislation. It's a day after he delivered a prime-time address trying to make the case for his long-stalled U.S.-Mexico border wall.

Trump says that he would like to see ""real immigration reform in this country because we need it."" He says, ""Everybody wants to see immigration reform,"" adding that perhaps the stalemate ""will turn out to be a blessing in disguise.""

Gone are the days when the U.S. and Mexican governments regularly exchanged statements over President Donald Trump's insistence on a border wall.

Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said Wednesday he won't be drawn into what he calls a U.S. internal dispute, an apparent reference to the 19-day-old partial U.S. government shutdown over a border barrier.

Lopez Obrador says, ""We are not going to respond to situations arising from internal affairs in the United States.""

Unlike his predecessor, the Mexican leader didn't have to respond to any specific aspersion about Mexico, because Trump didn't make any in his Tuesday night address to the American public. Relations between the two leaders have been surprisingly cordial, given their ideological differences.

Lopez Obrador said, ""Of course, there are those ... who want us to get into a confrontation. We always want a friendly relationship with the United States, a cooperative relationship.""

As a presidential candidate Trump promised Mexico would pay for a border wall, but Mexico refused.

President Donald Trump is using a bill signing focused on curbing human trafficking to push his case for a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border.

Trump says a southern border that is not secured exacerbates the incidents of human trafficking. He says, ""As long as we have a border that is not secure, we're going to suffer the consequences of that.""

Wednesday's bill signing came a day after Trump's prime-time speech designed to persuade Americans that illegal immigration and trafficking at the border are a crisis.

Democrats have called Trump's promised wall costly, ineffective and ""immoral"" and say he's ""manufacturing a crisis.""

The bill Trump signed is designed to enhance an annual State Department report that measures global efforts to eliminate human trafficking.

The White House says it's the fourth bipartisan bill the Republican president has signed in the last few weeks to prevent human trafficking.

Congressional Democrats say they'll head to the White House with the plan to reopen the government -- the same one they've been presenting. They're asking President Donald Trump to accept a bipartisan bill to fund border security without the wall.

Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Wednesday the president ""could end the Trump shutdown and re-open the government today, and he should.""

Pelosi and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer spoke at an event where they were flanked by federal workers going without pay during the shutdown, now in its 19th day.

Schumer called workers the ""collateral damage"" of Trump's ""temper tantrum."" He said the president failed to ""persuade a soul"" during his ""divisive"" prime-time address Tuesday night to the nation.

Trump meets with congressional leaders at the White House Wednesday afternoon. He rejected the Senate's bipartisan funding bill in December, sparking the shutdown.

The White House is trying to keep jittery congressional Republicans from defecting over the toll the partial government shutdown is taking in their states.

President Donald Trump and Democrats have been at an impasse over funding for his proposed border wall, which has led to a partial government shutdown, now in its 19th day.

Trump meets with Senate Republicans Wednesday on Capitol Hill just hours after he argued on national television that a border wall was needed to resolve a security and humanitarian ""crisis.""

Senators say the shutdown has led to disruptions in agricultural payments for farmers, as well as for home buyers trying to secure government-backed home loans. Lawmakers also are worried about missed paychecks for government workers Friday.

As many as half a dozen GOP senators have said the government should reopen while border security negotiations with Democrats continue.

President Donald Trump again linked illegal immigration along the southern border with drugs and violent crime as he urged Democratic lawmakers to fund his proposed border wall.

In his first national address from the Oval Office, the president gave no indication he was softening his stance that the partial government shutdown would continue without money for the wall.

Trump argued Tuesday night that the wall was needed to resolve what he called a security and humanitarian ""crisis.""

He addressed the nation as the shutdown stretched through its third week, with hundreds of thousands of federal workers going without pay and some congressional Republicans growing increasingly jittery about the impasse.

Trump plans to visit Senate Republicans at the Capitol on Wednesday before meeting with Democratic leaders at the White House."
174,newstatesman.com,https://www.newstatesman.com/culture/2019/01/nancy-pelosi-s-last-stand,"The re-elected Democrat speaker faces her greatest battle yet as she takes on Trump and contends with her party's radical left.

After reclaiming the gavel on 3 January, Nancy Pelosi, who is 78, the only woman to be elected speaker of the US House of Representatives and the first lawmaker in over 50 years to hold the office twice, pledged that America's 116th Congress would be ""bipartisan and unifying"". She was setting herself a huge challenge. The government has been shut down since 22 December after President Donald Trump's demand for a $5bn Mexican border wall.

As well as negotiating with an uncooperative president and forging a consensus with Republicans - who still control the Senate, the upper chamber - Pelosi needs to broker unity within her own party. The Democrats embraced her leadership only reluctantly, and this year's diverse intake includes an outspoken and rebellious left wing. But if anyone can end Washington's political deadlock, Pelosi can.

Thomas Mann, a senior fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution in Washington, has described Pelosi as ""the strongest and most effective Speaker of modern times"". During her 2007-11 speakership she shepherded a fiscal stimulus bill and extensive Wall Street reforms through Congress, in response to the 2007-08 financial crisis, and secured passage of the Affordable Care Act, which extended health-care coverage to tens of millions of uninsured American citizens.

Pelosi's first task in the new Congress is to find a way to reopen the government. Trump has said he's prepared to maintain the shutdown ""for years"" to secure funding for his wall. Pelosi has said she will not spend a dollar on a project that she describes as un-American and ""an immorality"".

A longer-term challenge for the speaker will be managing division within her own party. She skilfully saw off an attempted coup last year - it helped that she has no obvious successor - but agreed to limit her term to four years. A number of left-wing Democratic freshmen are contemptuous of the party's wealthy, ageing leadership and uncompromising in their political views.

Rashida Tlaib of Michigan attracted public attention this month for pledging to ""impeach the motherfucker [Trump]"". In contrast, Pelosi is an old-school politician who advocates ""decency and dignity"", even when confronting an adversary she disdains (she recently joked to the Washington Post that her nicknames for Trump are ""Rock Bottom"" and ""Difficult Circumstances"").

The Democrats' majority in the House grants them extensive powers to investigate the president's business interests and foreign ties, and to begin impeachment proceedings. Pelosi has not ruled out impeaching Trump but is urging the ""pound of flesh club"" in her party to wait for the facts.

The speaker has been honing her political instincts since early childhood. She was born in Baltimore in 1940, the youngest of seven children. ""We were all christened into the Roman Catholic church and the Democratic Party,"" she has said. Her father, Thomas d'Alesandro, was a congressman when she was born and became mayor of the city when she was seven. Her mother, Annunciata, was a skilled networker and Democratic organiser. ""Our whole lives were politics,"" Pelosi recalled in 1987.

She studied political science in Washington, where she met her future husband, Paul Pelosi, a wealthy financier. The couple married in 1963 and moved to San Francisco, where Pelosi raised five children, born within six years of each other, while also working as a Democratic volunteer and rising through the party ranks as an organiser.

When the San Francisco congresswoman Sala Burton was dying of cancer in 1986, she persuaded Pelosi to run as her successor. Pelosi was elected the following year. She used her first House speech to urge Congress to address the Aids epidemic. (Despite her Catholicism, Pelosi has long championed LGBT rights and women's reproductive freedom.)

In 2001, she became the first woman to be elected to the post of Democratic whip. The following year she made history again as the first female House minority leader.

As a junior congresswoman in a male-dominated chamber Pelosi was used to being excluded and underestimated, as well as disliked. When asked by NBC this month why her approval ratings were below Trump's, she blamed decades of Republican attacks. ""They're against me because I'm effective,"" she said.

When she reclaimed the speakership, Pelosi called up her grandchildren (she has nine) and any other children on the House floor to join her. She threw her arm around Bella, nine, who watched with admiration as her grandmother took her oath. It was a symbolic moment, conveying the sense that America's most powerful elected woman will be looking to secure her legacy.

Ensuring that Congress provides an effective check to the Trump administration will be one of the hardest and most important battles of her long career. It may also be her last."
175,washington examiner,https://www.washingtonexaminer.com/news/congress/the-border-wall-fight-started-long-before-trump,"In 2013, two years before Trump declared his intention to run for president, Republicans blocked passage of a measure requiring the Homeland Security Department to finish construction of 350 miles of double-layer fence along the U.S.-Mexico border.

Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., who recently urged Trump to ""hang tough"" in the battle against Democrats over wall funding, was among five GOP lawmakers who voted to defeat the fence even though he supported it at the time.

Trump and Republicans have in recent days accused Democrats of abandoning previous support for a border wall because of their intense dislike of the president.

""The only reason they are against it is because I won the presidency,"" Trump said last week.

But the battle over wall funding has been simmering for years, and the effort in Congress to pay for it has grown increasingly partisan and complicated.

Graham's vote against the fence more than five years ago is a prime example.

On June 18, 2013, the Senate was poised to pass a comprehensive immigration reform bill, the first of its kind in years and one that lawmakers had long sought to achieve. It coupled new border security measures with a pathway to citizenship for the nation's approximately 11 million illegal immigrants.

The bipartisan ""Gang of Eight"" lawmakers who authored the bill included Sens. Graham, Marco Rubio, R-Fla., Jeff Flake, R-Ariz., John McCain, R-Ariz., and four Democrats.

Lawmakers debated and voted on a string of amendments to the bill, and the list included a measure authored by Sen. John Thune, R-S.D., that would have required ""completion of the 350 miles of reinforced, double-layered fencing"" before any the nation's approximately 11 million illegal immigrants could apply for green cards.

The 350 miles make up half the length of fencing called for in the Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996.

""This would ensure that the border is more secure before any legalization program is carried out,"" Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, said during Senate debate in support of Thune's amendment.

But all the Democrats voting at the time refused to back the fence. They threatened to block final passage of the reform bill if Thune's amendment passed.

The four GOP authors of the reform bill, along with Sen. Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska, voted to help Democrats defeat the Thune amendment in order to protect the immigration reform bill, which finally passed the Senate but then died in the GOP-led House.

Every singe Senate Democrat voted against the fence, almost two years before Trump descended the escalator stairs to announce his plan to seek the GOP nomination for president.

Democratic support for a wall dwindled some time after 2006, when both the House and Senate passed the Secure Fence Act with bipartisan backing.

The bill was signed into law by former President George W. Bush in 2006. It authorized the construction of hundreds of miles of ""additional fencing"" on the southern border, as well as ""more vehicle barriers, checkpoints, and lighting to help prevent people from entering our country illegally.""

The measure passed the Senate 80-19 and supporters included then-Sens. Hillary Clinton, D-N.Y., and Barack Obama, D-Ill., as well as Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., who is currently leading the upper chamber's fight against wall funding. Other Democrats who currently serve in the Senate also voted for the fence.

Most House Democrats voted against the 2006 Secure Fence Act, including Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., who recently declared a southern border wall ""an immorality.""

Pelosi and other Democrats have backed fencing in recent spending measures, however. They voted for last year's Homeland Security spending measure, which provided money for new barriers and to reinforce existing fencing, including along the border in San Diego. And they did not object to Obama's use of federal money to complete fencing and barriers along the southern border when he was president.

Democrats now say no new walls are necessary on the border.

Pelosi in recent days has made the case that if there is a border crisis as Trump contends, it is humanitarian and not the national security threat portrayed by the president. Pelosi urged Trump and Republicans to soften their stance on the wall. She and Democrats say the border can be secured instead with drones and other technological advances.

""Let's have this discussion on where we can agree on the best ways to protect our borders, to secure our borders, to do so in a way that honors our values,"" she said."
176,the kansas city star,https://www.kansascity.com/news/business/national-international/article224277975.html,"The government shutdown has suspended federal cleanups at Superfund sites around the nation and forced the cancellation of public hearings, deepening the mistrust and resentment of surrounding residents who feel people in power long ago abandoned them to live among the toxic residue of the country's factories and mines.

""We are already hurting, and it's just adding more fuel to the fire,"" says 40-year-old Keisha Brown, whose wood-frame home is in a community nestled among coking plants and other factories on Birmingham's north side.

The mostly African-American community has been forced to cope with high levels of arsenic, lead and other contaminants in the soil that the Environmental Protection Agency has been scraping up and carting away, house by house.

As President Donald Trump and Congress battle over Trump's demand for a wall on the southern U.S. border, the nearly 3-week-old partial government shutdown has stopped federal work on Superfund sites except for cases where the administration deems ""there is an imminent threat to the safety of human life or to the protection of property.""

EPA's shutdown plans said the agency would evaluate about 800 Superfund sites to see how many could pose an immediate threat. As an example of that kind of threat, it cited an acid leak from a mine that could threaten the public water supply. That's the hazard at Northern California's Iron Mountain mine, where EPA workers help prevent an unending flow of lethally acidic runoff off the Superfund site from spilling into rivers downstream.

Practically speaking, said Bonnie Bellow, a former EPA official who worked on Superfund public outreach at the agency, the impact of the stoppage of work at sites across the nation ""wholly depends"" on the length of the shutdown.

""Unless there is immediate risk like a storm, a flood, a week or two of slowdowns is not going to very likely affect the cleanup at the site,"" Bellow said.

In north Birmingham, Brown said it's been a couple of weeks since she's spotted any EPA crews at people's houses. It wasn't clear if state workers or contractors were continuing work.

But long before the shutdown began, Brown harbored doubts the cleanup was working anyway. ""My main concern is the health of the people out here,"" said Brown, who has asthma. ""All of us are sick, and we've got to function on medicine every day.""

In terms of time, the federal government shutdown is a chronological blip in the long history of the site -- which includes ethics charges in a local bribery scandal to block federal cleanup efforts -- but adds to the uncertainty in an area where residents feel forgotten and betrayed.

At the EPA, the shutdown has furloughed the bulk of the agency's roughly 14,000 employees. It also means the EPA isn't getting most of the daily stream of environmental questions and tips from the public. Routine inspections aren't happening. State, local and private emails to EPA officials often get automated messages back promising a response when the shutdown ends.

In Montana, for instance, state officials this month found themselves fielding calls from a tribal member worried about drinking water with a funny look to it, said Kristi Ponozzo, public-policy director at that state's Department of Environmental Quality. The EPA normally provides tribes with technical assistance on water supplies.

With most EPA colleagues idled, Ponozzo said, her agency also had to call off an environmental review meeting for a mining project, potentially delaying the project.

But it's the agency's work at Superfund sites -- lessening the threat from old nuclear-weapons plants, chemical factories, mines and other entities -- that gets much of the attention.

Absent imminent peril, it would be up to state governments or contractors to continue any cleanup during the shutdown ""up to the point that additional EPA direction or funding is needed,"" the EPA said in a statement.

""Sites where cleanup activities have been stopped or shut down will be secured until cleanup activities are able to commence when the federal government reopens,"" the agency said.

For federal Superfund sites in Michigan, the shutdown means there are no EPA colleagues to consult, said Scott Dean, a spokesman for that state's Department of Environmental Quality.

At Michigan Superfund sites, day-to-day field operations were continuing since private contractors do most of the on-the-ground work, Dean said.

Bellow, the former EPA official, said the cancellation of hearings about Superfund sites posed immediate concerns.

In East Chicago, Indiana, for example, the EPA called off a planned public hearing set for last Wednesday to outline how the agency planned to clean up high levels of lead and arsenic in the soil.

The EPA has proposed a seven-month, $26.5 million cleanup that includes treating and removing tainted soil from the area, where a lead smelter previously was located.

During a public meeting Nov. 29, some residents complained that the EPA's approach would leave too much pollution in place. But others didn't get a chance to speak and were hoping to do so at the meeting this week, said Debbie Chizewer, a Northwestern University environmental attorney who represents community groups in the low-income area.

The EPA announced the cancellation in an online notice and gave no indication that it would be rescheduled.

Leaders of the East Chicago Calumet Community Advisory Group asked for a new hearing date and an extension of a Jan. 14 public comment deadline in a letter to the EPA's regional Superfund division.

Calls by The Associated Press to the agency's regional office in Chicago this week were not answered.

Local critics fear the EPA will use the delay caused by the shutdown as justification for pushing ahead with a cleanup strategy they consider flawed, Chizewer said, even though the agency has designated the affected area as an ""environmental justice community"" -- a low-income community of color that has been disproportionately harmed by pollution.

The EPA has a ""special obligation"" when dealing with such communities, Chizewer said. ""This would be an example of shutting them out for no good reason.""

In North Birmingham, former longtime neighborhood resident Charlie Powell said most of the people living in and around the Superfund site had already ""just got tired and fed up.""

Powell left the area but started a group called PANIC, People Against Neighborhood Industrial Contamination. He believes money would be better spent helping residents move away from the pollution.

""Can I say hell?"" Powell said when asked what residents have been through.

As President Donald Trump and Congress battle over Trump's demand for a wall on the southern U.S. border, the nearly 3-week-old partial government shutdown has stopped federal work on Superfund sites except for cases where the administration deems ""there is an imminent threat to the safety of human life or to the protection of property.""

EPA's shutdown plans said the agency would evaluate about 800 Superfund sites to see how many could pose an immediate threat. As an example of that kind of threat, it cited an acid leak from a mine that could threaten the public water supply. That's the hazard at Northern California's Iron Mountain mine, where EPA workers help prevent an unending flow of lethally acidic runoff off the Superfund site from spilling into rivers downstream.

Practically speaking, said Bonnie Bellow, a former EPA official who worked on Superfund public outreach at the agency, the impact of the stoppage of work at sites across the nation ""wholly depends"" on the length of the shutdown.

""Unless there is immediate risk like a storm, a flood, a week or two of slowdowns is not going to very likely affect the cleanup at the site,"" Bellow said.

In north Birmingham, Brown said it's been a couple of weeks since she's spotted any EPA crews at people's houses. It wasn't clear if state workers or contractors were continuing work.

But long before the shutdown began, Brown harbored doubts the cleanup was working anyway. ""My main concern is the health of the people out here,"" said Brown, who has asthma. ""All of us are sick, and we've got to function on medicine every day.""

In terms of time, the federal government shutdown is a chronological blip in the long history of the site -- which includes ethics charges in a local bribery scandal to block federal cleanup efforts -- but adds to the uncertainty in an area where residents feel forgotten and betrayed.

At the EPA, the shutdown has furloughed the bulk of the agency's roughly 14,000 employees. It also means the EPA isn't getting most of the daily stream of environmental questions and tips from the public. Routine inspections aren't happening. State, local and private emails to EPA officials often get automated messages back promising a response when the shutdown ends.

In Montana, for instance, state officials this month found themselves fielding calls from a tribal member worried about drinking water with a funny look to it, said Kristi Ponozzo, public-policy director at that state's Department of Environmental Quality. The EPA normally provides tribes with technical assistance on water supplies.

With most EPA colleagues idled, Ponozzo said, her agency also had to call off an environmental review meeting for a mining project, potentially delaying the project.

But it's the agency's work at Superfund sites -- lessening the threat from old nuclear-weapons plants, chemical factories, mines and other entities -- that gets much of the attention.

Absent imminent peril, it would be up to state governments or contractors to continue any cleanup during the shutdown ""up to the point that additional EPA direction or funding is needed,"" the EPA said in a statement.

""Sites where cleanup activities have been stopped or shut down will be secured until cleanup activities are able to commence when the federal government reopens,"" the agency said.

For federal Superfund sites in Michigan, the shutdown means there are no EPA colleagues to consult, said Scott Dean, a spokesman for that state's Department of Environmental Quality.

At Michigan Superfund sites, day-to-day field operations were continuing since private contractors do most of the on-the-ground work, Dean said.

Bellow, the former EPA official, said the cancellation of hearings about Superfund sites posed immediate concerns.

In East Chicago, Indiana, for example, the EPA called off a planned public hearing set for last Wednesday to outline how the agency planned to clean up high levels of lead and arsenic in the soil.

The EPA has proposed a seven-month, $26.5 million cleanup that includes treating and removing tainted soil from the area, where a lead smelter previously was located.

During a public meeting Nov. 29, some residents complained that the EPA's approach would leave too much pollution in place. But others didn't get a chance to speak and were hoping to do so at the meeting this week, said Debbie Chizewer, a Northwestern University environmental attorney who represents community groups in the low-income area.

The EPA announced the cancellation in an online notice and gave no indication that it would be rescheduled.

Leaders of the East Chicago Calumet Community Advisory Group asked for a new hearing date and an extension of a Jan. 14 public comment deadline in a letter to the EPA's regional Superfund division.

Calls by The Associated Press to the agency's regional office in Chicago this week were not answered.

Local critics fear the EPA will use the delay caused by the shutdown as justification for pushing ahead with a cleanup strategy they consider flawed, Chizewer said, even though the agency has designated the affected area as an ""environmental justice community"" -- a low-income community of color that has been disproportionately harmed by pollution.

The EPA has a ""special obligation"" when dealing with such communities, Chizewer said. ""This would be an example of shutting them out for no good reason.""

In North Birmingham, former longtime neighborhood resident Charlie Powell said most of the people living in and around the Superfund site had already ""just got tired and fed up.""

Powell left the area but started a group called PANIC, People Against Neighborhood Industrial Contamination. He believes money would be better spent helping residents move away from the pollution.

""Can I say hell?"" Powell said when asked what residents have been through."

179,the daily gazette,https://dailygazette.com/article/2019/01/06/pence-white-house-officials-meet-with-congressional-aides-in-effort-to-end-shutdown,"WASHINGTON - The government shutdown that has halted paychecks for hundreds of thousands of federal workers began its third week Saturday with no end in sight, as Vice President Mike Pence, top White House officials and senior congressional aides met for more than two hours without reaching a deal to reopen the government.

Inside the meeting at the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, Pence refused to budge from the more than $5 billion President Donald Trump has demanded from Congress to pay for a portion of his promised wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, according to two Democratic officials briefed on the negotiations.

The standoff - which has heavily affected national parks and other operations and threatens to halt payments as varied as food stamps and tax refunds - has made Trump's unrealized border wall the linchpin of his presidency as he seeks to make good on a signature campaign promise.

Administration officials have acknowledged that they were not prepared for the potential consequences of an extended shutdown and Trump's decision to demand wall funding. Democrats, meanwhile, are standing firm on offering no taxpayer money for the project, which Trump had long asserted would be funded by Mexico.

Pence was deputized by Trump to oversee Saturday's talks, but he did not have the president's blessing to float new or specific numbers as he did last month in a meeting with Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., according to two Trump aides who were not authorized to speak publicly. That meant few specifics were actually discussed Saturday, as Democratic staffers repeatedly pushed the administration to reopen the federal government and negotiate differences over the border after the shutdown ends.

But the administration - represented by Pence, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and senior adviser Jared Kushner - refused, according to multiple officials.

""Not much headway made today,"" Trump tweeted Saturday afternoon. ""Second meeting set for tomorrow. After so many decades, must finally and permanently fix the problems on the Southern Border!""

Before the meeting began Saturday morning, Trump took a combative tone in several Twitter messages and claimed that news coverage documenting cracks in Republican support for his hard-line position were inaccurate.

""Great support coming from all sides for Border Security (including Wall) on our very dangerous Southern Border,"" Trump tweeted. ""Teams negotiating this weekend! Washington Post and NBC reporting of events, including Fake sources, has been very inaccurate (to put it mildly)!""

A number of Republicans, including Sen. Cory Gardner, R-Colo., who is up for reelection in 2020, have said in recent days that the government should be reopened and that a shutdown is not the ""right answer,"" worrying GOP leaders about the depth of support for Trump's position.

Trump spent much of Saturday on the phone with allies, talking through his positioning on the shutdown and hearing their reviews of his Friday news conference in the Rose Garden, according to a person close to him. Two people regularly on his call list - Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., and Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. - have encouraged Trump to hold fast and refuse to agree to reopen the government unless wall funding is secured, the person said.

""I've never seen the president as resolved on any issue as he is on this,"" Meadows said Saturday. ""But he is open to new ideas about how to end the impasse.""

Trump told reporters Friday that he wants to reopen government but is prepared to maintain the shutdown for weeks or even years. He also told congressional leaders at the White House on Friday that he preferred the term ""strike"" over ""shutdown,"" people briefed on the meeting said.

In conversations with top aides on Friday and Saturday, House Democratic leaders said Trump and GOP leaders seem eager to be seen as making progress even if the talks remained stalled, allowing Republican lawmakers back home over the weekend to reassure nervous constituents, according to two Democratic officials briefed on those discussions who were not authorized to speak publicly.

""There is the reality of what the White House is doing, which is very little, and the image they're trying to send, which is, 'Look at us, we're busy, and the vice president is rolling up his sleeves,' "" one Democratic official said. ""They're worried about defections.""

During Saturday's meeting, Democratic staffers asked the White House to lay out in formal detail the administration's funding request for the border - including its specific security requests, what the money would be used for, and what in the Homeland Security budget the administration would cut to make the numbers work, people familiar with the meeting said.

Democrats ""emphasized that it's important for us to have an updated budget request from the White House because they have been all over the map,"" said another official briefed on the discussion. The White House plans to provide those figures before the group meets again Sunday afternoon.

Some centrist Republicans on Saturday urged Trump and congressional leaders to reopen the government, reflecting growing unease in their ranks about the prolonged shutdown and the political cost the GOP might pay.

""With Nancy Pelosi as speaker, it's going to have to be a compromise solution,"" Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick, R-Pa., a moderate and former FBI agent who represents the Philadelphia suburbs, said in an interview. ""It's our most basic function as members of Congress to fund the government, and we need to have these battles on immigration and other issues on their own turf, separately.""

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said in a statement Saturday that the House will begin passing separate bills to reopen the government next week, starting with the funding bill that covers the Treasury Department ""so that the American people can receive their tax refunds on schedule.""

""The senseless uncertainty and chaos of the Trump Shutdown must end, now,"" Pelosi said.

Mulvaney said in an interview to air Sunday on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" that Trump would ""take a concrete wall off the table"" in negotiations with Democratic leaders if that would help end the shutdown.

""If he has to give up a concrete wall, replace it with a steel fence to do that so that Democrats can say, 'See? He's not building a wall anymore,' that should help us move in the right direction.' "" Mulvaney said.

But Trump is annoyed by news reports about the negotiations that make it seem that he is backing away from his demands and wants to avoid stories about new numbers for wall funding being discussed, Trump aides said. The president instead encouraged Pence and senior aides to focus on the $5.6 billion for border security that was the focal point of legislation passed last month by House Republicans, the aides said.

Trump exasperated members of both parties with his comments Friday, but Trump spent that evening boasting to friends that he was in a strong negotiating position because he was able to capture attention and make a flurry of points that he feels his core voters appreciate, White House officials said.

On Saturday evening, Trump tweeted that he would travel to Camp David on Sunday for ""meetings on Border Security and other topics"" with aides attending a White House staff retreat. He then followed up with a tweet of his ""Game of Thrones""-style poster saying, ""The Wall is Coming.""

Mulvaney is spearheading the gathering as a way of connecting with his new deputies and colleagues, according to officials.

The president is asking advisers about further ways to battle for wall funding in the coming days, whether it is meeting with family members of people killed by undocumented immigrants, huddling with sheriffs or visiting the border, the officials said.

As Saturday's meeting unfolded, Trump was eyeing his own options for trying to force the Democrats' hand, including declaring a national emergency to begin wall construction without congressional approval, a possible course he mentioned at his Friday news conference.

According to two confidants of Trump's, who have spoken to him in recent days but were not authorized to speak publicly, Trump is looking at how such a move would play out and has told his aides that such a drastic turn could rattle the Democrats and compel them to offer him wall funding. The legality of such a move is unclear, however, and Trump would almost certainly face immediate legal challenges in the courts.

Still, there are signs within the White House that more-comprehensive deals are at least being discussed, more likely for after the shutdown concludes and the government reopens.

Kushner, the president's son-in-law, continues to tell his allies that he thinks there could eventually be a deal for border wall funding in exchange for immigration protections for undocumented immigrants who were brought to the United States as children, according to two people who were briefed on those discussions. Another person familiar with the discussions emphasized, however, that Kushner was not pushing for a deal on Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, at this time.

Chatter about an agreement involving protections for young immigrant beneficiaries of the DACA program have risen a bit in recent days, although the administration has rejected previous wall-for-DACA deals and Democratic leadership is in no mood for one now.

After his work on a bipartisan criminal justice reform bill, Kushner is as engaged as ever with Capitol Hill, the people said. Still, Kushner's interest in brokering a possible deal on immigration has caused some anxiety among conservatives close to Trump, several of whom said Saturday they feared the president could eventually be intrigued by Kushner's position as the shutdown drags on and Trump searches for a way out."

WASHINGTON -- Democrats on Thursday assumed control of the House for the first time in eight years as a new Congress gaveled in amid a partial government shutdown over President Donald Trump's demands for a border wall.

Nine new Texans -- four Democrats and five Republicans -- took the oath of office.

""It's real right now,"" Rep. Colin Allred, D-Dallas, said as he attached his official congressional lapel pin and double-checked that he had his voting card before walking onto the House floor.

The tradition-bound day featured history of all sorts, ranging from Rep. Nancy Pelosi's rare feat of regaining the post of House speaker to new Reps. Veronica Escobar of El Paso and Sylvia Garcia of Houston officially becoming the first Texas Latinas to serve in Congress.

But there was no mistaking the pall cast by the government shutdown, which has left hundreds of thousands of federal employees out of work for nearly two weeks.

House Democrats are expected on Thursday to pass two spending bills that would end the shutdown but not fund a border wall. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, pointing to Trump's objections, declared the legislation dead in the Senate even before it passed the House.

The impasse will persist.

So while a new Congress always brings the prospect of fresh ideas and perhaps even a modicum of optimism, the Washington newcomers ended up getting an all-too-real lesson on Day 1 about how divided government does and, in this instance, doesn't work.

""I really did come here to form bipartisan relationships and to form bipartisan deals,"" said Allred, who defeated longtime Republican Rep. Pete Sessions in the November election. ""And I'm hopeful that we can still do that. But to begin on this foot is not the best start.""

Rounding out the group of new Texans in Congress are Rep. Dan Crenshaw, R-Spring; Rep. Lizzie Pannil Fletcher, D-Houston; Rep. Lance Gooden, R-Terrell; Rep. Chip Roy, R-Austin; Rep. Van Taylor, R-Plano; and Rep. Ron Wright, R-Arlington.

Their first act of business in the House was to vote on a new speaker -- a contest that appeared just a few weeks ago that it would be a drama-filled endeavor.

While Pelosi enjoys broad support within the Democratic caucus -- particularly after the party's smashing success in the November elections -- Rep. Filemon Vela of Brownsville and a group of like-minded rebels threatened to block her bid over demands for fresh leadership.

The Californian melted away that opposition, with Vela and others reversing course last month after Pelosi agreed to serve no more than four years as speaker.

Pelosi made sure on Thursday to nod at the next generation, saying that when ""our new members take the oath, our Congress will be refreshed, and our democracy will be strengthened by the optimism, idealism and patriotism of this transformative freshman class.""

She secured 220 votes, which was enough to win the job with a few votes to spare. Every Texas Democrat voted in support of the Californian. That fact didn't go unnoticed by some in the GOP, with the National Republican Congressional Committee going on the attack against Allred.

""After Colin Allred spent months on the campaign trail dodging the question about his support of Nancy Pelosi, he promptly bent the knee today by voting YES for Speaker Pelosi,"" NRCC spokesman Bob Salera said.

But the shutdown fight was never far away. Escobar, the El Paso Democrat, even cast her speaker vote for Nancy ""No Wall"" Pelosi.

Trump last month abandoned a budget deal that would've prevented a funding lapse after key conservative voices blistered him for punting yet again on his signature promise to build a ""big, beautiful wall"" along the U.S.-Mexico border.

He left no doubt at the time about what he was willing to do to get $5 billion for a border wall.

""I am proud to shut down the government for border security,"" he said in the Oval Office during a televised meeting with Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. ""I will take the mantle. I will shut it down. I'm not going to blame you for it.""

While Trump and his allies see the wall as an essential way to boost national security, Democrats and even some Republicans see the proposed barrier as an outmoded waste of money.

That conflict comes despite the fact that the $5 billion in question wouldn't produce all that much wall: 100 miles of barrier along segments of the border that aren't already fenced and an upgrade to 115 miles of existing fence, federal officials say.

Trump has nevertheless refused to budge.

""The Shutdown is only because of the 2020 Presidential Election,"" the president wrote on Twitter on Thursday. ""The Democrats know they can't win based on all of the achievements of 'Trump,' so they are going all out on the desperately needed Wall and Border Security.""

The standstill caused both Democrats and Republicans to spend the holidays blustering past one another.

Rep. Michael Burgess, R-Pilot Point, said on Fox News that it was ""dismaying to see the obstacles that have been put in front of the president."" Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson, D-Dallas, said on Twitter that the ""right choice is the American people and not the ineffective border wall.""

The Texas newcomers didn't sit on the sidelines, either.

Escobar wrote on Twitter that the ""border has never been more secure"" and that there are ""better ways to spend that $."" Crenshaw also took to Twitter to say that the ""GOP must stand strong on promise to protect our border."""
181,triblive,https://triblive.com/usworld/world/14448385-74/trump-threatens-to-shut-border-if-no-wall-money,"WASHINGTON -- With the partial government shutdown headed toward its second week and no resolution in sight, President Donald Trump on Friday issued a string of tweets in which he once again vowed to close the entire U.S. border with Mexico and halt aid to several Latin American countries unless Democrats agree to his demand for billions of dollars in wall funding.

Trump is also canceling plans to visit his Florida resort, Mar-a-Lago, and will remain in Washington over the New Year holiday, Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney said.

About 25 percent of the federal government has been shut down since Saturday, with roughly 800,000 workers affected, including an estimated 350,000 who are on furlough at home.

""We will be forced to close the Southern Border entirely if the Obstructionist Democrats do not give us the money to finish the Wall & also change the ridiculous immigration laws that our Country is saddled with,"" Trump said in a morning tweet.

In a reprise of his threat before the midterm elections to cut off aid to Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador as a caravan of migrants was making its way toward the United States, Trump said that those three countries ""are doing nothing for the United States but taking our money.""

""Word is that a new Caravan is forming in Honduras and they are doing nothing about it,"" he said, without providing further details. ""We will be cutting off all aid to these 3 countries - taking advantage of U.S. for years!""

Despite Trump's threat, the United States this month announced a new collaboration with Mexico on a program to curb migration from Central American countries, with much of the $10.6 billion U.S. contribution to be drawn from existing aid programs.

Trump's tweets come as Congress has effectively given up on breaking the impasse over the president's demands for border-wall funding, all but ensuring that the partial government shutdown will stretch into at least the start of the new year.

The House and the Senate convened for just minutes on Thursday before gaveling closed until next week. During the brief session in the House, Republicans shot down a Democratic attempt to vote on legislation to reopen the government.

As he did Thursday, Trump remained out of public view on Friday. In an appearance on Fox News, Mulvaney said that the president had ""canceled his plans for Christmas, and now he's canceled his plan for New Year's.""

""He's staying in Washington, D.C., over New Year's,"" said Mulvaney, who is set to become Trump's acting chief of staff next month.

Even though Trump will be in town and Republicans control both chambers of Congress, Mulvaney acknowledged that little progress on a deal is expected until the start of the new Congress on Jan. 3, when Democrats will retake the House. Contending that Democrats ""have simply shut down the discussions,"" he sought to place the blame on House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., who is expected to be elected speaker in the new Congress.

""Nancy Pelosi, in fairness, does not have the votes for the speakership yet,"" Mulvaney said. ""She cannot be seen by her party as being weak on negotiating with Donald Trump. So we fully expect that until she is elected speaker and has locked that vote up, we don't expect to hear from the Democrats again.""

According to a Washington Post tally, Pelosi, who won the Democratic caucus's nomination for the speakership in late November, appears to have secured enough support to be elected speaker in January.

Pelosi's spokesman, Drew Hammill, said in a statement Friday that Democrats ""are united against the President's immoral, ineffective and expensive wall - the wall that he specifically promised that Mexico would pay for.""

Democrats will not consider any offers that have not been publicly endorsed by Trump himself, he said.

""While we await the president's public proposal, Democrats have made it clear that, under a House Democratic majority, we will vote swiftly to reopen government on Day One,"" Hammill said.

At the heart of the stalemate is Trump's demand for $5 billion in funding for his proposed wall at the U.S.-Mexico border. Congressional Democrats have rejected that figure and in recent weeks have refused to publicly endorse a figure above $1.3 billion, which continues existing funding levels and includes money for new border fencing and levee walls, but not the concrete wall Trump once demanded before he started more recently talking about ""steel slats.""

Mulvaney said Friday that ""some folks use the term 'wall' and they mean different things.""

""Everyone agrees that what we can and should be building on that southern border is that steel barrier that the president tweeted out. That's what he wants to build. The Democrats, believe it or not, don't call that a wall,"" he said."

Members of the congressional leadership were not in Washington, though aides insisted that lawmakers could return if there is a deal to end the shutdown. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., was in his home state, according to his office, while Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., was with his family in New York.

Aides to House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., declined to say where they were.

""The House remains ready to act once there is a product that can pass the Senate and that the president says he will sign,"" said AshLee Strong, a spokeswoman for Ryan.

Trump's previous threats to build a wall and force Mexico to pay for it led to diplomatic clashes with the government of former president Enrique Peña Nieto. But Mexico's new president - Andrés Manuel López Obrador, who is a leftist - has tried to avoid such disputes.

Asked about Trump's latest tweets, López Obrador told reporters Friday: ""We have acted prudently and cautiously, and we have not expressed an opinion on this theme, because this is an internal matter of the U.S. government and we prefer to abstain"" from making a statement.

He added that the Mexican government ""is seeking to always maintain a very good relationship with the government of the United States.""

As he did Thursday, Trump remained out of public view on Friday. In an appearance on Fox News, Mulvaney said that the president had ""canceled his plans for Christmas, and now he's canceled his plan for New Year's.""

""He's staying in Washington, D.C., over New Year's,"" said Mulvaney, who is set to become Trump's acting chief of staff next month.

White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said early Friday afternoon that the president was in the West Wing meeting with staff and making calls and that there were ""no plans as of now"" for him to travel to Florida.

Even though Trump will be in town and Republicans control both chambers of Congress, Mulvaney acknowledged that little progress on a deal is expected until the start of the new Congress on Jan. 3, when Democrats will retake the House.

Contending that Democrats ""have simply shut down the discussions,"" Mulvaney claimed that Schumer ""was really interested in doing a deal"" in their recent negotiations, ""but the more we're hearing this week is that it's [House Minority Leader] Nancy Pelosi who's preventing that from happening.""

""Nancy Pelosi, in fairness, does not have the votes for the speakership yet,"" Mulvaney said. ""She cannot be seen by her party as being weak on negotiating with Donald Trump. So we fully expect that until she is elected speaker and has locked that vote up, we don't expect to hear from the Democrats again.""

According to a Washington Post tally, Pelosi, who won the Democratic caucus's nomination for the speakership in late November, appears to have secured enough support to be elected speaker in January.

Throughout the negotiations, Pelosi and Schumer have presented a united front, issuing several joint statements and appearing together at an Oval Office meeting with Trump and Vice President Pence on Dec. 11.

Pelosi's spokesman, Drew Hammill, said in a statement Friday that Democrats ""are united against the President's immoral, ineffective and expensive wall - the wall that he specifically promised that Mexico would pay for.""

Democrats will not consider any offers that have not been publicly endorsed by Trump himself, he said, adding that the last time the White House directly reached out to Pelosi was when the president called her following the Oval Office meeting.

""While we await the president's public proposal, Democrats have made it clear that, under a House Democratic majority, we will vote swiftly to reopen government on Day One,"" Hammill said.

A Schumer spokesman said that Schumer and Pelosi ""have been in constant and close contact and on the same page with regards to shutdown strategy. There is no daylight between them.""

At the heart of the stalemate is Trump's demand for $5 billion in funding for his proposed wall at the U.S.-Mexico border. Congressional Democrats have rejected that figure and in recent weeks have refused to publicly endorse a figure above $1.3 billion, which continues existing funding levels and includes money for new border fencing and levee walls, but not the concrete wall Trump once demanded before he started more recently talking about ""steel slats.""

Legislation with that level of funding, which would have kept the entire government open through Feb. 8, passed the Senate unanimously last week, but Trump subsequently rejected it.

Mulvaney said Friday that ""some folks use the term 'wall' and they mean different things.""

""Everyone agrees that what we can and should be building on that southern border is that steel barrier that the president tweeted out. That's what he wants to build. The Democrats, believe it or not, don't call that a wall,"" he said."
183,irish examiner,https://www.irishexaminer.com/breakingnews/world/trump-ally-urges-president-to-end-us-government-shutdown-897329.html,"A Republican senator advising Donald Trump has said he is encouraging the president to reopen the government for several weeks to continue negotiating with Democrats over funding for a US-Mexico border wall.

But Lindsey Graham admitted Mr Trump still wants to reach a deal for the wall before agreeing to reopen closed government departments.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a leading Democratic negotiator, insists that Mr Trump reopen the government first.

The weeks-old stand-off over funding led to the partial government shutdown that hit day 23 on Sunday without an end in sight.

""Before he pulls the plug on the legislative option, and I think we're almost there, I would urge him to open up the government for a short period of time, like three weeks, before he pulls the plug, see if we can get a deal,"" said Mr Graham, a South Carolina Republican. ""If we can't at the end of three weeks, all bets are off.""

Mr Graham, who has publicly pushed Mr Trump to use his authority to declare a national emergency to build the wall, continued: ""See if he can do it by himself through the emergency powers. That's my recommendation.""

Such a step would allow Mr Trump to bypass Congress and tap various pots of unspent federal money, including for military construction and disaster relief and from assets seized by law enforcement, to pay for the wall.

Mr Trump has kept Washington on edge over whether he would resort to such a declaration, citing what he says is a ""crisis"" of drug smuggling and the trafficking of women and children at the border.

The president initially sounded as though such a move was imminent, but then pulled back. He has said several times since he first mentioned the idea in public earlier this month that he prefers to try to reach a deal with Congress.

A key question is how much more time is Mr Trump willing to give Congress. Mr Graham, who said he and Mr Trump talked by telephone on Sunday morning, said the legislative path ""is just about shut off"" and blamed Ms Pelosi.

Democrats oppose an emergency declaration but may be powerless to block it. Some Republicans are wary, too, fearing how a future Democratic president might use that authority. Such a move, should Mr Trump ultimately go down that route, would almost certainly be challenged in the courts.

Senator Chris Coons, called Mr Graham's idea to reopen the government a ""great place to start"".

""I do think if we reopen the government, if the president ends this shutdown crisis, we have folks who can negotiate a responsible, modern investment in technology that will actually make us safer,"" Mr Coons said.

Mr Trump has maintained that the border cannot be secured without a wall."

According to the Daily Caller, McConnell told the Democrats during a floor speech that their government funding proposals are ""non-starters"" and that they need to ""get serious about border security."" The Kentucky Senator reminded the left that even if they did get a bill out of the House, it would still have the Republican lead Senate, as well as the President's desk to contend with.

""All three of these things are needed. One partisan vote in the House tomorrow won't solve anything. The legislation that House Democrats are reportedly planning to introduce would not be a serious contribution to these negotiations,"" he said.

McConnell then slammed the Democrat's funding bill, which he called a ""political sideshow.""

""It isn't comprehensive,"" said McConnell. ""It ignores the needs of border security. It's exactly the kind of proposal you'd expect if the incoming House Democrats were choosing to stage a political sideshow rather than do the hard work of helping to govern the country. A total non-starter.""

At this time, Democrats are outright refusing to hear any talk about border security, and instead, attempting to paint the government shutdown as solely a Republican affair.

Republicans are not likely to back down, however. Not only are Republicans overwhelmingly in support of the government shutdown, the Republicans feel that both Trump's presidency and Republican support now lie in the success over the fight for border security. Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) noted that should Trump fail to get his funding for the border wall, his Presidency will become irrelevant, and likely hurt him dearly in 2020.

In an op-ed for Fox News on Wednesday, House Majority Whip Steve Scalise noted that Democrats have asked for 10 times the amount of money Trump is for border fencing and that the reason Democrats are in sudden opposition now is all about resistance to Trump, and nothing else:

No, that statement wasn't made by a Republican. It was a speech given by then-Sen. Barack Obama of Illinois in 2006, when 26 Senate Democrats - including Obama and Sens. Hillary Clinton and Chuck Schumer of New York - voted for The Secure Fence Act, which allocated $50 billion over 25 years for 700 miles of fencing along the border.

That's right. Barack Obama and Chuck Schumer voted for 10 times more funding than President Trump is requesting now to secure our border. What has changed Democrats' recognition that our southern border needs to be secured? Two words: President Trump.

This may very well be true. Schumer himself is on camera during the Obama era speaking about the importance of keeping the border safe and the dangers of illegal immigration, noting that a border barrier is important to our border security."

Dec. 18

The New York Times on a judge's rebuke of Michael Flynn and President Donald Trump's charitable foundation:

A bit of common sense and common decency intruded on Tuesday into the crazy world of Donald Trump.

In New York, the state attorney general announced that the president had agreed that the ""charity"" he used as a piggy bank has no reason to exist.

In Washington, a federal judge let a former top presidential aide know that you can parrot political spin or you can tell the truth, but you can't do both to someone who can send you to prison.

Michael Flynn, Mr. Trump's former national security adviser, appeared before Judge Emmet Sullivan to be sentenced to what he expected would be a term of probation, after pleading guilty to lying to federal investigators about conversations with the Russian ambassador. The office of the special counsel, Robert Mueller, had earlier filed a memo that said it would be right for Mr. Flynn to avoid prison after his extensive cooperation in the investigation of Trump ties to Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential campaign and after.

Then last week, in a memo about their client's sentencing, Mr. Flynn's lawyers implied that he had been tricked into lying and that the F.B.I. acted improperly in interviewing him - points raised by pro-Trump commentators elaborating on the president's claims of being victimized by a witch hunt.

Judge Sullivan was having none of it.

""I cannot recall an instance of a court ever accepting a guilty plea from someone who did not maintain he was guilty,"" Judge Sullivan said, ""and I do not intend to start today.""

Chastened, Mr. Flynn told the judge that nobody tricked him, that he lied and that he knew he shouldn't have.

The judge was not upset only about Mr. Flynn's sneaky prevarication. He said he felt ""disgust"" at Mr. Flynn's offenses, that a retired three-star general would lie to the F.B.I. ""while on the physical premises of the White House,"" and, acting as an unregistered agent of a foreign country, Turkey, while he was an adviser to Mr. Trump (to which he admitted but was not charged). It was a bracing reminder of the brazenness of his misdeeds and of the standards the public should be able to expect of those who serve them.

Realizing that Judge Sullivan was considering a term of up to six months in prison, Mr. Flynn accepted his offer to delay the sentencing for 90 days until he has completed his cooperation with the special counsel.

""Good luck today in court to General Michael Flynn,"" Mr. Trump had tweeted first thing Tuesday morning.

""Thanks for nothing, Mr. President,"" Mr. Flynn might have thought as he left court.

Mr. Flynn should be grateful the judge offered him the chance to come clean. By contrast, the Donald J. Trump Foundation, a charity that provided no charity, quite properly received none from the New York attorney general's office.

Attorney General Barbara Underwood accused it of ""a shocking pattern of illegality"" that ""amounted to the Trump Foundation functioning as little more than a checkbook to serve Mr. Trump's business and political interests.""

Whatever money that remains will be disbursed under the supervision of Ms. Underwood's office and the judge overseeing the continuing lawsuit her office filed in June, seeking $2.8 million in restitution and a ban on Mr. Trump and his three oldest children serving on the boards of other nonprofit organizations.

In a series of stories exposing the foundation's true nature, The Washington Post found that its largest donation was to fix a fountain in front of the Plaza Hotel in Manhattan, which Mr. Trump owned at the time, that its funds were used to buy a portrait of Mr. Trump, and that it illegally provided political donations and paid for personal legal settlements.

All this comes just days after prosecutors announced that they believed that Mr. Trump had conspired with the owner of The National Enquirer and his fixer Michael Cohen to violate campaign finance laws by paying hush money to two women who said they had affairs with him. It's also just been reported that prosecutors are investigating spending by the Trump inaugural committee. The president still faces lawsuits on the constitutionality of his enriching himself while in office. Meanwhile, the special counsel's inquiry may be expanding rather than winding down.

It's fitting that despite all his bluster and threats, a president who's demonstrated such contempt for the rule of law is finding it so formidable.

That this goes to the essence of American governance was best summed up by Paula Duncan, the Trump enthusiast who was among the jurors who found Mr. Trump's former campaign chief Paul Manafort guilty of fraud, even though she had hoped he wouldn't be convicted.

Explaining her decision after the verdict, she told Fox News, ""No one's above the law.""

The Wall Street Journal on a judge's ruling on the Affordable Care Act's individual mandate:

No one opposes ObamaCare more than we do, and Democrats are now confirming that it was designed as a way-station to government-run health care. But a federal judge's ruling that the law is unconstitutional is likely to be overturned on appeal and may boomerang politically on Republicans.

Judge Reed O'Connor ruled for some 20 state plaintiffs that the Affordable Care Act's individual mandate is no longer legal because Republicans repealed its financial penalty as part of the 2017 tax reform. Recall that Chief Justice John Roberts joined four Justices to say ObamaCare's mandate was illegal as a command to individuals to buy insurance under the Commerce Clause. ""The Framers gave Congress the power to regulate commerce, not to compel it,"" he wrote.

Yet the Chief famously salvaged ObamaCare by unilaterally rewriting the mandate to be a ""tax"" that was within Congress's power. Never mind that Democrats had expressly said the penalty was not a tax. Majority Leader Roberts declared it to be so.

Enter Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, who argues in Texas v. U.S. that since Congress has repealed the mandate, the tax is no longer a tax, and ObamaCare is thus illegal. Judge O'Connor agreed with that logic, and he went further in ruling that since Congress said the mandate is crucial to the structure of ObamaCare, then all of ObamaCare must fall along with the mandate.

We'll admit to a certain satisfaction in seeing the Chief Justice hoist on his own logic. But his ruling in NFIB v. Sebelius was in 2012 and there is more at issue legally now than the ""tax"" issue in that opinion. One legal complication is that Congress in 2017 repealed the financial part of the individual mandate, not the structure of the mandate itself. Republicans used budget rules to pass tax reform so they couldn't repeal the mandate's express language.

The Affordable Care Act has also been up and running since 2014, which means so-called reliance interests come into play when considering a precedent. Millions of people now rely on ObamaCare's subsidies and rules, which argues against judges repealing the law by fiat.

Judge O'Connor breezes past this like a liberal Ninth Circuit appeals judge handling a Donald Trump appeal. He's right that Democrats claimed the individual mandate was essential to the Affordable Care Act. But when Congress killed the financial penalty in 2017 it left the rest of ObamaCare intact. When judging congressional intent, a judge must account for the amending Congress as well as the original Congress.

In any case, the Supreme Court's ""severability"" doctrine calls for restraint in declaring an entire law illegal merely because one part of it is. Our guess is that even the right-leaning Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals judges will overturn Judge O'Connor on this point.

As for the politics, Democrats claim to be alarmed by the ruling but the truth is they're elated. They want to use it to further pound Republicans for denying health insurance for pre-existing conditions if the law is overturned. Democrats campaigned across the country against Mr. Paxton's lawsuit to gain House and Senate seats in November, and they will now press votes in Congress so they can compound the gains in 2020.

President Trump hailed the ruling in a tweet, but he has never understood the Affordable Care Act. His Administration has done good work revising regulations to reduce health-care costs and increase access, but the risk is that the lawsuit will cause Republicans in Congress to panic politically and strike a deal with Democrats that reinforces ObamaCare. This is what happens when conservatives fall into the liberal trap of thinking they can use the courts to achieve policy goals that need to be won in Congress.

The Washington Post on withdrawing all 2,000 U.S. troops out of Syria:

PRESIDENT TRUMP'S sudden move to yank U.S. troops out of Syria undermined at a stroke several foreign policy goals he has championed. The president promised to finish the job of destroying the Islamic State, but the withdrawal will leave thousands of its fighters still in place. He vowed to roll back Iran's aggression across the Middle East, but his decision will allow its forces to entrench in the country that is the keystone of Tehran's ambitions. He promised to protect Israel, but that nation will now be left to face alone the buildup by Iran and its proxies along its northern border.

The president's top national security advisers had carefully developed and articulated a strategy of maintaining a U.S. presence in Syria until the Islamic State was beyond revival and Iran withdrew its forces - a plan they were defending up until this week. Mr. Trump has again demonstrated, to them and to the world, that no U.S. policy or foreign commitment is immune from his whims.

Mr. Trump claimed the Islamic State had been defeated, but that is not the view of the Defense and State Departments. Thousands of jihadist fighters are still in Syria and control splotches of territory in the Euphrates Valley. A U.S. withdrawal will give the extremists an opportunity to reconstitute, as they did in Iraq following the premature U.S. withdrawal ordered by President Barack Obama.

Until Wednesday, a prime talking point of senior national security officials was that, ""if we've learned one thing over the years, (the) enduring defeat of a group like this means you can't just defeat their physical space and then leave,"" as the State Department's special envoy for the global campaign against the Islamic State, Brett McGurk, put it last week. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said it another way in September: ""Getting rid of the caliphate doesn't mean you then blindly say, 'Okay, we got rid of it,' march out, and then wonder why the caliphate comes back.""

Mr. Trump has justified some of his most controversial decisions, including his continued support for Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, as needed to contain Iran's threat to the United States and its allies. But the Syrian withdrawal hands Tehran and its ally Russia a windfall. Iran has deployed thousands of fighters and allied militiamen to Syria and aspires to create a corridor to Lebanon and the Mediterranean, as well as a new front against Israel along the Golan Heights. In reaction to that threat, Mr. Trump's national security adviser, John Bolton, announced Sept. 24 that ""We're not going to leave (Syria) as long as Iranian troops are outside Iranian borders, and that includes Iranian proxies and militias.""

U.S. ambitions in Syria have never been backed by adequate resources, and a case could be made that neither Congress nor the American public were prepared to support the mission suggested by Mr. Bolton. But Mr. Trump's decision appears to have been precipitated by the bellicose rhetoric of Turkey's Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who last week threatened - not for the first time - a military operation against Syrian Kurds, even though U.S. troops are positioned around them. The autocratic Turkish ruler appears to have extracted multiple favors from Mr. Trump in recent days, including the sale of U.S. Patriot missiles and a promise to reexamine the possible extradition of his rival, Fethullah Gulen, from Pennsylvania. If Mr. Trump received anything in return, he hasn't disclosed it.

The Syrian Kurdish forces, which have fought alongside the United States and played a crucial role in liberating most of eastern Syria from the jihadists, will be perhaps the foremost victims of Mr. Trump's decision. Betrayed by Washington, they will now be subject to a military offensive by Turkey. The stab in the back will send an unforgettable message to all who are asked to cooperate with the United States in the fight against terrorism: Washington is an unreliable and dangerous partner.

The Orange County (California) Register on Mick Mulvaney as Trump's choice for chief of staff:

President Trump has found a new chief of staff, albeit an interim one, in his director of the Office of Management and Budget, Mick Mulvaney.

That of chief is a terribly important post, perhaps government's most consequential aside from that of his boss. In theory, at least, the chief of staff is the gatekeeper for everything the president does, everyone he sees, everyone he talks to on the phone.

Perhaps, though few would expect this to be the case, the arbiter of every time he sends out a tweet, and of what it should say.

A Washington insider, a former congressman, Mulvaney is in many ways ideal for the job. He wants it, badly, whereas others with similarly impressive resumes touted for the job have indicated a strong desire to spend more time with their families, from Vice President Pence's staff chief Nick Ayers of Georgia to former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie.

Mulvaney shares the conservative values currently espoused by the president and was a founder of the House Freedom Caucus in 2013, the group that always taunted the Republican leadership, opposing much government funding, including debt limit increases and budget agreements made with the Democrats.

But he also, after Trump secured the Republican nomination in 2016, called the candidate ""a terrible human being"" who he only was voting for out of an even greater dislike of Hillary Clinton.

It's not as if other presidential allies of today haven't said bad things about him in the past. On the campaign trail, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz called his rival ""a narcissist at a level I don't think this country's ever seen,"" for instance.

But if you were the nation's chief executive - or the CEO of a much smaller entity, for that matter - could you hire as your top aide and work with a person who had once dubbed you ""terrible""?

Or does this kind of talk come with the territory in politics, where many strange bedfellows are made because of having to run in elections against once and perhaps future allies? Should Trump indeed elevate this practical choice for staff chief to permanent status immediately?

Los Angeles Times on banning bump stocks, which allow semi-automatic weapons to fire like machine guns:

The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives said Tuesday that it had finalized a rule reclassifying so-called bump stocks - the devices that can make a semiautomatic rifle fire nearly as quickly a fully automatic weapon - as machine guns, which makes it illegal to manufacture, sell or possess them. The agency said a year ago it had the authority to reclassify the devices, and President Trump - in the wake of the Parkland, Fla., school shooting - directed the ATF to speed up the process. Tuesday's announcement - a rare bit of welcome news from the Trump administration - makes it official; White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters that owners of the conversion devices will have until March 21 to destroy them or turn them in to the ATF.

This is a good step. Unfortunately, it's all but certain to be challenged in the courts, and it's on shaky legal ground because of the way the new rule evolved. The Obama administration determined that because bump stocks have ""no automatically functioning mechanical parts and (perform) no automated mechanical functions when installed,"" they did not fit the definition of a machine gun in federal law, which meant the ATF lacked the authority to regulate them. Tuesday's announcement, by contrast, hinges not on the technical specifications, but on the functionality. In essence, if it fires like a machine gun, it's a machine gun. Cue the lawyers.

We hope the administration prevails in whatever challenges emerge, but the sure-fire way to resolve this would be for Congress to legislate bump stocks and related gadgets out of existence. Such devices serve no function other than to evade the strict congressional limit on machine guns by, as the ATF said, harnessing ""the recoil energy of the semiautomatic firearm in a manner that allows the trigger to reset and continue firing"" without the shooter having to pull the trigger for each shot.

A mass shooter in Las Vegas used bump stocks affixed to semiautomatic rifles to fire more than 1,000 rounds in a matter of minutes from a 32nd-floor suite of the Mandalay Bay Hotel into a crowd of some 20,000 people, killing 58 concertgoers and injuring hundreds of others. It was the largest single mass shooting in the modern era, drawing attention to bump stocks and sparking outraged demands by many - the Los Angeles Times included - that the devices be banned.

As welcome as this new rule is, it will do little to corral our national problem with gun violence. The vast majority of gun deaths come in ones and twos, led by suicides. ...

But it is progress. And the president deserves credit for sticking with his promise to find a way to ban bump stocks. ...

China Daily says telecommunications giant Huawei is a victim of U.S. panic attacks:

This year has not been an annus mirabilis for China's Huawei Technologies Ltd, the world's largest supplier of telecommunications network equipment and second-biggest maker of smartphones.

Although it has been constantly in the news and it is said there is no such thing as bad publicity, it has been making headlines because of the spurious claims it somehow poses a threat to the West, even world peace. It has never been explained exactly how.

In fact it is not because of anything it has done, but because its success has brought it into the crosshairs of the United States' anxiety attacks against China.

Huawei is at the forefront of 5G technology. This latest generation mobile network technology promises to bring the much anticipated and heralded internet of things to life and the US is determined to be the 5G leader.

Not only because whichever country develops the technology that is adopted as standard will have a huge commercial advantage. But also because by setting the standard it will have a knowledge advantage.

As a result, first the US and then one after another its most obedient allies have blocked Huawei from entering their 5G markets on security grounds.

None of them have offered any specific justification for blocking Huawei. They just repeat their claim that the company poses a security risk. That is why objective observers have concluded that those countries are politicizing a commercial issue.

It sets a harmful precedent. What if other countries used the same excuse to block US companies (not confined to the telecom sector)? The US companies are very competitive in many fields, including those that could pose huge security risks, such as finance.

While Huawei will not go unscathed from being prevented from entering key markets, as a competitive player, it still has a vast market to access in other parts of the world. It has signed contracts to supply 5G equipment to 25 telecom carriers, and more than 10,000 5G base stations have been shipped.

In stark contrast to the US and its allies, India for instance, has invited Huawei to conduct 5G trials in the country and complimented it on the role it has played in helping to develop its telecom industry.

The efforts of the US and its allies to try to shield their companies against a Chinese competitor are politically motivated, not the result of a fact-based or transparent decision-making process. And they are counterproductive to the concerted efforts that are needed to ensure the security of 5G networks.

186,daily herald,https://www.dailyherald.com/article/20190114/news/301149990,"WASHINGTON -- Congress returns to Washington for its first full week of legislative business since control of the House reverted to Democrats, but lawmakers will be confronted with the same lingering question: When will the partial government shutdown end?

One Republican senator says he's offered President Donald Trump a possible solution, though it may just be wishful thinking.

Sen. Lindsey Graham is encouraging Trump to reopen government for several weeks to continue negotiating with Democrats over the border wall Trump wants to build on the U.S.-Mexico border. If there's no deal at the end of that time, Graham says Trump would be free to take the more dramatic step of declaring a national emergency to build it.

But the South Carolina Republican says Trump still wants a deal on funding for the wall before agreeing to reopen shuttered government departments. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat, insists Trump reopen the government first.

Their weeks-old standoff led to the partial government shutdown, now on day 24 without a clear end in sight.

""Before he pulls the plug on the legislative option, and I think we're almost there, I would urge him to open up the government for a short period of time, like three weeks, before he pulls the plug, see if we can get a deal,"" Graham said. ""If we can't at the end of three weeks, all bets are off.

""See if he can do it by himself through the emergency powers. That's my recommendation,"" added Graham, who has publicly pushed Trump to use his authority to declare a national emergency to build the wall. Such a step would allow Trump to bypass Congress and tap various pots of unspent federal money, including for military construction and disaster relief as well as from assets seized by law enforcement, to pay for the wall.

The president initially sounded as though such a move was imminent, but then pulled back. He has said several times since he first mentioned the idea in public this month that he prefers a legislative solution.

A key question is how much more time is Trump willing to give lawmakers. Graham, who spoke with Trump by telephone on Sunday morning, said the legislative path ""is just about shut off"" and blamed intransigence by Pelosi.

The speaker's office had no immediate comment.

Democrats oppose an emergency declaration but may be powerless to block it. Some Republicans are wary, too, fearing how a future Democratic president might use that authority. Such a move, should Trump ultimately go that route, would almost certainly be challenged in the courts.

""I do think if we reopen the government, if the president ends this shutdown crisis, we have folks who can negotiate a responsible, modern investment in technology that will actually make us safer,"" Coons said.

Trump says technology is nice, but that the border can't be secured without a wall.

The White House has been laying the groundwork for an emergency declaration, which is feared by lawmakers in both parties.

Senate Homeland Security Committee Chairman Ron Johnson, R-Wis., said he'd ""hate to see"" a declaration issued because the wall wouldn't get built, presumably because of legal challenges. Democrats voted in the past for border security and should again, he said.

""I actually want to see this wall get built,"" Johnson said. ""I want to keep pressure on Democrats to actually come to the negotiating table in good faith and fund what they have supported in the past.""

Graham favors a declaration and said the time for talk is running out.

""It's the last option, not the first option, but we're pretty close to that being the only option,"" he said.

Graham and Coons spoke on ""Fox News Sunday"" and Johnson appeared on CNN's ""State of the Union.""

12:25 p.m.

President Donald Trump is using a bill signing focused on curbing human trafficking to push his case for a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border.

Trump says a southern border that is not secured exacerbates the incidents of human trafficking. He says, ""As long as we have a border that is not secure, we're going to suffer the consequences of that.""

Wednesday's bill signing came a day after Trump's prime-time speech designed to persuade Americans that illegal immigration and trafficking at the border are a crisis.

Democrats have called Trump's promised wall costly, ineffective and ""immoral"" and say he's ""manufacturing a crisis.""

The bill Trump signed is designed to enhance an annual State Department report that measures global efforts to eliminate human trafficking.

The White House says it's the fourth bipartisan bill the Republican president has signed in the last few weeks to prevent human trafficking.

11:30 a.m.

Congressional Democrats say they'll head to the White House with the plan to reopen the government - the same one they've been presenting. They're asking President Donald Trump to accept a bipartisan bill to fund border security without the wall.

Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Wednesday the president ""could end the Trump shutdown and re-open the government today, and he should.""

Pelosi and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer spoke at an event where they were flanked by federal workers going without pay during the shutdown, now in its 19th day.

Schumer called workers the ""collateral damage"" of Trump's ""temper tantrum."" He said the president failed to ""persuade a soul"" during his ""divisive"" prime-time address Tuesday night to the nation.

Trump meets with congressional leaders at the White House Wednesday afternoon. He rejected the Senate's bipartisan funding bill in December, sparking the shutdown.

10 a.m.

The White House is trying to keep jittery congressional Republicans from defecting over the toll the partial government shutdown is taking in their states.

President Donald Trump and Democrats have been at an impasse over funding for his proposed border wall, which has led to a partial government shutdown, now in its 19th day.

Trump meets with Senate Republicans Wednesday on Capitol Hill just hours after he argued on national television that a border wall was needed to resolve a security and humanitarian ""crisis.""

Senators say the shutdown has led to disruptions in agricultural payments for farmers, as well as for home buyers trying to secure government-backed home loans. Lawmakers also are worried about missed paychecks for government workers Friday.

As many as half a dozen GOP senators have said the government should reopen while border security negotiations with Democrats continue.

1:25 a.m.

President Donald Trump again linked illegal immigration along the southern border with drugs and violent crime as he urged Democratic lawmakers to fund his proposed border wall.

In his first national address from the Oval Office, the president gave no indication he was softening his stance that the partial government shutdown would continue without money for the wall.

Trump argued Tuesday night that the wall was needed to resolve what he called a security and humanitarian ""crisis.""

He addressed the nation as the shutdown stretched through its third week, with hundreds of thousands of federal workers going without pay and some congressional Republicans growing increasingly jittery about the impasse.

Trump plans to visit Senate Republicans at the Capitol on Wednesday before meeting with Democratic leaders at the White House."
188,dailypress.com,https://www.dailypress.com/news/virginia/dp-nws-elaine-luria-swearing-in-116th-congress-20181228-story.html,"Hampton Roads' newest representative in Congress was welcomed into her new role Thursday with a vow to uphold the Constitution and a major to-do list.

At the top of that list? Reopening the government.

U.S. Rep. Elaine Luria, the Norfolk Democrat, took the oath of office alongside her daughter, Violette, and more than 100 of her newly elected congressional colleagues -- including two other new Virginian women, Abigail Spanberger and Jennifer Wexton.

Luria will also be one of more than 126 female U.S. senators and House members elected in 2018, marking a record in the U.S. House for the number of women serving (102), according to the Rutgers University Eagleton Institute of Politics.

""I've always said that I think that Congress would be better when it looks more like the people that it represents,"" Luria said Wednesday in a phone interview.

Democrats -- Luria among them -- faced their first challenge as the party in control of the U.S. House of Representatives after being sworn into the 116th Congress.

Since President Donald Trump refused to sign a budget bill nearly two weeks ago, the government has been in partial shutdown, with thousands of federal employees being told they couldn't work, and thousands more working without pay.

""It's not fair for government workers to be asked to work without pay,"" Luria said, adding she's asked for her salary to be withheld until federal workers were paid, one of several House members to say so.

The president has repeatedly said he would refuse to sign a bill that didn't have at least $5.6 billion in funding for the border wall, blaming Democrats for the impasse.

Luria wouldn't say how much, if anything, she would support spending on a border wall. But she said that however the border was secured, it needs to be done in a ""smart way.""

Climate change and military

Luria said one of the first bills she'll put her name on once the government reopens is one to stop offshore drilling off the East Coast.

U.S. Rep. Don McEachin, who represents Richmond, first introduced the bill in June along with Rep. Walter B. Jones, a North Carolina Republican, that would amend the Outer Continental Shelf Lands Act to forbid issuing federal lease-sales ""for the exploration, development or production of oil or gas"" in the areas that include waters off Virginia, North Carolina, Maryland and Delaware.

Issues like offshore drilling and seismic testing -- both of which Luria opposes -- are why she said she wants to get assigned to the special committee on climate change.

Luria said during her campaign she would fight for clean water and air initiatives in Congress and wanted to address rising sea levels in Southeast Virginia.

Given Hampton Roads' deep ties to the Pentagon -- the area is home to 78,000 active military personnel, according to the Hampton Roads Economic Development Alliance -- and reliance on defense spending, she also wants to be on the House Armed Services Committee and the Veteran Affairs Committee.

""We need to do a lot more to make sure the veterans receive the benefits they've earned,"" she said, adding there are ""efficiencies to be gained"" in the VA.

A diverse district

As a 20-year veteran of the Navy, Luria has a lot in common with her many military constituents -- but so did her opponent, one-term Republican Scott Taylor, a Virginia Beach resident and former Navy SEAL.

Voters elected Luria on Nov. 6 by a margin of just over 6,100 votes, out of 273,400 cast amid unusually heavy turnout, both in the 2nd Congressional District and throughout Virginia.

Most of Luria's victory margin came from Virginia Beach, where she beat Taylor by 4,170 votes. Luria did well in her hometown of Norfolk as well, winning 55 percent of the vote.

""There's a lot of energy across the district,"" she said Wednesday. ""I think people were ready for change and to have a new voice in Washington and I'm glad to be here.""

The 2nd District includes all of Virginia Beach and the state's Eastern Shore as well as Norfolk's north side and several localities on the Peninsula, including Williamsburg and York County.

Several of her supporters, from Virginia Beach to Bethesda, Md., attended an open house at her office -- Cannon 534 -- on Thursday. She expected 350 attendees throughout the day.

Since her win, Luria said she's been learning how diverse the district is.

She's getting to know the needs of her most eastern constituents, where issues like infrastructure and rural healthcare dominate. She's getting up to speed on projects like a regional sewer line between Nassawadox and Accomac, and tuning in to transportation and economic development issues in Hampton Roads.

""There's such a variety of issues, and we want to make sure we hear about those and prioritize them,"" she said.

Luria said she plans to be in the district on weekends and at least one week out of the month, with votes taking place in Congress the other three weeks. She plans on hosting a town hall soon.

As she's getting to know the district, she has one message for the people she represents:

""We all have more common ground than we have differences. The door is open, the phone is on. I'm your representative whether you voted for me or not.""

189,wral.com,https://www.wral.com/congress-to-face-same-question-when-will-the-shutdown-end-/18122286/,"WASHINGTON -- Congress returns to Washington for its first full week of legislative business since control of the House reverted to Democrats, but lawmakers will be confronted with the same lingering question: When will the partial government shutdown end?

One Republican senator says he's offered President Donald Trump a possible solution, though it may just be wishful thinking.

Sen. Lindsey Graham is encouraging Trump to reopen government for several weeks to continue negotiating with Democrats over the border wall Trump wants to build on the U.S.-Mexico border. If there's no deal at the end of that time, Graham says Trump would be free to take the more dramatic step of declaring a national emergency to build it.

But the South Carolina Republican says Trump still wants a deal on funding for the wall before agreeing to reopen shuttered government departments. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat, insists Trump reopen the government first.

Their weeks-old standoff led to the partial government shutdown, now on day 24 without a clear end in sight.

""Before he pulls the plug on the legislative option, and I think we're almost there, I would urge him to open up the government for a short period of time, like three weeks, before he pulls the plug, see if we can get a deal,"" Graham said. ""If we can't at the end of three weeks, all bets are off.

""See if he can do it by himself through the emergency powers. That's my recommendation,"" added Graham, who has publicly pushed Trump to use his authority to declare a national emergency to build the wall. Such a step would allow Trump to bypass Congress and tap various pots of unspent federal money, including for military construction and disaster relief as well as from assets seized by law enforcement, to pay for the wall.

Trump has kept Washington on edge over whether he would resort to such a declaration, citing what he says is a ""crisis"" of drug smuggling and the trafficking of women and children at the border. The president initially sounded as though such a move was imminent, but then pulled back. He has said several times since he first mentioned the idea in public this month that he prefers a legislative solution.

A key question is how much more time is Trump willing to give lawmakers. Graham, who spoke with Trump by telephone on Sunday morning, said the legislative path ""is just about shut off"" and blamed intransigence by Pelosi.

The speaker's office had no immediate comment.

Democrats oppose an emergency declaration but may be powerless to block it. Some Republicans are wary, too, fearing how a future Democratic president might use that authority. Such a move, should Trump ultimately go that route, would almost certainly be challenged in the courts.

Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., called Graham's idea to reopen the government a ""great place to start.""

""I do think if we reopen the government, if the president ends this shutdown crisis, we have folks who can negotiate a responsible, modern investment in technology that will actually make us safer,"" Coons said.

Trump says technology is nice, but that the border can't be secured without a wall.

The White House has been laying the groundwork for an emergency declaration, which is feared by lawmakers in both parties.

Senate Homeland Security Committee Chairman Ron Johnson, R-Wis., said he'd ""hate to see"" a declaration issued because the wall wouldn't get built, presumably because of legal challenges. Democrats voted in the past for border security and should again, he said.

""I actually want to see this wall get built,"" Johnson said. ""I want to keep pressure on Democrats to actually come to the negotiating table in good faith and fund what they have supported in the past.""

Graham favors a declaration and said the time for talk is running out.

""It's the last option, not the first option, but we're pretty close to that being the only option,"" he said.

Graham and Coons spoke on ""Fox News Sunday"" and Johnson appeared on CNN's ""State of the Union.""

190,americanthinker.com,https://www.americanthinker.com/blog/2019/01/trump_floats_path_to_citizenship_for_h1b_visa_holders.html,"Donald Trump tweeted yesterday that ""changes are soon coming"" to the H-1b visa program that could give a ""path to citizenship' for some.

""H1-B holders in the United States can rest assured that changes are soon coming which will bring both simplicity and certainty to your stay, including a potential path to citizenship,"" Mr. Trump tweeted. ""We want to encourage talented and highly skilled people to pursue career options in the U.S.""

There is nothing new in Trump's desire to bring the best of the world to work in the US. He has repeatedly said so over the years. Of course, this debunks the notion that Trump is ""anti-immigrant."" He wants to reform the H-1b program but only after the border is secured.

Mr. Trump has expressed openness to a broader immigration overhaul, but has insisted that he first wants funding for a concrete or steel wall or barrier, along with funding for technology and personnel to handle the situation at the border. It's unclear what prompted Mr. Trump's tweet.

During the campaign, Mr. Trump proposed increasing the prevailing wage paid to H-1B visa holders in an effort to force companies to give entry-level jobs to an existing pool of unemployed workers in the U.S., instead of bringing in cheaper workers from overseas.

""This will improve the number of black, Hispanic and female workers in Silicon Valley who have been passed over in favor of the H-1B program,"" the Trump campaign wrote in an August 2015 immigration platform.

The H-1b visa program was created to bring highly skilled and educated workers to the US to be employed by tech firms and labs. But the program has been abused by some businesses who bring over entry level workers who will work for less than Americans. Consequently, Americans have been fired from some jobs to accomodate the lower paid foreign workers.

As a businessman, Trump has a unique perspective among politicians on the H-1b visa program. He has already tried to address some of the abuses of the program with uneven success. Clearly, this is an issue that Congress needs to get involved in. But with immigration politics all tied up in knots because of the fight over the border wall, it won't happen anytime soon."
191,reuters india,https://in.reuters.com/article/usa-congress-budget-departments-idINKCN1OM01H,"(Reuters) - Following weeks of talks between President Donald Trump and congressional leaders, parts of the U.S. government shut down on Saturday after negotiators reached an impasse over a deal to keep the government fully funded.

At issue was funding for a wall along the country's southern border with Mexico. The House of Representatives passed a bill that included $5 billion Trump had demanded for a wall, but the Senate included considerably less money for border security.

The partial shutdown will affect about 15 percent of the federal workforce, a senior administration official said on Saturday, as a majority of agencies and departments, including the Department of Defense and the Postal Service, already have secured funding.

Still, some 800,000 employees from the Departments of Homeland Security, Transportation and others will be affected.

According to the American Federation of Government Employees, 420,000 people who have been deemed ""essential"" must work without pay, while 380,000 others will not be able to report for work at all.

Trump administration officials say anyone working without pay will receive back pay once a deal is reached.

Below is what will happen at some of the agencies and departments affected by the shutdown.

The department that oversees Customs and Border Protection, Immigration and Customs Enforcement, the Transportation Security Administration, the Coast Guard and the Secret Service is affected by the shutdown.

But most of those agencies' employees are considered essential, so they will need to work without pay until a government funding bill is passed.

Of the 245,000 people who work under the department's umbrella, nearly 213,000 have been deemed essential, according to the department's contingency plan.

Of the department's 7,500 employees, only 343 are expected to work. Nearly 1,000 other people may be called in to work on specific tasks, for which they will not be paid until a funding bill is passed.

Though public housing authorities and tribally designated housing entities are not part of the federal government and are not required to shut down, some of their funding is provided by the federal government, so they may need to reduce or change normal operating hours.

The department, which is also responsible for some housing loans and low-income housing payments, said in its contingency plan a shutdown would likely not significantly affect the housing market.

But, it added, ""a protracted shutdown could see a decline in home sales, reversing the trend toward a strengthening market that we've been experiencing.""

The National Park Service, under the umbrella of the Interior Department, will have a skeleton staff. Under its contingency plan, no national parks will be open and no visitor services - including restrooms, facility maintenance and trash collection - will be provided.

But some governors have pledged to step in, including in Arizona, the site of the Grand Canyon, and New York, where the state has provided funding for the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island to stay open.

Of the department's 55,000 employees, 20,400 will be put on leave. Those employees do not include most of the Federal Aviation Administration, where 24,200 will be working, or the Federal Highway Administration, where all 2,700 employees are funded through other sources.

Air traffic control, hazardous material safety inspections and accident investigations will continue, but some rulemaking, inspections and audits will be paused.

An estimated 1,100 of the office's 1,800 employees would be placed on leave. This will include most of the Office of Management and Budget, which helps the president implement his budget and policy goals."
192,miami herald,https://www.miamiherald.com/news/politics-government/national-politics/article224069750.html,"With illegal immigration at its lowest level in a decade, it's nothing short of stunning that the federal government is shut down over funding for a border wall.

Yet here we are, entering a third week of the shutdown because President Donald Trump has inexplicably chosen to dig his heels in on getting $5 billion to build a wall along stretches of the U.S. border with Mexico that do not already have such a barrier in place.

""As long as it takes,"" Trump said last week when asked how long he was willing to let the shutdown last. ""I mean, look, I'm prepared. I think the people of the country think I'm right. I think the people of this country think I'm right.""

Except, polling shows the opposite. Major polls conducted last month by Quinnipiac, Harvard, NPR and others all showed that a majority of Americans do not support the wall. And the number of wall supporters shrinks even more when asked if it is worth shutting down the government over.

The reality is that immigration from Mexico has been decreasing since 2007, and the number of unauthorized immigrants living in the U.S. is at its lowest level since 2004, according to the Pew Research Center.

Further, the majority of illegal immigration to the United States from Mexico occurs in and around heavily secured ports of entry like San Diego, El Paso and Brownsville, Texas, where 654 miles of wall, fencing and other barriers already exist. Spending billions to build a structure along vast, rural stretches of the border doesn't help with security at the sections of the border that most need help.

No one is arguing for unsecure borders. The newly installed Democratic Congress voted Thursday to approve a stopgap funding bill that would reopen the federal government and provide $1.3 billion for border security in the form of manpower and equipment but not a wall. Trump has said he won't sign it, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell refuses to let a bill come to the Senate floor that the president won't sign.

It's hard to know what the president's end game is. He couldn't get the border wall approved when Republicans controlled both the House and the Senate, so it seems odd to take this stance on the heels of a midterm election in which Democrats made their biggest gains in 40 years and took control of the House.

Trump may feel he is being true to his base of ardent supporters, among whom the border wall ranked high on their list of priorities. But his focus is sorely misplaced. Rather, his attention should be focused on the independent voters who took a chance on him in 2016 believing his style could prove effective at getting things done in Washington. Shutting down the federal government in an effort to get $5 billion for a wall that most Americans don't feel the country needs is the opposite of getting things done.

Laura Kelly is already on the case for Kansas kids with decision to name new DCF leader ' The Kansas City Star

This is why voters elected incoming Gov. Laura Kelly: Because we need to do so much better for Kansas children, because we badly need transparency in state government and because there is zero time to waste in recovering all that was lost under Governors Sam Brownback and Jeff Colyer.

So good for her for marching so briskly into 2019. On Thursday, Kelly announced that she will replace Gina Meier-Hummel as head of the state's child welfare system. The Kansas Department for Children and Families was on what seemed like permanent crisis footing long before Meier-Hummel got there in fall of 2017. But it has remained troubled under her sometimes questionable leadership, and a change was in order.

Meier-Hummel had a difficult job and did make some improvements, which began with a top-to-bottom audit.

But she talked about transparency and didn't show enough of it. She decided to hire inexperienced and unlicensed social workers to fill jobs investigating reports of abuse and neglect. And she replaced contracts for foster care, family preservation and other services with grants that got around rules on no-bid arrangements.

Kelly asked the Colyer administration that she'll soon supplant -- in 11 days, her announcement noted, and we're glad she's counting -- not to implement those grants at this point. Meier-Hummel immediately said she'd honor that request.

The governor-elect also said outright that the state's procurement process wasn't followed and that agency officials had tried to keep her from learning more about how the grantees were chosen.

We wanted Kelly to clean house and name names, for the sake of the state's struggling families, and she's already doing that.

As The Star has reported, the agency gave a major grant to a Florida nonprofit already facing heavy criticism for its foster care. An agency spokeswoman argued that they'd been hired to provide family preservation services, not foster care, but it's still the same nonprofit group.

Meier-Hummel will be succeeded on an interim basis by Laura Howard, who for now will head both the DCF and the Kansas Department for Aging and Disability Services. A former regional administrator in a federal agency overseeing substance abuse and mental health services, Howard is currently director of the Public Management Center in the School of Public Affairs and Administration at the University of Kansas.

Meier-Hummel responded to Kelly's no-nonsense announcement with a news release of her own. It listed her achievements, including starting a new Wichita abuse and neglect reporting line, ""changing key policies and procedures and implementing further mandated training"" and reducing the number of missing and runaway kids by just over a quarter. The suspended grants are in the ""absolute best interest"" of Kansas children and families, the DCF's announcement said.

That's a matter of opinion, but ours is that Kelly has done the right thing and is off to a promising start even before being sworn in as governor."
193,miami herald,https://www.miamiherald.com/news/business/article223342450.html,"Excerpts from recent editorials in the United States and abroad:

The New York Times on a judge's rebuke of Michael Flynn and President Donald Trump's charitable foundation:

A bit of common sense and common decency intruded on Tuesday into the crazy world of Donald Trump.

In New York, the state attorney general announced that the president had agreed that the ""charity"" he used as a piggy bank has no reason to exist.

In Washington, a federal judge let a former top presidential aide know that you can parrot political spin or you can tell the truth, but you can't do both to someone who can send you to prison.

Michael Flynn, Mr. Trump's former national security adviser, appeared before Judge Emmet Sullivan to be sentenced to what he expected would be a term of probation, after pleading guilty to lying to federal investigators about conversations with the Russian ambassador. The office of the special counsel, Robert Mueller, had earlier filed a memo that said it would be right for Mr. Flynn to avoid prison after his extensive cooperation in the investigation of Trump ties to Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential campaign and after.

Then last week, in a memo about their client's sentencing, Mr. Flynn's lawyers implied that he had been tricked into lying and that the F.B.I. acted improperly in interviewing him -- points raised by pro-Trump commentators elaborating on the president's claims of being victimized by a witch hunt.

Judge Sullivan was having none of it.

""I cannot recall an instance of a court ever accepting a guilty plea from someone who did not maintain he was guilty,"" Judge Sullivan said, ""and I do not intend to start today.""

Chastened, Mr. Flynn told the judge that nobody tricked him, that he lied and that he knew he shouldn't have.

The judge was not upset only about Mr. Flynn's sneaky prevarication. He said he felt ""disgust"" at Mr. Flynn's offenses, that a retired three-star general would lie to the F.B.I. ""while on the physical premises of the White House,"" and, acting as an unregistered agent of a foreign country, Turkey, while he was an adviser to Mr. Trump (to which he admitted but was not charged). It was a bracing reminder of the brazenness of his misdeeds and of the standards the public should be able to expect of those who serve them.

Realizing that Judge Sullivan was considering a term of up to six months in prison, Mr. Flynn accepted his offer to delay the sentencing for 90 days until he has completed his cooperation with the special counsel.

""Good luck today in court to General Michael Flynn,"" Mr. Trump had tweeted first thing Tuesday morning.

""Thanks for nothing, Mr. President,"" Mr. Flynn might have thought as he left court.

Mr. Flynn should be grateful the judge offered him the chance to come clean. By contrast, the Donald J. Trump Foundation, a charity that provided no charity, quite properly received none from the New York attorney general's office.

Attorney General Barbara Underwood accused it of ""a shocking pattern of illegality"" that ""amounted to the Trump Foundation functioning as little more than a checkbook to serve Mr. Trump's business and political interests.""

Whatever money that remains will be disbursed under the supervision of Ms. Underwood's office and the judge overseeing the continuing lawsuit her office filed in June, seeking $2.8 million in restitution and a ban on Mr. Trump and his three oldest children serving on the boards of other nonprofit organizations.

In a series of stories exposing the foundation's true nature, The Washington Post found that its largest donation was to fix a fountain in front of the Plaza Hotel in Manhattan, which Mr. Trump owned at the time, that its funds were used to buy a portrait of Mr. Trump, and that it illegally provided political donations and paid for personal legal settlements.

All this comes just days after prosecutors announced that they believed that Mr. Trump had conspired with the owner of The National Enquirer and his fixer Michael Cohen to violate campaign finance laws by paying hush money to two women who said they had affairs with him. It's also just been reported that prosecutors are investigating spending by the Trump inaugural committee. The president still faces lawsuits on the constitutionality of his enriching himself while in office. Meanwhile, the special counsel's inquiry may be expanding rather than winding down.

It's fitting that despite all his bluster and threats, a president who's demonstrated such contempt for the rule of law is finding it so formidable.

That this goes to the essence of American governance was best summed up by Paula Duncan, the Trump enthusiast who was among the jurors who found Mr. Trump's former campaign chief Paul Manafort guilty of fraud, even though she had hoped he wouldn't be convicted.

Explaining her decision after the verdict, she told Fox News, ""No one's above the law.""

The Wall Street Journal on a judge's ruling on the Affordable Care Act's individual mandate:

No one opposes ObamaCare more than we do, and Democrats are now confirming that it was designed as a way-station to government-run health care. But a federal judge's ruling that the law is unconstitutional is likely to be overturned on appeal and may boomerang politically on Republicans.

Judge Reed O'Connor ruled for some 20 state plaintiffs that the Affordable Care Act's individual mandate is no longer legal because Republicans repealed its financial penalty as part of the 2017 tax reform. Recall that Chief Justice John Roberts joined four Justices to say ObamaCare's mandate was illegal as a command to individuals to buy insurance under the Commerce Clause. ""The Framers gave Congress the power to regulate commerce, not to compel it,"" he wrote.

Yet the Chief famously salvaged ObamaCare by unilaterally rewriting the mandate to be a ""tax"" that was within Congress's power. Never mind that Democrats had expressly said the penalty was not a tax. Majority Leader Roberts declared it to be so.

Enter Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, who argues in Texas v. U.S. that since Congress has repealed the mandate, the tax is no longer a tax, and ObamaCare is thus illegal. Judge O'Connor agreed with that logic, and he went further in ruling that since Congress said the mandate is crucial to the structure of ObamaCare, then all of ObamaCare must fall along with the mandate.

We'll admit to a certain satisfaction in seeing the Chief Justice hoist on his own logic. But his ruling in NFIB v. Sebelius was in 2012 and there is more at issue legally now than the ""tax"" issue in that opinion. One legal complication is that Congress in 2017 repealed the financial part of the individual mandate, not the structure of the mandate itself. Republicans used budget rules to pass tax reform so they couldn't repeal the mandate's express language.

The Affordable Care Act has also been up and running since 2014, which means so-called reliance interests come into play when considering a precedent. Millions of people now rely on ObamaCare's subsidies and rules, which argues against judges repealing the law by fiat.

Judge O'Connor breezes past this like a liberal Ninth Circuit appeals judge handling a Donald Trump appeal. He's right that Democrats claimed the individual mandate was essential to the Affordable Care Act. But when Congress killed the financial penalty in 2017 it left the rest of ObamaCare intact. When judging congressional intent, a judge must account for the amending Congress as well as the original Congress.

In any case, the Supreme Court's ""severability"" doctrine calls for restraint in declaring an entire law illegal merely because one part of it is. Our guess is that even the right-leaning Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals judges will overturn Judge O'Connor on this point.

As for the politics, Democrats claim to be alarmed by the ruling but the truth is they're elated. They want to use it to further pound Republicans for denying health insurance for pre-existing conditions if the law is overturned. Democrats campaigned across the country against Mr. Paxton's lawsuit to gain House and Senate seats in November, and they will now press votes in Congress so they can compound the gains in 2020.

President Trump hailed the ruling in a tweet, but he has never understood the Affordable Care Act. His Administration has done good work revising regulations to reduce health-care costs and increase access, but the risk is that the lawsuit will cause Republicans in Congress to panic politically and strike a deal with Democrats that reinforces ObamaCare. This is what happens when conservatives fall into the liberal trap of thinking they can use the courts to achieve policy goals that need to be won in Congress.

The Washington Post on withdrawing all 2,000 U.S. troops out of Syria:

PRESIDENT TRUMP'S sudden move to yank U.S. troops out of Syria undermined at a stroke several foreign policy goals he has championed. The president promised to finish the job of destroying the Islamic State, but the withdrawal will leave thousands of its fighters still in place. He vowed to roll back Iran's aggression across the Middle East, but his decision will allow its forces to entrench in the country that is the keystone of Tehran's ambitions. He promised to protect Israel, but that nation will now be left to face alone the buildup by Iran and its proxies along its northern border.

The president's top national security advisers had carefully developed and articulated a strategy of maintaining a U.S. presence in Syria until the Islamic State was beyond revival and Iran withdrew its forces -- a plan they were defending up until this week. Mr. Trump has again demonstrated, to them and to the world, that no U.S. policy or foreign commitment is immune from his whims.

Mr. Trump claimed the Islamic State had been defeated, but that is not the view of the Defense and State Departments. Thousands of jihadist fighters are still in Syria and control splotches of territory in the Euphrates Valley. A U.S. withdrawal will give the extremists an opportunity to reconstitute, as they did in Iraq following the premature U.S. withdrawal ordered by President Barack Obama.

Until Wednesday, a prime talking point of senior national security officials was that, ""if we've learned one thing over the years, (the) enduring defeat of a group like this means you can't just defeat their physical space and then leave,"" as the State Department's special envoy for the global campaign against the Islamic State, Brett McGurk, put it last week. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said it another way in September: ""Getting rid of the caliphate doesn't mean you then blindly say, 'Okay, we got rid of it,' march out, and then wonder why the caliphate comes back.""

Mr. Trump has justified some of his most controversial decisions, including his continued support for Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, as needed to contain Iran's threat to the United States and its allies. But the Syrian withdrawal hands Tehran and its ally Russia a windfall. Iran has deployed thousands of fighters and allied militiamen to Syria and aspires to create a corridor to Lebanon and the Mediterranean, as well as a new front against Israel along the Golan Heights. In reaction to that threat, Mr. Trump's national security adviser, John Bolton, announced Sept. 24 that ""We're not going to leave (Syria) as long as Iranian troops are outside Iranian borders, and that includes Iranian proxies and militias.""

U.S. ambitions in Syria have never been backed by adequate resources, and a case could be made that neither Congress nor the American public were prepared to support the mission suggested by Mr. Bolton. But Mr. Trump's decision appears to have been precipitated by the bellicose rhetoric of Turkey's Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who last week threatened -- not for the first time -- a military operation against Syrian Kurds, even though U.S. troops are positioned around them. The autocratic Turkish ruler appears to have extracted multiple favors from Mr. Trump in recent days, including the sale of U.S. Patriot missiles and a promise to reexamine the possible extradition of his rival, Fethullah Gulen, from Pennsylvania. If Mr. Trump received anything in return, he hasn't disclosed it.

The Syrian Kurdish forces, which have fought alongside the United States and played a crucial role in liberating most of eastern Syria from the jihadists, will be perhaps the foremost victims of Mr. Trump's decision. Betrayed by Washington, they will now be subject to a military offensive by Turkey. The stab in the back will send an unforgettable message to all who are asked to cooperate with the United States in the fight against terrorism: Washington is an unreliable and dangerous partner.

The Orange County (California) Register on Mick Mulvaney as Trump's choice for chief of staff:

President Trump has found a new chief of staff, albeit an interim one, in his director of the Office of Management and Budget, Mick Mulvaney.

That of chief is a terribly important post, perhaps government's most consequential aside from that of his boss. In theory, at least, the chief of staff is the gatekeeper for everything the president does, everyone he sees, everyone he talks to on the phone.

Perhaps, though few would expect this to be the case, the arbiter of every time he sends out a tweet, and of what it should say.

A Washington insider, a former congressman, Mulvaney is in many ways ideal for the job. He wants it, badly, whereas others with similarly impressive resumes touted for the job have indicated a strong desire to spend more time with their families, from Vice President Pence's staff chief Nick Ayers of Georgia to former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie.

Mulvaney shares the conservative values currently espoused by the president and was a founder of the House Freedom Caucus in 2013, the group that always taunted the Republican leadership, opposing much government funding, including debt limit increases and budget agreements made with the Democrats.

But he also, after Trump secured the Republican nomination in 2016, called the candidate ""a terrible human being"" who he only was voting for out of an even greater dislike of Hillary Clinton.

It's not as if other presidential allies of today haven't said bad things about him in the past. On the campaign trail, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz called his rival ""a narcissist at a level I don't think this country's ever seen,"" for instance.

But if you were the nation's chief executive -- or the CEO of a much smaller entity, for that matter -- could you hire as your top aide and work with a person who had once dubbed you ""terrible""?

Or does this kind of talk come with the territory in politics, where many strange bedfellows are made because of having to run in elections against once and perhaps future allies? Should Trump indeed elevate this practical choice for staff chief to permanent status immediately?

Los Angeles Times on banning bump stocks, which allow semi-automatic weapons to fire like machine guns:

The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives said Tuesday that it had finalized a rule reclassifying so-called bump stocks -- the devices that can make a semiautomatic rifle fire nearly as quickly a fully automatic weapon -- as machine guns, which makes it illegal to manufacture, sell or possess them. The agency said a year ago it had the authority to reclassify the devices, and President Trump -- in the wake of the Parkland, Fla., school shooting -- directed the ATF to speed up the process. Tuesday's announcement -- a rare bit of welcome news from the Trump administration -- makes it official; White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters that owners of the conversion devices will have until March 21 to destroy them or turn them in to the ATF.

This is a good step. Unfortunately, it's all but certain to be challenged in the courts, and it's on shaky legal ground because of the way the new rule evolved. The Obama administration determined that because bump stocks have ""no automatically functioning mechanical parts and (perform) no automated mechanical functions when installed,"" they did not fit the definition of a machine gun in federal law, which meant the ATF lacked the authority to regulate them. Tuesday's announcement, by contrast, hinges not on the technical specifications, but on the functionality. In essence, if it fires like a machine gun, it's a machine gun. Cue the lawyers.

We hope the administration prevails in whatever challenges emerge, but the sure-fire way to resolve this would be for Congress to legislate bump stocks and related gadgets out of existence. Such devices serve no function other than to evade the strict congressional limit on machine guns by, as the ATF said, harnessing ""the recoil energy of the semiautomatic firearm in a manner that allows the trigger to reset and continue firing"" without the shooter having to pull the trigger for each shot.

A mass shooter in Las Vegas used bump stocks affixed to semiautomatic rifles to fire more than 1,000 rounds in a matter of minutes from a 32nd-floor suite of the Mandalay Bay Hotel into a crowd of some 20,000 people, killing 58 concertgoers and injuring hundreds of others. It was the largest single mass shooting in the modern era, drawing attention to bump stocks and sparking outraged demands by many -- the Los Angeles Times included -- that the devices be banned.

As welcome as this new rule is, it will do little to corral our national problem with gun violence. The vast majority of gun deaths come in ones and twos, led by suicides. ...

But it is progress. And the president deserves credit for sticking with his promise to find a way to ban bump stocks. ...

China Daily says telecommunications giant Huawei is a victim of U.S. panic attacks:

This year has not been an annus mirabilis for China's Huawei Technologies Ltd, the world's largest supplier of telecommunications network equipment and second-biggest maker of smartphones.

Although it has been constantly in the news and it is said there is no such thing as bad publicity, it has been making headlines because of the spurious claims it somehow poses a threat to the West, even world peace. It has never been explained exactly how.

In fact it is not because of anything it has done, but because its success has brought it into the crosshairs of the United States' anxiety attacks against China.

Huawei is at the forefront of 5G technology. This latest generation mobile network technology promises to bring the much anticipated and heralded internet of things to life and the US is determined to be the 5G leader.

Not only because whichever country develops the technology that is adopted as standard will have a huge commercial advantage. But also because by setting the standard it will have a knowledge advantage.

As a result, first the US and then one after another its most obedient allies have blocked Huawei from entering their 5G markets on security grounds.

None of them have offered any specific justification for blocking Huawei. They just repeat their claim that the company poses a security risk. That is why objective observers have concluded that those countries are politicizing a commercial issue.

It sets a harmful precedent. What if other countries used the same excuse to block US companies (not confined to the telecom sector)? The US companies are very competitive in many fields, including those that could pose huge security risks, such as finance.

While Huawei will not go unscathed from being prevented from entering key markets, as a competitive player, it still has a vast market to access in other parts of the world. It has signed contracts to supply 5G equipment to 25 telecom carriers, and more than 10,000 5G base stations have been shipped.

In stark contrast to the US and its allies, India for instance, has invited Huawei to conduct 5G trials in the country and complimented it on the role it has played in helping to develop its telecom industry.

The efforts of the US and its allies to try to shield their companies against a Chinese competitor are politically motivated, not the result of a fact-based or transparent decision-making process. And they are counterproductive to the concerted efforts that are needed to ensure the security of 5G networks."

Euro currency remains a work in progress on 20th birthday

FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- The euro is about to celebrate its 20th birthday, but the countries that use it are still wrestling with how the shared currency should work and how to fix flaws exposed by the debt crisis that marred its second decade.

The euro was launched on Jan. 1, 1999, when 10 countries fixed their exchange rates to it and handed decisions on interest rates to the newly-founded European Central Bank. Euro notes and coins went into circulation three years later.

The shared currency was seen as a solution to the constant quarrels over exchange rates that had marked European politics after World War II and as a logical extension of the European Union's tariff-free trade zone. Britain, notably, opted out, but 19 of 28 EU countries use the euro.

North Korea's 'Singapore shops' expose gap in sanctions push

PYONGYANG, North Korea (AP) -- Despite the unwanted publicity of a criminal trial for one of their main suppliers, business is booming at Pyongyang's 'Singapore shops,' which sell everything from Ukrainian vodka to brand-name knock-offs from China. The stores stock many of the very things United Nations' sanctions banning trade in luxury goods are intended to block and provide a nagging reminder that not all potential trade partners are lining up behind the U.N.'s pronouncements or the Trump administration's policy of maximum pressure on the North.

Especially when there's a buck -- or a few million bucks -- to be made.

US pending home sales slipped 0.7 percent in November

WASHINGTON (AP) -- Fewer Americans signed contracts to buy homes in November as higher mortgage rates and prices continued to squeeze would-be buyers out of the market.

The National Association of Realtors said Friday that its pending home sales index dipped 0.7 percent last month to 101.4. The index based on contract signings has dropped 7.7 percent over the past year and has recorded 11 straight year-over-year decreases.

Tesla names Oracle's Ellison to board in SEC settlement

NEW YORK (AP) -- Tesla named Oracle's Larry Ellison and an executive from Walgreens to its board Friday as part of a settlement with U.S. regulators who demanded more oversight of CEO Elon Musk.

Ellison and Kathleen Wilson-Thompson, an executive vice president at Walgreens Boots Alliance, join the board as independent directors, effective immediately.

Musk got into trouble with the Securities and Exchange Commission in early August when he said in a tweet that he had ""funding secured"" to take the electric car company private at $420 per share.

GOP and Democrats trade blame for shutdown, no deal in sight

WASHINGTON (AP) -- The partial government shutdown will almost certainly be handed off to a divided government to solve in the new year, as both parties traded blame Friday and President Donald Trump sought to raise the stakes in the weeklong impasse.

As agreement eludes Washington in the waning days of the Republican monopoly on power, it sets up the first big confrontation between Trump and newly empowered Democrats. Trump is sticking with his demand for money to build a border wall with Mexico, and Democrats, who take control of the House on Jan. 3, are refusing to give him what he wants.

Trump raised the stakes on Friday, reissuing threats to shut the U.S.-Mexico border to pressure Congress to fund the wall and to shut off aid to three Central American countries from which many migrants have fled.

EPA proposes easing regulation of mercury from coal plants

WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Environmental Protection Agency is considering backing off of its regulation of toxic mercury emissions from coal-fired power plants.

In an announcement Friday, the EPA proposes what would be another Trump administration rollback of federal enforcement under the Clean Air Act. It's the latest administration effort on behalf of the country's coal industry.

Wall Street faces annual losses despite solid gains for week

Wall Street capped a week of volatile trading Friday with an uneven finish and the market's first weekly gain since November. Still, a rough month of December has erased all the market's 2018 gains and nudged the S&P 500 closer to its worst year since 2008.

The S&P 500 index fell 3.09 points, or 0.1 percent, to 2,485.74. The Dow Jones Industrial Average dropped 76.42 points, or 0.3 percent, to 23,062.40. The Nasdaq added 5.03 points, or 0.1 percent, to 6,584.52.

195,miami herald,https://www.miamiherald.com/news/business/article224277975.html,"The government shutdown has suspended federal cleanups at Superfund sites around the nation and forced the cancellation of public hearings, deepening the mistrust and resentment of surrounding residents who feel people in power long ago abandoned them to live among the toxic residue of the country's factories and mines.

""We are already hurting, and it's just adding more fuel to the fire,"" says 40-year-old Keisha Brown, whose wood-frame home is in a community nestled among coking plants and other factories on Birmingham's north side.

The mostly African-American community has been forced to cope with high levels of arsenic, lead and other contaminants in the soil that the Environmental Protection Agency has been scraping up and carting away, house by house.

As President Donald Trump and Congress battle over Trump's demand for a wall on the southern U.S. border, the nearly 3-week-old partial government shutdown has stopped federal work on Superfund sites except for cases where the administration deems ""there is an imminent threat to the safety of human life or to the protection of property.""

EPA's shutdown plans said the agency would evaluate about 800 Superfund sites to see how many could pose an immediate threat. As an example of that kind of threat, it cited an acid leak from a mine that could threaten the public water supply. That's the hazard at Northern California's Iron Mountain mine, where EPA workers help prevent an unending flow of lethally acidic runoff off the Superfund site from spilling into rivers downstream.

Practically speaking, said Bonnie Bellow, a former EPA official who worked on Superfund public outreach at the agency, the impact of the stoppage of work at sites across the nation ""wholly depends"" on the length of the shutdown.

""Unless there is immediate risk like a storm, a flood, a week or two of slowdowns is not going to very likely affect the cleanup at the site,"" Bellow said.

In north Birmingham, Brown said it's been a couple of weeks since she's spotted any EPA crews at people's houses. It wasn't clear if state workers or contractors were continuing work.

But long before the shutdown began, Brown harbored doubts the cleanup was working anyway. ""My main concern is the health of the people out here,"" said Brown, who has asthma. ""All of us are sick, and we've got to function on medicine every day.""

In terms of time, the federal government shutdown is a chronological blip in the long history of the site -- which includes ethics charges in a local bribery scandal to block federal cleanup efforts -- but adds to the uncertainty in an area where residents feel forgotten and betrayed.

At the EPA, the shutdown has furloughed the bulk of the agency's roughly 14,000 employees. It also means the EPA isn't getting most of the daily stream of environmental questions and tips from the public. Routine inspections aren't happening. State, local and private emails to EPA officials often get automated messages back promising a response when the shutdown ends.

In Montana, for instance, state officials this month found themselves fielding calls from a tribal member worried about drinking water with a funny look to it, said Kristi Ponozzo, public-policy director at that state's Department of Environmental Quality. The EPA normally provides tribes with technical assistance on water supplies.

With most EPA colleagues idled, Ponozzo said, her agency also had to call off an environmental review meeting for a mining project, potentially delaying the project.

But it's the agency's work at Superfund sites -- lessening the threat from old nuclear-weapons plants, chemical factories, mines and other entities -- that gets much of the attention.

Absent imminent peril, it would be up to state governments or contractors to continue any cleanup during the shutdown ""up to the point that additional EPA direction or funding is needed,"" the EPA said in a statement.

""Sites where cleanup activities have been stopped or shut down will be secured until cleanup activities are able to commence when the federal government reopens,"" the agency said.

For federal Superfund sites in Michigan, the shutdown means there are no EPA colleagues to consult, said Scott Dean, a spokesman for that state's Department of Environmental Quality.

At Michigan Superfund sites, day-to-day field operations were continuing since private contractors do most of the on-the-ground work, Dean said.

Bellow, the former EPA official, said the cancellation of hearings about Superfund sites posed immediate concerns.

In East Chicago, Indiana, for example, the EPA called off a planned public hearing set for last Wednesday to outline how the agency planned to clean up high levels of lead and arsenic in the soil.

The EPA has proposed a seven-month, $26.5 million cleanup that includes treating and removing tainted soil from the area, where a lead smelter previously was located.

During a public meeting Nov. 29, some residents complained that the EPA's approach would leave too much pollution in place. But others didn't get a chance to speak and were hoping to do so at the meeting this week, said Debbie Chizewer, a Northwestern University environmental attorney who represents community groups in the low-income area.

The EPA announced the cancellation in an online notice and gave no indication that it would be rescheduled.

Leaders of the East Chicago Calumet Community Advisory Group asked for a new hearing date and an extension of a Jan. 14 public comment deadline in a letter to the EPA's regional Superfund division.

Calls by The Associated Press to the agency's regional office in Chicago this week were not answered.

Local critics fear the EPA will use the delay caused by the shutdown as justification for pushing ahead with a cleanup strategy they consider flawed, Chizewer said, even though the agency has designated the affected area as an ""environmental justice community"" -- a low-income community of color that has been disproportionately harmed by pollution.

The EPA has a ""special obligation"" when dealing with such communities, Chizewer said. ""This would be an example of shutting them out for no good reason.""

In North Birmingham, former longtime neighborhood resident Charlie Powell said most of the people living in and around the Superfund site had already ""just got tired and fed up.""

Powell left the area but started a group called PANIC, People Against Neighborhood Industrial Contamination. He believes money would be better spent helping residents move away from the pollution.

""Can I say hell?"" Powell said when asked what residents have been through.

President Donald Trump said he won't relent on the partial government shutdown unless Congress funds his proposed border wall, and wouldn't say whether he'd accept less than $5 billion for the project.

""Whatever it takes,"" he told reporters accompanying him Wednesday on an unannounced visit to US troops deployed at an air base in Iraq. ""We're going to have a wall. We're going to have safety.""

A deal to fund shuttered government departments still seemed out of reach Wednesday, the fifth day of the partial shutdown. The Republican House leadership informed members not to expect any votes on Thursday, with no indication that votes will be scheduled Friday. The new Congress begins on Jan. 3 with House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi appearing to have secured enough votes from her party to become speaker.

Trump blamed Pelosi of California for prolonging the shutdown.

""Nancy Pelosi is calling the shots, not Chuck,"" Trump said, referring to Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer of New York. ""And Chuck wants to have this done, I really believe that. But she's calling the shots, and she's calling them because she wants the votes and probably if they do something she's not going to get the votes and she's not going to speaker of the House and that would not be good for her.""

The House, while still under Republican control, passed a bill that includes more than $5 billion for the wall, which would be built along the US-Mexico border, but it didn't have enough support in the Senate. Democrats have held firm in their opposition to giving Trump money for the wall, and there's been no public indication that Pelosi risks an erosion of Democratic support over the negotiations.

Trump declined to say whether he would accept $2 billion for new fencing, as is said to have proposed to Schumer. ""I'm not going to talk about it now,"" he said.

Vice President Mike Pence is said to have proposed $2.1 billion for new border barriers in an offer to Democrats, along with $400 million for other Trump immigration priorities.

Congressional Republicans were still waiting to hear an counteroffer from Democrats to Pence's proposal, according to a GOP aide.

Matt Schlapp, head of the American Conservative Union and a White House ally, said the standoff won't be any easier to solve with Pelosi presiding over the House of Representatives.

""I don't believe that there's a deal in the near term,"" Schlapp said in a phone interview. ""Do I think the dynamics are going to change much come the new year? I do not.""

Schlapp said there could be a way to get congressional Republicans to agree to a bill like the Senate passed last week that provides temporary funding at current levels, but Trump would look for other ways to fund the wall on the southern border. Pelosi previously reminded the White House that any attempt to ""reprogram"" government funds -- that is, use resources for a purpose other than that which was appropriated -- would have to be approved by Congress.

Schlapp said the chances that Republicans would put up enough votes to override a presidential veto ""are pretty much nil.""

""The 2020 election has already started,"" he said. ""It is all about the wall, it's all about border security, it's all about promises of 2016 that the Democrats oppose mightily and it's going to be a very interesting year."""
197,miami herald,https://www.miamiherald.com/news/nation-world/article223193915.html,"White House digs in on border wall demand, risking shutdown

WASHINGTON (AP) -- The White House on Sunday pushed the federal government closer to the brink of a partial shutdown later this week, digging in on its demand for $5 billion to build a border wall as congressional Democrats stood firm against it.

""We're going to do whatever is necessary to build the border wall to stop this ongoing crisis of illegal immigration,"" said White House senior adviser Stephen Miller.

Asked if that meant having a government shutdown, he said: ""If it comes to it, absolutely.""

Trump said last week he would be ""proud"" to have a shutdown to get Congress to approve a $5 billion down payment to fulfill his campaign promise to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. But the president doesn't have the votes from the Republican-controlled Congress to support funding for the wall at that level.

Democratic congressional leaders, Sen. Chuck Schumer and Rep. Nancy Pelosi, have proposed no more than $1.6 billion, as outlined in a bipartisan Senate bill. The money would not go for the wall but for fencing upgrades and other border security. Democrats also offered to simply keep funding at its current level, $1.3 billion.

Trump lawyer Giuliani rules out Mueller interview with Trump

WASHINGTON (AP) -- With a number of probes moving closer to the Oval Office, President Donald Trump and his attorney unleashed a fresh series of attacks on the investigators, questioning their integrity while categorically ruling out the possibility of a presidential interview with the special counsel.

Trump and Rudy Giuliani used Twitter and television interviews Sunday to deliver a series of broadsides against special counsel Robert Mueller and federal prosecutors in New York. Giuliani said he was ""disgusted"" by the tactics used by Mueller in his probe into Russian election interference, including in securing guilty pleas from the president's former national security adviser Michael Flynn on a charge of lying to federal investigators.

Trump, Giuliani said, would not submit to an interview by Mueller's team.

""They're a joke,"" Giuliani told ""Fox News Sunday."" ''Over my dead body, but, you know, I could be dead.""

The special counsel, who is investigating possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russia, has continued to request an interview with the president. Last month, the White House sent written answers in response to the special counsel's questions about possible collusion. The White House has resisted answering questions on possible obstruction of justice.

Child's death highlights communication barriers on border

Shortly before a 7-year-old Guatemalan girl died in U.S. custody, her father signed a form stating that his daughter was in good health. But it's unclear how much the man understood on the form, which was written in English and read to him in Spanish by Border Patrol agents.

The death of Jakelin Caal highlights the communication challenges along the U.S.-Mexico border as agents come in contact with an increasing number of migrants who speak neither English nor Spanish.

Her father's native language is the Mayan tongue known as Q'eqchi'. His second language is Spanish. It's unclear whether something was lost in translation or whether it would have made a difference in saving Jakelin after the two were detained and underwent a health screening along a remote stretch of U.S.-Mexico border. But the case raises questions about the Border Patrol's use of English-only forms.

All agents are required to speak Spanish, and they receive formal Spanish training. Reading forms in Spanish is often enough to pose basic questions. But some other Spanish-speaking migrants reported signing paperwork that they later said they did not understand.

Scores of immigrant parents who were separated from their children after crossing the border in the spring said they signed forms agreeing to be deported with the understanding that their kids would be returning with them, only to find themselves deported without them. Many had to wait months before being reunited with them in their homelands.

Talks adopt 'rulebook' to put Paris climate deal into action

KATOWICE, Poland (AP) -- Almost 200 nations, including the world's top greenhouse gas producers, China and the United States, have adopted a set of rules meant to breathe life into the 2015 Paris climate accord by setting out how countries should report their emissions and efforts to reduce them.

But negotiators delayed other key decisions until next year -- a move that frustrated environmentalists and countries that wanted more ambitious goals in light of scientists' warnings that the world must shift sharply away from fossil fuels in the coming decade.

""The majority of the rulebook for the Paris agreement has been created, which is something to be thankful for,"" said Mohamed Adow, a climate policy expert at Christian Aid. ""But the fact countries had to be dragged kicking and screaming to the finish line shows that some nations have not woken up"" to the dire consequences of global warming as outlined in a report by the U.N Panel on Climate Change, or IPCC.

Officials at the talks, which ended late Saturday in the Polish city of Katowice, agreed upon universal rules on how nations can cut emissions. Poor countries secured assurances on financial support to help them reduce emissions, adapt to changes such as rising sea levels and pay for damage that has already happened.

""Through this package, you have made a thousand little steps forward together,"" said Michal Kurtyka, a senior Polish official who led the talks.

French city honors victims of Christmas market attack

PARIS (AP) -- People filled a square in the French city of Strasbourg on Sunday to show respect and sympathy for the victims of last week's shooting attack near a famous Christmas market as the death toll rose to five.

French authorities said a Polish man died in a Strasbourg hospital Sunday, one of a dozen people wounded in last Tuesday's attack. Poland's Foreign Ministry extended condolences Sunday on Twitter to his family.

According to the newspaper DNA, more than 1,000 people attended the memorial, which ended with a minute of applause and a rendition of France's national anthem, ""La Marseillaise.""

The hour-long ceremony took place in Kleber Square, not far from where a gunman opened fire on Tuesday evening. Strasbourg Mayor Roland Ries praised the city's resilience in the face of hardship.

The ""extremely large crowd in the Christmas market"" on Saturday ""was an illustration of our commitment to these values ??on which our living together is based, which we will continue to defend against all those who want to attack it,"" Ries said.

Not into bingo, 84-year-old Texas woman gets college degree

RICHARDSON, Texas (AP) -- After raising five kids and retiring at age 77 from her secretarial job, Janet Fein couldn't be blamed for finally relaxing, but that's not her.

Fein, now 84, went to back to school and will accomplish a long-held goal this week when she graduates from the University of Texas at Dallas with a bachelor's degree.

""I didn't have anything to do in retirement and I didn't think that playing bingo was up to my speed,"" said Fein, who majored in sociology because she felt it was ""substantial.""

She said she enjoyed all the reading and writing papers. ""With each class I already knew a lot, but then I also learned a lot. And that made me happy,"" she said.

People 65 and older make up less than one percent of U.S. college students. In 2015, they accounted for about 67,000 of about 20 million college students, according to the National Center for Education Statistics.

Next-generation of GPS satellites are headed to space

DENVER (AP) -- After months of delays, the U.S. Air Force is about to launch the first of a new generation of GPS satellites, designed to be more accurate, secure and versatile.

But some of their most highly touted features will not be fully available until 2022 or later because of problems in a companion program to develop a new ground control system for the satellites, government auditors said.

The satellite is scheduled to lift off Tuesday from Cape Canaveral, Florida, aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. It's the first of 32 planned GPS III satellites that will replace older ones now in orbit. Lockheed Martin is building the new satellites outside Denver.

GPS is best-known for its widespread civilian applications, from navigation to time-stamping bank transactions. The Air Force estimates that 4 billion people worldwide use the system.

But it was developed by the U.S. military, which still designs, launches and operates the system. The Air Force controls a constellation of 31 GPS satellites from a high-security complex at Schriever Air Force Base outside Colorado Springs.

After fraud probe, new primary may replace GOP candidate

RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- Legislation quickly passed by North Carolina's lawmakers this week would prepare a path for Republicans to dump their nominee in a still-undecided U.S. House race marred with ballot fraud allegations.

""I think (legislators are) worried that Mark Harris might be damaged goods and they want to have the opportunity to have a different Republican nominee,"" said Carter Wrenn, a Republican operative and consultant to former U.S. Sen. Jesse Helms and others for more than 40 years. ""That's how I read those tea leaves.""

If the state elections board decides ballot irregularities or other problems cast the true outcome into doubt and force a redo, the legislation -- if allowed to go into law by Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper -- would require new primary elections in the 9th Congressional District race, in addition to a new general election.

That would allow Republicans another look at Mark Harris, the Republican who led Democrat Dan McCready by 905 votes in unofficial results. Harris hasn't been certified the winner, and an investigation is looking into missing absentee ballots in rural Bladen County and whether unsealed ballots illegally handled by collection teams there could have been altered.

Bladen was the only county among the eight within the 9th District where Harris won a majority of mail-in absentee ballots over McCready.

Top of mind: 'Justice' is Merriam-Webster's word of the year

NEW YORK (AP) -- Racial justice. Obstruction of justice. Social justice. The Justice Department. Merriam-Webster has chosen ""justice"" as its 2018 word of the year, driven by the churning news cycle over months and months.

The word follows ""toxic,"" picked by Oxford Dictionaries, and ""misinformation,"" plucked by Dictonary.com.

Peter Sokolowski, Merriam-Webster's editor at large, told The Associated Press ahead of Monday's announcement that ""justice"" consistently bubbled into the top 20 or 30 lookups on the company's website, spiking at times due to specific events but also skating close to the surface for much of the year.

While it's one of those common words people likely know how to spell and use correctly in a sentence, Sokolowski pointed to other reasons that drive search traffic. Among them is an attempt to focus a train of thought around a philosophical problem, or to seek aspirational motivation. Such well-known words are often among the most looked up every year, including those that are slightly abstract, including ""love,"" he said.

The designation for ""justice"" came soon after President Trump's one-time fixer, Michael Cohen, was sentenced to three years in prison for crimes that included arranging the payment of hush money to conceal his boss' alleged sexual affairs. He told a judge he agreed time and again to cover up Trump's ""dirty deeds"" out of ""blind loyalty.""

'Spider-Verse' swings to the top; 'Mortal Engines' tanks

LOS ANGELES (AP) -- ""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse"" swung to the top of the domestic box office in its first weekend in theaters, proving that there is widespread audience interest in big screen animated versions of Marvel's marquee superheroes.

The film led a host of newcomers that debuted to varying success on this pre-Christmas holiday weekend, including Clint Eastwood's drug smuggling drama ""The Mule"" and the Peter Jackson-produced epic ""Mortal Engines"" which bombed in North American theaters.

""Into the Spider-Verse"" earned an estimated $35.4 million from 3,813 theaters against a $90 million production budget according to Sony Pictures on Sunday, which is a record for animated movies in December (although the hybrid ""Alvin and the Chipmunks"" movies were higher). The film features an innovative animation style -- both CGI and hand-drawn -- and focuses on the Miles Morales character as he learns to become the famed web-slinger. It's another financial win for the studio's latest ""expanded Spider-Man universe"" strategy following ""Venom"" and ""Spider-Man: Homecoming.""

198,talking points memo,https://talkingpointsmemo.com/news/graham-trump-wall-negotiations,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Republican lawmaker advising President Donald Trump said he is encouraging the president to reopen the government for several weeks to continue negotiating with Democrats over funding for a U.S.-Mexico border wall before the president takes the more drastic step of declaring a national emergency.

But that may be wishful thinking, given that Sen. Lindsey Graham also says Trump still wants to reach a deal for the wall before agreeing to reopen shuttered government departments. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a leading Democratic negotiator, insists that Trump reopen the government first.

The weeks-old standoff over funding led to the partial government shutdown that hit day 23 on Sunday without an end in sight.

""Before he pulls the plug on the legislative option, and I think we're almost there, I would urge him to open up the government for a short period of time, like three weeks, before he pulls the plug, see if we can get a deal,"" said Graham, a South Carolina Republican. ""If we can't at the end of three weeks, all bets are off.""

""See if he can do it by himself through the emergency powers. That's my recommendation,"" added Graham, who has publicly pushed Trump to use his authority to declare a national emergency to build the wall. Such a step would allow Trump to bypass Congress and tap various pots of unspent federal money, including for military construction and disaster relief and from asset seized by law enforcement, to pay for the wall.

Trump has kept Washington on edge over whether he would resort to such a declaration, citing what he says is a ""crisis"" of drug smuggling and the trafficking of women and children at the border. The president initially sounded as though such a move was imminent, but then pulled back. He has said several times since he first mentioned the idea in public earlier this month that he prefers to try to reach a deal with Congress.

A key question is how much more time is Trump willing to give lawmakers. Graham, who said he and Trump talked by telephone on Sunday morning, said the legislative path ""is just about shut off"" and blamed Pelosi.

The speaker's office had no immediate comment.

Democrats oppose an emergency declaration but may be powerless to block it. Some Republicans are wary, too, fearing how a future Democratic president might use that authority. Such a move, should Trump ultimately go that route, would almost certainly be challenged in the courts.

Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., called Graham's idea to reopen the government a ""great place to start.""

""I do think if we reopen the government, if the president ends this shutdown crisis, we have folks who can negotiate a responsible, modern investment in technology that will actually make us safer,"" Coons said.

Trump has maintained that the border cannot be secured without a wall.

Graham said he thinks Trump is willing to accept the $5.7 billion he has insisted on for the wall, along with some immigration measures Democrats might find acceptable, such as helping immigrants who were illegally brought to the U.S. as children.

Trump has expressed interest in a broader immigration overhaul, but says he first wants the Supreme Court to address the class of immigrants known as ""Dreamers."" Pelosi also has shown no interest in accepting a wall -- she has called it an ""immorality"" -- in exchange for immigration fixes.

And, Trump, who was holed up in the White House as snow blanketed Washington on Sunday, appeared to shoot down Graham's suggestion of a ""wall plus"" deal, saying on Twitter that even Democrats don't want to make ""Dreamers"" part of the negotiations.

""The damage done to our Country from a badly broken Border - Drugs, Crime and so much that is bad - is far greater than a Shutdown, which the Dems can easily fix as soon as they come back to Washington!"" Trump said in a separate tweet.

The White House has been laying the groundwork for an emergency declaration, feared by members of both parties.

Senate Homeland Security Committee Chairman Ron Johnson, R-Wis., said he would ""hate to see"" a declaration because then the wall wouldn't get built, presumably because of legal challenges. Democrats voted in the past for border security and should again, he said.

""I actually want to see this wall get built,"" Johnson said. ""I want to keep pressure on Democrats to actually come to the negotiating table in good faith and fund what they have supported in the past.""

But Graham, who favors a presidential declaration, said the time for talk is running out.

""It's the last option, not the first option, but we're pretty close to that being the only option,"" he said.

199,reuters india,https://in.reuters.com/article/usa-shutdown-idINKCN1P81GM,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A partial government shutdown entered its 24th day on Monday as talks between U.S. President Donald Trump and congressional Democrats remained stalled even as some of Trump's fellow Republicans called on the president to cut a deal and strains mounted nationwide.

Trump appeared unmoved to act, however, retweeting criticism of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer that urged the top Democratic leaders to negotiate with him over funding for his long-promised wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.

""I've been waiting all weekend. Democrats must get to work now. Border must be secured!"" Trump wrote in an early morning tweet on Monday.

Democrats have rejected Trump's demand for $5.7 billion for the border wall in addition to other border funds but have said they would support $1.3 billion to bolster border security in other ways, including beefing up the number of Border Patrol agents and increasing surveillance.

About one-quarter of the U.S. government shut down last month as Republicans controlled both chambers of Congress as well as the White House. In December Trump said he would take responsibility for the shutdown but has since shifted the blame to Democrats. A growing proportion of Americans blame Trump for the closures, a Reuters/Ipsos poll found.

He now must win concessions from the Democrats, who took over the U.S. House of Representatives this month following November's elections. He also must win over enough Senate Democrats to secure the 60 votes needed to pass funding legislation there.

The stress from the shutdown became more visible as 800,000 federal employees across the United States missed their first paychecks on Friday. The cut government services also affected travelers as a jump in unscheduled absences among federal airport security screeners forced partial closures of airports in Houston and Miami.

National parks also remain shuttered, food and drug inspections have been curtailed and key economic data is on hold, among other impacts. Federal courts are set to run out of money on Friday.

Later on Monday, Trump is scheduled to address a New Orleans gathering of farmers, a key bloc of Trump supporters who have been hit by the shutdown as federal loan and farm aid applications have stalled and key farming and crop data has been delayed.

Republican U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham, who last week had called on Trump to declare a national emergency as a way to get money to build his wall, on Sunday urged the president to instead reopen the government for a short period of time in an effort to restart talks before taking such action.

Declaring a national emergency over immigration issues is fiercely opposed by Democrats and remains unpopular with some Republicans. It also would likely face an immediate legal challenge.

Pelosi called on the Republican-led Senate to vote on several bills passed earlier this month by the House to fund affected departments that do not include money for Trump's wall. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said he will not take up any legislation that does not have Trump's support.

Representatives for Schumer could not be immediately reached for comment on Monday.

Both the Senate and the House were scheduled to reconvene on Monday afternoon, despite a weekend winter storm shuttered much of the Washington area and it remained unclear what, if any, steps lawmakers might take to address the lapsed funding measures for affected agencies.

Senator Chris Coons on Monday reiterated fellow Democrats' call for Trump to reopen the government while negotiations over the wall and immigration continue.

He acknowledged efforts by Graham and other Republicans to forge a temporary solution but said Trump has been unpredictable even among fellow conservatives with ever-shifting positions.

""Every time they make progress, the president throws cold water on it,"" Coons told CNN in an interview."

Sen. Lindsey Graham is encouraging Trump to reopen government for several weeks to continue negotiating with Democrats over the border wall Trump wants to build on the U.S.-Mexico border.

201,miami herald,https://www.miamiherald.com/news/business/article224126560.html,"The Latest on President Donald Trump and the partial government shutdown (all times local):

3:45 p.m.

Top Democrats say President Donald Trump walked out of a meeting with congressional leaders as talks to end the partial government shutdown remain at an impasse.

Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said Trump asked House Speaker Nancy Pelosi at Wednesday's White House meeting whether she would agree to fund his wall.

When she said ""no,"" Schumer says, Trump got up and said, ""Then we have nothing to discuss."" Schumer says, ""And he just walked out.""

Schumer is calling Trump's actions ""really, really unfortunate.""

Trump is also weighing in on the meeting by tweet, calling it ""a total waste of time.""

He tweets that once Pelosi rejected his long-stalled border wall, he ""said bye-bye, nothing else works!""

Congressional leaders from both parties have returned to the White House for another round of negotiations with President Donald Trump on the ongoing partial government shutdown.

The two sides have made no apparent progress in the past week, with Trump sticking to his demand of $5.7 billion for a border barrier and Democrats insisting they won't give him the money.

Trump has been making a public case that there is a ""crisis"" at the southern border. And he's still threatening to declare a national emergency to circumvent Congress if he can't get the wall money from them.

He told reporters during a visit to the Capitol earlier Wednesday that he may turn to a declaration ""at some point"" if top Democrats Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi ""don't agree"" with his assessment about the problems at the border.

President Donald Trump says Republicans are ""totally unified"" in the shutdown standoff over his long-promised southern border wall, though some GOP lawmakers have been expressing concern about the 19-day partial government closure.

Trump traveled to Capitol Hill on Wednesday to meet with Senate Republicans. He says there was ""no discussion about anything other than solidarity.""

Trump has been considering a national emergency declaration to bypass Congress to build the wall. He says he ""may do that at some point"" if he can't get a deal with Democrats.

Trump also plans to meet with top congressional Democrats and Republicans at the White House on Wednesday.

President Donald Trump arrived on Capitol Hill claiming he has ""tremendous"" support as he headed into a meeting with Republican senators uneasy with the government shutdown over his border wall.

Asked how long the shutdown would last, Trump told reporters Wednesday ""whatever it takes.""

The partial shutdown is now in its 19th day, the second longest ever.

Trump and Vice President Mike Pence arrived for the private lunch meeting with the Senate GOP caucus to shore up support.

Several Republican senators have said the government should be re-opened while talks continue over border security and Trump's demand for money to build the wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.

President Donald Trump says he thinks he and the Democrats are ""getting closer"" to a deal to end the budget stalemate that has partially shut down the government despite no evidence that any progress has been made.

And he's suggesting the partial government shutdown could be ""a blessing in disguise"" because, he suggests, it could lead to a broader immigration deal.

Trump spoke Wednesday during an Oval Office bill signing on anti-human trafficking legislation. It's a day after he delivered a prime-time address trying to make the case for his long-stalled U.S.-Mexico border wall.

Trump says that he would like to see ""real immigration reform in this country because we need it."" He says, ""Everybody wants to see immigration reform,"" adding that perhaps the stalemate ""will turn out to be a blessing in disguise.""

Gone are the days when the U.S. and Mexican governments regularly exchanged statements over President Donald Trump's insistence on a border wall.

Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said Wednesday he won't be drawn into what he calls a U.S. internal dispute, an apparent reference to the 19-day-old partial U.S. government shutdown over a border barrier.

Lopez Obrador says, ""We are not going to respond to situations arising from internal affairs in the United States.""

Unlike his predecessor, the Mexican leader didn't have to respond to any specific aspersion about Mexico, because Trump didn't make any in his Tuesday night address to the American public. Relations between the two leaders have been surprisingly cordial, given their ideological differences.

Lopez Obrador said, ""Of course, there are those ... who want us to get into a confrontation. We always want a friendly relationship with the United States, a cooperative relationship.""

As a presidential candidate Trump promised Mexico would pay for a border wall, but Mexico refused.

President Donald Trump is using a bill signing focused on curbing human trafficking to push his case for a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border.

Trump says a southern border that is not secured exacerbates the incidents of human trafficking. He says, ""As long as we have a border that is not secure, we're going to suffer the consequences of that.""

Wednesday's bill signing came a day after Trump's prime-time speech designed to persuade Americans that illegal immigration and trafficking at the border are a crisis.

Democrats have called Trump's promised wall costly, ineffective and ""immoral"" and say he's ""manufacturing a crisis.""

The bill Trump signed is designed to enhance an annual State Department report that measures global efforts to eliminate human trafficking.

The White House says it's the fourth bipartisan bill the Republican president has signed in the last few weeks to prevent human trafficking.

Congressional Democrats say they'll head to the White House with the plan to reopen the government -- the same one they've been presenting. They're asking President Donald Trump to accept a bipartisan bill to fund border security without the wall.

Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Wednesday the president ""could end the Trump shutdown and re-open the government today, and he should.""

Pelosi and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer spoke at an event where they were flanked by federal workers going without pay during the shutdown, now in its 19th day.

Schumer called workers the ""collateral damage"" of Trump's ""temper tantrum."" He said the president failed to ""persuade a soul"" during his ""divisive"" prime-time address Tuesday night to the nation.

Trump meets with congressional leaders at the White House Wednesday afternoon. He rejected the Senate's bipartisan funding bill in December, sparking the shutdown.

The White House is trying to keep jittery congressional Republicans from defecting over the toll the partial government shutdown is taking in their states.

President Donald Trump and Democrats have been at an impasse over funding for his proposed border wall, which has led to a partial government shutdown, now in its 19th day.

Trump meets with Senate Republicans Wednesday on Capitol Hill just hours after he argued on national television that a border wall was needed to resolve a security and humanitarian ""crisis.""

Senators say the shutdown has led to disruptions in agricultural payments for farmers, as well as for home buyers trying to secure government-backed home loans. Lawmakers also are worried about missed paychecks for government workers Friday.

As many as half a dozen GOP senators have said the government should reopen while border security negotiations with Democrats continue.

President Donald Trump again linked illegal immigration along the southern border with drugs and violent crime as he urged Democratic lawmakers to fund his proposed border wall.

In his first national address from the Oval Office, the president gave no indication he was softening his stance that the partial government shutdown would continue without money for the wall.

Trump argued Tuesday night that the wall was needed to resolve what he called a security and humanitarian ""crisis.""

He addressed the nation as the shutdown stretched through its third week, with hundreds of thousands of federal workers going without pay and some congressional Republicans growing increasingly jittery about the impasse.

Trump plans to visit Senate Republicans at the Capitol on Wednesday before meeting with Democratic leaders at the White House."

As President Donald Trump is said to be mulling ""other options"" for funding his border wall between the U.S. and Mexico, according to the Associated Press, a dark horse arises on the internet.

A GoFundMe campaign popped up Sunday, hoping to raise funds for Trump's proposed wall between the U.S. and Mexico, which isn't news in and of itself. There are plenty of those around.

But the organizers of this campaign are so encouraged that they've raised more-than $700,000 in just three days that they've bumped their original goal of $200 million up to a cool billion.

The GoFundMe organizer is listed as triple-amputee Air Force veteran Brian Kolfage, who lost both legs and his right arm in a blast at Balad Air Force Base in Iraq in 2004, according to the Arizona Daily Star.

The contact listing for the organizer says ""The Wall Funding Team"" is located in Miramar, Fla.

""As a veteran who has given so much, 3 limbs, I feel deeply invested to this nation to ensure future generations have everything we have today,"" Kolfage wrote in the GoFundMe campaign description. ""Too many Americans have been murdered by illegal aliens and too many illegals are taking advantage of the United States taxpayers with no means of ever contributing to our society.

""I have grandparents who immigrated to America legally, they did it the correct way and it's time we uphold our laws, and get this wall BUILT! It's up to Americans to help out and pitch in to get this project rolling.""

Multiple studies and reports have shown, though, that illegal immigrants commit crime, violent or nonviolent, at lesser rates than do native-born Americans.

Kolfage's GoFundMe campaign was listed as the ""Top fundraiser"" on the front page of the crowd-sourced social fundraising website as of Wednesday afternoon, despite Kolfage's claims that the platform was trying to hide his fundraiser from potential donors.

Kolfage's Facebook page, where he posts content relevant to his conservative political beliefs, has more than 90,000 followers.

""We have contacted the Trump Administration to secure a point of contact where all funds will go upon completion,"" the campaign says. ""When get this information secured we will update. We have many very high level contacts already helping."""

The Dems will say that they only conceded a tiny amount of money and therefore ""won.""

Trump will say that he forced the Dems to give some funding and that if people want the wall, they should vote to re-elect him and elect more Republicans in 2020.

Both sides seem entrenched, but when federal workers stop showing up to work, there will be a lot of heat on Trump to reopen the government. Democrats, particularly in Maryland and Northern Virginia where there are many federal workers, will also be under pressure by these folks to accept any deal so the workers can pay their bills.

""Love our farmers, love Tennessee - a great combination! See you in a little while.""

Trump deleted the tweet minutes later. One possible reason for the confusion was that the prior year's convention was held in Nashville.

Several other of the president's tweets Monday morning focused on the partial government shutdown, which is now in its 24th day -- the longest such shutdown in U.S. history.

Trump scuttled an agreement both parties reached in December to keep the government funded through early February because it did not contain about $5 billion in funding for a wall along the southern border. Democrats said they will not provide Trump with any additional wall funding on top of $1.6 billion that had already been allocated."
206,pjmedia.com,https://pjmedia.com/news-and-politics/february-border-funding-punt-moves-to-house-as-trump-demands-perfect-border-security/,"WASHINGTON -- The House begins weighing today, as part of a full plate of year-end business while GOPs still control the lower chamber, the continuing resolution passed Wednesday night by the Senate to keep the government open past the previous Friday deadline.

As President Trump seeks $5 billion for a border wall, Democrats put the border security cap at $1.3 billion with no funds going toward a concrete wall.

Fencing along the southern border is currently being repaired or upgraded in high-traffic spots with steel bollard fencing. The border wall prototypes Trump viewed in California earlier this year were concrete or a mixture of concrete and steel fencing, as the Border Patrol has indicated solid concrete doesn't allow the visibility they need.

""The Democrats, who know Steel Slats (Wall) are necessary for Border Security, are putting politics over Country. What they are just beginning to realize is that I will not sign any of their legislation, including infrastructure, unless it has perfect Border Security. U.S.A. WINS!"" Trump tweeted this morning.

The White House said earlier this week that other federal agencies were asked to look at their own budgets to find places to scrape together $5 billion, but Democrats said reallocation would have to come back to the congressional appropriations process.

""The administration cannot reprogram funds appropriated by Congress for the full wall without our assent, to do so would violate Congress' Article I powers,"" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) said on the floor Wednesday. ""They cannot do it on their own and the House and Senate will not approve a wall from reprogrammed funds or anything else. It won't happen.""

Senators sang Christmas carols included ""O Holy Night"" and ""Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer"" as they passed a measure by voice vote to punt the appropriations fight to Feb. 8.

Sen. Jerry Moran (R-Kansas) contended that lawmakers should instead take advantage of Trump indicating ""his interest and flexibility in striking a funding deal for FY2019.""

""Democrat leaders' refusal to compromise is extremely frustrating, and after speaking with numerous colleagues on both sides of the aisle, I remain convinced that we could have reached a long-term agreement that would have also better secured our borders,"" Moran said late Wednesday.

""Therefore, I did not support the short-term and short-sighted CR,"" he added. ""I encourage the Senate to continue working to resolve our differences so we may move on to the important issues we have ahead of us in the new year.""

Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas) said the continuing resolution ""fails to reflect"" a voter mandate ""by not sufficiently securing the border -- this is a missed opportunity to deliver on the promises made to the American people.""

Schumer said after the vote that ""it's good that our Republican colleagues in the Senate finally realized that they should not shut down the government over a wall that does not have enough support to pass the House or Senate and is not supported by a majority of the country."""
207,stars and stripes,https://www.stripes.com/news/us/trump-threatens-to-shut-down-border-as-government-funding-stalemate-drags-on-1.562458,"WASHINGTON -- With the partial government shutdown headed toward its second week and no resolution in sight, President Donald Trump on Friday issued a string of tweets in which he again vowed to close the entire U.S. border with Mexico and halt aid to several Latin American countries unless Democrats agree to his demand for billions of dollars in wall funding.

Trump also canceled plans to visit his Florida resort, Mar-a-Lago, and will remain in Washington over the New Year's holiday, Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney said.

About 25 percent of the federal government has been shut down since Saturday, with roughly 800,000 workers affected, including an estimated 350,000 who are on furlough at home.

""We will be forced to close the Southern Border entirely if the Obstructionist Democrats do not give us the money to finish the Wall &amp; also change the ridiculous immigration laws that our Country is saddled with,"" Trump said in a morning tweet.

In a reprise of his threat before the midterm elections to cut off aid to Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador as a caravan of migrants was making its way toward the United States, Trump said that those three countries ""are doing nothing for the United States but taking our money.""

""Word is that a new Caravan is forming in Honduras and they are doing nothing about it,"" he said, without providing further details. ""We will be cutting off all aid to these 3 countries - taking advantage of U.S. for years!""

Despite Trump's threat, the United States this month announced a new collaboration with Mexico on a program to curb migration from Central American countries, with much of the $10.6 billion U.S. contribution to be drawn from existing aid programs.

Trump's tweets come as Congress has effectively given up on breaking the impasse over the president's demands for border-wall funding, all but ensuring that the partial government shutdown will stretch into at least the start of the new year.

The House and the Senate convened for just minutes Thursday before gaveling closed until next week. During the brief session in the House, Republicans shot down a Democratic attempt to vote on legislation to reopen the government.

Members of the congressional leadership were not in Washington, though aides insisted that lawmakers could return if there is a deal to end the shutdown. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., was in his home state, according to his office, while Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-N.Y., was with his family in New York.

Aides to House Speaker Paul Ryan, R-Wis., and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., declined to say where they were.

""The House remains ready to act once there is a product that can pass the Senate and that the president says he will sign,"" said AshLee Strong, a spokeswoman for Ryan.

Trump's previous threats to build a wall and force Mexico to pay for it led to diplomatic clashes with the government of former president Enrique Peña Nieto. But Mexico's new president - Andrés Manuel López Obrador, who is a leftist - has tried to avoid such disputes.

Asked about Trump's latest tweets, López Obrador told reporters Friday: ""We have acted prudently and cautiously, and we have not expressed an opinion on this theme, because this is an internal matter of the U.S. government and we prefer to abstain"" from making a statement.

He added that the Mexican government ""is seeking to always maintain a very good relationship with the government of the United States.""

As he did Thursday, Trump remained out of public view on Friday. In an appearance on Fox News, Mulvaney said that the president had ""canceled his plans for Christmas, and now he's canceled his plan for New Year's.""

""He's staying in Washington, D.C., over New Year's,"" said Mulvaney, who is set to become Trump's acting chief of staff next month.

White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said early Friday afternoon that the president was in the West Wing meeting with staff and making calls and that there were ""no plans as of now"" for him to travel to Florida.

Even though Trump will be in town and Republicans control both chambers of Congress, Mulvaney acknowledged that little progress on a deal is expected until the start of the new Congress on Jan. 3, when Democrats will retake the House.

Contending that Democrats ""have simply shut down the discussions,"" Mulvaney claimed that Schumer ""was really interested in doing a deal"" in their recent negotiations, ""but the more we're hearing this week is that it's [House Minority Leader] Nancy Pelosi who's preventing that from happening.""

""Nancy Pelosi, in fairness, does not have the votes for the speakership yet,"" Mulvaney said. ""She cannot be seen by her party as being weak on negotiating with Donald Trump. So we fully expect that until she is elected speaker and has locked that vote up, we don't expect to hear from the Democrats again.""

According to a Washington Post tally, Pelosi, who won the Democratic caucus's nomination for the speakership in late November, appears to have secured enough support to be elected speaker in January.

Throughout the negotiations, Pelosi and Schumer have presented a united front, issuing several joint statements and appearing together at an Oval Office meeting with Trump and Vice President Pence on Dec. 11.

Pelosi's spokesman, Drew Hammill, said in a statement Friday that Democrats ""are united against the President's immoral, ineffective and expensive wall - the wall that he specifically promised that Mexico would pay for.""

Democrats will not consider any offers that have not been publicly endorsed by Trump himself, he said, adding that the last time the White House directly reached out to Pelosi was when the president called her following the Oval Office meeting.

""While we await the president's public proposal, Democrats have made it clear that, under a House Democratic majority, we will vote swiftly to reopen government on Day One,"" Hammill said.

A Schumer spokesman said that Schumer and Pelosi ""have been in constant and close contact and on the same page with regards to shutdown strategy. There is no daylight between them.""

At the heart of the stalemate is Trump's demand for $5 billion in funding for his proposed wall at the U.S.-Mexico border. Congressional Democrats have rejected that figure and in recent weeks have refused to publicly endorse a figure above $1.3 billion, which continues existing funding levels and includes money for new border fencing and levee walls, but not the concrete wall Trump once demanded before he started more recently talking about ""steel slats.""

Legislation with that level of funding, which would have kept the entire government open through Feb. 8, passed the Senate unanimously last week, but Trump subsequently rejected it.

Mulvaney said Friday that ""some folks use the term 'wall' and they mean different things.""

""Everyone agrees that what we can and should be building on that southern border is that steel barrier that the president tweeted out. That's what he wants to build. The Democrats, believe it or not, don't call that a wall,"" he said.

208,mprnews.org,https://www.mprnews.org/story/2019/01/14/congress-to-face-question-when-will-shutdown-end,"Congress returns to Washington for its first full week of legislative business since control of the House reverted to Democrats, but lawmakers will be confronted with the same lingering question: When will the partial government shutdown end?

One Republican senator says he's offered President Donald Trump a possible solution, though it may just be wishful thinking.

Sen. Lindsey Graham is encouraging Trump to reopen government for several weeks to continue negotiating with Democrats over the border wall Trump wants to build on the U.S.-Mexico border. If there's no deal at the end of that time, Graham says Trump would be free to take the more dramatic step of declaring a national emergency to build it.

But the South Carolina Republican says Trump still wants a deal on funding for the wall before agreeing to reopen shuttered government departments. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat, insists Trump reopen the government first.

Their weeks-old standoff led to the partial government shutdown, now on day 24 without a clear end in sight.

""Before he pulls the plug on the legislative option, and I think we're almost there, I would urge him to open up the government for a short period of time, like three weeks, before he pulls the plug, see if we can get a deal,"" Graham said. ""If we can't at the end of three weeks, all bets are off.

""See if he can do it by himself through the emergency powers. That's my recommendation,"" added Graham, who has publicly pushed Trump to use his authority to declare a national emergency to build the wall. Such a step would allow Trump to bypass Congress and tap various pots of unspent federal money, including for military construction and disaster relief as well as from assets seized by law enforcement, to pay for the wall.

Trump has kept Washington on edge over whether he would resort to such a declaration, citing what he says is a ""crisis"" of drug smuggling and the trafficking of women and children at the border. The president initially sounded as though such a move was imminent, but then pulled back. He has said several times since he first mentioned the idea in public this month that he prefers a legislative solution.

A key question is how much more time is Trump willing to give lawmakers. Graham, who spoke with Trump by telephone on Sunday morning, said the legislative path ""is just about shut off"" and blamed intransigence by Pelosi.

The speaker's office had no immediate comment.

Democrats oppose an emergency declaration but may be powerless to block it. Some Republicans are wary, too, fearing how a future Democratic president might use that authority. Such a move, should Trump ultimately go that route, would almost certainly be challenged in the courts.

Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., called Graham's idea to reopen the government a ""great place to start.""

""I do think if we reopen the government, if the president ends this shutdown crisis, we have folks who can negotiate a responsible, modern investment in technology that will actually make us safer,"" Coons said.

Trump says technology is nice, but that the border can't be secured without a wall.

The White House has been laying the groundwork for an emergency declaration, which is feared by lawmakers in both parties.

Senate Homeland Security Committee Chairman Ron Johnson, R-Wis., said he'd ""hate to see"" a declaration issued because the wall wouldn't get built, presumably because of legal challenges. Democrats voted in the past for border security and should again, he said.

""I actually want to see this wall get built,"" Johnson said. ""I want to keep pressure on Democrats to actually come to the negotiating table in good faith and fund what they have supported in the past.""

Graham favors a declaration and said the time for talk is running out.

""It's the last option, not the first option, but we're pretty close to that being the only option,"" he said.

Graham and Coons spoke on ""Fox News Sunday"" and Johnson appeared on CNN's ""State of the Union."""
209,washington free beacon,https://freebeacon.com/uncategorized/cnns-acosta-confirms-walled-part-of-the-border-is-crisis-free/,"CNN chief White House correspondent Jim Acosta / Getty Images

CNN reporter Jim Acosta confirmed no crisis existed along a walled portion of the U.S.-Mexico border during a visit Thursday.

In a video shared to Twitter, Acosta pointed to ""some of the steel slats that the president's been talking about."" Walking along the border in McAllen, Texas, Acosta noted that the president has warned of a national emergency at the unwalled portion of the southern border. Acosta observed that this emergency did not exist along the portion of the border that had already been secured with steel slats.

""As we're walking along here we're not saying any kind of imminent danger,"" he remarked, patting the border barrier with his hand as he filmed himself. ""There are no migrants trying to rush towards this fence.""

President Donald Trump campaigned on a promise to ""build the wall"" and secure the border. Though the rate has decreased in recent years, hundreds of thousands of foreign nationals cross the southern border into the United States every year.

Democrats have refused to provide funding for the president's border wall, though many have voted for it as part of larger immigration bills in the past. Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D., Calif.) jokingly offered the president one dollar for the wall and called it immoral. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D., N.Y.), have refused to accommodate Trump's wish to build a border wall.

""He is not going to get the wall in any form,"" Schumer said last month. Some Democrats, like Congressman Hakeem Jeffries (D., N.Y.), have agreed that ""enhanced fencing"" would in fact help secure the border. The estimated cost is between $2-5.7 billion dollars.

In an address to the nation from the oval office Tuesday, Trump stopped short of declaring a federal emergency to secure unilateral authority to fund the wall. Now in its twentieth day, the government shutdown is approaching the longest of its kind in American history.

The president is set to visit the border in Texas on Thursday."

The president's statement was due to be followed, unusually, by a response from Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer, the Democrat congressional leaders, also being carried live by the networks.

Mr Trump has been accused of manufacturing a sense of crisis after failing to convince Congress to agree $5.7 billion towards the wall, which he refers to as a steel barrier having initially said it would be funded by Mexico.

As my loyal readers know, I try to avoid writing on political matters, recognizing that Seeking Alpha is a financial site. However, from time to time, I must weigh in on certain political topics because that's just part of my job.

We're now in the midst of a partial federal government shutdown that began after House and Senate lawmakers failed to end the budget standoff, and adjourned when last-minute negotiations fizzled.

The House went home and the Senate adjourned, assuring that a quarter of the government would run out of money and be forced to shut down at midnight. Once it became a foregone conclusion that the government would be partially closed, President Trump took to Twitter, where he acknowledged the inevitability of a shutdown in a video.

In the video, President Trump called for bipartisanship support while he continued to insist that it is a ""Democratic shutdown."" In a departure from his remarks at the White House earlier, President Trump said that he was prepared for a long shutdown,

We're going to have a shutdown. There's nothing we can do about that, because we need the Democrats to give us their votes.""

The standoff between President Trump and Democrats is in its second week and according to CBS News, ""this is the 21st government shutdown since Congress adopted new budgeting procedures in 1976... and it's also the third this year alone.""

One of the biggest misconceptions, as it relates to a temporary shutdown, is the impact to DoD spending. While some important agencies are impacted, such as Homeland Security, Transportation, Interior, Agriculture, State and Justice, as well as national parks and forests; Social security, military, Medicare and Medicaid will remain in operation.

The shutdown will impact 800,000 federal workers who will face furloughs or be forced to work without pay. Nine of 15 Cabinet-level departments and dozens of agencies are also affected.

But, to put it bluntly, a government shutdown will have zero impact on national security, the government will continue to pay all obligations (including rent).

As I said, I am purposely avoiding political commentary related to the highly debatable political issues, surrounding the Trump administration's firm stance on border control, yet I am standing firm as it relates to Corporate Office Properties (OFC), the ""black knight"" of this on-going checkmate.

Pullback Creates 'Rare' Investment Opportunity

According to the Congressional Budget Office (or CBO) ""spending for the Department of Defense (or DoD) accounts for nearly all of the nation's defense budget. The funding provided to DoD covers its base budget - which pays for the department's normal activities - and its contingency operations.

CBO analyzes the possible consequences of planned reductions in funding for the military's force structure and acquisitions. The agency also studies the budgetary implications of DoD's plans, including those for military personnel, weapon systems, and operations.""

Funding for support functions consumes more of the defense budget today than it did in the 1980s, CBO finds. The largest increases were in healthcare, DoD management, communications infrastructure, and the science and technology program.

Source: COPT Investor Presentation

The U.S. military's readiness to respond to current and future threats depends on the quality and availability of military forces - personnel, weapon systems such as ships and aircraft, and other material resources such as ammunition and fuel.

In turn, the quality and availability of military forces depend on the support infrastructure. The military uses that support infrastructure - such as bases, depots, and schools - to recruit personnel, train units for deployment, acquire and maintain equipment, construct facilities, provide healthcare, facilitate communications, and more.

From the 1980s to the 2010s, the funding for support activities in DoD's base budget rose in relation to funding for forces. Between 1980 and 1989, a period marked by the rapid defense buildup against the threat of the Soviet Union, support costs accounted for 43% of DoD's nearly $500 billion base budget, on average.

Between 1990 and 2000, during the defense drawdown after the Soviet Union's collapse, the average share of DoD's base budget devoted to support costs grew to 49%. In the post-9/11 period, from 2001 to 2016, it rose further - to 50% (see below).

The Full Year 2018 budget provided the DOD with a $605 billion base budget - a 14% increase over Full Year 2017. The Full Year 2019 NDAA currently would increase DOD budget by another 2% (FY 2019 reflects amounts authorized in the FY 2019 NDAA (H.R. 5515), which was appropriated and signed into law on September 28, 2018).

In 2018, the National Defense Strategy highlighted three DOD Strategic Priorities: (1) Build a More Lethal Force, (2) Reform the DOD for Greater Performance and Affordability, and (3) Strengthen Alliances and Attract New Partners. As viewed below, COPT's (abbreviated throughout the rest of the article) Defense/IT locations are well-aligned with the nation's defense spending priorities:

A Mission-Critical REIT On Sale

COPT is the only REIT that is specifically focused on serving U.S. government agencies and defense contractors engaged in defense information technology and national security-related activities. This is a very strategic niche, and one in which COPT's tenants are generally focused on knowledge-based activities such as cybersecurity, R&D, and other highly technical defense and security areas.

COPT has a strategic tenant niche that provides real estate solutions serving a specialized cyber-based platform. The defense installations (or government demand drivers) where COPT's tenants operate are R&D, high-tech knowledge-based centers, NOT weapons or troops-related.

Accordingly, the REIT has a regional focus on owning properties in targeted markets or submarkets in the Greater Washington, DC/Baltimore region with strong growth attributes. COPT is a market leader in these markets, and the company has identified five impacts of industry recovery that are or will be driving demand at these mission-critical, Defense/IT locations.

Source: COPT Investor Presentation

As of Q3-18, COPT owned 159 office and data center shell properties, encompassing 17.7 million square feet and was 94% leased. Of these, COPT owns 152 buildings in Defense/IT (15.7 million sf) and 7 regional office buildings (2.0 million sf). As of September 30, 2018, COPT derived 88% of its core portfolio annualized revenue from Defense/IT Locations and 12% from Regional Office Properties.

Source: COPT Investor Presentation

From 2011-2017, COPT has transformed its portfolio to focus on its unique Defense/IT franchise by selling $1.6 billion of commodity suburban office assets (10.9 mm SF), developing $1.2 billion (6.0 mm SF) and acquiring $345 million (1.5 mm SF) of strategic properties. The company has a significant concentration of assets in or around the Greater DC area, where there are a number of Federal Agencies and cybersecurity-focused operations.

Source: COPT Fact Sheet

COPT's niche-based model provides competitive advantages that include:

Unique Land Positions - COPT has properties and entitled land adjacent to key knowledge-based defense installations. The company earns 59% of its core portfolio's annualized rental revenue from 82 properties that are adjacent to Strategic Demand Drivers.

Development Expertise - COPT is a preferred and trusted developer with considerable experience in providing space for secured government operations.

Operating Platform - The company has unparalleled teams of managers with the specialized skills required to handle complex security-oriented needs. COPT's credentialed personnel collaborate with the US government and defense customers on a frequent basis.

Customer Relationships - Its highly specialized business model provides a distinct competitive advantage, and one in which COPT's customers reward the company with repeat business and sustainable growth opportunities.

Track Record - COPT was founded in 1988 as Royale Investments, and traded on the Nasdaq. The company changed its name to Corporate Office Properties Trust, and went on the NYSE in 1998. COPT has over two decades of operating experience, with growth in assets from $300 million (in 1998) to over $5 billion today.

The Balance Sheet

During Q3-18, COPT executed several capital market transactions:

In late July the company closed on a $116 million construction loan for 2100 L. Street in Washington, D.C. The proceeds from this loan will completely fund the project's remaining development cost and COPT continues to match fund development investments with equity.

The company drew down $80 million of its forward equity agreement and issued $30 million at $30.46 a share under the ATM program. The company said it was using the proceeds from the ATM to fund project capex which is incremental to the 2018 development plan.

Shortly after Q3-18, COPT entered into a new $800 million credit facility to replace its existing line. The new credit facility has improved pricing and covenants, matures in March 2023 and has two six-month extension options. Also, Fitch ratings upwardly revised its outlook on COPT's credit rating from stable to positive.

The balance sheet metrics remain strong, and the company expects year-end debt plus preferred to EBITDA ratio to be consistent at ~6.0x and Debt/Adjusted Book ≤40%.

A Very Clear Path To Development Profits

One key differentiator for COPT is its focus on development. Demand for new construction in the company's core markets remains strong, even during multiple consecutive years during which the DoD had no budget. As COPT's CEO Steve Budorick, explains on the Q3-18 earnings call,

An elevated and predictable defense spending environment and consistent bipartisan support in Congress to fund defense are driving demand for expansion space throughout our operating portfolio and for new developments.""

Highlights from Q3-18 include 161,000 square feet of vacancy leasing in the company's operating portfolio that along with developments placed in service drove core portfolio back up to 94% leased. Notable large leasing gains during the quarter included the Fort Meade BW corridor sub-segment, which is up 50 bps to 92.4% leased. The NoVA defense/IT sub-segment is up 80 bps to 92.1% leased, and the Navy Support Group which gained 160 bps is now 93.2% leased.

Source: COPT Investor Presentation

COPT announced (post Q3-18) two full building pre-leases for data center shells, representing the sixth and seventh leases of the 11 building pipeline. These leases bring COPT's annual development leasing above 1 million square feet, and the company expects to meet our upwardly revise its development leasing goal for the year. COPT's concentration of expirations at mission critical Defense/IT Locations mitigates rollover risk, as illustrated below:

Source: COPT Investor Presentation

On the Q3-18 earnings call, the company said that ""the sheer volume of data center development activities has stressed the capacity of accounting zoning and power distribution resources extending the completion times for land development"". This means that the delayed commencements will defer some of the anticipated 2019 revenue into 2020, but ""the magnitude of the revenue and the value creation of this program has not changed.""

Each quarter of delay in leasing the remaining 120,000 square feet equates to $0.01 of FFO opportunity cost to next year's results, and the company said that ""although the timing associated with leasing has been frustrating"", it ""continues to have confidence the property will fully lease.""

COPT's CEO added,

The DoD's fiscal 2017 budget is driving the year-over-year increases we have achieved in vacancy leasing this year. Throughout 2019, incremental demand from the DoD's substantial 2018 budget, which passed in law only seven months ago should amplify existing demand as defense outlays filter down to the real estate level. We will likely see incremental demand from the 2019 defense budget emerge toward the end of next year, further expanding leasing opportunities.""

Through 2020, 24 recently completed and under construction projects that are not in same-property represent up to $39.3 million of future annual Cash NOI, $35.1 million of which is contractual. Additionally, the two U.S. Government buildings represent potential Cash NOI of $8.5-9 million in 2020, $4.5 million of which is contractual.

Source: COPT Investor Presentation

As viewed below, COPT's robust shadow development pipeline bodes well for future development leasing & NOI growth. The 2-2.5 million SF shadow development pipeline supports the company's upwardly revised 2018 goal of leasing 1.1 million SF in development projects. To date, 1.06 million SF have been completed:

The 'Black Knight' Wins

On the Q3-18 earnings call, management said it was maintaining the $2.01 mid-point of its annual guidance and tightening its range, from $1.98-2.04 to a new range of $2.00-2.02:

Source: COPT Investor Presentation

The company said it was also tightening Q4-18 FFO per share guidance from the prior range of $0.48 to $0.52 to a new range of $0.49 to $0.51. The $0.50 cent midpoint of the Q4 range is flat with Q3 results because the company is completing several weather-related R&M projects that were budgeted for earlier in the year. As illustrated below, the $2.01 mid-point of 2018 guidance represents 4.7% growth over pro forma 2017 results.

Although the above-referenced delays in completing the data centers and leasing will reduce COPT's 2019 results, the strength and volume of leasing in the operating portfolio, and the benefit of executing additional development projects will partially offset the impact of these delays. Here's how analysts forecast COPT's FFO/share growth in 2019 and 2020:

Source: F.A.S.T. Graphs

Now, as I said, COPT has no direct peer, so we will compare to the broader peer group, starting with the dividend yield:

Source: Rhino Real Estate Advisors

As you can see, COPT is yielding 5.2%, and the although the company has not raised its dividend (it cut in 2011 and has not increased since 2012), the payout ratio appears relatively safe, as illustrated below:

Source: Rhino Real Estate Advisors

Now as viewed below, OFC trades at a sizable discount, based on P/FFO metrics:

Source: Rhino Real Estate Advisors

Keep in mind that 88% of COPT's core portfolio annualized rental revenue comes from growing Defense/IT locations (core portfolio 94% leased). Also, the pipeline of future build-to-suit transactions and expansion activity among existing operating properties remain robust.

The company has multiple avenues of growth in Defense/IT generate durable, less correlated demand for new facilities: (1) U.S. Government, (2) Contractors serving at the mission, and (3) Contractors providing cloud computing.

And remember, the temporary government shutdown has ZERO impact to COPT's rent checks and, as a result, we are upgrading the company from a Buy to a Strong Buy. While the checkmate over the budget continues, we are confident that the ""black knight"" will prevail, and we will have no problem ""sleeping well at night"" owning shares in Corporate Office Properties Trust.

Euro currency remains a work in progress on 20th birthday

FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- The euro is about to celebrate its 20th birthday, but the countries that use it are still wrestling with how the shared currency should work and how to fix flaws exposed by the debt crisis that marred its second decade.

The euro was launched on Jan. 1, 1999, when 10 countries fixed their exchange rates to it and handed decisions on interest rates to the newly-founded European Central Bank. Euro notes and coins went into circulation three years later.

The shared currency was seen as a solution to the constant quarrels over exchange rates that had marked European politics after World War II and as a logical extension of the European Union's tariff-free trade zone. Britain, notably, opted out, but 19 of 28 EU countries use the euro.

PYONGYANG, North Korea (AP) -- Despite the unwanted publicity of a criminal trial for one of their main suppliers, business is booming at Pyongyang's 'Singapore shops,' which sell everything from Ukrainian vodka to brand-name knock-offs from China. The stores stock many of the very things United Nations' sanctions banning trade in luxury goods are intended to block and provide a nagging reminder that not all potential trade partners are lining up behind the U.N.'s pronouncements or the Trump administration's policy of maximum pressure on the North.

GOP and Democrats trade blame for shutdown, no deal in sight

WASHINGTON (AP) -- The partial government shutdown will almost certainly be handed off to a divided government to solve in the new year, as both parties traded blame Friday and President Donald Trump sought to raise the stakes in the weeklong impasse.

As agreement eludes Washington in the waning days of the Republican monopoly on power, it sets up the first big confrontation between Trump and newly empowered Democrats. Trump is sticking with his demand for money to build a border wall with Mexico, and Democrats, who take control of the House on Jan. 3, are refusing to give him what he wants.

Trump raised the stakes on Friday, reissuing threats to shut the U.S.-Mexico border to pressure Congress to fund the wall and to shut off aid to three Central American countries from which many migrants have fled.

Our Federal Reserve Chairman should be commended. Under extraordinary pressure, Mr. Powell and the FOMC didn't buckle.

Expiration for the aged ""Fed put"" was long past due. For too long it has been integral to precarious Bubble Dynamics. It has promoted speculation and speculative leverage. It is indispensable to a derivatives complex that too often distorts, exacerbates and redirects risk. The ""Fed put"" has been integral to momentous market misperceptions, distortions and structural maladjustment. It has been fundamental to the precarious ""moneyness of risk assets,"" the momentous misconception key to Trillions flowing freely into ETFs and other passive ""investment"" products and strategies. The ""Fed put"" was central to a prolonged financial Bubble that over time imparted major structural impairment upon the U.S. Bubble Economy.

Moreover, prolonged U.S. financial and economic Bubbles were fundamental to Bubbles inflating on an unprecedented global scale. The ""Fed put"" morphed into a disastrous global ""policymaker put"" phenomenon. If not for the ""Fed put,"" never would there have been the audaciousness to set forth on ""whatever it takes."" And the greater asset Bubbles inflated the more convinced everyone became that central banks and governments (certainly including Beijing!) had everything under control - and would in no terms tolerate a bust.

There is never a good time to pierce a Bubble. There definitely is no cure, so it's a central banker and policymaker imperative to avoid supporting a backdrop conducive to Bubble Dynamics. There was never going to be a convenient time to end the ""Fed put."" Implicit backstops and guarantees are problematic that way. Washington throughout the mortgage finance Bubble period was content with the markets' view that the Treasury would backstop GSE obligations. No one was willing to rock the boat during the boom. Critical lesson not learned.

As for the Fed's market ""put"", it proved a challenge for Chairman Powell to distance the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) from an implicit backstop the Federal Reserve repeatedly employed starting all the way back with the 1987 stock market crash (evolving from liquidity assurances to Trillions of ""whatever it takes"" liquidity injections and zero rates in a non-crisis backdrop). The new Chairman intimated that he preferred the Fed move in a different direction, subtlety easily lost with the focus on communicating policy continuity. It was only when the markets were under acute pressure that participants would comprehend the seriousness of a subtle but momentous change in the Fed's approach. That day came Wednesday.

December 21 - CNBC (Kate Rooney): ""Federal Reserve Bank of New York President John Williams told CNBC on Friday the Fed is open to reconsidering its views on rate hikes next year. 'We are listening, there are risks to that outlook that maybe the economy will slow further,' Williams told Steve Liesman... Williams said despite this week's forecasts, the central bank is not 'sitting there saying we know for sure what's going to happen' in 2019. 'What we're going to be doing going into next year is reassessing our views on the economy, listening to not only markets but everybody that we talk to, looking at all the data and being ready to reassess and re-evaluate our views,' he said.""

The Dow rallied 350 points in Friday morning trading on comments from (NY Fed President) John Williams. Yet another rally to evaporate. By that time, the damage had been done. Confidence had been shaken. Fear had completely supplanted Greed. And, to be sure, it's not a market structure especially resistant to waning confidence. Indeed, acute fragilities are being laid bare. Bubbles don't work in reverse. Crisis Dynamics have engulfed the ""Core,"" and I'll leave it at that for this week.

I've always had serious issues with central banks promoting the perception that they would eagerly backstop market liquidity. Liquidity is a fundamental market risk - that can't be permanently transformed, transferred or mitigated. It's a precarious proposition to promote the belief that contemporary central banks - with unlimited capacity to create liquidity - will do ""whatever it takes"" to ensure highly liquid markets. Nevertheless, it's extremely challenging to convey to market participants, central bankers, politicians and the general public why central banks aggressively underpinning the markets over the long-term promotes pernicious instability for the markets, real economies and humanity more generally.

The implicit ""Fed put"" seemed so innocuous when things looked good - so long as the Bubble was inflating. For going on a decade, Bubble Analysis has appeared a pathetic waste of time. Suddenly, cracks appear, confidence wanes, liquidity disappears, credit falters - and ramifications are anything but subtle: so much teeters on the markets' perception of the efficacy of central bank market backstops. The world today hangs in the balance - markets, economies, politics and geopolitics. One of the greatest risks associated with the global government finance Bubble has been a crisis of confidence in policymaking.

It was inevitable the ""Fed put"" would turn problematic. The more explicit central backstops become, the more market distortions promote self-reinforcing speculative excess and Bubbles. The greater the scope of Bubbles, the more deeply manic markets become convinced that central bankers won't allow the good times to end. Importantly, speculation and leverage will invariably expand beyond the expected capacity of liquidity backstops. This is why ""whatever it takes"" and ""QE infinity"" were so reckless. There became essentially no degree of excess that troubled the marketplace. It degenerated into a complete malfunctioning of the market mechanism.

I certainly don't believe the ""Fed put"" is dead. The Powell Fed just meaningfully lowered the ""strike price."" They'll be forced to respond, but only after the market has suffered significant impairment. To the markets' horror, the bursting Bubble will pass the point of no return before our central bank is compelled to aggressively defend the marketplace.

As painful as this process will become, and as deeply distressing it will be to see so many hopes, dreams and expectations crushed, the Powell Fed is taking the best approach. The Bubble would have inevitably burst. Indeed, the global Bubble has been deflating since earlier in the year. That the U.S. ""Terminal Phase"" of Bubble excess continued even as the global Bubble faltered created a perilous divergence that would end badly. It's ending now - badly. The miserable downside would have only been worse had the Fed stepped in, bolstered the markets once again and extended the ""Terminal Phase.""

It would have been the easy decision for Powell to just pull a Greenspan, Bernanke or Yellen. Just give the markets what they want and silence the temper tantrum. The three preceding Fed chairs invariably acted in the interest of sustaining or resuscitating Bubble Dynamics. In my view, at least two of the three seemed preoccupied with their own reputations and legacies.

In an age seemingly bereft of statesmen, Jay Powell is one. He will fall under only more intense pressure and criticism. This good man will be pilloried and blamed for a predicament decades in the making. Clearly, he's the targeted presidential fall guy. History will surely be merciless, and it's all unfair. I worry about a lot of things these days, including how our nation will attract talented and decent individuals into public service - especially now that they will be needed more than ever. We're heading into challenging and unsettling times. Somehow our nation must to come together and support our institutions and responsible public servants.

Currency Watch

December 17 - Bloomberg (Chris Anstey): ""China's exchange rate is likely to get more volatile in time as the country pushes greater international use of the yuan, according to Goldman Sachs... While the yuan-internationalization campaign hit a setback as China tightened regulation of capital flows in the wake of a messy 2015 devaluation, there's increasing pressure for policy makers to take up the initiative again, economists including MK Tang wrote... China's current account will tip into deficit in coming years, in the view of many strategists, as its increasingly large economy continues to grow faster than the rest of the world. In financing that deficit, China could reduce risks if it acquired funding in its own currency - much like the U.S. does now, and unlike more vulnerable countries such as Brazil, Goldman noted.""

Market Dislocation Watch

December 21 - CNBC (Thomas Franck): ""Stocks plunged again on Friday, sending the Dow Jones Industrial Average to its worst week since the financial crisis in 2008, down nearly 7%. The Nasdaq Composite Index closed in a bear market and the S&P 500 was on the brink of one itself, down nearly 18% from its record earlier this year.""

December 16 - Financial Times (Eric Platt, Colby Smith and Joe Rennison): ""US credit markets are grinding to a halt with fund managers refusing to bankroll buyouts and investors shunning high-yield bond sales as rising interest rates and market volatility weigh on sentiment. Not a single company has borrowed money through the $1.2tn US high-yield corporate bond market this month. If that drought persists, it would be the first month since November 2008 that not a single high-yield bond priced in the market, according to data providers Informa and Dealogic. In the leveraged loan market, two transactions were postponed last week after Barclays, Deutsche Bank, UBS and Wells Fargo failed to find buyers for the debt packages, a rarity in what has been one of the hottest corners of credit markets this year.""

December 21 - Bloomberg (Davide Scigliuzzo and Sally Bakewell): ""A rout in the once-hot market for risky corporate loans has some of Wall Street's largest banks stuck with at least $1.6 billion of unwanted leveraged buyout debt. Banks including Barclays Plc, Goldman Sachs... and Bank of America... - among the top providers of loans for LBOs - have struggled in recent weeks to sell loans they've agreed to make for private equity deals, as concerns about the global economic outlook spurred investors to flee risky assets. At least four loan sales for buyouts and acquisitions have failed to clear the market so far this month, forcing the banks to keep the debt on their books...""

December 17 - Bloomberg (Lisa Lee): ""Some of the biggest buyers of company loans are scaling back, and it's hurting the market for buyout debt. Money managers that buy loans and repackage them into bonds have cut back on their activity. Sales of the rebundled loans, known as collateralized loan obligations, dropped 25% in the first half of December from the same period last year, after falling 10% in November. The firms that issue CLOs buy about half the loans made to junk-rated companies. As demand from these money managers has waned, not to mention buying from retail investors, prices for leveraged loans have reached their lowest levels in more than two years.""

December 15 - New York Times (Matt Phillips): ""Stocks? Messy. Bonds? Meh. Commodities? Not pretty. Most years, financial markets are a mixed bag. A bad year for risky investments, like stocks, might be a great one for safe bets like government bonds. Or, if worries about inflation are hurting bond investments, commodities like gold tend to do well. Not this year. For the first time in decades, every major type of investment has fared poorly, as the outlook for economic growth and corporate profits is dampened by rising trade tensions and interest rates. Stocks around the world are getting pummeled, while commodities and bonds are tumbling - all of which have left investors with few places to put their money.""

December 18 - Bloomberg (Donal Griffin, Jennifer Surane and Cathy Chan): ""Citigroup Inc. faces losses of as much as $180 million on loans made to an Asian hedge fund whose foreign-exchange wagers went awry, prompting board-level discussions and a business shakeup, according to a person briefed on the matter. The hedge fund, managed by a unit of GF Holdings (Hong Kong) Corp., and Citigroup are in discussions on the positions and how they should be valued... The situation is fluid and the eventual losses may end up being smaller depending on how the trades are unwound, one of the people said.""

Trump Administration Watch

December 21 - Bloomberg (Daniel Flatley, Erik Wasson, Steven T. Dennis and Laura Litvan): ""Parts of the U.S. government began shutting down on Saturday for the third time this year after a bipartisan spending deal collapsed over President Donald Trump's demands for more money to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. Trump scuttled an agreement that would have kept the government open until February after coming under heavy criticism from conservative talk show hosts and some allies in the House because the measure didn't include the $5 billion he wanted for the wall. While negotiations to resolve the impasse are underway, it's not clear whether parts of the government will remain shuttered for days or weeks. Ending the shutdown - which affects nine of 15 federal departments and dozens of agencies - requires Democratic leaders and Trump to reach a compromise, which so far has been elusive as both sides hardened their positions.""

December 18 - Bloomberg (David Lawder): ""The United States and China are planning to hold meetings in January to 'document an agreement' on trade, U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told Bloomberg... Mnuchin was quoted as saying the two sides had held several phone conversations in recent weeks, and were planning further formal talks.""

December 18 - Reuters (Susan Heavey): ""U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday further sought to pressure the Federal Reserve as the central bank prepared to start its two-day policy meeting, warning the Fed's board not to 'make yet another mistake' ahead of an expected interest rate hike... Trump, who has made the economy a key part of his political platform, has repeatedly criticized the Fed and its chairman, Jerome Powell. 'Don't let the market become any more illiquid than it already is. Stop with the 50 B's. Feel the market, don't just go by meaningless numbers. Good luck!' Trump wrote.""

December 17 - Wall Street Journal (Alex Leary and Nick Timiraos): ""President Trump argued Monday on Twitter that it was 'incredible' that Federal Reserve policy members were considering raising interest rates again, continuing his public campaign against tighter monetary policy... 'It is incredible that with a very strong dollar and virtually no inflation, the outside world blowing up around us, Paris is burning and China way down, the Fed is even considering yet another interest rate hike,' Mr. Trump tweeted. 'Take the Victory!'""

December 18 - Bloomberg (Tom Schoenberg, Chris Dolmetsch and Jennifer Epstein): ""The U.S. Justice Department announced indictments accusing Chinese officials of coordinating a decade-long espionage campaign to steal intellectual property and other data from dozens of companies, adding to tensions amid the trade war between the two nations. Two Chinese nationals, Zhu Hua and Zhang Shilong, were accused... of coordinating with state security officials in an 'extensive' hacking campaign, allegedly infiltrating 45 U.S. companies and government agencies... Secretary of State Michael Pompeo and Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said... they were 'concerned' that the alleged operation violated a 2015 agreement China made with the U.S. to stop supporting cyber theft of intellectual property and trade secrets.""

December 18 - Bloomberg (Saleha Mohsin, Elizabeth Dexheimer and Craig Torres): ""The Trump administration wants to work with Congress on freeing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac from government control, though it's considering pursuing some changes on its own, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said... 'I would like to get them out of conservatorship,' Mnuchin said during a roundtable interview at Bloomberg's Washington office. 'My preference would be to do something that has bipartisan legislative support.' ... Fannie and Freddie have spent more than a decade under the government's thumb with no end in sight. The U.S. took over the mortgage-finance giants during the 2008 financial crisis, eventually injecting them with $187.5 billion as the housing market tanked. The companies have since become profitable again, and have paid about $279 billion to the U.S. Treasury in dividends that don't count as repayment.""

Federal Reserve Watch

December 19 - Financial Times (Sam Fleming): ""If bruised US equity investors were expecting Jay Powell to come to their rescue at the final Federal Reserve policy meeting of the year, they were sorely mistaken. The Fed chairman ploughed ahead on Wednesday with the fourth quarter-point interest rate rise in 2018 and brushed aside calls for the central bank to slow its balance sheet reduction programme. Weeks of market volatility had caused financial conditions to tighten only 'a little bit', he said at a press conference. The economy, he added, no longer needed any monetary support. The resulting stock market slide - the S&P 500 dropped as much as 2.3%, marking the worst fall following a Fed rate rise since 1994 - will have come as unwelcome news to a central bank that has been an unwitting contributor to volatility in recent months.""

December 16 - Reuters (Howard Schneider): ""Whatever the acronym, when the U.S. Federal Reserve dropped its policy rate to near zero on Dec. 16, 2008, to counter a full-scale economic crisis, it ushered in what the central bank's chairman at the time, Ben Bernanke, called 'the end of the old regime.' A decade later, the full impact and import of that move are still not fully clear. But the Fed was never the same. The decision to move to zero ushered in wholesale changes to how the Fed works, from its building a massive balance sheet to adopting an explicit 2% inflation target and holding regular post-meeting press conferences. A new body of research continues to explore the likelihood that trips to the 'effective lower bound' will become common.""

December 20 - Bloomberg (Mohamed A. El-Erian): ""Resisting unusual pressure from both politicians and notable market participants, Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell and his colleagues on the Open Market Committee on Wednesday raised interest rates by 25 bps and slowed the path for future hikes by less than markets hoped. In doing so, the central bank reaffirmed that its focus remains firmly domestic and economic. But the markets' reaction suggested the move was seen as heightening concerns about a policy mistake, rather than responsible policy making. This, and what's likely to play out over the next few weeks, illustrates a bigger phenomenon: the threat that the Fed and other central banks are increasingly in a no-win situation, due to factors mostly outside their control.""

December 18 - Bloomberg (Jeff Kearns): ""Selling in U.S. stocks has an ominous historical comparison for Federal Reserve officials debating an interest-rate increase this week. The last time the S&P 500 Index fell this much in the period between two policy gatherings was the collapse of investment bank Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. in 2008... The S&P 500 has declined 9.3% from the Fed's last meeting on Nov. 8 through Monday's close. That's the biggest intra-meeting slump since the 18.8% plunge between its Sept. 16, 2008, meeting, a day after Lehman filed for bankruptcy, and a special gathering announced on Oct. 8.""

U.S. Bubble Watch

December 19 - Reuters (Jason Lange): ""The U.S. current account deficit increased in the third quarter as imports surged, the Commerce Department said... in a report that also showed U.S. firms brought into the United States $92.7 billion in repatriated earnings. ...The current account deficit, which measures the flow of goods, services and investments into and out of the country, widened to $124.8 billion, or 2.4% of national economic output, in the July-September period.

December 17 - Reuters (Imani Moise): ""As U.S. bank stocks tanked this month over fears of an impending recession, industry executives downplayed concerns to colleagues, analysts and journalists, arguing that the economy is in great shape.

China Watch

December 21 - Bloomberg: ""China's top policy makers confirmed that more monetary and fiscal support will be rolled out in 2019, as the world's second-largest economy grapples with a slowdown that's yet to show signs of ending. 'Significant' cuts to taxes and fees will be enacted in 2019 and while monetary policy will remain 'prudent,' officials will strike an 'appropriate' balance between tightening and loosening, according to a statement published after the annual Economic Work Conference...

December 20 - Wall Street Journal (Nathaniel Taplin): ""'What we should and can reform, we will resolutely reform. What shouldn't be reformed and cannot be reformed, we will resolutely refrain from changing.' Not the tone optimists had been hoping for from Chinese President Xi Jinping, speaking this week 40 years after the launch of Deng Xiaoping's 'reform and opening up' policy, which ignited China's economic miracle... Given the severe stress China's private sector is under, with bond defaults at an all-time high and huge amounts of equity pledged as collateral for loans, Mr. Xi's speech was remarkably light on signals that Beijing is committed to turning things around for private companies. The speech did urge 'unwavering' support for the private economy, but only after calling for 'strengthening and developing the state-controlled economy.'""

December 17 - Reuters (Evelyn Cheng): ""Chinese President Xi Jinping addressed his nation Tuesday morning in Beijing to commemorate the 40th anniversary of China's 'reform and opening up' - and he struck a relatively defiant tone in response to international calls for changes to his country's economy. His remarks focused on how China's Communist Party guided the nation to its economic success and emphasized the country's right to pursue its own path going forward. In an address that lasted nearly 1 1/2 hours, Xi did not mention trade tensions with the U.S. and made only passing reference to market-oriented reform goals that previous speeches have discussed in detail...

Global Bubble Watch

December 19 - Financial Times (James Politi): ""At a congressional hearing last week, David Malpass, the top US Treasury official on international affairs, issued a thinly disguised warning that might have seemed unthinkable just a few years ago: the World Bank and other bastions of the US-led international economic order are at risk of being captured by Chinese influence. China had made 'substantial inroads' into the multilateral development banks that were 'worrisome', Mr Malpass told members of the House financial services committee. 'We are, therefore, working with allies and like-minded countries to guide the MDBs away from what could be viewed as endorsement of China's geopolitical ambitions.' Mr Malpass's comments highlighted the extent to which the World Bank and other multilateral lenders are in danger of becoming ensnared in the economic and strategic confrontation between Washington and Beijing. 'It's not going to put any of these banks in a good place to have these two big countries duking it out in the midst of their lending programmes,' said Mary Lovely, an economics professor at Syracuse University and a fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics... 'They may be forced to choose.'""

December 16 - Bloomberg (Alex Harris and Katherine Greifeld): ""Non-U.S. banks have amassed dollar-denominated liabilities that are about as big as they were during the global financial crisis. Yet changes to how they obtain dollars make it hard to tell if funding risks have increased or lessened. Foreign institutions from Europe to the Asia-Pacific and the Americas have boosted the proportion of dollar funding they do in their home countries rather than through U.S.-based branches and subsidiaries, according to a paper from the Bank for International Settlements... At the same time though, cross-border flows account for just over half of their dollar liabilities and U.S. residents provide a bigger share of dollar funding than is actually raised in America, it says.""

However, the concerns raised by the EU Commission and financial markets about the Italian economy are likely to resurface, analysts say. Rome has agreed to trim its budget deficit target for 2019 from 2.4% to 2% of gross domestic product mostly by delaying the implementation of some of its most expansionary measures. Welfare handouts for the poor, Five Star's flagship 'Citizens' Income,' will be delayed, as will a plan to unwind pension reforms dating back to Italy's last financial crisis in 2011. The coalition has also conceded that economic growth for 2019 will be 1%, from 1.5% previously.

Instead, these investors say in court filings, the auction rewarded a hedge fund that had sold credit insurance on the company: Cyrus Capital Partners, which is allied with Edward S. Lampert, who has run Sears for 13 years. The retailer's debt auction is being challenged in bankruptcy court; a hearing on the dispute is scheduled for Thursday in White Plains, N.Y.

214,san jose mercury news,https://www.mercurynews.com/2018/12/28/trump-threatens-to-shut-down-border-as-government-funding-stalemate-drags-on/,"WASHINGTON - With the partial government shutdown headed toward its second week and no resolution in sight, President Donald Trump on Friday issued a string of tweets in which he once again vowed to close the entire U.S. border with Mexico and halt aid to several Latin American countries unless Democrats agree to his demand for billions of dollars in wall funding.

Trump is also canceling plans to visit his Florida resort, Mar-a-Lago, and will remain in Washington over the New Year holiday, Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney said.

About 25 percent of the federal government has been shut down since Saturday, with roughly 800,000 workers affected, including an estimated 350,000 who are on furlough at home.

""We will be forced to close the Southern Border entirely if the Obstructionist Democrats do not give us the money to finish the Wall & also change the ridiculous immigration laws that our Country is saddled with,"" Trump said in a morning tweet.

In a reprise of his threat before the midterm elections to cut off aid to Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador as a caravan of migrants was making its way toward the United States, Trump said that those three countries ""are doing nothing for the United States but taking our money.""

""Word is that a new Caravan is forming in Honduras and they are doing nothing about it,"" he said, without providing further details. ""We will be cutting off all aid to these 3 countries - taking advantage of U.S. for years!""

Despite Trump's threat, the United States this month announced a new collaboration with Mexico on a program to curb migration from Central American countries, with much of the $10.6 billion U.S. contribution to be drawn from existing aid programs.

Trump's tweets come as Congress has effectively given up on breaking the impasse over the president's demands for border-wall funding, all but ensuring that the partial government shutdown will stretch into at least the start of the new year.

The House and the Senate convened for just minutes on Thursday before gaveling closed until next week. During the brief session in the House, Republicans shot down a Democratic attempt to vote on legislation to reopen the government.

As he did Thursday, Trump remained out of public view on Friday. In an appearance on Fox News, Mulvaney said that the president had ""canceled his plans for Christmas, and now he's canceled his plan for New Year's.""

""He's staying in Washington, D.C., over New Year's,"" said Mulvaney, who is set to become Trump's acting chief of staff next month.

Even though Trump will be in town and Republicans control both chambers of Congress, Mulvaney acknowledged that little progress on a deal is expected until the start of the new Congress on Jan. 3, when Democrats will retake the House. Contending that Democrats ""have simply shut down the discussions,"" he sought to place the blame on House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., who is expected to be elected speaker in the new Congress.

""Nancy Pelosi, in fairness, does not have the votes for the speakership yet,"" Mulvaney said. ""She cannot be seen by her party as being weak on negotiating with Donald Trump. So we fully expect that until she is elected speaker and has locked that vote up, we don't expect to hear from the Democrats again.""

According to a Washington Post tally, Pelosi, who won the Democratic caucus's nomination for the speakership in late November, appears to have secured enough support to be elected speaker in January.

Pelosi's spokesman, Drew Hammill, said in a statement Friday that Democrats ""are united against the President's immoral, ineffective and expensive wall - the wall that he specifically promised that Mexico would pay for.""

Democrats will not consider any offers that have not been publicly endorsed by Trump himself, he said.

""While we await the president's public proposal, Democrats have made it clear that, under a House Democratic majority, we will vote swiftly to reopen government on Day One,"" Hammill said.

At the heart of the stalemate is Trump's demand for $5 billion in funding for his proposed wall at the U.S.-Mexico border. Congressional Democrats have rejected that figure and in recent weeks have refused to publicly endorse a figure above $1.3 billion, which continues existing funding levels and includes money for new border fencing and levee walls, but not the concrete wall Trump once demanded before he started more recently talking about ""steel slats.""

Mulvaney said Friday that ""some folks use the term 'wall' and they mean different things.""

""Everyone agrees that what we can and should be building on that southern border is that steel barrier that the president tweeted out. That's what he wants to build. The Democrats, believe it or not, don't call that a wall,"" he said.

215,san jose mercury news,https://www.mercurynews.com/2018/12/27/magid-a-momentous-2018-both-good-and-bad-in-tech/,"2018 was a momentous year for tech, but not always in a good way.

One of the biggest stories of the year was Facebook's fall from grace. The company is still strong, but its reputation has been tarnished. It started in 2017 after revelations that Facebook was duped into inadvertently helping Russia influence the 2016 election.

In March, word got out that Cambridge Analytica, a now-defunct British political consulting firm, harvested data from 87 million Facebook users to benefit the Trump presidential campaign.

In April, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg appeared before both House and Senate committees to answer questions about this scandal as well as other issues such as privacy breaches, security flaws and the unsubstantiated claim that Facebook discriminates against conservatives.

Later in the year, Facebook faced more criticism and scandals including reportedly hiring a public relations firm to discredit liberal financier George Soros, prompting criticism from the left as well as the right. Soros, a Jewish holocaust survivor, has been the subject of numerous unrelated conspiracy theories and anti-Semitic attacks.

In June, the New York Times reported that Facebook had data-sharing partnerships with at least four Chinese companies, including Huawei, which has been flagged by U.S. intelligence agencies as a potential security threat. In December, the Times alleged that Facebook had ""more intrusive access to users' personal data than it has disclosed,"" sharing data with the likes of Microsoft, Amazon, Netflix and Spotify.

In a statement, Facebook denied the allegations, but all of these revelations sparked a renewed ""delete Facebook movement"" with some prominent defectors including former Wall Street journalist Walt Mossberg, who recently took to Facebook to say that he's deleting his Facebook, Messenger and Instagram accounts ""because my own values and the policies and actions of Facebook have diverged to the point where I'm no longer comfortable here.""

Google

Google celebrated its 20th anniversary in 2018, but it, too, had a rough year. There was the revelation of a $90 million payout to a former executive who had been credibly accused of sexual harassment, which prompted 20,000 of its employees to walk out for a day.

Google CEO Sundar Pichai went to Washington in December for a grilling by the House Judiciary Committee, including claims by Republicans that liberal employees were introducing anti-conservative bias in its algorithms and search results, a charge that Pichai denied.

Pichai was also called upon to defend his company's data collection policies, including its use of location data. There were also questions about Google's possible project to create a censored search engine in China. Pichai acknowledged that the company had explored such plans but said that there are no current plans to launch such a product.

Tesla

In August, Tesla founder CEO Elon Musk announced that he was going to take the company ""private"" at $420 a share with ""secured funding.""

There was no funding and the SEC didn't think it was funny. Musk was forced to resign as chairman, though he is still CEO. And in a November interview with Axios, Musk admitted that the company was ""within single-digit weeks,"" of death due largely to its inability to build enough of its new Model 3s to bring in necessary revenue.

Tesla upped its production and is now building as many as a thousand cars a day, and just days ahead of New Year's Eve, promised to deliver cars ordered this week to buyers by Monday (in time for the full $7,500 federal tax rebate) or make-up the $3,750 between the full rebate and what buyers will get if they take delivery after December 31.

He also said that the long-promised ""$35,000"" model is about a half a year away, although Tesla did release a 260-mile range model starting at $46,000, down $3,000 from the discontinued version that could go 310 miles between charges. Tesla still has a 310-mile-range car, but it comes with all-wheel drive and starts at $53,000.

Products

There were of course lots of tech products introduced in 2018. The Apple Watch 4 is significant mostly because of its health implications. It can detect if the user falls and can call for help if necessary, but that feature can be accidentally activated by dropping or shaking the watch. It can also take the user's electrocardiogram and measure atrial fibrillation, but -- as I discovered -- it can cause unnecessary anxiety for some users. It's not quite a smartwatch, but Fitbit's Charge 3, introduced this year, does many of the same tasks for less than half the price and has a five-day battery.

Apple also introduced two new iPhones including the $749 iPhone XR, which provides most of the benefits of its new and more expensive iPhone XS for $350 less. Google and Samsung also introduced their flagship phones -- the highly rated Google Pixel 3 (and larger XL version) and the Samsung S9 with its beautiful screen. All three companies upped the game with their phone cameras, virtually eliminating the need for anyone other than very serious photographers to carry around a dedicated digital camera.

Apple finally updated its popular 13-inch MacBook Air with significant design changes, a higher resolution ""Retina"" display, a new keyboard and less weight. Dell, HP, Lenovo and other PC makers continued their march toward lighter and better laptops, many, like the MacBook Air, weighing 2.75 pounds or less.

Smart speakers did very well this year. Both Amazon and Google released newer and better versions of their offerings, and in February, Apple finally introduced its HomePod, which at $349, hasn't done as well as its competitors. Amazon's newest third-generation Echo Dot (on sale during the holidays for $29.99) was one of Amazon's best selling products in December.

Amazon also said that it had record sales this holiday season and shipped more than a billion free packages for Prime users. But all that holiday consumerism makes no sense when you consider that the title of its No. 1 requested song this year was Mariah Carey's ""All I Want for Christmas is You."""
216,twin cities,https://www.twincities.com/2019/01/13/trump-says-he-has-no-idea-if-deal-can-be-made-with-pelosi/,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Republican lawmaker advising President Donald Trump said he is encouraging the president to reopen the government for several weeks to continue negotiating with Democrats over funding for a U.S.-Mexico border wall before the president takes the more drastic step of declaring a national emergency.

But that may be wishful thinking, given that Sen. Lindsey Graham also says Trump still wants to reach a deal for the wall before agreeing to reopen shuttered government departments. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a leading Democratic negotiator, insists that Trump reopen the government first.

The weeks-old standoff over funding led to the partial government shutdown that hit day 23 on Sunday without an end in sight.

""Before he pulls the plug on the legislative option, and I think we're almost there, I would urge him to open up the government for a short period of time, like three weeks, before he pulls the plug, see if we can get a deal,"" said Graham, a South Carolina Republican. ""If we can't at the end of three weeks, all bets are off.""

""See if he can do it by himself through the emergency powers. That's my recommendation,"" added Graham, who has publicly pushed Trump to use his authority to declare a national emergency to build the wall. Such a step would allow Trump to bypass Congress and tap various pots of unspent federal money, including for military construction and disaster relief and from asset seized by law enforcement, to pay for the wall.

Trump has kept Washington on edge over whether he would resort to such a declaration, citing what he says is a ""crisis"" of drug smuggling and the trafficking of women and children at the border. The president initially sounded as though such a move was imminent, but then pulled back. He has said several times since he first mentioned the idea in public earlier this month that he prefers to try to reach a deal with Congress.

A key question is how much more time is Trump willing to give lawmakers. Graham, who said he and Trump talked by telephone on Sunday morning, said the legislative path ""is just about shut off"" and blamed Pelosi.

The speaker's office had no immediate comment.

Democrats oppose an emergency declaration but may be powerless to block it. Some Republicans are wary, too, fearing how a future Democratic president might use that authority. Such a move, should Trump ultimately go that route, would almost certainly be challenged in the courts.

Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., called Graham's idea to reopen the government a ""great place to start.""

""I do think if we reopen the government, if the president ends this shutdown crisis, we have folks who can negotiate a responsible, modern investment in technology that will actually make us safer,"" Coons said.

Trump has maintained that the border cannot be secured without a wall.

Graham said he thinks Trump is willing to accept the $5.7 billion he has insisted on for the wall, along with some immigration measures Democrats might find acceptable, such as helping immigrants who were illegally brought to the U.S. as children.

Trump has expressed interest in a broader immigration overhaul, but says he first wants the Supreme Court to address the class of immigrants known as ""Dreamers."" Pelosi also has shown no interest in accepting a wall -- she has called it an ""immorality"" -- in exchange for immigration fixes.

And, Trump, who was holed up in the White House as snow blanketed Washington on Sunday, appeared to shoot down Graham's suggestion of a ""wall plus"" deal, saying on Twitter that even Democrats don't want to make ""Dreamers"" part of the negotiations.

""The damage done to our Country from a badly broken Border - Drugs, Crime and so much that is bad - is far greater than a Shutdown, which the Dems can easily fix as soon as they come back to Washington!"" Trump said in a separate tweet.

The White House has been laying the groundwork for an emergency declaration, feared by members of both parties.

Senate Homeland Security Committee Chairman Ron Johnson, R-Wis., said he would ""hate to see"" a declaration because then the wall wouldn't get built, presumably because of legal challenges. Democrats voted in the past for border security and should again, he said.

""I actually want to see this wall get built,"" Johnson said. ""I want to keep pressure on Democrats to actually come to the negotiating table in good faith and fund what they have supported in the past.""

But Graham, who favors a presidential declaration, said the time for talk is running out.

""It's the last option, not the first option, but we're pretty close to that being the only option,"" he said.

Graham and Coons spoke on ""Fox News Sunday."" Johnson appeared on CNN's ""State of the Union.""

For AP's complete coverage of the U.S. government shutdown: https://apnews.com/GovernmentShutdown"
217,east idaho news,https://www.eastidahonews.com/2019/01/nancy-pelosi-elected-house-speaker-reclaims-gavel-to-lead-democrats-new-majority/,"(CNN) -- Nancy Pelosi was officially elected the new House speaker on Thursday in a majority vote by the House of Representatives on the first day of the 116th Congress.

She defeated the Republican nominee Kevin McCarthy, winning 220 votes. McCarthy becomes the House minority leader.

As House speaker, Pelosi will regularly face off against President Donald Trump and will preside over an emboldened and energized Democratic majority that is poised to launch aggressive oversight of the President and his administration.

Pelosi also makes history as she reclaims a title she previously held when she served as the first and so far only female House speaker from 2007 to 2011.

A small, but vocal, faction of Democrats initially worked to derail Pelosi's bid to become the next speaker following the 2018 midterm elections, but no challenger against her ever emerged and she ultimately succeed in winning over many of her critics.

Twelve Democrats voted for others besides Pelosi, including former Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Tammy Duckworth of Illinois, Rep. Cheri Bustos of Illinois, Rep. Stephanie Murphy of Florida, Rep. John Lewis of Georgia, Rep. Joe Kennedy of Massachusetts, Rep. Marcia Fudge of Ohio, and Stacey Abrams, who unsuccessfully ran for governor of Georgia. Three Democrats voted present.

One of the most immediate challenges confronting Pelosi as leader of the new House Democratic majority will be the fight over the President's long-promised border wall that triggered a standoff between congressional Democrats and the President and resulted in a partial government shutdown, which is now in its second week.

Pelosi has already outlined a plan for Democrats to pass a legislative package later in the day on Thursday to re-open shuttered parts of the government. Contrary to the President's demands for $5 billion for a border wall, however, the legislation does not provide any new wall funding, setting up an early confrontation between the new Democratic majority and the administration.

Pelosi always projected confidence that she would reclaim the Speaker's gavel, but faced criticism and pushback along the way.

At the end of November, she secured the nomination to become speaker by winning support from a majority of House Democrats -- a total of 203 votes in closed-door leadership elections. But she came up slightly short of the total 218 votes typically needed to win the speakership in the final January vote.

To become Speaker requires the support of a majority of all members of the House who are present and voting, a threshold that could be as high as 218 votes. It would be possible for Pelosi to win with fewer votes, as several previous House speakers have, if some members vote present or decline to participate.

Ahead of the final vote, Pelosi deployed her deal-making abilities to win over detractors, and by mid-December, she appeared to have secured the votes necessary to prevail after negotiating an agreement with some of the Democrats who had been lobbying to block her from the speakership. As part of the agreement, Pelosi backed a proposal to enact term limits for the party's top three leaders.

""I see myself as a bridge to the next generation of leaders, a recognition of my continuing responsibility to mentor and advance new Members into positions of power and responsibility in the House Democratic Caucus,"" Pelosi said in a statement at the time.

218,san jose mercury news,https://www.mercurynews.com/2018/12/18/trump-seeks-funds-to-redirect-to-wall-move-could-be-illegal/,"WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump has directed his cabinet secretaries to search for any stray funds that could be repurposed for the construction of a wall along the Mexico border, conceding that Democrats have stymied his efforts in Congress.

But his new approach sets up more budget and political battles, as it's very difficult to legally redirect taxpayer money without Congress' approval.

""If you do this without going through the proper reprogramming requests and getting all the proper approvals, you are breaking the law,"" said Todd Harrison, director of defense budget analysis at the Center for Strategic and International Studies.

A similar assessment was shared by some Democrats and Republicans on Tuesday, but White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said lawyers were reviewing what was possible.

""That's their entire job is determining whether or something is legal and we are looking to those individuals to find out those specific pots of money that can be used for that,"" she said.

The rapidly changing approach reflects a scramble by Trump aides to deliver on one of his core campaign promises without much assistance from Congress. The White House hasn't settled on a plan for funding a border wall, and Republicans haven't devised a way to obtain even a small portion of the spending Trump has demanded.

This has led to complaints from supporters of new restrictions on immigration that the White House fumbled one of their top priorities and never had a plan on how to proceed.

Mark Krikorian, executive director of the Center for Immigration Studies, said Trump has repeatedly threatened to fight Democrats over border wall funding only to back down at the last minute, making clear to Democrats that he would capitulate again.

""I think this really undermines the president's credibility,"" said Krikorian, whose think tank has broad influence inside the Trump administration and favors tight restrictions on immigration. ""Why didn't he go to the mattresses the first time this became an issue?""

The Constitution requires Congress's approval before money can be allocated and spent, which has made it difficult for Trump to secure money for a border wall so far.

One of Trump's central campaign promises in 2016 was the construction of a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, and he vowed he would force Mexico to finance the entire project. Since becoming president, he abandoned that call, saying instead that taxpayer money should be devoted to the project and threatening repeatedly to shut down the government if his demands weren't met.

In a Twitter post last week, Trump suggested a pending trade deal with Canada and Mexico would somehow provide the needed money to build a wall along the Mexico border, though his advisers have not explained how this would work. Sanders said Tuesday it would come from new revenue to the Treasury Department triggered by economic growth, but this would be very hard to measure with any precision, if at all.

Congress has passed several spending bills in the last year that did allow the Trump administration to repair and rebuild existing portions of border walls and even add some new barriers, but these projects have fallen far short of the scope Trump sought during the campaign.

The Department of Homeland Security said the Trump administration has already begun work on 14 miles of wall in the San Diego area and another 20 miles near Santa Teresa, New Mexico. But the U.S.-Mexico border stretches for about 2,000 miles.

In the runup to the midterm elections last month, Trump overstated the amount of progress the government has made in the past year constructing barriers. He said he had already secured $3.2 billion for these projects, an inflated figure. And incoming House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., has said she will not support funding to build additional barriers once Democrats take control of the House of Representatives in January.

There have been varying estimates for the cost of a full or partial wall along the Mexico border, with many starting at around $25 billion. Trump last week said $5 billion would be an ample amount to make major progress creating a partial blockade along the border that is sufficient to block immigrants from crossing into the U.S.

On Tuesday, as it became clear Democrats would not approve even half that amount, Sanders said the White House would be satisfied with $1.6 billion in new appropriations from Congress and then find other ways to cover the remaining $3.4 billion. But a few hours later, Democrats said they had never agreed to spending even $1.6 billion for the construction of a new wall. Democrats have long said that money is for replacing existing walls and barriers, though the White House has said the money would be for new barriers.

The federal government is projected to spend more than $4 trillion this year, and the $5 billion sought by the White House for a border wall represents less than 0.1 percent of that. But even moving around that amount of money could be considered illegal without congressional approval.

""This is pretty tricky business,"" said Elaine Kamarck, a former top Clinton White House official. She said agencies can occasionally move around smaller sums of money without congressional input, but never anywhere near the amount the Trump administration is trying to secure.

Congress has already passed a defense law to fund the military through the end of September, making it hard for lawmakers to siphon off any money that is already allocated for military programs. Funding for the Department of Homeland Security expires on Friday at midnight, but Democrats are closely monitoring any new request for that agency in order to prevent it from being used for a wall.

""I think our appropriations process restricts the wall, so I don't see how he does it legally,"" said Sen. Ben Cardin, D-Md.

Sen. Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn., said the White House could be looking for any money in other agencies that was specified to be used for ""border security"" but otherwise would come up short.

""If they have authority to deal with border security, they can spend the money,"" he said. ""If they don't have congressional authority, they can't.""

Comments from Sanders and a number of Republicans on Tuesday made clear that there wasn't a concrete plan going forward and that multiple scenarios were being considered.

""We are looking at existing funding from other agencies right now,"" Sanders said."
219,hot air,https://hotair.com/archives/2019/01/10/quick-solution-defiant-landowners-along-border/,"As the President heads down to the Texas border this morning, there's no sign of any sort of deal involving another $5.7B to build hundreds of additional miles of wall, fence, steel slats or whatever the description of the day happens to be. It's easy to forget, however, that Donald Trump previously secured some funding for 33 miles of ""barrier"" in Texas last March and that work is supposed to be kicking into gear. Simply having the money, however, doesn't mean the project is shovel ready. First, the government must secure the land to put the wall on.

That's not a given in many cases. The Associated Press has an interview with one landowner with property along the Rio Grande who has no intention of allowing construction on her property. And she claims that it's not a question of writing him a big enough check.

As President Donald Trump travels to the border in Texas to make the case for his $5.7 billion wall, landowner Eloisa Cavazos says she knows firsthand how the project will play out if the White House gets its way.

The federal government has started surveying land along the border in Texas and announced plans to start construction next month. Rather than surrender their land, some property owners are digging in, vowing to reject buyout offers and preparing to fight the administration in court.

""You could give me a trillion dollars and I wouldn't take it,"" said Cavazos, whose land sits along the Rio Grande, the river separating the U.S. and Mexico in Texas. ""It's not about money.""

Ms. Cavazos is only one of many thorns in Trump's side when it comes to building the border wall. So what should the government do about these defiant landowners? Negotiations leading to a resolution which satisfies both parties would be the ideal situation, but some, like Cavazos, who say that even ""a trillion dollars"" wouldn't do the trick aren't going to allow that to be an option.

The more crude, sledgehammer approach would be to then resort to eminent domain. That should clearly be a legally viable option, despite what some of the talking heads on CNN are saying this week. Under proper use of eminent domain, the land in question must be taken for ""public use."" (Of course, the execrable Kelo decision states that land can be taken for ""public benefit"" which makes it all the easier, but vastly hypocritical for conservatives.) A water or sewage treatment plant is ""used"" by the public even if they don't physically go and hang out at the facility because such projects serve the entire community. In the same fashion, a wall that protects the citizens from foreign invaders is ""used"" by everyone.

Still, to be true to conservative principles, eminent domain should be avoided wherever possible, respecting the rights of landowners to forge their own future. So if we can't negotiate with the landowners and don't wish to forcibly seize their property, what option is left? I have one suggestion, though some will find it distasteful.

First, let's answer the question of specifically where a border wall has to be placed. We don't put it exactly on the border. In many cases that would require building it in the middle of a river. You can't even put it directly on the riverbank because the land is generally too weak and muddy to support such a structure. With that as a starting point, there really isn't any hard and fast rule as to how far back from the border the barrier must be.

Keeping that premise in mind, if Ms. Cavazos doesn't want to negotiate a deal to have the wall on her property, let's pull the line back until we reach a piece of land that can be made available and build it there. In other words, all of the property owners along the border who don't wish to support protecting our border can be put on the other side of the wall. This doesn't need to be a cruel or inhumane solution. We'll be sure to provide a port of entry every so often along the fence and have roads running along the outside so property owners can reach them. Assuming the landowners are all legal U.S. citizens, they will have no trouble getting through customs at the port of entry for any business they need to conduct in the interior of the country. (It just might take a bit longer if there are a lot of people waiting to get through.)

Problem solved. This plan carries an added bonus. The more border that's secured with a proper barrier, the fewer customs and immigration enforcement agents will be needed to patrol it. That will free them up to handle the traffic of legal travelers needing to pass through the ports of entry. Of course, as soon as the landowners learn that they're about to find themselves on the wrong side of the wall, they may reconsider that whole negotiating thing."
220,mynorthwest.com,http://mynorthwest.com/1241533/congress-to-face-same-question-when-will-shutdown-end/??,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congress returns to Washington for its first full week of legislative business since control of the House reverted to Democrats, but lawmakers will be confronted with the same lingering question: When will the partial government shutdown end?

One Republican senator says he's offered President Donald Trump a possible solution, though it may just be wishful thinking.

Sen. Lindsey Graham is encouraging Trump to reopen government for several weeks to continue negotiating with Democrats over the border wall Trump wants to build on the U.S.-Mexico border. If there's no deal at the end of that time, Graham says Trump would be free to take the more dramatic step of declaring a national emergency to build it.

But the South Carolina Republican says Trump still wants a deal on funding for the wall before agreeing to reopen shuttered government departments. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat, insists Trump reopen the government first.

Their weeks-old standoff led to the partial government shutdown, now on day 24 without a clear end in sight.

""Before he pulls the plug on the legislative option, and I think we're almost there, I would urge him to open up the government for a short period of time, like three weeks, before he pulls the plug, see if we can get a deal,"" Graham said. ""If we can't at the end of three weeks, all bets are off.

""See if he can do it by himself through the emergency powers. That's my recommendation,"" added Graham, who has publicly pushed Trump to use his authority to declare a national emergency to build the wall. Such a step would allow Trump to bypass Congress and tap various pots of unspent federal money, including for military construction and disaster relief as well as from assets seized by law enforcement, to pay for the wall.

Trump has kept Washington on edge over whether he would resort to such a declaration, citing what he says is a ""crisis"" of drug smuggling and the trafficking of women and children at the border. The president initially sounded as though such a move was imminent, but then pulled back. He has said several times since he first mentioned the idea in public this month that he prefers a legislative solution.

A key question is how much more time is Trump willing to give lawmakers. Graham, who spoke with Trump by telephone on Sunday morning, said the legislative path ""is just about shut off"" and blamed intransigence by Pelosi.

The speaker's office had no immediate comment.

Democrats oppose an emergency declaration but may be powerless to block it. Some Republicans are wary, too, fearing how a future Democratic president might use that authority. Such a move, should Trump ultimately go that route, would almost certainly be challenged in the courts.

Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., called Graham's idea to reopen the government a ""great place to start.""

""I do think if we reopen the government, if the president ends this shutdown crisis, we have folks who can negotiate a responsible, modern investment in technology that will actually make us safer,"" Coons said.

Trump says technology is nice, but that the border can't be secured without a wall.

The White House has been laying the groundwork for an emergency declaration, which is feared by lawmakers in both parties.

Senate Homeland Security Committee Chairman Ron Johnson, R-Wis., said he'd ""hate to see"" a declaration issued because the wall wouldn't get built, presumably because of legal challenges. Democrats voted in the past for border security and should again, he said.

""I actually want to see this wall get built,"" Johnson said. ""I want to keep pressure on Democrats to actually come to the negotiating table in good faith and fund what they have supported in the past.""

Graham favors a declaration and said the time for talk is running out.

""It's the last option, not the first option, but we're pretty close to that being the only option,"" he said.

Graham and Coons spoke on ""Fox News Sunday"" and Johnson appeared on CNN's ""State of the Union.""

For AP's complete coverage of the U.S. government shutdown: https://apnews.com/GovernmentShutdown"
221,times union,https://www.timesunion.com/news/article/University-researchers-await-word-on-government-13506815.php,"ALBANY -- Two weeks into the federal shutdown, college and university officials are waiting to see how the spending freeze impacts the numerous research projects that are funded through the government. But they stress it's too early to say if particular initiatives are in danger of outright derailment.

""The impact to SUNY, like any higher education institution receiving federal grants for research, depends on the length of the shutdown,"" State University of New York spokeswoman Holly Liapis said in a statement.

She said continued uncertainty about the duration of the shutdown could impact federal agencies this month, ""which would then affect research institutions and their faculty members from submitting new proposals, attending pre-scheduled review panels, and receiving payments and awards on time.

""This would have a detrimental impact and prevent our faculty, students, and staff from conducting leading-edge research on campuses,"" Liapis said.

Approximately 800,000 federal employees have been furloughed or are working without pay during the shutdown, prompted by an impasse over funding for President Donald J. Trump's proposed wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.

Among those workers are employees of federal agencies that review, approve and help fund basic scientific and technological research at universities across the nation, said Christopher Nomura, vice president for research at the SUNY College of Environmental Science and Forestry in Syracuse.

""At this point, it's too early to tell -- but if this becomes prolonged it will have an impact,"" Nomura said.

One of the projects he oversees explores how bacteria react to the surrounding environment. Researchers are focusing on a particular strain that can be lethal to people with cystic fibrosis.

Getting a university research project started and keeping it operating entails a number of steps and moving parts, Nomura explained.

A researcher with an idea for an experiment or inquiry will offer an initial proposal to a federal agency such as the U.S. Department of Agriculture, National Institutes of Health or National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.

Once the initial approval is secured, the plan is then peer-reviewed to determine whether it is worth funding. After that hurdle is cleared, money for equipment and to pay research assistants -- often doctoral candidates -- is disbursed.

Because the process can take months, it takes a while to feel the impact of a shutdown.

Additionally, colleges and universities have been on Christmas-New Year's break as the shutdown was unfolding.

""If this extended into May, or even through February, it could cause issues,"" said Nomura."
222,mynorthwest.com,http://mynorthwest.com/1239560/shutdown-suspends-federal-cleanups-at-us-superfund-sites/??,"BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) -- The government shutdown has suspended federal cleanups at Superfund sites around the nation and forced the cancellation of public hearings, deepening the mistrust and resentment of surrounding residents who feel people in power long ago abandoned them to live among the toxic residue of the country's factories and mines.

""We are already hurting, and it's just adding more fuel to the fire,"" says 40-year-old Keisha Brown, whose wood-frame home is in a community nestled among coking plants and other factories on Birmingham's north side.

The mostly African-American community has been forced to cope with high levels of arsenic, lead and other contaminants in the soil that the Environmental Protection Agency has been scraping up and carting away, house by house.

As President Donald Trump and Congress battle over Trump's demand for a wall on the southern U.S. border, the nearly 3-week-old partial government shutdown has stopped federal work on Superfund sites except for cases where the administration deems ""there is an imminent threat to the safety of human life or to the protection of property.""

EPA's shutdown plans said the agency would evaluate about 800 Superfund sites to see how many could pose an immediate threat. As an example of that kind of threat, it cited an acid leak from a mine that could threaten the public water supply. That's the hazard at Northern California's Iron Mountain mine, where EPA workers help prevent an unending flow of lethally acidic runoff off the Superfund site from spilling into rivers downstream.

Practically speaking, said Bonnie Bellow, a former EPA official who worked on Superfund public outreach at the agency, the impact of the stoppage of work at sites across the nation ""wholly depends"" on the length of the shutdown.

""Unless there is immediate risk like a storm, a flood, a week or two of slowdowns is not going to very likely affect the cleanup at the site,"" Bellow said.

In north Birmingham, Brown said it's been a couple of weeks since she's spotted any EPA crews at people's houses. It wasn't clear if state workers or contractors were continuing work.

But long before the shutdown began, Brown harbored doubts the cleanup was working anyway. ""My main concern is the health of the people out here,"" said Brown, who has asthma. ""All of us are sick, and we've got to function on medicine every day.""

In terms of time, the federal government shutdown is a chronological blip in the long history of the site -- which includes ethics charges in a local bribery scandal to block federal cleanup efforts -- but adds to the uncertainty in an area where residents feel forgotten and betrayed.

At the EPA, the shutdown has furloughed the bulk of the agency's roughly 14,000 employees. It also means the EPA isn't getting most of the daily stream of environmental questions and tips from the public. Routine inspections aren't happening. State, local and private emails to EPA officials often get automated messages back promising a response when the shutdown ends.

In Montana, for instance, state officials this month found themselves fielding calls from a tribal member worried about drinking water with a funny look to it, said Kristi Ponozzo, public-policy director at that state's Department of Environmental Quality. The EPA normally provides tribes with technical assistance on water supplies.

With most EPA colleagues idled, Ponozzo said, her agency also had to call off an environmental review meeting for a mining project, potentially delaying the project.

But it's the agency's work at Superfund sites -- lessening the threat from old nuclear-weapons plants, chemical factories, mines and other entities -- that gets much of the attention.

Absent imminent peril, it would be up to state governments or contractors to continue any cleanup during the shutdown ""up to the point that additional EPA direction or funding is needed,"" the EPA said in a statement.

""Sites where cleanup activities have been stopped or shut down will be secured until cleanup activities are able to commence when the federal government reopens,"" the agency said.

For federal Superfund sites in Michigan, the shutdown means there are no EPA colleagues to consult, said Scott Dean, a spokesman for that state's Department of Environmental Quality.

At Michigan Superfund sites, day-to-day field operations were continuing since private contractors do most of the on-the-ground work, Dean said.

Bellow, the former EPA official, said the cancellation of hearings about Superfund sites posed immediate concerns.

In East Chicago, Indiana, for example, the EPA called off a planned public hearing set for last Wednesday to outline how the agency planned to clean up high levels of lead and arsenic in the soil.

The EPA has proposed a seven-month, $26.5 million cleanup that includes treating and removing tainted soil from the area, where a lead smelter previously was located.

During a public meeting Nov. 29, some residents complained that the EPA's approach would leave too much pollution in place. But others didn't get a chance to speak and were hoping to do so at the meeting this week, said Debbie Chizewer, a Northwestern University environmental attorney who represents community groups in the low-income area.

The EPA announced the cancellation in an online notice and gave no indication that it would be rescheduled.

Leaders of the East Chicago Calumet Community Advisory Group asked for a new hearing date and an extension of a Jan. 14 public comment deadline in a letter to the EPA's regional Superfund division.

Calls by The Associated Press to the agency's regional office in Chicago this week were not answered.

Local critics fear the EPA will use the delay caused by the shutdown as justification for pushing ahead with a cleanup strategy they consider flawed, Chizewer said, even though the agency has designated the affected area as an ""environmental justice community"" -- a low-income community of color that has been disproportionately harmed by pollution.

The EPA has a ""special obligation"" when dealing with such communities, Chizewer said. ""This would be an example of shutting them out for no good reason.""

In North Birmingham, former longtime neighborhood resident Charlie Powell said most of the people living in and around the Superfund site had already ""just got tired and fed up.""

Powell left the area but started a group called PANIC, People Against Neighborhood Industrial Contamination. He believes money would be better spent helping residents move away from the pollution.

""Can I say hell?"" Powell said when asked what residents have been through.

224,pmnewsnigeria.com,https://www.pmnewsnigeria.com/2018/12/23/ohio-governor-kasich-mulls-challenging-trump-in-2020/,"The Governor of Ohio, United States (U.S.), John Kasich, has said that he is considering challenging President Donald Trump in the 2020 primary election of the Republican Party.

Kasich who suspended his 2016 presidential bid in May of that year, only to win in his home state of Ohio after consistently lagging far behind Trump in all major polls said his decision was necessitated by the current disturbing political climate in the country under the Trump leadership.

He said he has a slew of advisers analyzing his prospective candidacy every day.

""All options are on the table,"" Kasich said, including running as an Independent if he cannot secure the Republican Party nomination.

""We look every day; I have a team of people who look every day at the factors that go into a consideration like that. We assess it, and at some point I will make a decision.""

Kasich said Republicans performed well in Ohio during the 2018 midterm elections and got ""smashed"" elsewhere because the GOP in Ohio used a different ""road map"" -- one focused on ""hopefulness.""

Republicans last month secured a veto-proof majority in the Ohio State Legislature, and won not only the gubernatorial contest but all four down-ticket races.

Trump won Ohio by nearly 10 points in the 2016 presidential race, and several political analysts now say the state -- owing in part to changing demographics -- is no longer the swing state it historically has been.

""You can't ignore your allies. You can't just do things on your own -- 'America First,'"" Kasich said, referring to the president's campaign slogan and stated principle of governance.

He noted that primary challenges can severely damage sitting presidents, even though primary challengers themselves have not won the presidency in the modern era.

Kasich said: Pat Buchanan's 1992 race against President George H.W. Bush for the Republican nomination demonstrated the influence of the party's hard-right wing, and Ted Kennedy's 1980 bid against President Jimmy Carter deeply divided Democrats just as Republicans united behind then-nominee Ronald Reagan.

According to Kasich, Trump has erred by not pushing a prospective deal this summer to provide border wall funding in exchange for a pathway to citizenship for Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients.

""A president can't just get everything they want.

""I don't understand why he didn't make the deal. Give me a couple billion for the wall and in exchange for that we let the DACA people stay,"" Kasich said.

But House Republicans had overwhelmingly rejected that arrangement.

The sprawling, compromise GOP immigration bill that would have provided a path to citizenship for young illegal immigrants while directing $25 billion for the construction of a border wall failed in the House by a 301-121 vote, despite encouragement from the president for Republicans to support it.

Kasich concluded by criticizing Trump's announced withdrawal of troops from Syria, saying that while the decision may have fulfilled a campaign promise, it was ""precipitous"" and came too quickly without proper warning to allies in the region.

""The implications of what all this means long-term for our foreign policy, for our domestic agenda, is really up in the air."
225,bizpac review,https://www.bizpacreview.com/2019/01/11/gop-senators-bill-to-withhold-pay-from-congress-members-during-govt-shutdowns-catches-on-712311,"Republican Montana Sen. Steve Daines introduced a bill on the Senate floor Thursday that would withhold the pay of members of Congress during future government shutdowns.

Daines's introduction of the bill, sponsored by Republican Texas Sen. John Cornyn, comes hours after Daines announced he sent a letter requesting the secretary of the U.S. Senate withhold his pay during the ongoing partial shutdown of the federal government.

""Members of Congress are sent to Washington, D.C., to represent the great people of their state and keep the federal government open, working and funded. So it's simple. If they can't do that, they shouldn't get paid. No work, no pay,"" Daines told The Daily Caller News Foundation after the bill was introduced.

The ""No Work, No Pay Act,"" introduced by Daines, would make it so members of Congress would not be paid if they cannot keep the government funded.

His move to not accept pay was followed by many of his colleagues, such as Cornyn, who said he was excited to join Daines in co-sponsoring the bill. He echoed Daines's message that members of Congress should not be paid while government agencies are shut down.

""The senator is very hopeful his colleagues will follow suit as this is a very important issue in bringing accountability to Washington, D.C.,"" Daines's Deputy Communications Director Katie Schoettler told TheDCNF.

In the House, Republican Utah Rep. John Curtis introduced a similar bill, which would make it unlawful to pay U.S. senators and representatives during government shutdowns.

Republican Texas Rep. Dan Crenshaw also announced Thursday he would refuse to be paid until the government is open, saying he asked the chief administrative officer to withhold his pay until both sides can come to an agreement on border security.

""Democrats aren't the only people who want this shutdown to end. Republicans have tried to compromise, but Democrats won't come to the table and negotiate in good faith. I cannot let federal employees take the fall for Democrats' grandstanding, so I am withholding my pay until this partial shutdown ends,"" Crenshaw told TheDCNF.

Republican Indiana Rep. Greg Pence, another freshman congressman, released a video Thursday, saying he too would not accept his pay until the southern border is secured, echoing President Donald Trump's message. Trump traveled to the southern border to meet with Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) officials.

Pence campaigned on fighting the opioid crisis plaguing the country, something he considers a top priority and not a partisan issue.

""We are facing a serious opioid crisis and it seems that some Democrats refuse to acknowledge this,"" Pence told TheDCNF Thursday afternoon. ""It's important that we work to solve the crisis, which includes securing our border. Hancock County for example, had 50 overdose deaths between 2014-2017, and in 29 of the cases, opioids were found. This isn't a partisan issue.""

Oklahoma Republican Rep. Kevin Hern is donating his salary from the shutdown to veterans organizations, saying they deserve the money over members of Congress in the midst of a partial government shutdown.

""I've long held the belief that if you don't do your job, you shouldn't get paid. Being elected to Congress shouldn't exempt us from the standards that any employer would hold. If Congress can't fund the government, we shouldn't be paid for failing to do our Constitutional duty,"" Hern told TheDCNF Thursday night.

As the government entered its 19th day of a partial shutdown Wednesday, five Republican lawmakers -- Ohio Rep. Bob Gibbs, North Carolina Rep. Mark Meadows, Indiana Rep. Susan Brooks, Colorado Rep. Scott Tipton and Virginia Rep. Morgan Griffith -- introduced legislation that would require federal workers to be paid during the shutdown.

""While Democrats continue to play politics with border security, federal employees dedicated to their mission of keeping America safe and our border secure are still going to work knowing they will be missing their paychecks,"" Gibbs said in a Wednesday statement.

Trump was on Capitol Hill Wednesday meeting with Republican senators to discuss the shutdown and border wall funding. After the meeting, he said Republicans were ""unified.""

The president also warned Democrats he might declare a national emergency if they cannot come to an agreement soon."

A Republican lawmaker advising President Donald Trump said he is encouraging the president to reopen the government for several weeks to continue negotiating with Democrats over funding for a US-Mexico border wall before the president takes the more drastic step of declaring a national emergency.

But that may be wishful thinking, given that Senator Lindsey Graham also says Mr Trump still wants to reach a deal for the wall before agreeing to reopen shuttered government departments. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a leading Democratic negotiator, insists that Mr Trump reopen the government first.

The weeks-old standoff over funding led to the partial government shutdown that hit day 23 on Sunday without an end in sight.

US government shutdown over border wall becomes longest in history

""Before he pulls the plug on the legislative option, and I think we're almost there, I would urge him to open up the government for a short period of time, like three weeks, before he pulls the plug, see if we can get a deal,"" said Mr Graham, a South Carolina Republican.

The president initially sounded as though such a move was imminent, but then pulled back.

A key question is how much more time is Mr Trump willing to give lawmakers. Mr Graham, who said he and Mr Trump talked by telephone on Sunday morning, said the legislative path ""is just about shut off"" and blamed Ms Pelosi.

The speaker's office had no immediate comment.

Democrats oppose an emergency declaration but may be powerless to block it. Some Republicans are wary, too, fearing how a future Democratic president might use that authority. Such a move, should Mr Trump ultimately go that route, would almost certainly be challenged in the courts.

""I do think if we reopen the government, if the president ends this shutdown crisis, we have folks who can negotiate a responsible, modern investment in technology that will actually make us safer,"" Mr Coons said.

Mr Trump has maintained that the border cannot be secured without a wall.

Mr Graham said he thinks Mr Trump is willing to accept the $5.7 billion he has insisted on for the wall, along with some immigration measures Democrats might find acceptable, such as helping immigrants who were illegally brought to the US as children.

Mr Trump has expressed interest in a broader immigration overhaul, but says he first wants the Supreme Court to address the class of immigrants known as 'Dreamers'. Ms Pelosi also has shown no interest in accepting a wall -- she has called it an ""immorality"" -- in exchange for immigration fixes.

And, Mr Trump, who was holed up in the White House as snow blanketed Washington on Sunday, appeared to shoot down Mr Graham's suggestion of a 'wall plus' deal, saying on Twitter that even Democrats don't want to make 'Dreamers' part of the negotiations.

""The damage done to our Country from a badly broken Border - Drugs, Crime and so much that is bad - is far greater than a Shutdown, which the Dems can easily fix as soon as they come back to Washington!"" Mr Trump said in a separate tweet.

The White House has been laying the groundwork for an emergency declaration, feared by members of both parties.

The year gone by has thrown up a lot of surprises for the Palestinians and supporters of their cause. But what if next year there was an even bigger shock: a United States peace plan, long in the making, which actually gave them what they wanted - a state of their own with internationally recognised borders, living side by side with Israel, with East Jerusalem as its capital, not the humiliating offer of Abu Dis. No West Bank confederation with Jordan, no pushing Gaza into Egypt's Sinai Peninsula and no passing the buck for the damage caused by Israel's occupation. Instead, the rejoining of both Palestinian territories to lay the ground for a contiguous state and improved prospects of Palestinian unity between rival factions Fatah and Hamas.

Israeli forces would withdraw from the West Bank, along with the 400,000 illegal settlers they protect for its ""Greater Israel"" enterprise. Children, women and men would be able to go to school and work without passing through checkpoints, without being harassed or searched, without fear of random shootings or assaults. There would be an end to the siege in Gaza so the economy can improve, there would be jobs that can lift residents out of misery and freedom of travel that would transform the enclave.

An American figure who has not funded illegal set­tlements would spearhead the plan. Not Jared Kush­ner or David Friedman, the son-in-law and bankruptcy lawyer-turned US ambassador who have profited from the Trump family for years and raised American cash for one of the most hardline Israeli outposts, Beit El, but someone with diplomatic experience who can hold court with both sides, an individual whom the Palestinians can trust. The US clawing back its stake as a fair and impartial mediator to deliver a real end to the conflict, but with support for any deal secured from the EU, Gulf, Russia and China.

There would be condemnation of Israeli attacks and policies in the West Bank and Gaza, as the US does with Palestinian attacks - home demolitions, extrajudicial killings and the sniping of both children and unarmed adults at border protests no longer going unpunished. Policies enacted in the past year would be reversed. The US embassy would be moved back to Tel Aviv until the contested city's status is agreed. Funding returning to UNRWA, East Jerusalem hospitals that help sick Palestinians and coexistence programmes. Any plan must ensure that innocent and helpless people are not the victims of the plan, but rather the beneficiaries. If they are not, then every­thing else will be treated as hot air.

Leaders would have the courage to strike a deal, such as Israeli statesman Yitzhak Rabin who sought and could sell a vision of peace with the Palestinians, a policy that cost him his life at the hands of the Israeli far-right. They wouldn't be so mired in corruption al­legations that they'll do anything to protect their posi­tion, not least act against the Palestinians to appease the far-right who want to replace them with an even more hardline vision for the conflict. And Palestinian leaders would remain defiant in the face of Israeli oppression, not seek self-preservation and co-operate with the Israeli government to consolidate the power of both themselves and their cronies.

For the ordinary Palestinian, this is just a dream. But wouldn't it be nice?

Are Instagram and mindfulness compatible? Don't worry, it's not a trick question - the answer is very definitely ""no"". Mindfulness, you see, is about being in the moment; it is about focusing on the sensations, whatever they may be, that you are experiencing right now.

Instagram, on the other hand, has been specifically designed to stop you doing this. As you scroll, your mind is coaxed from the present. Forgive me for spelling this out, but it really isn't pos­sible - like, not at all possible - to be in the moment if you're thinking about what someone else is doing at some other time in some other place.

But try telling that to the 10.5 million people using the mindfulness hashtag on Instagram. Can none of them see the contradiction? Apparently not. ""Ten­sion is who you think you should be,"" one recent post reads. ""Relaxation is who you are."" Very true, no doubt, but I'd amend that to. ""Tension is who you think you should be, particularly when you've been made to feel inadequate by spending an hour scrolling through Instagram."" Stick that in front of a pretty sunset.

Aside from the fact that posting about mindfulness is a virulent form of anti-mindfulness, it is also just so incredibly tedious for the rest of us. I'm glad for you if mindfulness is making you feel better. All I ask in 2019 is that you remember that posting about it makes the rest of us feel worse. And for those of you screaming, ""Log off then!"" - come on, don't be silly.

This scourge of social media reached its nadir in 2018 when Twitter founder Jack Dorsey posted an 18-tweet thread about his meditation retreat in Myanmar. ""I was able to focus entirely on my breath, without thoughts, for over an hour,"" read one. Best of all, though, was when he used his Apple Watch to monitor his heart-rate. Because nothing says inner peace quite like checking your Apple Watch on the hour.

Social media has made narcissists of us all. But I don't mind that. Holiday snaps, cute dogs, happy cou­ples - all are entertaining enough. Posts about mind­fulness are embarrassingly self-indulgent. By all means practise it - just have the good grace to be mindful of those who don't. That way we can all be #happy.

Since June 23, 2016, Britain has been a divided country - bitterly and almost equally split between those who voted to leave the European Union and those who wished to remain part of it. Leavers are a mob of underemployed and over-tattooed bigots from the provinces, while remainers are an effete, superior bunch who live in leafy areas of big cities and probably get to work on Brompton bikes. At least that's what some people want you to believe. The reality, as ever, is more complicated.

The decision to leave or remain came in many different shades. Take me for example. On a purely philosophical level, I was never keen on the idea of a largely unelected, supranational body having much say in my life. On a more practical one, I have, over the years, been appalled by the EU's heavy-handed, austerity-driven approach to economically disadvantaged member states such as Greece, Portugal and Ireland. In spite of all these misgivings, I cast my vote to remain. This decision was made on the basis of economic pragmatism, an attachment to the idea that borders should always be as open as possible, and a belief that both the official and the unofficial leave campaigns were trading in outright lies and barely concealed racism. Similarly, a considerable number of traditional left-wing voters opted to leave on anti-capitalist grounds, while many outward-looking, free-market conservatives chose to stay.

Ever since the result was announced, many commentators have characterised the decision to leave as an incoherent, self-lacerating outpouring of rage from a ""white working class"" that had been ""left behind"", incapable of making informed choices about its own future. This stereotype is probably more revealing than the ballot itself. An overwhelming number of affluent, older middle-class people voted to leave, too, largely based on a hankering for the past and the erroneous belief that ""waves"" of immigration have changed British society beyond recognition. Far less blame has been apportioned to them. The truth is, Britain is deeply divided, but the lines were not drawn in 2016. They are rooted in a system of privilege that has existed for centuries.

With the deadlines for the nation's departure from the EU fast-approaching and the end result seeming evermore precarious, hostility between leavers and remainers is rising. And it is becoming increasingly clear that when - or perhaps if - Brexit happens, the road is not going to be smooth. But if there's one lesson to be learnt from global political events of the past few years, it is that large sections of society cannot be left to flounder while others prosper. Should we wish to salvage anything from the ashes of Brexit, the new Britain that emerges must be based around inclusion, cohesion and equality of opportunity, not the insularity, personal enrichment and negligence that brought us here in the first place.

By the time I was 16, I had been inappropriately groped; had a man expose himself to me as I was waiting for a bus in the morning and had spent close to a decade fielding comments from men that made me feel uncomfortable in a way I wasn't weary enough to fully understand (and I believe, from the conversations I've had, that I am one of the very lucky ones). Did I do anything at the time? No, because societal subtext tells young girls not to make a fuss. We are meant to be ""nice"", but in 2018, some ladies were ""nasty"" - and I mean this as a compliment.

It's been 14 months since #MeToo went viral (but activist Tarana Burke began the movement in 2006), and social media has been flooded with a general calling out of a toxic culture in which people dehumanise and debase other people (both male and female). But wouldn't it be nice if 2019 was the year, not in which more people felt like they could share their stories, but in which fewer moments of terror and discomfort were doled out?

I'm not interested in sharing the details of my uncomfortable encounters via social media (it's just not for me), but I'm glad so many women did. I don't want girls and boys today to feel like they can't, I want them to be more evolved and more demanding than I am (or, at least, was).

I'd like a world in which women don't instinctively cross the road when they spot a group of men down the street; don't walk with car keys poised as some sort of useless shiv, just in case. I must point out that my palm remains free of a key-as-weapon in this country, because I don't feel that innate fear in the UAE, which is a huge reason why I love living here.

While Hollywood needs a clearing out of execs who take advantage of the vulnerable, wouldn't it be nice if the effects of #MeToo filtered down to the most vulnerable? To those cleaning offices at night who can't lose their jobs so don't complain about their boss, to the homeless who are often scared of the authorities they should turn to, or refugees who don't have a state as an anchor?

Some people claim the pendulum has swung too far, and there are anecdotes that show people misappropriating the ""movement"", but they are just that, one-off stories. There are far more moments that point to a systematic issue: a man who was recorded brazenly talking about how consent didn't apply to him because he was in a position of power, was elected as POTUS, even after everyone heard him say so. Roman Polanski (who raped a 13-year-old girl in 1977) is currently filming his next movie (J'accuse), which is sure to be lauded by critics. And, on a random day last month - November 19 - BBC journalists across the globe took note of the number of women killed in crimes in which the main motive was their gender: they found 47. In one day. Those were the ones reported.

The word ""work"" is attached to very contradictory phrases - on the one hand, we have people who seek to work hard but play harder, and on the other, those who are about all work and no play. Dull countenance aside, the latter group are at risk of working themselves into the ground in an attempt to work their way up.

One of the most alarming phrases I heard this year was ""work-life integration"", which is threatening to take over the more digestible ""work-life balance"". The latter throws up images of a holistic existence, where one has enough time to heed Leisure poet William Henry Davies's suggestion to stand and stare, while the former essentially suggests that life is about being constantly switched on.

Much was made earlier this year about a survey conducted by real estate group Perpetual Guardian, which found that getting its employees to work for 32 hours a week over four days - instead of 40 hours over five days - resulted in lower levels of stress, greater engagement and improved performance. The New Zealand-based company promptly decided to implement the change permanently, joining a growing number of others, most of which are located in countries that routinely appear on ""world's happiest"" lists.

Saliha Afridi, clinical psychologist and founder of The LightHouse Centre for Wellbeing in Dubai says: ""There is something about human nature that when you give someone less time, they get the same amount done as they would if you'd given them longer for the task. When you have less time, you are more focused.""

Balance is key, of course - balancing deadlines with attention spans, profits with productivity levels, and corporate growth / individual ambition with (insert as appropriate: family bonding / travel experiences / dig­ital detox / interpersonal communication / me-time). After all, some of our best ideas emerge when we are relaxed, on holiday, interacting with others and, in my case, when I come to something fresh and well-rested.

A four-day week has the potential to allow us to implement what is currently my favourite adage: work smarter, not harder. After all, and on the fifth day we rested, works like a charm, too.

Judging by the uninspiring sounds on Arabic radio these days, the suggestion that the next global music hit should come from the region may seem laughable. But the talent exists. The clues that the Arab world could produce its first truly international hit point to the West rather than the region's traditional pop music centres of Beirut and Cairo. Where those cities specialise in churning out radio-friendly fodder and the latest line of television talent quest-winners, a new generation of Arab and North African producers are making their mark in pop music elsewhere. If these talents were pooled, we'd have a good shot at creating a Mena-meets-West hit single.

In terms of the personnel who can achieve such a task, we are spoilt for choice. Two of pop music's most esteemed producers hail from the region. Palestinian-American DJ Khaled (Khaled Mohamed Khaled) has scored chart success for his anthemic brand of hip-hop, his knack for hashtag-friendly choruses and his formidable marketing skills. You also can't ignore RedOne (Nadir Khayat). The Moroccan-Swedish producer is been behind plenty of Lady Gaga's biggest hits, such as Just Dance and Poker Face. The Arab world also has a depth of talent when it comes to successful songwriters. Salem Al Fakir, a Swedish songwriter of Syrian descent, is responsible for huge melodies in the EDM scene, having penned hooks for the likes of Avicii (Brother and You Make Me) as well as Axwell - Ingrosso's More Than You Know. Katy Perry's Cozy Little Christmas, currently No 1 on Billboard's Adult Contemporary Chart, has a regional touch to it, with American-Jordanian songwriter Ferras Alqaisi having co-written the tune.

What's missing and sorely needed, however, are creative exchanges between these international talents and Arab singers in the Mena region. With the exception of RedOne's efforts to work with singers such as Saad Lamjarred and Ahmed Chawki, Arab pop stars are too comfortable working in the Cairo and Beirut bubble, and the end result is predictability. While vocal talent hailing from the region is undeniable - from veteran pop stars Amr Diab and Tamer Hosny to a new generation of singers such as Mohammed Assaf and Nassif Zeytoun - the knowledge to expand Arab pop music's sound is lacking. This is where our brothers in the US and Europe can help.

Such an approach helped dance-hall and reggaeton escape their geographical confines and spread globally. For example, American artists such as Luis Fonsi of Despacito fame, Sean Paul (Temperature) and Enrique Iglesias (Duele El Corazon), reached out to colleagues in South America and Jamaica to create global hits that sound both modern and respectful of their music traditions. It is now time for Arab artists, from all corners of the globe, to band together and show the world what the region has to offer.

Facebook, let's take a look back at the memories you made in 2018: Increased dislikes, a growing number of pledges to leave Facebook, warnings from governments and more! Sometimes looking back helps us remember what matters most, and we hope shielding user privacy tops this list in 2019 for Facebook.

The past year was one of explanations, apologies and regrets for Mark Zuckerberg, chief executive and founder of the greatest social media brand of our time. From answering questions from United States

Congressmen to getting fined and warned for data collection policies by countries across Europe, and finally the allegations of giving Netflix, Spotify and Royal Bank of Canada the liberty to read, write and delete users' private messages, Facebook has had a fairly tough year, and rightfully so.

As it's the time of the year when you plan to leave bygones and make resolutions for a better year, wouldn't it be nice if Facebook took its ethical blindness seriously and found a cure for it? If the privacy and data of users were treated as paramount? If, apart from apologies, the social networking biggie compensated for the stolen or misused users' confidential information?

Apparently, the privacy issues - ranging from digital colonialism to mishandling of free basics - have plagued the image of Facebook for a long time and 2018 was no different, just adding to the pile of accusations and contentions. Almost $69 billion net-worth business is clearly suffering from fundamental ethical conflicts and this is costing more than 2.2 billion Facebook users their personal data - however the profits for the company continue to swell and top the charts.

It is painful, though, that the users, who are the real reason behind all the propelling growth this relatively young company has seen over the years, are apparently not the most cared-for stakeholders for Facebook. Users and their personal private information has been instead used as bait to catch big fish in the market and bring in even bigger revenues.

But if you look at the issue from a technological point of view, it is easier said than done. The concept of complete privacy is a subjective matter but completely in hand of the hosting platform. Plus, the privacy agreement that contains hundreds of clauses and terms, comes to the rescue of companies like Facebook every now and then. The idea of being ethical therefore makes more sense than ever.

We hope 2019 makes for a more trustworthy and digitally secure year for Facebook users. We also hope that Facebook lives by the words it put out in a recent print ad saying, ""We have a responsibility to protect your information. If we can't, we don't deserve it.""

""This package contains the decomposing flesh of a once-live animal that had a face!"" ""Factory farming is destroying the planet!"" ""A mother had to lose its baby just so you can have milk in your tea!"" ""An egg is the product of a hen's menstrual cycle!"" Too far?

It's so easy, once it's all been wiped of the blood and pus, and neatly packaged up, to forget what it is you're eating, particularly when it's well-seasoned. But take a closer look at cow's milk, for example. It's designed to turn a baby cow into a full-grown bovine in a few weeks. And we wonder why many of us are overweight; our hormones are out of control; arteries are being fatally clogged by the millions. (Also, FYI, spinach and chickpeas are far superior sources of calcium than a glass of milk. There's a reason why all vegans love hummus.)

No other animal on the planet drinks the breast milk of another creature. We humans are perfectly willing to - from a cow, goat, sheep, even camel - and yet we find drinking our own breast milk disgusting. How does that make any sense? Do I sound too extreme? Surely what's extreme is the mass slaughter of billions of animals every year, when 821 million people - one in nine - go hungry every day, according to the World Food Programme. And one in three suffer from some form of malnutrition. Even more incredible when you consider an estimated 80 per cent of all agricultural land is dedicated to the production of feed. So we're taking up all that land, and using all that money, to feed our foodstuffs food we could have just eaten in the first place. That's mad, right?

On the flip side, here are a few labels I'd like to see printed on plant-based food: ""Contains protein!"" ""Will not cause malnutrition!"" ""Has plenty of flavour!"" ""Eating this will not turn you into a hippy know-it-all!"" What would be really great is if the tide of information flipped the tables on society's stance, and omnivores become the ""strange"", ""extreme"" ones in 2019. Oh, and the vegan options begin to far exceed the meat- and dairy-laden dishes on restaurants' menus.

It can often feel as if online discourse is becoming more toxic with every passing day. In some ways this isn't surprising - we're never far from a potential geopolitical crisis. But it's not as if we need the provocation of a sabre-rattling speech to start arguing on Facebook, Twitter or any number of online forums. The origin of hummus, the correct spelling of yoghurt and the PC vs Macintosh debate are just three countless quarrels that continue to provoke accusation and recrimination, threat and counter-threat. And we are so easily dragged into these exchanges, forgetting that they merely entrench the opinions of everyone involved and solve nothing.

In the real world, acts of kindness reassure us of our humanity constantly and remind us that people can be polite and courteous. But in front of a laptop, tablet or phone, for some reason, we become marked­ly less civil. It wasn't meant to be like this, of course. Tim Berners-Lee, the inventor of the world wide web, saw his creation as a utopian tool that would lead to ""more understanding"", and social media companies have always made well-meaning promises to bring the citizens of the world together in a happy congregation. But the internet has problems that simply aren't con­ducive to good manners. Anonymity allows us to be as unpleasant as we want, without fear of repercussions. Policing of bad behaviour is notoriously lenient. The emotional rush of an untrammelled argument has an addictive quality. And so the worst parts of our nature run rampant, while empathy becomes suppressed.

It feels a bit futile to wish for a new atmosphere of tolerance in 2019, but it's possible for each of us to do our bit. We can imagine our sparring partners as real people, with feelings. We could think twice before unleashing our anger, taking a moment to consider other viewpoints and the things we might share, which in turn will naturally lead to empathy. These simple acts evidently won't make the problems of the internet evaporate, but on a personal level they may at least bring us some respite, a drop in blood pressure and a slightly calmer day.

Much ink has been spilled over worst-case scenarios in the United States-China trade war. The catastrophising has not only heated up reporters' keyboards, but also contributed to a historically bad global market rout, sent major American retailers on a Chinese spending spree on everything from microwaves to bikinis ahead of tariffs on January 1, and triggered the International Monetary Fund to reduce the economic growth outlook globally in 2019. But what if the world's two biggest economies made peace? Once you clear the haunting image of Presidents Xi Jinping and Donald Trump singing Kumbaya around a campfire from your mind, here's how it might actually look:

1. Calmed automakers. Trump has imposed a 25 per cent tariff on vehicles imported from China, and China hit the US with 40 per cent tariffs on cars imported from the US, prompting higher sticker prices on Teslas and Priuses, while throwing a wrench into US-to-China productions of Mercedes and BMW. Exacerbating this dynamic, last May Trump levied large tariffs on aluminium and steel imports (the stuff cars are made of) from its trade allies the EU, Mexico and Canada - with steel imports from those places taxed at 25 per cent and aluminium imports at 10 per cent; up from under three per cent previously. Taken together, automakers have vocalised these tariffs are not good for business. Ford chief executive James Hackett said in September that tariffs cost the company about $1 billion (Dh3.67bn) in profit. GM warned in June that they could lead to a ""reduced presence"" in the US and abroad. It delivered on this warning earlier this month by closing factories in the US and cutting nearly 15,000 jobs. A Xi-Trump peace agreement would go a long way in settling this most unsettled industry.

2. Cooled commodities. There is no better measuring stick for the US-China trade war than the American soybean. China, the world's top buyer, typically purchases most of its oilseed imports from the US in the last quarter of the year as farmers harvest their crops and go to market. The US was the second-largest supplier of soybeans to China and the trade was worth $12bn in 2017, according to Reuters. In November of this year, that figure was $0. In response, the US Department of Agriculture has pledged $12bn in aid to US farmers. With the Federal government shut down over a $5bn line item (the wall at the border with Mexico) it is easy to see how that capital could be used elsewhere - if not to build a wall then to invest in something other than propping up hard-working farmers with no buyer for their crop.

3. Composed equities. Global markets have been in a nosedive over fears of slowed growth next year, spurred by trade tensions. Higher tariffs mean less money in company coffers to invest in fun pursuits such as research, innovation and glossy new advertising campaigns - activities that cost a lot in the short-term but can pay dividends when they drum up things like life-saving drugs, trendy technology and / or greater product demand. All of that gets put on hold when companies are quaking in their boots.

I know, this is a hyper-simplification of one of the worst economic stand-offs in recent memory. But wouldn't it be nice if the trade war ended?

When Norwegian striker Ada Hegerberg won the inaugural women's Ballon d'Or honouring her as the best female footballer, her accomplishment was overshadowed by the fact one of the presenters asked her to twerk after accepting the award. News spread rather quickly about the incident - instead of a story about her triumph, the moment became focused on her embarrassment. And it's undeniable, no one would ask this of Lionel Messi or Cristiano Ronaldo.

Female athletes have long had to struggle to even get close to being treated with the reverence afford­ed to their male peers. In a world where women are still battling for equality, I would like to see the sports world take a stance. Serena Williams is a prime example: as one of the greatest tennis players of all-time, whose matches have helped elevate the sport, she still has to struggle. Earlier this year, the French Open banned her customised catsuit (which she says helps with her blood clots after a difficult pregnancy) from competition when a new dress code was announced, stating that players ""must respect the game and the place.""

But, in terms of respect, what about respecting a woman's right to wear what she wants and what she's comfortable with while competing? What kind of message does this send to young girls when suddenly they hear their favourite athlete isn't allowed to wear something as if she's actually done something wrong? She must wear a skirt instead? No one ever questions whether LeBron James' basketball shorts show too much leg or whether Tom Brady's football pants are too tight.

Also, when a female tennis player speaks up or gets emotional during a match, she's viewed as being difficult but when a male player does the same (i.e John McEnroe), he's lauded for his pas­sion towards the game. For young girls around the world, these things matter. I'll always remember watching US gymnast Shannon Miller compete at the 1992 Barcelona Olympics, and knowing I wanted to do the same. Spending my childhood immersed in a sport taught me discipline, and it helped me embrace an active and healthy lifestyle early on.

I wish I had continued with it but, like many women, I stopped when other responsibilities arose and it became clear to me that women in sport have fewer pathways. I hope that female athletes are one day viewed with the same respect as their male counterparts, because I can only imagine what the world would be like if women were given the impression, and reality, that they too could excel in anything they wanted."
228,albuquerque journal,https://www.abqjournal.com/1267033/shutdown-suspends-federal-cleanups-at-us-superfund-sites.html,"BIRMINGHAM, Ala. -- The government shutdown has suspended federal cleanups at Superfund sites around the nation and forced the cancellation of public hearings, deepening the mistrust and resentment of surrounding residents who feel people in power long ago abandoned them to live among the toxic residue of the country's factories and mines.

""We are already hurting, and it's just adding more fuel to the fire,"" says 40-year-old Keisha Brown, whose wood-frame home is in a community nestled among coking plants and other factories on Birmingham's north side.

The mostly African-American community has been forced to cope with high levels of arsenic, lead and other contaminants in the soil that the Environmental Protection Agency has been scraping up and carting away, house by house.

As President Donald Trump and Congress battle over Trump's demand for a wall on the southern U.S. border, the nearly 3-week-old partial government shutdown has stopped federal work on Superfund sites except for cases where the administration deems ""there is an imminent threat to the safety of human life or to the protection of property.""

EPA's shutdown plans said the agency would evaluate about 800 Superfund sites to see how many could pose an immediate threat. As an example of that kind of threat, it cited an acid leak from a mine that could threaten the public water supply. That's the hazard at Northern California's Iron Mountain mine, where EPA workers help prevent an unending flow of lethally acidic runoff off the Superfund site from spilling into rivers downstream.

Practically speaking, said Bonnie Bellow, a former EPA official who worked on Superfund public outreach at the agency, the impact of the stoppage of work at sites across the nation ""wholly depends"" on the length of the shutdown.

""Unless there is immediate risk like a storm, a flood, a week or two of slowdowns is not going to very likely affect the cleanup at the site,"" Bellow said.

In north Birmingham, Brown said it's been a couple of weeks since she's spotted any EPA crews at people's houses. It wasn't clear if state workers or contractors were continuing work.

But long before the shutdown began, Brown harbored doubts the cleanup was working anyway. ""My main concern is the health of the people out here,"" said Brown, who has asthma. ""All of us are sick, and we've got to function on medicine every day.""

In terms of time, the federal government shutdown is a chronological blip in the long history of the site -- which includes ethics charges in a local bribery scandal to block federal cleanup efforts -- but adds to the uncertainty in an area where residents feel forgotten and betrayed.

At the EPA, the shutdown has furloughed the bulk of the agency's roughly 14,000 employees. It also means the EPA isn't getting most of the daily stream of environmental questions and tips from the public. Routine inspections aren't happening. State, local and private emails to EPA officials often get automated messages back promising a response when the shutdown ends.

In Montana, for instance, state officials this month found themselves fielding calls from a tribal member worried about drinking water with a funny look to it, said Kristi Ponozzo, public-policy director at that state's Department of Environmental Quality. The EPA normally provides tribes with technical assistance on water supplies.

With most EPA colleagues idled, Ponozzo said, her agency also had to call off an environmental review meeting for a mining project, potentially delaying the project.

But it's the agency's work at Superfund sites -- lessening the threat from old nuclear-weapons plants, chemical factories, mines and other entities -- that gets much of the attention.

Absent imminent peril, it would be up to state governments or contractors to continue any cleanup during the shutdown ""up to the point that additional EPA direction or funding is needed,"" the EPA said in a statement.

""Sites where cleanup activities have been stopped or shut down will be secured until cleanup activities are able to commence when the federal government reopens,"" the agency said.

For federal Superfund sites in Michigan, the shutdown means there are no EPA colleagues to consult, said Scott Dean, a spokesman for that state's Department of Environmental Quality.

At Michigan Superfund sites, day-to-day field operations were continuing since private contractors do most of the on-the-ground work, Dean said.

Bellow, the former EPA official, said the cancellation of hearings about Superfund sites posed immediate concerns.

In East Chicago, Indiana, for example, the EPA called off a planned public hearing set for last Wednesday to outline how the agency planned to clean up high levels of lead and arsenic in the soil.

The EPA has proposed a seven-month, $26.5 million cleanup that includes treating and removing tainted soil from the area, where a lead smelter previously was located.

During a public meeting Nov. 29, some residents complained that the EPA's approach would leave too much pollution in place. But others didn't get a chance to speak and were hoping to do so at the meeting this week, said Debbie Chizewer, a Northwestern University environmental attorney who represents community groups in the low-income area.

The EPA announced the cancellation in an online notice and gave no indication that it would be rescheduled.

Leaders of the East Chicago Calumet Community Advisory Group asked for a new hearing date and an extension of a Jan. 14 public comment deadline in a letter to the EPA's regional Superfund division.

Calls by The Associated Press to the agency's regional office in Chicago this week were not answered.

Local critics fear the EPA will use the delay caused by the shutdown as justification for pushing ahead with a cleanup strategy they consider flawed, Chizewer said, even though the agency has designated the affected area as an ""environmental justice community"" -- a low-income community of color that has been disproportionately harmed by pollution.

The EPA has a ""special obligation"" when dealing with such communities, Chizewer said. ""This would be an example of shutting them out for no good reason.""

In North Birmingham, former longtime neighborhood resident Charlie Powell said most of the people living in and around the Superfund site had already ""just got tired and fed up.""

Powell left the area but started a group called PANIC, People Against Neighborhood Industrial Contamination. He believes money would be better spent helping residents move away from the pollution.

""Can I say hell?"" Powell said when asked what residents have been through.

A crowdfunding campaign to pay for a proposed border wall between the U.S. and Mexico is raking in millions of dollars by the day, but can the government actually use the money?

""We The People Will Fund The Wall"" is the name of a GoFundMe page dedicated to raising cash to construct President Donald Trump's wall on the U.S. southern border. The crowdfunding effort witnessed remarkable attention since Brian Kolfage, a triple-amputee Iraq veteran, launched the page Sunday. As of publication of this article, the GoFundMe campaign raised almost $13 million from more than 210,000 people.

""This is the United States and we can do anything we want,"" Kolfage said Thursday night on Fox News. ""If people want to donate to that wall and give their money, they can do it.""

The Purple Heart veteran said he's received support and donations from Republicans and Democrats alike.

The campaign hasn't only attracted small-dollar donations. A few people dropped considerable amounts of cash, with several donations totaling $10,000 or more, and the highest single contribution being $50,000.

However, there are mounting questions over whether the GoFundMe cash can actually go toward construction of a border wall. Kolfage assured donors that 100 percent the money will be used for the wall's construction. If not, he says every single penny will be reimbursed.

""We have contacted the Trump Administration to secure a point of contact where all the funds will go upon completion. When we get this information secured we will update,"" Kolfage wrote in the description page, adding that his group will cover ""all legal aspects"" before releasing any of the money.

The ""legal aspects"" remain unclear. Private citizens are allowed to raise money for the federal government, but they cannot specifically direct the government how to spend those funds.

A citizen can make a general donation to the U.S. government that is placed into a ""Gifts to the United Sate"" fund and be used for ""general use,"" according to the Treasury Department. Approval from Congress would be needed before the GoFundMe cash could be directed to the Department of Homeland Security.

Kolfage said his group is working with a law firm on several possible options to ensure sure the funds go toward the wall. Republican Mississippi Rep. Steve Palazzo, for example, introduced legislation that would allow for private funding of the border wall. The Border Bonds for America Act of 2018 would let citizens purchase revenue bonds to finance the wall's construction.

""In November of 2016, Americans voted for better border security and as Vice-Chairman of the Homeland Security Appropriations Subcommittee, I believe this legislation allows new alternatives for our citizens to support their values and defend our homeland,"" Palazzo said in a Monday press release.

GoFundMe rules stipulate that money raised must go toward the advertised caused. If not, all funds must be given back to donors -- a rule Kolfage pledged to follow.

Meanwhile, Trump and congressional Democrats appear to be headed for a government shutdown over the border wall funding fight. The president indicated he is prepared for a drawn-out battle to secure funding, and doesn't mind if a shutdown occurs.

""We are totally prepared for a very long shut down. This is our only chance that we will ever have in our opinion,"" he said at a bill-signing ceremony Friday."
230,bizpac review,https://www.bizpacreview.com/2018/12/28/build-the-wall-libs-rage-when-trump-calls-out-manhunt-for-illegal-immigrant-suspected-of-killing-legal-immigrant-cop-707404,"Facts matter, and according to the facts, on the day after Christmas a criminal alien thug killed a 33-year-old upstanding California police officer and legal immigrant named Ronil Singh.

""Ronil Singh came to the U.S. from his native Fiji to fulfill a lifelong dream of becoming an officer, joining a small-town police force in California and working to improve his English,"" the Associated Press reported Thursday. ""The day after Christmas, he stopped another immigrant, this one in the country illegally, who shot and killed the corporal, authorities said Thursday.""

According to the AP, Newman Police Chief Randy Richardson held back tears as he described Singh -- who had a wife and baby son who'll never see him again -- as an ""American patriot"" who ""came to America with one purpose, and that was to serve this country.""

It was a purpose he served beautifully up until he was murdered by one of the millions of criminal aliens who've managed to sidle across the border with ease thanks to the Democrats' incessant refusal to allow President Donald Trump to secure America's borders.

The suspect is still on the run, as the manhunt continues:

The president responded by demanding Democrats secure the border and highlighted the manhunt for the suspected murderer:

Last week House Republicans passed a spending bill that included funding for the wall. Because of Democrat obstruction in the Senate by Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, the bill remains stalled. The government entered into a partial shutdown last Saturday morning as a result.

According to the president, Singh's tragic murder has made it abundantly clear why congressional Democrats need to stop obstructing and allow the bill to be passed.

Those who suffer from Trump Derangement Syndrome disagree, of course. Look below to see the unhinged replies they posted to the president's otherwise sensible tweets:

The oft-repeated mantra that ""a wall is stupid and won't work"" is patently false, as noted by former U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement Director Thomas Homan.

""Every place we've built a wall -- San Diego, Yuma, El Paso -- the results have been a decrease in illegal immigration, a decrease in drug supply,"" he said Wednesday on Fox News.

HERE'S WHAT YOU'RE MISSING ...

""The data is there. I keep hearing Democrats say, 'The wall doesn't work.' Then you're ignoring the data. Every place that it's been put up, it's worked 100 percent of the time. So if it works, what price are you willing to put on our national security and public safety?""

Listen:

This isn't coming from some random person. It's coming from a man who served as ICE's executive associate director of enforcement and removal operations from 2013 to 2017 and was awarded a Presidential Rank Award as a Distinguished Executive in 2015. He later served as the director ICE.

These are the facts. But do they matter to the left? Apparently not ...

Leftists keep comparing the murder rate among citizens to the murder rate among illegals as proof of something. But it proves nothing. Citizens outnumber illegals by a landslide, so of course they commit more crimes. More importantly, every molestation, rape or murder committed by an illegal is a crime that could have been prevented had the border been secured. Facts."

Funding for nine federal departments and multiple agencies are slated to expire at midnight Friday, and without a political breakthrough, more than 420,000 employees will work without pay and another 380,000 will be furloughed, according to the New York Times.

Even a partial shutdown of select departments will prove problematic, experts say.

Why? A budget agreement featuring an increase in military spending, disaster relief funds and an extension to CHIP was denounced by many, including House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Sen. Rand Paul for not addressing immigration and protecting DACA's recipients (or ""Dreamers"").

Then what? Congress agreed to the $400 billion deal, which Trump signed.

Why? A Senate immigration bill under Trump failed to pass. Democrats wanted the bill to address the funding of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, but Republicans said the deadline wasn't until mid-March.

Then what? Democrats reached a compromise to continue negotiations until Feb. 8. ""If an agreement isn't reached by February 8, the Senate will immediately proceed to consideration of legislation dealing with DACA,"" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer previously said.

"" RELATED: The Latest: Digging in, Trump warns of 'very long shutdown'

Why? Ted Cruz and House conservatives insisted on delaying Obamacare, which President Barack Obama rejected. The House passed multiple versions; the Senate kept sending them back.

Then what? Minor changes were made to Obamacare, including income verification requirements, before Obama signed the spending bill. Congress voted to extend the debt limit as well.

Why? The longest shutdown in U.S. history deals with that provision to balance the budget within seven years. Republicans wanted Clinton to use the Congressional Budget Office's economic forecasts, not the more optimistic Office of Management and Budget forecasts.

Then what? Nothing, really. Republicans gave in and Clinton submitted a plan with CBO forecasts ensuring a balanced budget within seven years.

Why? Former President Bill Clinton vetoed Congress' resolution packed with provisions he opposed, including increased Medicare premiums.

Then what? As negotiations continued, Congress agreed to fund the government at 75 percent levels for about a month. And despite his initial opposition, Clinton agreed to a provision to balance the budget within seven years.

Why? Former President George W. Bush vetoed a spending bill without a deficit reduction plan, which he demanded. The House was unable to override the veto.

Then what? Congress came up with a joint resolution with a deficit reduction plan. Bush signed it.

Why? Democrats wanted more funding for Nicaragua's Contras and wanted to reinstate the ""Fairness Doctrine"" requiring balanced political coverage by broadcasters.

Then what? The Contras received nonlethal aid, but the Democrats gave up on reinstating the ""Fairness Doctrine.""

Why? Lots of disagreements between Democrats and Reagan's White House, including a Democrat measure to expand Aid to Families with Dependent Children (welfare). Time ran out before all parties could come to a resolution.

Then what? Democrats dropped some demands but secured welfare expansion and concession regarding privatization of the public railway, Conrail.

Why? The three-day extension (see below) came and went.

Then what? Congress let go of both the civil rights issue and water projects package and passed Reagan's desired crime-fighting measure. Unrelated to the previous shutdown disputes, temporary funding was also decided for Nicaragua's anti-communist Contra guerrillas.

Why? A spending bill that passed in the House included a crime package Reagan wanted, but it also included a water projects package he opposed. In addition, Democrats sought a reversal of the Title IX Civil Rights Act Grove City College v. Bell Supreme Court decision, which allowed exemptions for colleges that didn't get federal funding but whose students did. Reagan opposed this as well.

Then what? A deal wasn't reached in time, so the negotiations continued with a signed spending extension.

Why? Reagan's disputes over foreign aid spending cuts and increases, plus the Democrats' $1 billion education spending bill, led to a short shutdown.

Then what? House Democrats cut the spending down to roughly $100 million and funded the MX missile Reagan wanted, but maintained their proposed foreign aid and defense cuts. They also got a ban on wildlife refuge for oil and gas. The new bill also banned federal employee health insurance coverage to fund abortions unless the mother's life was in danger.

Why? Two main reasons. Reagan wouldn't sign two proposed spending bills to create jobs. And the House refused to fund Reagan's Cold War MX missile program against the Soviet Union.

Then what? None of the aforementioned issues were funded. The House proposed funding for legal support for poor Americans and increased funding for Israel, which Reagan signed into law after criticizing both strategies.

Why? Congress didn't pass new spending in time because leaders were, well, busy. ""President Reagan invited all members of Congress to a barbecue at the White House, while Democrats were having a $1,000-a-plate fund-raising dinner,"" the New York Times reported in 1982.

Then what? Nothing. Spending bills were signed a little later.

Why? Former President Ronald Reagan vetoed a package of domestic budget cut legislation $2 billion short of how much he sought.

Then what? A temporary bill extended spending through Dec. 15 to allow time for a long-term resolution.

Why? The House wanted to limit federal abortion spending to the stricter restrictions (mother's life in danger) but the Senate wanted to keep funding abortions in cases of rape, incest and heightened mother's health risk. The House also wanted to raise congressional and senior civil servant pay by 5.5 percent, which the Senate opposed.

Then what? The compromise previously set on Medicaid and abortion was tightened to allow funding in cases of rape, incest, but not when the mother's health was in danger. Funding was allowed, however, if her life was in danger. The House also received its 5.5 percent pay increases.

Why? Carter vetoed a defense bill Congress passed, which included funding for a nuclear-powered aircraft carrier. He also vetoed a public works bill. Both, he believed, were wasteful projects. The abortion dispute also added to the funding gap.

Then what? In the end, the previously vetoed bills were adjusted to exclude the projects Carter opposed and the previous compromise on abortion remained.

Why? The second measure to allow more time for negotiations on the abortion issue failed. The Senate proposed Medicaid dollars be used for abortions by victims of statutory rape, which the House rejected.

Then what? They eventually brokered a deal to allow Medicaid to also pay for abortions resulting from rape or incest or abortions necessary to protect the mother and her health.

Why? Unfortunately, the abortion dispute continued despite the temporary measure for resolution.

Then what? Carter signed another bill to give Congress more time.

Why? The Senate under former President Jimmy Carter sought looser restrictions on Medicaid use to cover abortions, specifically for funding in cases of rape, incest or when the mother's health was at risk, before the Sept. 30 deadline. But the House wanted to maintain the restrictions of the time, which only allowed Medicaid dollars to cover abortions if the mother's life was at risk.

Then what? The funding gap ended Oct. 31, and negotiators were given more time to come to a resolution through a temporary measure ending the shutdown.

Why? Former President Gerald Ford vetoed a funding bill for the Departments of Labor and Health, Education, and Welfare (or HEW, now split into the Departments of Education and of Health and Human Services).

Then what? Congress overrode the veto, but it wasn't until Oct. 11 that its continuing resolution to end the funding gap for other parts of the government went into effect."
232,the national,https://www.thenational.ae/world/the-americas/americans-for-and-against-donald-trump-s-wall-turn-to-crowdfunding-1.805157,"A battle of the crowdfund has broken out online between those for and against Donald Trump's planned wall along the Mexico border.

One campaign aims to make up the shortfall in funding for Mr Trump's border wall, the other fundraises for 'ladders' to help people over it.

They have one thing in common, the leaders of both campaigns are former armed forces personnel.

Brian Kolfage, an air force veteran, set up his fundraiser We The People Will Fund The Wall five days ago, with a target of raising £1bn.

As Trump threatened a government shutdown over payment for his campaign promise on Friday, the crowdfunder, which aims to help fund the 2000-mile-long wall, reached $13m (Dh48m).

As his campaign went viral, US news outlets revealed Mr Kolfage had run a Facebook group called Right Wing News, which has been banned by the social media platform and has set up a number of conspiracy-theory websites.

Responding to questions about how the US government would accept such a payment, Mr Kolfage wrote on the crowdfunding page:

""We have contacted the Trump Administration to secure a point of contact where all the funds will go upon completion. When we get this information secured we will update. We have many very high level contacts already helping.""

The alternate crowdfunder was set up in in response to the fund in favour of a border wall. Although titled Ladders to Get Over Trump's Wall, it is not for ladders to help migrants over the proposed wall. Rather, the beneficiaries will be Texas-based Refugee and Immigrant Centre for Education and Legal Services.

""We saw some folks are raising money for a border wall to keep out our migrant siblings and fellow human beings, who are fleeing violence and persecution and whose tragically-underpaid labor is essential to the US economy,"" wrote Charlotte Clymer, an army veteran on the fundraising page.

""Seems like a bad idea on countless levels for everyone involved. Maybe we should focus on human rights and creating a community that reflects our supposed values.""

Her crowdfunder, set up on Wednesday had raised over $100,000 by Friday evening.

During the 2016 election campaign, Mr Trump claimed Mexico would pay for the wall, but is currently asking the US Congress for $5bn towards its construction.

This week, Mr Trump said the wall would be ""artistically designed steel slats, so you can easily see through it...."""
233,albuquerque journal,https://www.abqjournal.com/1265064/pence-white-house-officials-meet-with-congressional-aides-in-effort-to-end-shutdown.html,"WASHINGTON - The government shutdown that has halted paychecks for hundreds of thousands of federal workers began its third week Saturday with no end in sight, as Vice President Mike Pence, top White House officials and senior congressional aides met for more than two hours without reaching a deal to reopen the government.

Inside the meeting at the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, Pence refused to budge from the more than $5 billion President Donald Trump has demanded from Congress to pay for a portion of his promised wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, according to two Democratic officials briefed on the negotiations.

The standoff - which has heavily affected national parks and other operations and threatens to halt payments as varied as food stamps and tax refunds - has made Trump's unrealized border wall the linchpin of his presidency as he seeks to make good on a signature campaign promise.

Administration officials have acknowledged that they were not prepared for the potential consequences of an extended shutdown and Trump's decision to demand wall funding. Democrats, meanwhile, are standing firm on offering no taxpayer money for the project, which Trump had long asserted would be funded by Mexico.

Pence was deputized by Trump to oversee Saturday's talks, but he did not have the president's blessing to float new or specific numbers as he did last month in a meeting with Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., according to two Trump aides who were not authorized to speak publicly. That meant few specifics were actually discussed Saturday, as Democratic staffers repeatedly pushed the administration to reopen the federal government and negotiate differences over the border after the shutdown ends.

But the administration - represented by Pence, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and senior adviser Jared Kushner - refused, according to multiple officials.

""Not much headway made today,"" Trump tweeted Saturday afternoon. ""Second meeting set for tomorrow. After so many decades, must finally and permanently fix the problems on the Southern Border!""

Before the meeting began Saturday morning, Trump took a combative tone in several Twitter messages and claimed that news coverage documenting cracks in Republican support for his hard-line position were inaccurate.

""Great support coming from all sides for Border Security (including Wall) on our very dangerous Southern Border,"" Trump tweeted. ""Teams negotiating this weekend! Washington Post and NBC reporting of events, including Fake sources, has been very inaccurate (to put it mildly)!""

A number of Republicans, including Sen. Cory Gardner, R-Colo., who is up for reelection in 2020, have said in recent days that the government should be reopened and that a shutdown is not the ""right answer,"" worrying GOP leaders about the depth of support for Trump's position.

Trump spent much of Saturday on the phone with allies, talking through his positioning on the shutdown and hearing their reviews of his Friday news conference in the Rose Garden, according to a person close to him. Two people regularly on his call list - Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., and Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. - have encouraged Trump to hold fast and refuse to agree to reopen the government unless wall funding is secured, the person said.

""I've never seen the president as resolved on any issue as he is on this,"" Meadows said Saturday. ""But he is open to new ideas about how to end the impasse.""

Trump told reporters Friday that he wants to reopen government but is prepared to maintain the shutdown for weeks or even years. He also told congressional leaders at the White House on Friday that he preferred the term ""strike"" over ""shutdown,"" people briefed on the meeting said.

In conversations with top aides on Friday and Saturday, House Democratic leaders said Trump and GOP leaders seem eager to be seen as making progress even if the talks remained stalled, allowing Republican lawmakers back home over the weekend to reassure nervous constituents, according to two Democratic officials briefed on those discussions who were not authorized to speak publicly.

""There is the reality of what the White House is doing, which is very little, and the image they're trying to send, which is, 'Look at us, we're busy, and the vice president is rolling up his sleeves,' "" one Democratic official said. ""They're worried about defections.""

During Saturday's meeting, Democratic staffers asked the White House to lay out in formal detail the administration's funding request for the border - including its specific security requests, what the money would be used for, and what in the Homeland Security budget the administration would cut to make the numbers work, people familiar with the meeting said.

Democrats ""emphasized that it's important for us to have an updated budget request from the White House because they have been all over the map,"" said another official briefed on the discussion. The White House plans to provide those figures before the group meets again Sunday afternoon.

Some centrist Republicans on Saturday urged Trump and congressional leaders to reopen the government, reflecting growing unease in their ranks about the prolonged shutdown and the political cost the GOP might pay.

""With Nancy Pelosi as speaker, it's going to have to be a compromise solution,"" Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick, R-Pa., a moderate and former FBI agent who represents the Philadelphia suburbs, said in an interview. ""It's our most basic function as members of Congress to fund the government, and we need to have these battles on immigration and other issues on their own turf, separately.""

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said in a statement Saturday that the House will begin passing separate bills to reopen the government next week, starting with the funding bill that covers the Treasury Department ""so that the American people can receive their tax refunds on schedule.""

""The senseless uncertainty and chaos of the Trump Shutdown must end, now,"" Pelosi said.

Mulvaney said in an interview to air Sunday on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" that Trump would ""take a concrete wall off the table"" in negotiations with Democratic leaders if that would help end the shutdown.

""If he has to give up a concrete wall, replace it with a steel fence to do that so that Democrats can say, 'See? He's not building a wall anymore,' that should help us move in the right direction.' "" Mulvaney said.

But Trump is annoyed by news reports about the negotiations that make it seem that he is backing away from his demands and wants to avoid stories about new numbers for wall funding being discussed, Trump aides said. The president instead encouraged Pence and senior aides to focus on the $5.6 billion for border security that was the focal point of legislation passed last month by House Republicans, the aides said.

Trump exasperated members of both parties with his comments Friday, but Trump spent that evening boasting to friends that he was in a strong negotiating position because he was able to capture attention and make a flurry of points that he feels his core voters appreciate, White House officials said.

On Saturday evening, Trump tweeted that he would travel to Camp David on Sunday for ""meetings on Border Security and other topics"" with aides attending a White House staff retreat. He then followed up with a tweet of his ""Game of Thrones""-style poster saying, ""The Wall is Coming.""

Mulvaney is spearheading the gathering as a way of connecting with his new deputies and colleagues, according to officials.

The president is asking advisers about further ways to battle for wall funding in the coming days, whether it is meeting with family members of people killed by undocumented immigrants, huddling with sheriffs or visiting the border, the officials said.

As Saturday's meeting unfolded, Trump was eyeing his own options for trying to force the Democrats' hand, including declaring a national emergency to begin wall construction without congressional approval, a possible course he mentioned at his Friday news conference.

According to two confidants of Trump's, who have spoken to him in recent days but were not authorized to speak publicly, Trump is looking at how such a move would play out and has told his aides that such a drastic turn could rattle the Democrats and compel them to offer him wall funding. The legality of such a move is unclear, however, and Trump would almost certainly face immediate legal challenges in the courts.

Still, there are signs within the White House that more-comprehensive deals are at least being discussed, more likely for after the shutdown concludes and the government reopens.

Kushner, the president's son-in-law, continues to tell his allies that he thinks there could eventually be a deal for border wall funding in exchange for immigration protections for undocumented immigrants who were brought to the United States as children, according to two people who were briefed on those discussions. Another person familiar with the discussions emphasized, however, that Kushner was not pushing for a deal on Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, at this time.

Chatter about an agreement involving protections for young immigrant beneficiaries of the DACA program have risen a bit in recent days, although the administration has rejected previous wall-for-DACA deals and Democratic leadership is in no mood for one now.

After his work on a bipartisan criminal justice reform bill, Kushner is as engaged as ever with Capitol Hill, the people said. Still, Kushner's interest in brokering a possible deal on immigration has caused some anxiety among conservatives close to Trump, several of whom said Saturday they feared the president could eventually be intrigued by Kushner's position as the shutdown drags on and Trump searches for a way out."
234,vice,https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/qvqa7v/trumps-wall-is-now-a-fence-or-maybe-nothing-at-all,"Decoding the past few days of confusing presidential statements.

On Thursday morning, hours after the Senate defied Donald Trump by passing a funding bill that didn't include the president's desired $5 billion for a wall along the southern border, he was online and ranting. Well, he's always online and ranting, but this time his rants were even more inscrutable than usual. Here are the tweets in question, a mere 11 minutes apart:

The second tweet is unusually on point for Trump. The ""caravan"" of migrants that he and his Republican allies spent the midterm season ginning up fear about was in fact effectively stopped from crossing the border -- by force. Zooming out, there's evidence that illegal border crossings have significantly decreased since the early 2000s. ""Border"" is in fact ""tight.""

While Trump is undercutting his own case for the wall by acknowledging these realities, he's also changing what he means by ""wall"" in the first tweet. The steel slats he's talking about sound a lot like the fencing approved during the George W. Bush administration, but Trump has previously said that the wall isn't the same thing as a fence. Of course, he hasn't been consistent in what the word ""wall"" might mean, and many of his Republican supporters may think he's just talking about enhanced border security.

But if what Trump really means is just better border security, why has he made so much of a stink about a literal wall, repeatedly threatening to shut down the government over funding it? Does he actually secretly agree with Democrats who say that they want to make the border secure, but that that doesn't mean -- much less require -- a wall?

What's becoming clear is that Trump never really had any concrete idea himself about what a wall would look like, let alone how Mexico would pay for it -- another campaign promise that has now morphed confusingly into Mexico is paying for the wall via a new North American trade deal. The wall is, and has always been, a rhetorical device that allows Trump to claim his opponents care less about border security than he does.

If Democrats suddenly turned around and said OK to a wall, Trump would insist that their wall was insufficient, because what he really wants is a way to call them weak -- in this case, on immigration, in other cases, on terrorism. In fact, Democratic leaders reportedly did offer to fund Trump's wall early this year in exchange for protections for some undocumented immigrants, and the White House turned them down. (Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer then took that offer off the table.)

Of course, now that Trump is president, he has to claim that he in fact secured the previously lawless border or else admit failure. So the border is at once safe and dangerously porous without a wall, which could also be a fence, or not even a physical object. The wall has been inside Trump's mind all along. That's where it will stay."
235,crain's new york business,https://www.crainsnewyork.com/health-pulse/cuomos-600m-opioid-fund-scrapped-federal-judge,"A federal judge on Wednesday struck down a New York state law intended to raise $600 million from opioid manufacturers and distributors to pay for treatment and enforcement.

The Opioid Stewardship Act, which took effect July 1, created a fund to support treatment for people dependent on opioids and to prevent new cases of addiction. That same month, the Healthcare Distribution Alliance, representing drug distributors, sued the state on the grounds that the law was unconstitutional.

In September the Association for Accessible Medicines -- a coalition of makers of generic drugs -- and Dublin-based Mallinckrodt subsidiary SpecGx also filed lawsuits, seeking an injunction on the provision barring drugmakers and distributors from passing on costs to purchasers.

U.S. District Judge Katherine Polk Failla ruled in favor of the pharmaceutical industry.

""While the animating concerns of the OSA are plainly valid,"" Polk Failla said, ""the method by which the act extracts payments from opioid manufactures [sic] and distributors to redress those concerns violates the Dormant Commerce Clause of the United States Constitution.""

The judge continued, ""The OSA is not a tax but is rather a regulatory penalty on opioid manufacturers and distributors. And as currently structured, it improperly burdens interstate commerce.""

The ruling, which is likely to be appealed, deals a blow to Cuomo's efforts to force Big Pharma to cough up hundreds of millions of dollars for programming to reduce the number of overdose deaths from prescription painkillers.

""The Department of Health is reviewing this decision and considering all our options. New York State continues to take all steps necessary to fight the opioid epidemic,"" a spokeswoman for the department said.

""The opioid crisis was manufactured, literally and figuratively. Unscrupulous distributors developed a $400 billion industry selling opioids, and they were conveniently blind to the consequences of their actions,"" Cuomo said in his State of the State speech in January. ""We will make them pay for their illegal and reprehensible conduct.""

New York State Attorney General Barbara Underwood filed a lawsuit against Purdue Pharma, maker of OxyContin, in August, alleging the company understated the risks of addiction and overstated the benefits of its painkillers as part of its sales strategy.

The stewardship funds were to be raised over six years by a tax on the amount of ""morphine milligram equivalents"" that a company sold or distributed in New York annually.

SpecGx, one of the plaintiffs, said its required payment on some of the generic opioids it sells would exceed the average manufacturer price it charges. It is responsible for a nearly $1.3 million payment to the state for 2018.

""What seems to have tripped [the state] up was the Cuomo administration and the Legislature's insistence that this tax not be passed down to the end consumer,"" said Bill Hammond, director of health policy at the Empire Center, an Albany think tank. ""That flies in the face of how economics works.""

Polk Failla said New York's goals in creating the law were ""commendable"" but that it used ""unconstitutional means"" to raise the money.

""New York's interest in the public health of its residents cannot trump the Commerce Clause,"" she wrote. ""Additionally, the perhaps-unforeseen consequence that the OSA could well reduce the availability of opioid medications for those who need them also runs counter to the public interest."" -- Jonathan LaMantia

Barbot named health commissioner

Dr. Oxiris Barbot has been appointed the city's health commissioner, Mayor Bill de Blasio announced Wednesday.

Barbot will focus on achieving health equity and combatting the opioid epidemic as well as raising awareness about mental health in the role, the mayor's office said. She is the first Latina to lead the agency.

""My 25 years in clinical medicine and public health have been guided by a commitment to equity, community engagement and innovation, as well as a track record of incorporating mental health into my clinical and public health practice,"" Barbot said in a statement. ""Those priorities will continue to be a focus as I work to address reducing racially-based inequities within the most pressing health issues facing our city - opioid overdose deaths, the HIV epidemic and maternal/child health outcomes.""

Barbot has served as Acting Health Commissioner since Sept. 1, after Dr. Mary Bassett stepped down from the role at the end of August. Prior to that, Barbot served as first deputy health commissioner since 2014.

As acting health commissioner, Barbot oversaw the $8 million Bronx Action Plan to address the opioid epidemic in the South Bronx and announced the city's new Standards for Respectful Care at Birth.

Barbot first joined the city's health department in 2003 as medical director for the city's public school system, a role she held for seven years. Prior to her return, she served as Baltimore's health commissioner. -- Jennifer Henderson

DFS superintendent to resign

Maria Vullo, the superintendent of the Department of Financial Services, said Wednesday that she will leave the agency Feb. 1 after three years as the state's top regulator of Wall Street and insurance. Her planned departure will allow her to lead the agency through the governor's release of his budget proposal.

""After three incredibly rewarding years as DFS superintendent, I have informed the governor that I have decided not to continue to serve in this role for his third term,"" she said in a written statement on the agency's website.

As the chief regulator of health insurance, Vullo held down insurance rate increases while enforcing coverage mandates in areas, such as access to coverage for contraception and abortion and maternal depression. She arrived in a year before the start of the Trump administration, which would loosen regulations on cheaper but less comprehensive insurance products, such as short-term plans and association health plans. Vullo was firm in her opposition to the plans, which could have allowed products that didn't cover a full range of health benefits and attracted healthier members, endangering the state's individual market.

Vullo first disclosed her departure in an interview with the New York Law Journal on Wednesday morning. The Wall Street Journal reported earlier this month that Gov. Andrew Cuomo was considering his chief of staff, Linda Lacewell, for the position. At that time, Vullo denied she was leaving.

The outgoing superintendent also presided over the liquidation of Health Republic Insurance of New York following its shutdown, which continues with policyholders and providers still awaiting payment.

Vullo did not share whether she had accepted another job. -- J.L.

Celmatix eyes therapeutics with biosciences launch

Manhattan-based Celmatix has launched a division focused on discovering and advancing new therapies in women's health called Celmatix Biosciences.

The new division will use Celmatix's Reproductive Atlas program, which is building a sprawling data set on reproductive health, for genomics- and artificial intelligence-backed therapeutic discovery in areas of women's health with high unmet needs, including reproductive conditions and menopause, Celmatix said Wednesday. Celmatix has secured its first external partnership for the biosciences division; funding of an undisclosed amount has come from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation.

Funding from the Gates Foundation will enable Celmatix to study the potential of its genomics platform to identify new biological targets for contraceptive drugs with fewer side effects, such as through nonhormonal approaches. Contraceptive drugs have long been used to treat a variety of women's health conditions.

Genomics has advanced the treatment of cancer and cardiovascular conditions, including through more effective and tolerable drugs and a better understanding of individuals who are at risk for developing these conditions.

""In comparison,"" said Piraye Beim, founder and CEO of Celmatix, ""the genomic era has not really come to women's health yet.""

Celmatix Biosciences initially will focus on delaying ovarian failure, as well as endometriosis and polycystic ovary syndrome.

""We know that a woman's reproductive health and ovarian biology really underlie her overall health,"" Beim said. ""The work that we are doing has an impact beyond fertility.""

Celmatix was founded in 2009. It employs about 100. -- J.H.

236,st george news,https://www.stgeorgeutah.com/news/archive/2019/01/14/apc-republican-senator-offers-solution-to-end-shutdown-before-trump-declares-national-emergency/,"DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA (AP) -- Congress returns to Washington for its first full week of legislative business since control of the House reverted to Democrats, but lawmakers will be confronted with the same lingering question: When will the partial government shutdown end?

One Republican senator says he's offered President Donald Trump a possible solution, though it may just be wishful thinking.

Sen. Lindsey Graham is encouraging Trump to reopen government for several weeks to continue negotiating with Democrats over the border wall Trump wants to build on the U.S.-Mexico border. If there's no deal at the end of that time, Graham says Trump would be free to take the more dramatic step of declaring a national emergency to build it.

But the South Carolina Republican says Trump still wants a deal on funding for the wall before agreeing to reopen shuttered government departments. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat, insists Trump reopen the government first.

Their weeks-old standoff led to the partial government shutdown, now on day 24 without a clear end in sight.

Trump insisted on Twitter Monday that he wanted to deal, declaring: ""I've been waiting all weekend. Democrats must get to work now. Border must be secured!""

Targeting Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, Trump also argued that the shutdown ""has become their, and the Democrats, fault!"" Trump weeks ago asserted that he would ""own"" the shutdown and polls show that he is taking most of the blame.

Graham, who has publicly pushed Trump to use his authority to declare a national emergency to build the wall, is suggesting a short-term fix first.

""Before he pulls the plug on the legislative option, and I think we're almost there, I would urge him to open up the government for a short period of time, like three weeks, before he pulls the plug, see if we can get a deal,"" Graham said. ""If we can't at the end of three weeks, all bets are off.""

Declaring a national emergency would allow Trump to bypass Congress and tap various pots of unspent federal money, including for military construction and disaster relief, as well as from assets seized by law enforcement, to pay for the wall.

Trump has kept Washington on edge over whether he would resort to such a declaration, citing what he says is a ""crisis"" of drug smuggling and the trafficking of women and children at the border. The president initially sounded as though such a move was imminent but then pulled back. He has said several times since he first mentioned the idea in public this month that he prefers a legislative solution.

A key question is how much more time is Trump willing to give lawmakers. Graham, who spoke with Trump by telephone on Sunday morning, said the legislative path ""is just about shut off"" and blamed intransigence by Pelosi.

The speaker's office had no immediate comment.

Democrats oppose an emergency declaration but may be powerless to block it. Some Republicans are wary too, fearing how a future Democratic president might use that authority. Such a move, should Trump ultimately go that route, would almost certainly be challenged in the courts.

Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., called Graham's idea to reopen the government a ""great place to start.""

""I do think if we reopen the government, if the president ends this shutdown crisis, we have folks who can negotiate a responsible, modern investment in technology that will actually make us safer,"" Coons said.

Trump says technology is nice, but that the border can't be secured without a wall.

The White House has been laying the groundwork for an emergency declaration, which is feared by lawmakers in both parties.

Senate Homeland Security Committee Chairman Ron Johnson, R-Wis., said he'd ""hate to see"" a declaration issued because the wall wouldn't get built, presumably because of legal challenges. Democrats voted in the past for border security and should again, Johnson said.

""I actually want to see this wall get built,"" Johnson said. ""I want to keep pressure on Democrats to actually come to the negotiating table in good faith and fund what they have supported in the past.""

Graham favors a declaration and said the time for talk is running out.

""It's the last option, not the first option, but we're pretty close to that being the only option,"" he said.

Graham and Coons spoke on ""Fox News Sunday"" and Johnson appeared on CNN's ""State of the Union.""

237,vice,https://www.vice.com/en_us/article/wj33nx/republicans-dont-really-want-to-secure-the-border,"Portions of the federal bureaucracy have been shut down since December 22, after Donald Trump demanded Congress budget $5 billion for a wall on the southern border and lawmakers -- Democrats in particular -- refused to include that in spending bill required to fund the government. As a result, around 800,000 government employees are temporarily out of work or working without pay and may struggle to pay rent; meanwhile, many of the jobs they would be doing, like keeping national parks clean, are not being done at all.

The reason Trump and his allies are demanding a wall, they say, is a ""crisis"" at the southern border. Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen criticized Congress for not addressing the ""growing security and humanitarian crisis"" on Saturday; Trump echoed that rhetoric and demanded ""a government funding bill that secures the border and keeps Americans safe"" in a letter to Congress on Friday.

This is dishonest in a couple different ways. Firstly, the ""crisis"" narrative is largely manufactured -- illegal border crossing apprehensions have been falling for years, according to available data, and even Trump claimed that the border was ""secure"" last month. If there is a crisis in regards to immigration it's that there's a massive backlog of asylum cases in the court system, and authorities are failing to quickly process claims from migrants waiting at the southern border in deplorable conditions. But of course, a wall won't do anything to solve those problems, and in fact Trump's supposedly tough immigration policy has fed them.

The second bit of dishonesty is that if Republicans were really concerned with border security, they've had chance after chance to address it through legislation over the past decade. Instead, both before Trump and during his administration the GOP has scuttled many compromises on immigration that would have given them the border security they say they want. Let's run the tape:

The politics of immigration were very different 12 years ago. As Trump and others have noted, many Democrats voted in 2006 for the ""Secure Fence Act"" that called for new security measures along 700 miles of the border. (There's a longstanding debate about how effective that kind of approach, a mix of fencing and other barriers, is compared to other border enforcement methods.) But that was only signed into law after a larger compromise package failed to pass.

That compromise, passed by the Senate in May and largely supported by President George W. Bush, would have built border fencing and more jail cells for deportees, and declared English the national language. But it also would have created a guest worker program and allowed undocumented people to remain in the country and in some cases become citizens -- a policy many Democrats and even some Republicans supported but which was derided as ""amnesty"" by portions of the right. The bill never went anywhere in the House, as Speaker Dennis Hastert (who was years later sent to prison after sexually abusing wrestlers he coached) slow-walked it and failed to bring it up for a vote.

That failure didn't dampen demands for a bipartisan compromise that secured the border while offering a way for millions of undocumented immigrants to come out of the shadows. The Bush White House put out a framework that offered a way to achieve those objectives. Features of this plan included a guest worker program, a worker database that would help prevent employers from hiring undocumented immigrants, and a pathway undocumented people could use to get a green card, though that process would take years. The resulting bill had support from Democrats and Republicans, but it ultimately couldn't even get a simple majority in the Senate.

Many at the time and later blamed its failure on a ""poison pill"" amendment that would have put an expiration date on the guest worker program. Introduced by a Democrat at the behest of unions, it was backed by then Senator Barack Obama and several Republicans who voted for it because they knew it would make the compromise unworkable. Though there is some doubt that the legislation would have become law even without that poison pill, the 2007 failure showed that while there was bipartisan support for an immigration compromise, there was also opposition to it from Democrats.

The politics of this issue began to shift during the Obama administration, as the Republican Party, never fully on board with the idea of immigration reform that included any relief for undocumented people, became more stridently nativist. But some GOP senators were still working on a compromise. Notably, Lindsey Graham wrote a March Washington Post op-ed with Democrat Chuck Schumer calling for increased border security along with a pathway to legal status for undocumented immigrants. But appetite for a compromise vanished as Republicans supported a harsh anti-immigrant law in Arizona and Graham rescinded his support for a compromise. Democrats still backed a security-and-legal-status reform package, but without much hope of it becoming law, since Republicans wouldn't take that deal. Any sort of support for what the right called ""amnesty"" was regarded as toxic, which is one likely reason John McCain, a previous reform sponsor, abandoned the issue around this time.

But by 2013, the dynamic had shifted again, or so many people thought. As ProPublica's Alec MacGillis would later write, after Mitt Romney lost the 2012 presidential election in part because he only got 27 percent of the Hispanic vote, many Republicans were looking at immigration reform as a way to get that demographic back and avoid becoming a party exclusively made up of whites. In the Senate, a bipartisan ""Gang of Eight"" that included four members of each party came up with a by-now-familiar framework: On one hand, there would be increased border security and measures intended to make it harder to hire undocumented workers; on the other, millions of undocumented people would be provided a pathway to citizenship.

The resulting bill passed the Senate, but the real obstacle, as it was in the Hastert era, was the House, which Republicans controlled after the Tea Party wave of 2010 put many extreme anti-immigration conservatives in office. In early 2014, GOP leaders including Speaker John Boehner introduced some principles that indicated there might be room for a compromise: They didn't support citizenship for all undocumented people, but would allow them to live and work in the US.

But then Boehner essentially bailed, saying, ""There's widespread doubt about whether this administration can be trusted to enforce our laws. And it's going to be difficult to move any immigration legislation until that changes."" This was perhaps a curious line of criticism, given that Obama's border policies around this time earned him the title ""deporter in chief"" from America's largest Latino advocacy group, but the bottom line was that conservative Republicans weren't interested in reform.

In the following years, there was little hope of compromise as the parties drifted further apart on the issue. Obama used his powers as president to shield some undocumented people brought to the US as children -- a.k.a. ""dreamers"" -- from deportation, while the GOP became increasingly anti-immigration, to the point that Marco Rubio, a member of the Gang of Eight, rejected his previous position on the issue to appeal to voters in the 2016 primary.

The 2016 election created a new obstacle to compromise legislation, as Trump was far more flagrantly racist and cruel than previous Republican presidents. Still, he had made extensive promises about building a wall, and to do so he needed at least some Democratic support, setting the stage for an obvious deal where a wall gets built in exchange for some Democratic policies.

But after a heated debate in the Senate that included a short, Democrat-led government shutdown, a series of votes for bills along those lines in early 2018 failed thanks to widespread Republican opposition. Trump maintains that the problem is federal courts have blocked his efforts to remove those protections for dreamers, making the Democrats reticent to agree to any deal involving them. But Senate Minority Leader Schumer reportedly offered to give Trump as much as $25 billion for border security, including money for the wall, in exchange for protections for dreamers -- an offer Trump rejected last January. And Trump later indicated he was not willing to negotiate along those lines.

The current state of the shutdown-and-wall negotiation is muddled, in part because Trump is such an unreliable bargaining partner. But the basic dynamic is the same as it has been for years: Democrats are largely willing, even eager, to agree to a deal that includes more border security in exchange for some protections for undocumented people. Last year, Illinois Democratic Congressman Luis Gutiérrez even said of Trump's wall, ""I'll take a bucket, take bricks, and start building it myself,"" if it meant dreamers would be shielded from deportation.

The problem is that since 2007 -- when, you could argue, Democrats were at least partly responsible for the failure of a reform bill -- Republicans have consistently refused to compromise without offering a credible alternative. If Trump really wanted a wall, he could trade it for something with Democrats. Instead, he's holding the government hostage in an attempt to get $5 billion in exchange for nothing. A rambling Friday press conference where he threatened to keep the shutdown going for years didn't help. Some conservatives have hinted they'd be willing to trade dreamer protections for the wall, but there are other indications that the nativist crew at the White House will want much more in the way of concessions from Democrats, making a deal seem impossible.

The only thing that's clear that Republicans don't want to secure the supposedly porous border. They want to gin up fear and have a big shouting match. That's pretty much the only thing you can count on at this point."
238,frontpage mag,https://www.frontpagemag.com/fpm/272349/why-trumps-wall-must-michael-cutler,"President Trump has demonstrated, once again, that he is a man of his word, opting to shut down the government rather than accede to the globalist Democrats who refuse to provide funding for the wall to be erected to help secure the dangerous and porous U.S./Mexican border.

Schumer, Pelosi and others, mostly Democrats, have opposed a wall and called for drones and other elements of a ""virtual fence"" along the southern border insisting that a wall would be too expensive and not needed.

As I noted in an earlier article, America Needs A Border Wall Like Houses Need Insulation, just as the cost of insulating houses ultimately saves money, by keeping warm air from escaping the house in the winter, insulating America against contraband (including deadly, dangerous narcotics), illegals and the criminals and terrorists among them, would protect America and Americans; and help staunch the flow of tens of billions of dollars annually sent out of the United States by illegal alien workers and criminals.

The cost of a secure border wall should be considered an investment in national security, public safety and the livelihoods of American workers. This is one investment that would not only pay for itself and, indeed pay dividends, but save many, many innocent lives.

For years, drones--also known as UAV's (Unmanned Aerial Vehicles)--have been deployed along that border at great expense and with little or nothing to show for the costly effort.

The deployment of the U.S. military's Predator UAV's to support the Border Patrol's efforts to secure our borders provided many Americans with a sense of security. After all, the military relies on those drones and we all know the U.S. military's prowess at achieving national security goals and objectives.

In reality, for the most part, that sense of security provided by the drones has been false security. False security is worse than no security.

The stark and irrefutable reality is that drones and other such devices cannot stop the entry of any illegal aliens or contraband.

Drones can spot illegal aliens and contraband only after our borders have been violated. This is true for all of the technological devices that are deployed along the border.

Furthermore, unmanned drones cannot make arrests. All that drones, pole-mounted cameras, radar and other sensors can do is transmit alerts and images to alert members of the U.S. Border Patrol that illegal entries into the United States have already taken place. The Border Patrol then must have the resources to respond to those alerts and images provided by the drones and other costly high-tech devices.

On May 1, 2018 the Cato Institute published the Immigration Research And Policy Brief No. 5: Drones on the Border: Efficacy and Privacy Implications which began with the following two paragraphs:

In response to President Donald Trump's call for a border wall, some members of Congress have instead offered a ""virtual wall"" -- ocean-to-ocean border surveillance with technology, especially unmanned aircraft known as drones. U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) already operates a fleet of nine unmanned aircraft. Although drones have been widely used in foreign battlefields, they have failed to help CBP apprehend illegal border crossers and seize drugs. Drones have led to only 0.5 percent of apprehensions at a cost of $32,000 per arrest.

At the same time, drones undermine Americans' privacy. Their surveillance records the daily lives of Americans living along the border, and because CBP regularly uses its drones to support the operations of other federal agencies as well as state and local police, its drones allow for government surveillance nationwide with minimal oversight and without warrants. CBP should wind down its drone program and, in the meantime, establish more robust privacy protections.

Drones cannot assist Border Patrol agents who come under attack by illegal aliens and alien smugglers. All that drones can do is transit images of agents who are being attacked and other agents then need to respond to back up the agents who are being attacked.

Drones are also vulnerable to hacking. On December 17, 2015 the website Defense One published a report, DHS: Drug Traffickers Are Spoofing Border Drones that include the following statement:

""The bad guys on the border have lots of money and what they are putting money into is into spoofing and jamming GPS systems. We're funding some advances so we can counter this,"" said Timothy Bennett, a science-and-technology program manager at the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees CBP. Those bad guys aren't ISIS, just traffickers, Bennett said on Dec. 16 at the Center for Strategic and International Studies ""It's more about trafficking drugs and people,"" he told Defense One. ""We know who's over there. We can guess who's doing it.""

On December 24, 2014 the DHS Office of Inspector General (OIG) issued a report, ""U.S. Customs and Border Protection's Unmanned Aircraft System Program Does Not Achieve Intended Results or Recognize All Costs of Operations"" that included the following assessments:

Although CBP's Unmanned Aircraft System program contributes to border security, after 8 years, CBP cannot prove that the program is effective because it has not developed performance measures. The program has also not achieved the expected results. Specifically, the unmanned aircraft are not meeting flight hour goals. Although CBP anticipated increased apprehensions of illegal border crossers, a reduction in border surveillance costs, and improvement in the U.S. Border Patrol's efficiency, we found little or no evidence that CBP met those program expectations.

We estimate that, in fiscal year 2013, it cost at least $62.5 million to operate the program, or about $12,255 per hour. The Office of Air and Marine's calculation of $2,468 per flight hour does not include operating costs, such as the costs of pilots, equipment, and overhead. By not including all operating costs, CBP also cannot accurately assess the program's cost effectiveness or make informed decisions about program expansion. In addition, unless CBP fully discloses all operating costs, Congress and the public are unaware of all the resources committed to the Unmanned Aircraft System program. As a result, CBP has invested significant funds in a program that has not achieved the expected results, and it cannot demonstrate how much the program has improved border security.

Given the cost of the Unmanned Aircraft System program and its unproven effectiveness, CBP should reconsider its plan to expand the program. The $443 million that CBP plans to spend on program expansion could be put to better use by investing in alternatives, such as manned aircraft and ground surveillance assets.

An effective wall, however, could prevent the illegal entry of aliens and contraband in the first place.

This should be a matter of common sense, yet many members of Congress have resisted the construction of a wall.

The major corporations that sell the government the drones, cameras and sensors find this to be an extremely lucrative venture. All too frequently you have to consider the potential for what has come to be referred to as ""crony capitalism.""

Of far greater concern however, is the simple and unavoidable conclusion that I came to many years ago. I have come to refer to this as the magic act, comparable to the magician who promises his audience that he will slice his lovely assistance in half.

Using all sorts of devices, blue smoke, mirrors and lighting, the magician creates a most convincing illusion that he had, indeed, cut the poor young woman in half. However, to everyone's relief, after the stunt is carried out, his assistant bounds up onto the stage to the enthusiastic applause and cheers of the audience.

Of course, it is clear that the last thing that the magician would want to do is really slice his assistant in half. He would go to jail and probably never be able to find anyone willing to work with him again.

Politicians like Schumer and Pelosi know damned well that the great majority of Americans, including their supposed constituents want our borders secured against the illegal entry of aliens, particularly the criminals and terrorists among them. The politicians know that the voters want to keep drugs out of their communities. However, the politicians also know that the majority of the special interest groups, such as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce want our borders left open so that cheap and exploitable workers can flood into the United States.

Politicians know that they need those campaign contributions from those special interest groups if they are to win their next elections, so they are compelled to meet the demands of their de-facto employers, those who write those big, fat political campaign checks.

Not unlike that magician, politicians have become adept at creating illusions that they are eager to secure our borders and demonstrate this by voting for expensive measures and programs that are largely worthless, but create the convincing illusion that lots of money is being spent to meet the demands of their constituents while, in reality, just as the magician's assistant is unharmed, the flood of exploitable workers will be able to continue without impediment.

So, while Schumer continues to drone on, and on, ad nauseam, the truth is that America's borders cannot be secured by blue smoke and mirrors."
239,spokesman.com,http://www.spokesman.com/stories/2019/jan/13/graham-urging-trump-to-reopen-government-for-a-few/,"WASHINGTON - A Republican lawmaker advising President Donald Trump said he is encouraging the president to reopen the government for several weeks to continue negotiating with Democrats over funding for a U.S.-Mexico border wall before the president takes the more drastic step of declaring a national emergency.

Graham said he thinks Trump is willing to accept the $5.7 billion he has insisted on for the wall, along with some immigration measures Democrats might find acceptable, such as helping immigrants who were illegally brought to the U.S. as children.

Trump has expressed interest in a broader immigration overhaul, but says he first wants the Supreme Court to address the class of immigrants known as ""Dreamers."" Pelosi also has shown no interest in accepting a wall - she has called it an ""immorality"" - in exchange for immigration fixes.

And, Trump, who was holed up in the White House as snow blanketed Washington on Sunday, appeared to shoot down Graham's suggestion of a ""wall plus"" deal, saying on Twitter that even Democrats don't want to make ""Dreamers"" part of the negotiations.

""The damage done to our Country from a badly broken Border - Drugs, Crime and so much that is bad - is far greater than a Shutdown, which the Dems can easily fix as soon as they come back to Washington!"" Trump said in a separate tweet.

240,newsweek,https://www.newsweek.com/democratic-senator-suggests-donald-trump-could-build-mexico-wall-exchange-1283172,"Senator Joe Manchin has suggested that President Donald Trump should bring back a vote on the 2013 immigration bill so he could ""get what he needs"" with regards to funding his border wall.

Speaking to CNN's Chris Cuomo, Manchin predicted that Trump would get the $5 billion he is demanding for the wall across the U.S./Mexico border if he allowed for another vote on the ""tremendous"" legislation which died in Congress last time it tried to pass.

""You go back to the 2013 immigration reform bill that we did in the Senate. And we passed it with a majority of Democrats and Republicans, I think it was 68 votes. It was a tremendous piece of legislation.

""If the president would say this, Chris, we're going to bring that 2013 immigration reform bill back up within the 30-day trial period, within 30 days, it has to be voted on, it cannot be filibustered, cannot be blocked out, we're going to have to take a vote on the floor,"" Manchin said.

""If he would do that, he would get what he needs.""

The 2013 immigration bill would have would have made it easier for millions of undocumented residents to gain citizenship in the U.S. while also increasing security on the border, including an additional 40,000 agents. Manchin previously discussed the bill during a closed-door Senate Democrats meeting last week, reports The Hill.

The government has been in partial shutdown for 18 days over Trump's demands to receive billions in funding to help build his wall.

Elsewhere in the interview, Cuomo asked why anyone would vote in favor of the border wall considering it was just a ""gimmick"" that ""resonated"" with his some voters when improved fencing or protocols to deal with immigration are what is needed.

""He was never going to build a big concrete anything, Mexico was never going to pay for a damn thing and everybody knew it,"" Cuomo added.

The host also suggested Trump's rhetoric that ""we're a wall away from safety"" is ""not true.""

Manchin replied that he has always known that any improved border security would never have been ""a China wall, or any other type of a wall"" but additional border security measures such as drones, more agents, and new X-ray machines at the ports of entries are needed.

""There are so many things that we need to secure this border. But a fence or a secured border, a fencing of some sort is needed also,"" he added.

241,the sacramento bee,https://www.sacbee.com/news/business/article223342450.html,"Excerpts from recent editorials in the United States and abroad:

The New York Times on a judge's rebuke of Michael Flynn and President Donald Trump's charitable foundation:

A bit of common sense and common decency intruded on Tuesday into the crazy world of Donald Trump.

In New York, the state attorney general announced that the president had agreed that the ""charity"" he used as a piggy bank has no reason to exist.

In Washington, a federal judge let a former top presidential aide know that you can parrot political spin or you can tell the truth, but you can't do both to someone who can send you to prison.

Michael Flynn, Mr. Trump's former national security adviser, appeared before Judge Emmet Sullivan to be sentenced to what he expected would be a term of probation, after pleading guilty to lying to federal investigators about conversations with the Russian ambassador. The office of the special counsel, Robert Mueller, had earlier filed a memo that said it would be right for Mr. Flynn to avoid prison after his extensive cooperation in the investigation of Trump ties to Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential campaign and after.

Then last week, in a memo about their client's sentencing, Mr. Flynn's lawyers implied that he had been tricked into lying and that the F.B.I. acted improperly in interviewing him -- points raised by pro-Trump commentators elaborating on the president's claims of being victimized by a witch hunt.

Judge Sullivan was having none of it.

""I cannot recall an instance of a court ever accepting a guilty plea from someone who did not maintain he was guilty,"" Judge Sullivan said, ""and I do not intend to start today.""

Chastened, Mr. Flynn told the judge that nobody tricked him, that he lied and that he knew he shouldn't have.

The judge was not upset only about Mr. Flynn's sneaky prevarication. He said he felt ""disgust"" at Mr. Flynn's offenses, that a retired three-star general would lie to the F.B.I. ""while on the physical premises of the White House,"" and, acting as an unregistered agent of a foreign country, Turkey, while he was an adviser to Mr. Trump (to which he admitted but was not charged). It was a bracing reminder of the brazenness of his misdeeds and of the standards the public should be able to expect of those who serve them.

Realizing that Judge Sullivan was considering a term of up to six months in prison, Mr. Flynn accepted his offer to delay the sentencing for 90 days until he has completed his cooperation with the special counsel.

""Good luck today in court to General Michael Flynn,"" Mr. Trump had tweeted first thing Tuesday morning.

""Thanks for nothing, Mr. President,"" Mr. Flynn might have thought as he left court.

Mr. Flynn should be grateful the judge offered him the chance to come clean. By contrast, the Donald J. Trump Foundation, a charity that provided no charity, quite properly received none from the New York attorney general's office.

Attorney General Barbara Underwood accused it of ""a shocking pattern of illegality"" that ""amounted to the Trump Foundation functioning as little more than a checkbook to serve Mr. Trump's business and political interests.""

Whatever money that remains will be disbursed under the supervision of Ms. Underwood's office and the judge overseeing the continuing lawsuit her office filed in June, seeking $2.8 million in restitution and a ban on Mr. Trump and his three oldest children serving on the boards of other nonprofit organizations.

In a series of stories exposing the foundation's true nature, The Washington Post found that its largest donation was to fix a fountain in front of the Plaza Hotel in Manhattan, which Mr. Trump owned at the time, that its funds were used to buy a portrait of Mr. Trump, and that it illegally provided political donations and paid for personal legal settlements.

All this comes just days after prosecutors announced that they believed that Mr. Trump had conspired with the owner of The National Enquirer and his fixer Michael Cohen to violate campaign finance laws by paying hush money to two women who said they had affairs with him. It's also just been reported that prosecutors are investigating spending by the Trump inaugural committee. The president still faces lawsuits on the constitutionality of his enriching himself while in office. Meanwhile, the special counsel's inquiry may be expanding rather than winding down.

It's fitting that despite all his bluster and threats, a president who's demonstrated such contempt for the rule of law is finding it so formidable.

That this goes to the essence of American governance was best summed up by Paula Duncan, the Trump enthusiast who was among the jurors who found Mr. Trump's former campaign chief Paul Manafort guilty of fraud, even though she had hoped he wouldn't be convicted.

Explaining her decision after the verdict, she told Fox News, ""No one's above the law.""

The Wall Street Journal on a judge's ruling on the Affordable Care Act's individual mandate:

No one opposes ObamaCare more than we do, and Democrats are now confirming that it was designed as a way-station to government-run health care. But a federal judge's ruling that the law is unconstitutional is likely to be overturned on appeal and may boomerang politically on Republicans.

Judge Reed O'Connor ruled for some 20 state plaintiffs that the Affordable Care Act's individual mandate is no longer legal because Republicans repealed its financial penalty as part of the 2017 tax reform. Recall that Chief Justice John Roberts joined four Justices to say ObamaCare's mandate was illegal as a command to individuals to buy insurance under the Commerce Clause. ""The Framers gave Congress the power to regulate commerce, not to compel it,"" he wrote.

Yet the Chief famously salvaged ObamaCare by unilaterally rewriting the mandate to be a ""tax"" that was within Congress's power. Never mind that Democrats had expressly said the penalty was not a tax. Majority Leader Roberts declared it to be so.

Enter Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, who argues in Texas v. U.S. that since Congress has repealed the mandate, the tax is no longer a tax, and ObamaCare is thus illegal. Judge O'Connor agreed with that logic, and he went further in ruling that since Congress said the mandate is crucial to the structure of ObamaCare, then all of ObamaCare must fall along with the mandate.

We'll admit to a certain satisfaction in seeing the Chief Justice hoist on his own logic. But his ruling in NFIB v. Sebelius was in 2012 and there is more at issue legally now than the ""tax"" issue in that opinion. One legal complication is that Congress in 2017 repealed the financial part of the individual mandate, not the structure of the mandate itself. Republicans used budget rules to pass tax reform so they couldn't repeal the mandate's express language.

The Affordable Care Act has also been up and running since 2014, which means so-called reliance interests come into play when considering a precedent. Millions of people now rely on ObamaCare's subsidies and rules, which argues against judges repealing the law by fiat.

Judge O'Connor breezes past this like a liberal Ninth Circuit appeals judge handling a Donald Trump appeal. He's right that Democrats claimed the individual mandate was essential to the Affordable Care Act. But when Congress killed the financial penalty in 2017 it left the rest of ObamaCare intact. When judging congressional intent, a judge must account for the amending Congress as well as the original Congress.

In any case, the Supreme Court's ""severability"" doctrine calls for restraint in declaring an entire law illegal merely because one part of it is. Our guess is that even the right-leaning Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals judges will overturn Judge O'Connor on this point.

As for the politics, Democrats claim to be alarmed by the ruling but the truth is they're elated. They want to use it to further pound Republicans for denying health insurance for pre-existing conditions if the law is overturned. Democrats campaigned across the country against Mr. Paxton's lawsuit to gain House and Senate seats in November, and they will now press votes in Congress so they can compound the gains in 2020.

President Trump hailed the ruling in a tweet, but he has never understood the Affordable Care Act. His Administration has done good work revising regulations to reduce health-care costs and increase access, but the risk is that the lawsuit will cause Republicans in Congress to panic politically and strike a deal with Democrats that reinforces ObamaCare. This is what happens when conservatives fall into the liberal trap of thinking they can use the courts to achieve policy goals that need to be won in Congress.

The Washington Post on withdrawing all 2,000 U.S. troops out of Syria:

PRESIDENT TRUMP'S sudden move to yank U.S. troops out of Syria undermined at a stroke several foreign policy goals he has championed. The president promised to finish the job of destroying the Islamic State, but the withdrawal will leave thousands of its fighters still in place. He vowed to roll back Iran's aggression across the Middle East, but his decision will allow its forces to entrench in the country that is the keystone of Tehran's ambitions. He promised to protect Israel, but that nation will now be left to face alone the buildup by Iran and its proxies along its northern border.

The president's top national security advisers had carefully developed and articulated a strategy of maintaining a U.S. presence in Syria until the Islamic State was beyond revival and Iran withdrew its forces -- a plan they were defending up until this week. Mr. Trump has again demonstrated, to them and to the world, that no U.S. policy or foreign commitment is immune from his whims.

Mr. Trump claimed the Islamic State had been defeated, but that is not the view of the Defense and State Departments. Thousands of jihadist fighters are still in Syria and control splotches of territory in the Euphrates Valley. A U.S. withdrawal will give the extremists an opportunity to reconstitute, as they did in Iraq following the premature U.S. withdrawal ordered by President Barack Obama.

Until Wednesday, a prime talking point of senior national security officials was that, ""if we've learned one thing over the years, (the) enduring defeat of a group like this means you can't just defeat their physical space and then leave,"" as the State Department's special envoy for the global campaign against the Islamic State, Brett McGurk, put it last week. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said it another way in September: ""Getting rid of the caliphate doesn't mean you then blindly say, 'Okay, we got rid of it,' march out, and then wonder why the caliphate comes back.""

Mr. Trump has justified some of his most controversial decisions, including his continued support for Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, as needed to contain Iran's threat to the United States and its allies. But the Syrian withdrawal hands Tehran and its ally Russia a windfall. Iran has deployed thousands of fighters and allied militiamen to Syria and aspires to create a corridor to Lebanon and the Mediterranean, as well as a new front against Israel along the Golan Heights. In reaction to that threat, Mr. Trump's national security adviser, John Bolton, announced Sept. 24 that ""We're not going to leave (Syria) as long as Iranian troops are outside Iranian borders, and that includes Iranian proxies and militias.""

U.S. ambitions in Syria have never been backed by adequate resources, and a case could be made that neither Congress nor the American public were prepared to support the mission suggested by Mr. Bolton. But Mr. Trump's decision appears to have been precipitated by the bellicose rhetoric of Turkey's Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who last week threatened -- not for the first time -- a military operation against Syrian Kurds, even though U.S. troops are positioned around them. The autocratic Turkish ruler appears to have extracted multiple favors from Mr. Trump in recent days, including the sale of U.S. Patriot missiles and a promise to reexamine the possible extradition of his rival, Fethullah Gulen, from Pennsylvania. If Mr. Trump received anything in return, he hasn't disclosed it.

The Syrian Kurdish forces, which have fought alongside the United States and played a crucial role in liberating most of eastern Syria from the jihadists, will be perhaps the foremost victims of Mr. Trump's decision. Betrayed by Washington, they will now be subject to a military offensive by Turkey. The stab in the back will send an unforgettable message to all who are asked to cooperate with the United States in the fight against terrorism: Washington is an unreliable and dangerous partner.

The Orange County (California) Register on Mick Mulvaney as Trump's choice for chief of staff:

President Trump has found a new chief of staff, albeit an interim one, in his director of the Office of Management and Budget, Mick Mulvaney.

That of chief is a terribly important post, perhaps government's most consequential aside from that of his boss. In theory, at least, the chief of staff is the gatekeeper for everything the president does, everyone he sees, everyone he talks to on the phone.

Perhaps, though few would expect this to be the case, the arbiter of every time he sends out a tweet, and of what it should say.

A Washington insider, a former congressman, Mulvaney is in many ways ideal for the job. He wants it, badly, whereas others with similarly impressive resumes touted for the job have indicated a strong desire to spend more time with their families, from Vice President Pence's staff chief Nick Ayers of Georgia to former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie.

Mulvaney shares the conservative values currently espoused by the president and was a founder of the House Freedom Caucus in 2013, the group that always taunted the Republican leadership, opposing much government funding, including debt limit increases and budget agreements made with the Democrats.

But he also, after Trump secured the Republican nomination in 2016, called the candidate ""a terrible human being"" who he only was voting for out of an even greater dislike of Hillary Clinton.

It's not as if other presidential allies of today haven't said bad things about him in the past. On the campaign trail, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz called his rival ""a narcissist at a level I don't think this country's ever seen,"" for instance.

But if you were the nation's chief executive -- or the CEO of a much smaller entity, for that matter -- could you hire as your top aide and work with a person who had once dubbed you ""terrible""?

Or does this kind of talk come with the territory in politics, where many strange bedfellows are made because of having to run in elections against once and perhaps future allies? Should Trump indeed elevate this practical choice for staff chief to permanent status immediately?

Los Angeles Times on banning bump stocks, which allow semi-automatic weapons to fire like machine guns:

The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives said Tuesday that it had finalized a rule reclassifying so-called bump stocks -- the devices that can make a semiautomatic rifle fire nearly as quickly a fully automatic weapon -- as machine guns, which makes it illegal to manufacture, sell or possess them. The agency said a year ago it had the authority to reclassify the devices, and President Trump -- in the wake of the Parkland, Fla., school shooting -- directed the ATF to speed up the process. Tuesday's announcement -- a rare bit of welcome news from the Trump administration -- makes it official; White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters that owners of the conversion devices will have until March 21 to destroy them or turn them in to the ATF.

This is a good step. Unfortunately, it's all but certain to be challenged in the courts, and it's on shaky legal ground because of the way the new rule evolved. The Obama administration determined that because bump stocks have ""no automatically functioning mechanical parts and (perform) no automated mechanical functions when installed,"" they did not fit the definition of a machine gun in federal law, which meant the ATF lacked the authority to regulate them. Tuesday's announcement, by contrast, hinges not on the technical specifications, but on the functionality. In essence, if it fires like a machine gun, it's a machine gun. Cue the lawyers.

We hope the administration prevails in whatever challenges emerge, but the sure-fire way to resolve this would be for Congress to legislate bump stocks and related gadgets out of existence. Such devices serve no function other than to evade the strict congressional limit on machine guns by, as the ATF said, harnessing ""the recoil energy of the semiautomatic firearm in a manner that allows the trigger to reset and continue firing"" without the shooter having to pull the trigger for each shot.

A mass shooter in Las Vegas used bump stocks affixed to semiautomatic rifles to fire more than 1,000 rounds in a matter of minutes from a 32nd-floor suite of the Mandalay Bay Hotel into a crowd of some 20,000 people, killing 58 concertgoers and injuring hundreds of others. It was the largest single mass shooting in the modern era, drawing attention to bump stocks and sparking outraged demands by many -- the Los Angeles Times included -- that the devices be banned.

As welcome as this new rule is, it will do little to corral our national problem with gun violence. The vast majority of gun deaths come in ones and twos, led by suicides. ...

But it is progress. And the president deserves credit for sticking with his promise to find a way to ban bump stocks. ...

China Daily says telecommunications giant Huawei is a victim of U.S. panic attacks:

This year has not been an annus mirabilis for China's Huawei Technologies Ltd, the world's largest supplier of telecommunications network equipment and second-biggest maker of smartphones.

Although it has been constantly in the news and it is said there is no such thing as bad publicity, it has been making headlines because of the spurious claims it somehow poses a threat to the West, even world peace. It has never been explained exactly how.

In fact it is not because of anything it has done, but because its success has brought it into the crosshairs of the United States' anxiety attacks against China.

Huawei is at the forefront of 5G technology. This latest generation mobile network technology promises to bring the much anticipated and heralded internet of things to life and the US is determined to be the 5G leader.

Not only because whichever country develops the technology that is adopted as standard will have a huge commercial advantage. But also because by setting the standard it will have a knowledge advantage.

As a result, first the US and then one after another its most obedient allies have blocked Huawei from entering their 5G markets on security grounds.

None of them have offered any specific justification for blocking Huawei. They just repeat their claim that the company poses a security risk. That is why objective observers have concluded that those countries are politicizing a commercial issue.

It sets a harmful precedent. What if other countries used the same excuse to block US companies (not confined to the telecom sector)? The US companies are very competitive in many fields, including those that could pose huge security risks, such as finance.

While Huawei will not go unscathed from being prevented from entering key markets, as a competitive player, it still has a vast market to access in other parts of the world. It has signed contracts to supply 5G equipment to 25 telecom carriers, and more than 10,000 5G base stations have been shipped.

In stark contrast to the US and its allies, India for instance, has invited Huawei to conduct 5G trials in the country and complimented it on the role it has played in helping to develop its telecom industry.

The efforts of the US and its allies to try to shield their companies against a Chinese competitor are politically motivated, not the result of a fact-based or transparent decision-making process. And they are counterproductive to the concerted efforts that are needed to ensure the security of 5G networks."
242,the sacramento bee,https://www.sacbee.com/news/politics-government/article223445505.html,"President Trump traveled to the center of California's tragic wildfire on Nov. 17. He toured devastated areas with Gov. Jerry Brown and Gov.-elect Gavin Newsom. By

President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Friday that calls for expanding logging on millions of acres of federal forest lands as part of a plan to reduce wildfire risks.

""For decades, dense trees and undergrowth have amassed in these lands, fueling catastrophic wildfires,"" Trump wrote in the order, released as Congress haggled over funding for Trump's border wall with a government shutdown looming. ""These conditions, along with insect infestation, invasive species, disease, and drought, have weakened our forests, rangelands, and other federal lands, and have placed communities and homes at risk of damage from catastrophic wildfires. Active management of vegetation is needed to treat these dangerous conditions on Federal lands but is often delayed.""

Trump's order calls for easing regulatory burdens that would allow for the harvest of least 3.8 billion board feet of timber from lands managed by the U.S. Forest Service and another 600 million board feet of timber on Bureau of Land Management property.

Those figures represent a substantial increase in timber sales over recent years.

In 2017, the Forest Service harvested more than 2.9 billion board feet of timber, according to a summary the agency released last year. In 2016, the BLM had more than 233.2 million board feet of timber for sale.

Environmental groups blasted Trump's order.

Denise Boggs of the the Northern California environmental group Conservation Congress said it ignored climate change, and didn't address the need to thin areas directly around communities to prevent them from catching fire.

""It won't work, and we know that ... All the fire ecologists are saying the same thing: You can't log your way out of this situation,"" Boggs said. ""Logging in the back country is just a gift to the timber industry.""

Boggs said environmentalists will certainly sue if Trump tries to ramp up logging.

Since taking office, the Trump administration has advocated for more aggressive timber management to boost struggling rural economies and to proactively fight fires. This year, Northern California's devastating Carr and Camp fires became the backdrop as Trump and administration officials made their case.

""We have to do management, maintenance,"" Trump said while touring Camp Fire-scorched Paradise neighborhoods last month. ""We'll be working also with environmental groups. I think everybody's seen the light.""

He cited the ""forest nation"" of Finland, which Trump said spends ""a lot of time raking and cleaning and doing things, and they don't have any problem.""

Touring Redding neighborhoods burned by the Carr Fire this summer, Trump's outgoing Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke blamed ""special interest"" environmentalists for using the courts to block thinning projects that he said would reduce fire risk.

""We have been held hostage by these environmental terrorist groups ... that have refused to allow harvest of timber,"" Zinke earlier told conservative news outlet Breitbart News.

While state officials are less likely to use the word ""logging"" to describe the work, California has vowed to become more aggressive when it comes to forest management.

Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown secured $96 million from the Legislature this year to pay for more forest management projects.

He also signed Senate Bill 901, which attempts to shield electric utilities from certain wildfire costs but also relaxes logging restrictions for larger trees on small parcels of privately owned land.

The new law allocates $1 billion over five years, generated by proceeds from the state's ""cap and trade"" carbon emissions program, to ramp up forest thinning."
243,the sacramento bee,https://www.sacbee.com/news/nation-world/article224499960.html,"Congress returns to Washington for its first full week of legislative business since control of the House reverted to Democrats, but lawmakers will be confronted with the same lingering question: When will the partial government shutdown end?

One Republican senator says he's offered President Donald Trump a possible solution, though it may just be wishful thinking.

Sen. Lindsey Graham is encouraging Trump to reopen government for several weeks to continue negotiating with Democrats over the border wall Trump wants to build on the U.S.-Mexico border. If there's no deal at the end of that time, Graham says Trump would be free to take the more dramatic step of declaring a national emergency to build it.

But the South Carolina Republican says Trump still wants a deal on funding for the wall before agreeing to reopen shuttered government departments. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat, insists Trump reopen the government first.

Their weeks-old standoff led to the partial government shutdown, now on day 24 without a clear end in sight.

""Before he pulls the plug on the legislative option, and I think we're almost there, I would urge him to open up the government for a short period of time, like three weeks, before he pulls the plug, see if we can get a deal,"" Graham said. ""If we can't at the end of three weeks, all bets are off.

""See if he can do it by himself through the emergency powers. That's my recommendation,"" added Graham, who has publicly pushed Trump to use his authority to declare a national emergency to build the wall. Such a step would allow Trump to bypass Congress and tap various pots of unspent federal money, including for military construction and disaster relief as well as from assets seized by law enforcement, to pay for the wall.

Trump has kept Washington on edge over whether he would resort to such a declaration, citing what he says is a ""crisis"" of drug smuggling and the trafficking of women and children at the border. The president initially sounded as though such a move was imminent, but then pulled back. He has said several times since he first mentioned the idea in public this month that he prefers a legislative solution.

A key question is how much more time is Trump willing to give lawmakers. Graham, who spoke with Trump by telephone on Sunday morning, said the legislative path ""is just about shut off"" and blamed intransigence by Pelosi.

The speaker's office had no immediate comment.

Democrats oppose an emergency declaration but may be powerless to block it. Some Republicans are wary, too, fearing how a future Democratic president might use that authority. Such a move, should Trump ultimately go that route, would almost certainly be challenged in the courts.

Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., called Graham's idea to reopen the government a ""great place to start.""

""I do think if we reopen the government, if the president ends this shutdown crisis, we have folks who can negotiate a responsible, modern investment in technology that will actually make us safer,"" Coons said.

Trump says technology is nice, but that the border can't be secured without a wall.

The White House has been laying the groundwork for an emergency declaration, which is feared by lawmakers in both parties.

Senate Homeland Security Committee Chairman Ron Johnson, R-Wis., said he'd ""hate to see"" a declaration issued because the wall wouldn't get built, presumably because of legal challenges. Democrats voted in the past for border security and should again, he said.

""I actually want to see this wall get built,"" Johnson said. ""I want to keep pressure on Democrats to actually come to the negotiating table in good faith and fund what they have supported in the past.""

Graham favors a declaration and said the time for talk is running out.

""It's the last option, not the first option, but we're pretty close to that being the only option,"" he said.

Graham and Coons spoke on ""Fox News Sunday"" and Johnson appeared on CNN's ""State of the Union."""
244,the sacramento bee,https://www.sacbee.com/news/business/article224126560.html,"The Latest on President Donald Trump and the partial government shutdown (all times local):

3:16 p.m.

Congressional leaders from both parties have returned to the White House for another round of negotiations with President Donald Trump on the ongoing partial government shutdown.

The two sides have made no apparent progress in the past week, with Trump sticking to his demand of $5.7 billion for a border barrier and Democrats insisting they won't give him the money.

Trump has been making a public case that there is a ""crisis"" at the southern border. And he's still threatening to declare a national emergency to circumvent Congress if he can't get the wall money from them.

He told reporters during a visit to the Capitol earlier Wednesday that he may turn to a declaration ""at some point"" if top Democrats Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi ""don't agree"" with his assessment about the problems at the border.

President Donald Trump says Republicans are ""totally unified"" in the shutdown standoff over his long-promised southern border wall, though some GOP lawmakers have been expressing concern about the 19-day partial government closure.

Trump traveled to Capitol Hill on Wednesday to meet with Senate Republicans. He says there was ""no discussion about anything other than solidarity.""

Trump has been considering a national emergency declaration to bypass Congress to build the wall. He says he ""may do that at some point"" if he can't get a deal with Democrats.

Trump also plans to meet with top congressional Democrats and Republicans at the White House on Wednesday.

President Donald Trump arrived on Capitol Hill claiming he has ""tremendous"" support as he headed into a meeting with Republican senators uneasy with the government shutdown over his border wall.

Asked how long the shutdown would last, Trump told reporters Wednesday ""whatever it takes.""

The partial shutdown is now in its 19th day, the second longest ever.

Trump and Vice President Mike Pence arrived for the private lunch meeting with the Senate GOP caucus to shore up support.

Several Republican senators have said the government should be re-opened while talks continue over border security and Trump's demand for money to build the wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.

President Donald Trump says he thinks he and the Democrats are ""getting closer"" to a deal to end the budget stalemate that has partially shut down the government despite no evidence that any progress has been made.

And he's suggesting the partial government shutdown could be ""a blessing in disguise"" because, he suggests, it could lead to a broader immigration deal.

Trump spoke Wednesday during an Oval Office bill signing on anti-human trafficking legislation. It's a day after he delivered a prime-time address trying to make the case for his long-stalled U.S.-Mexico border wall.

Trump says that he would like to see ""real immigration reform in this country because we need it."" He says, ""Everybody wants to see immigration reform,"" adding that perhaps the stalemate ""will turn out to be a blessing in disguise.""

Gone are the days when the U.S. and Mexican governments regularly exchanged statements over President Donald Trump's insistence on a border wall.

Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said Wednesday he won't be drawn into what he calls a U.S. internal dispute, an apparent reference to the 19-day-old partial U.S. government shutdown over a border barrier.

Lopez Obrador says, ""We are not going to respond to situations arising from internal affairs in the United States.""

Unlike his predecessor, the Mexican leader didn't have to respond to any specific aspersion about Mexico, because Trump didn't make any in his Tuesday night address to the American public. Relations between the two leaders have been surprisingly cordial, given their ideological differences.

Lopez Obrador said, ""Of course, there are those ... who want us to get into a confrontation. We always want a friendly relationship with the United States, a cooperative relationship.""

As a presidential candidate Trump promised Mexico would pay for a border wall, but Mexico refused.

President Donald Trump is using a bill signing focused on curbing human trafficking to push his case for a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border.

Trump says a southern border that is not secured exacerbates the incidents of human trafficking. He says, ""As long as we have a border that is not secure, we're going to suffer the consequences of that.""

Wednesday's bill signing came a day after Trump's prime-time speech designed to persuade Americans that illegal immigration and trafficking at the border are a crisis.

Democrats have called Trump's promised wall costly, ineffective and ""immoral"" and say he's ""manufacturing a crisis.""

The bill Trump signed is designed to enhance an annual State Department report that measures global efforts to eliminate human trafficking.

The White House says it's the fourth bipartisan bill the Republican president has signed in the last few weeks to prevent human trafficking.

Congressional Democrats say they'll head to the White House with the plan to reopen the government -- the same one they've been presenting. They're asking President Donald Trump to accept a bipartisan bill to fund border security without the wall.

Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Wednesday the president ""could end the Trump shutdown and re-open the government today, and he should.""

Pelosi and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer spoke at an event where they were flanked by federal workers going without pay during the shutdown, now in its 19th day.

Schumer called workers the ""collateral damage"" of Trump's ""temper tantrum."" He said the president failed to ""persuade a soul"" during his ""divisive"" prime-time address Tuesday night to the nation.

Trump meets with congressional leaders at the White House Wednesday afternoon. He rejected the Senate's bipartisan funding bill in December, sparking the shutdown.

The White House is trying to keep jittery congressional Republicans from defecting over the toll the partial government shutdown is taking in their states.

President Donald Trump and Democrats have been at an impasse over funding for his proposed border wall, which has led to a partial government shutdown, now in its 19th day.

Trump meets with Senate Republicans Wednesday on Capitol Hill just hours after he argued on national television that a border wall was needed to resolve a security and humanitarian ""crisis.""

Senators say the shutdown has led to disruptions in agricultural payments for farmers, as well as for home buyers trying to secure government-backed home loans. Lawmakers also are worried about missed paychecks for government workers Friday.

As many as half a dozen GOP senators have said the government should reopen while border security negotiations with Democrats continue.

President Donald Trump again linked illegal immigration along the southern border with drugs and violent crime as he urged Democratic lawmakers to fund his proposed border wall.

In his first national address from the Oval Office, the president gave no indication he was softening his stance that the partial government shutdown would continue without money for the wall.

Trump argued Tuesday night that the wall was needed to resolve what he called a security and humanitarian ""crisis.""

He addressed the nation as the shutdown stretched through its third week, with hundreds of thousands of federal workers going without pay and some congressional Republicans growing increasingly jittery about the impasse.

Trump plans to visit Senate Republicans at the Capitol on Wednesday before meeting with Democratic leaders at the White House."
245,the sacramento bee,https://www.sacbee.com/news/business/article224277975.html,"The government shutdown has suspended federal cleanups at Superfund sites around the nation and forced the cancellation of public hearings, deepening the mistrust and resentment of surrounding residents who feel people in power long ago abandoned them to live among the toxic residue of the country's factories and mines.

As President Donald Trump and Congress battle over Trump's demand for a wall on the southern U.S. border, the nearly 3-week-old partial government shutdown has stopped federal work on Superfund sites except for cases where the administration deems ""there is an imminent threat to the safety of human life or to the protection of property.""

EPA's shutdown plans said the agency would evaluate about 800 Superfund sites to see how many could pose an immediate threat. As an example of that kind of threat, it cited an acid leak from a mine that could threaten the public water supply. That's the hazard at Northern California's Iron Mountain mine, where EPA workers help prevent an unending flow of lethally acidic runoff off the Superfund site from spilling into rivers downstream.

Practically speaking, said Bonnie Bellow, a former EPA official who worked on Superfund public outreach at the agency, the impact of the stoppage of work at sites across the nation ""wholly depends"" on the length of the shutdown.

""Unless there is immediate risk like a storm, a flood, a week or two of slowdowns is not going to very likely affect the cleanup at the site,"" Bellow said.

In north Birmingham, Brown said it's been a couple of weeks since she's spotted any EPA crews at people's houses. It wasn't clear if state workers or contractors were continuing work.

But long before the shutdown began, Brown harbored doubts the cleanup was working anyway. ""My main concern is the health of the people out here,"" said Brown, who has asthma. ""All of us are sick, and we've got to function on medicine every day.""

In terms of time, the federal government shutdown is a chronological blip in the long history of the site -- which includes ethics charges in a local bribery scandal to block federal cleanup efforts -- but adds to the uncertainty in an area where residents feel forgotten and betrayed.

At the EPA, the shutdown has furloughed the bulk of the agency's roughly 14,000 employees. It also means the EPA isn't getting most of the daily stream of environmental questions and tips from the public. Routine inspections aren't happening. State, local and private emails to EPA officials often get automated messages back promising a response when the shutdown ends.

In Montana, for instance, state officials this month found themselves fielding calls from a tribal member worried about drinking water with a funny look to it, said Kristi Ponozzo, public-policy director at that state's Department of Environmental Quality. The EPA normally provides tribes with technical assistance on water supplies.

With most EPA colleagues idled, Ponozzo said, her agency also had to call off an environmental review meeting for a mining project, potentially delaying the project.

But it's the agency's work at Superfund sites -- lessening the threat from old nuclear-weapons plants, chemical factories, mines and other entities -- that gets much of the attention.

Absent imminent peril, it would be up to state governments or contractors to continue any cleanup during the shutdown ""up to the point that additional EPA direction or funding is needed,"" the EPA said in a statement.

""Sites where cleanup activities have been stopped or shut down will be secured until cleanup activities are able to commence when the federal government reopens,"" the agency said.

For federal Superfund sites in Michigan, the shutdown means there are no EPA colleagues to consult, said Scott Dean, a spokesman for that state's Department of Environmental Quality.

At Michigan Superfund sites, day-to-day field operations were continuing since private contractors do most of the on-the-ground work, Dean said.

Bellow, the former EPA official, said the cancellation of hearings about Superfund sites posed immediate concerns.

In East Chicago, Indiana, for example, the EPA called off a planned public hearing set for last Wednesday to outline how the agency planned to clean up high levels of lead and arsenic in the soil.

The EPA has proposed a seven-month, $26.5 million cleanup that includes treating and removing tainted soil from the area, where a lead smelter previously was located.

During a public meeting Nov. 29, some residents complained that the EPA's approach would leave too much pollution in place. But others didn't get a chance to speak and were hoping to do so at the meeting this week, said Debbie Chizewer, a Northwestern University environmental attorney who represents community groups in the low-income area.

The EPA announced the cancellation in an online notice and gave no indication that it would be rescheduled.

Leaders of the East Chicago Calumet Community Advisory Group asked for a new hearing date and an extension of a Jan. 14 public comment deadline in a letter to the EPA's regional Superfund division.

Calls by The Associated Press to the agency's regional office in Chicago this week were not answered.

Local critics fear the EPA will use the delay caused by the shutdown as justification for pushing ahead with a cleanup strategy they consider flawed, Chizewer said, even though the agency has designated the affected area as an ""environmental justice community"" -- a low-income community of color that has been disproportionately harmed by pollution.

The EPA has a ""special obligation"" when dealing with such communities, Chizewer said. ""This would be an example of shutting them out for no good reason.""

In North Birmingham, former longtime neighborhood resident Charlie Powell said most of the people living in and around the Superfund site had already ""just got tired and fed up.""

Powell left the area but started a group called PANIC, People Against Neighborhood Industrial Contamination. He believes money would be better spent helping residents move away from the pollution.

""Can I say hell?"" Powell said when asked what residents have been through.

246,newsweek,https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-approval-rating-favorite-rasmussen-poll-lowest-mark-year-1290549,"Amid the longest government shutdown in the nation's history, President Donald Trump's approval rating has dipped across a number of polls -- even his favorite conservative-leaning Rasmussen Reports.

Trump's approval rating Monday by Rasmussen Reports, which tracks that rating daily, fell to 43 percent among likely voters, the lowest since January 2018 when it bottomed out at 42 percent. Trump's latest disapproval rating was 55 percent. Close to half, 46 percent, strongly disapproved of the president while 32 percent strongly approved of him.

Rasmussen Reports, which Trump has often referenced in tweets to tout a higher approval rating than other polls, on Monday stated that his ""overall job approval rating has been falling since his Oval Office address last week calling for enhanced border security and the building of a wall to help stop illegal immigration.""

The Rasmussen poll is based on telephone surveys of 500 likely voters and has a margin of error of plus or minus 2.5 percentage points.

Other surveys also suggest that Trump is becoming increasingly unpopular due to the shutdown. His net job disapproval rating was 57 percent in a CNN poll conducted last Thursday and Friday, up from 52 percent disapproval when the same poll question was asked between December 6 and 9. Only 37 percent approved of the way Trump is handling his job in the latest poll, down from 39 percent in the December survey.

The president's disapproval rating has been higher four times since the poll was first conducted in late January 2017. Trump's disapproval peaked at 59 percent in mid-December 2017, after Roy Moore, the candidate he endorsed despite sexual assault allegations, lost the Alabama Senate race. His disapproval rating hit 58 percent three times, in early September 2018, mid-February 2018 and early November 2017. It also hit 57 percent in mid-October 2017.

55 percent of respondents in the latest survey thought Trump was more responsible for the shutdown, while only 32 percent thought it was the responsibility of Democrats in Congress who have refused to provide funding for a border wall. In the new poll, 39 percent favored building a wall, up one percent from December.

On Monday, the 24th day of the partial shutdown, Trump continued to blame Democrats.

""I've been waiting all weekend,"" he tweeted. ""Democrats must get to work now. Border must be secured!""

He also tweeted that House Speaker ""Nancy [Pelosi] and [Senate Minority Leader] Cryin' Chuck [Schumer] can end the Shutdown in 15 minutes. At this point it has become their, and the Democrats, fault!""

The new CNN poll was conducted by SSRS and included 848 adults and had a margin of error of plus or minus 4.1 percentage points.

A Morning Consult poll released on December 26 found that just 39 percent of registered voters approved of Trump's job performance, and that 80 percent of them were Republicans."
247,the detroit news,http://www.detroitnews.com/story/news/politics/2019/01/14/congress-face-question-will-shutdown-end/38894753/,"Washington - Congress returns to Washington for its first full week of legislative business since control of the House reverted to Democrats, but lawmakers will be confronted with the same lingering question: When will the partial government shutdown end?

One Republican senator says he's offered President Donald Trump a possible solution, though it may just be wishful thinking.

Sen. Lindsey Graham is encouraging Trump to reopen government for several weeks to continue negotiating with Democrats over the border wall Trump wants to build on the U.S.-Mexico border. If there's no deal at the end of that time, Graham says Trump would be free to take the more dramatic step of declaring a national emergency to build it.

But the South Carolina Republican says Trump still wants a deal on funding for the wall before agreeing to reopen shuttered government departments. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat, insists Trump reopen the government first.

Their weeks-old standoff led to the partial government shutdown, now on day 24 without a clear end in sight.

""Before he pulls the plug on the legislative option, and I think we're almost there, I would urge him to open up the government for a short period of time, like three weeks, before he pulls the plug, see if we can get a deal,"" Graham said. ""If we can't at the end of three weeks, all bets are off.

""See if he can do it by himself through the emergency powers. That's my recommendation,"" added Graham, who has publicly pushed Trump to use his authority to declare a national emergency to build the wall. Such a step would allow Trump to bypass Congress and tap various pots of unspent federal money, including for military construction and disaster relief as well as from assets seized by law enforcement, to pay for the wall.

Trump has kept Washington on edge over whether he would resort to such a declaration, citing what he says is a ""crisis"" of drug smuggling and the trafficking of women and children at the border. The president initially sounded as though such a move was imminent, but then pulled back. He has said several times since he first mentioned the idea in public this month that he prefers a legislative solution.

A key question is how much more time is Trump willing to give lawmakers. Graham, who spoke with Trump by telephone on Sunday morning, said the legislative path ""is just about shut off"" and blamed intransigence by Pelosi.

The speaker's office had no immediate comment.

Democrats oppose an emergency declaration but may be powerless to block it. Some Republicans are wary, too, fearing how a future Democratic president might use that authority. Such a move, should Trump ultimately go that route, would almost certainly be challenged in the courts.

Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., called Graham's idea to reopen the government a ""great place to start.""

""I do think if we reopen the government, if the president ends this shutdown crisis, we have folks who can negotiate a responsible, modern investment in technology that will actually make us safer,"" Coons said.

Trump says technology is nice, but that the border can't be secured without a wall.

The White House has been laying the groundwork for an emergency declaration, which is feared by lawmakers in both parties.

Senate Homeland Security Committee Chairman Ron Johnson, R-Wis., said he'd ""hate to see"" a declaration issued because the wall wouldn't get built, presumably because of legal challenges. Democrats voted in the past for border security and should again, he said.

""I actually want to see this wall get built,"" Johnson said. ""I want to keep pressure on Democrats to actually come to the negotiating table in good faith and fund what they have supported in the past.""

Graham favors a declaration and said the time for talk is running out.

""It's the last option, not the first option, but we're pretty close to that being the only option,"" he said.

Graham and Coons spoke on ""Fox News Sunday"" and Johnson appeared on CNN's ""State of the Union."""

As President Donald Trump is said to be mulling ""other options"" for funding his border wall between the U.S. and Mexico, according to the Associated Press, a dark horse arises on the internet.

A GoFundMe campaign popped up Sunday, hoping to raise funds for Trump's proposed wall between the U.S. and Mexico, which isn't news in and of itself. There are plenty of those around.

But the organizers of this campaign are so encouraged that they've raised more-than $700,000 in just three days that they've bumped their original goal of $200 million up to a cool billion.

The GoFundMe organizer is listed as triple-amputee Air Force veteran Brian Kolfage, who lost both legs and his right arm in a blast at Balad Air Force Base in Iraq in 2004, according to the Arizona Daily Star. The fundraiser is titled, ""We the people will fund the wall.""

The contact listing for the organizer says ""The Wall Funding Team"" is located in Miramar, Fla.

""As a veteran who has given so much, 3 limbs, I feel deeply invested to this nation to ensure future generations have everything we have today,"" Kolfage wrote in the GoFundMe campaign description. ""Too many Americans have been murdered by illegal aliens and too many illegals are taking advantage of the United States taxpayers with no means of ever contributing to our society.

""I have grandparents who immigrated to America legally, they did it the correct way and it's time we uphold our laws, and get this wall BUILT! It's up to Americans to help out and pitch in to get this project rolling.""

Multiple studies and reports have shown, though, that illegal immigrants commit crime, violent or nonviolent, at lesser rates than do native-born Americans.

Kolfage's GoFundMe campaign was listed as the ""Top fundraiser"" on the front page of the crowd-sourced social fundraising website as of Wednesday afternoon, despite Kolfage's claims that the platform was trying to hide his fundraiser from potential donors.

Kolfage's Facebook page, where he posts content relevant to his conservative political beliefs, has more than 90,000 followers.

""We have contacted the Trump Administration to secure a point of contact where all funds will go upon completion,"" the campaign says. ""When get this information secured we will update. We have many very high level contacts already helping."""
249,the sacramento bee,https://www.sacbee.com/news/nation-world/article223193915.html,"White House digs in on border wall demand, risking shutdown

WASHINGTON (AP) -- The White House on Sunday pushed the federal government closer to the brink of a partial shutdown later this week, digging in on its demand for $5 billion to build a border wall as congressional Democrats stood firm against it.

""We're going to do whatever is necessary to build the border wall to stop this ongoing crisis of illegal immigration,"" said White House senior adviser Stephen Miller.

Asked if that meant having a government shutdown, he said: ""If it comes to it, absolutely.""

Trump said last week he would be ""proud"" to have a shutdown to get Congress to approve a $5 billion down payment to fulfill his campaign promise to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. But the president doesn't have the votes from the Republican-controlled Congress to support funding for the wall at that level.

Democratic congressional leaders, Sen. Chuck Schumer and Rep. Nancy Pelosi, have proposed no more than $1.6 billion, as outlined in a bipartisan Senate bill. The money would not go for the wall but for fencing upgrades and other border security. Democrats also offered to simply keep funding at its current level, $1.3 billion.

Trump lawyer Giuliani rules out Mueller interview with Trump

WASHINGTON (AP) -- With a number of probes moving closer to the Oval Office, President Donald Trump and his attorney unleashed a fresh series of attacks on the investigators, questioning their integrity while categorically ruling out the possibility of a presidential interview with the special counsel.

Trump and Rudy Giuliani used Twitter and television interviews Sunday to deliver a series of broadsides against special counsel Robert Mueller and federal prosecutors in New York. Giuliani said he was ""disgusted"" by the tactics used by Mueller in his probe into Russian election interference, including in securing guilty pleas from the president's former national security adviser Michael Flynn on a charge of lying to federal investigators.

Trump, Giuliani said, would not submit to an interview by Mueller's team.

""They're a joke,"" Giuliani told ""Fox News Sunday."" ''Over my dead body, but, you know, I could be dead.""

The special counsel, who is investigating possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russia, has continued to request an interview with the president. Last month, the White House sent written answers in response to the special counsel's questions about possible collusion. The White House has resisted answering questions on possible obstruction of justice.

Child's death highlights communication barriers on border

Shortly before a 7-year-old Guatemalan girl died in U.S. custody, her father signed a form stating that his daughter was in good health. But it's unclear how much the man understood on the form, which was written in English and read to him in Spanish by Border Patrol agents.

The death of Jakelin Caal highlights the communication challenges along the U.S.-Mexico border as agents come in contact with an increasing number of migrants who speak neither English nor Spanish.

Her father's native language is the Mayan tongue known as Q'eqchi'. His second language is Spanish. It's unclear whether something was lost in translation or whether it would have made a difference in saving Jakelin after the two were detained and underwent a health screening along a remote stretch of U.S.-Mexico border. But the case raises questions about the Border Patrol's use of English-only forms.

All agents are required to speak Spanish, and they receive formal Spanish training. Reading forms in Spanish is often enough to pose basic questions. But some other Spanish-speaking migrants reported signing paperwork that they later said they did not understand.

Scores of immigrant parents who were separated from their children after crossing the border in the spring said they signed forms agreeing to be deported with the understanding that their kids would be returning with them, only to find themselves deported without them. Many had to wait months before being reunited with them in their homelands.

Talks adopt 'rulebook' to put Paris climate deal into action

KATOWICE, Poland (AP) -- Almost 200 nations, including the world's top greenhouse gas producers, China and the United States, have adopted a set of rules meant to breathe life into the 2015 Paris climate accord by setting out how countries should report their emissions and efforts to reduce them.

But negotiators delayed other key decisions until next year -- a move that frustrated environmentalists and countries that wanted more ambitious goals in light of scientists' warnings that the world must shift sharply away from fossil fuels in the coming decade.

""The majority of the rulebook for the Paris agreement has been created, which is something to be thankful for,"" said Mohamed Adow, a climate policy expert at Christian Aid. ""But the fact countries had to be dragged kicking and screaming to the finish line shows that some nations have not woken up"" to the dire consequences of global warming as outlined in a report by the U.N Panel on Climate Change, or IPCC.

Officials at the talks, which ended late Saturday in the Polish city of Katowice, agreed upon universal rules on how nations can cut emissions. Poor countries secured assurances on financial support to help them reduce emissions, adapt to changes such as rising sea levels and pay for damage that has already happened.

""Through this package, you have made a thousand little steps forward together,"" said Michal Kurtyka, a senior Polish official who led the talks.

French city honors victims of Christmas market attack

PARIS (AP) -- People filled a square in the French city of Strasbourg on Sunday to show respect and sympathy for the victims of last week's shooting attack near a famous Christmas market as the death toll rose to five.

French authorities said a Polish man died in a Strasbourg hospital Sunday, one of a dozen people wounded in last Tuesday's attack. Poland's Foreign Ministry extended condolences Sunday on Twitter to his family.

According to the newspaper DNA, more than 1,000 people attended the memorial, which ended with a minute of applause and a rendition of France's national anthem, ""La Marseillaise.""

The hour-long ceremony took place in Kleber Square, not far from where a gunman opened fire on Tuesday evening. Strasbourg Mayor Roland Ries praised the city's resilience in the face of hardship.

The ""extremely large crowd in the Christmas market"" on Saturday ""was an illustration of our commitment to these values ??on which our living together is based, which we will continue to defend against all those who want to attack it,"" Ries said.

Not into bingo, 84-year-old Texas woman gets college degree

RICHARDSON, Texas (AP) -- After raising five kids and retiring at age 77 from her secretarial job, Janet Fein couldn't be blamed for finally relaxing, but that's not her.

Fein, now 84, went to back to school and will accomplish a long-held goal this week when she graduates from the University of Texas at Dallas with a bachelor's degree.

""I didn't have anything to do in retirement and I didn't think that playing bingo was up to my speed,"" said Fein, who majored in sociology because she felt it was ""substantial.""

She said she enjoyed all the reading and writing papers. ""With each class I already knew a lot, but then I also learned a lot. And that made me happy,"" she said.

People 65 and older make up less than one percent of U.S. college students. In 2015, they accounted for about 67,000 of about 20 million college students, according to the National Center for Education Statistics.

Next-generation of GPS satellites are headed to space

DENVER (AP) -- After months of delays, the U.S. Air Force is about to launch the first of a new generation of GPS satellites, designed to be more accurate, secure and versatile.

But some of their most highly touted features will not be fully available until 2022 or later because of problems in a companion program to develop a new ground control system for the satellites, government auditors said.

The satellite is scheduled to lift off Tuesday from Cape Canaveral, Florida, aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. It's the first of 32 planned GPS III satellites that will replace older ones now in orbit. Lockheed Martin is building the new satellites outside Denver.

GPS is best-known for its widespread civilian applications, from navigation to time-stamping bank transactions. The Air Force estimates that 4 billion people worldwide use the system.

But it was developed by the U.S. military, which still designs, launches and operates the system. The Air Force controls a constellation of 31 GPS satellites from a high-security complex at Schriever Air Force Base outside Colorado Springs.

After fraud probe, new primary may replace GOP candidate

RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- Legislation quickly passed by North Carolina's lawmakers this week would prepare a path for Republicans to dump their nominee in a still-undecided U.S. House race marred with ballot fraud allegations.

""I think (legislators are) worried that Mark Harris might be damaged goods and they want to have the opportunity to have a different Republican nominee,"" said Carter Wrenn, a Republican operative and consultant to former U.S. Sen. Jesse Helms and others for more than 40 years. ""That's how I read those tea leaves.""

If the state elections board decides ballot irregularities or other problems cast the true outcome into doubt and force a redo, the legislation -- if allowed to go into law by Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper -- would require new primary elections in the 9th Congressional District race, in addition to a new general election.

That would allow Republicans another look at Mark Harris, the Republican who led Democrat Dan McCready by 905 votes in unofficial results. Harris hasn't been certified the winner, and an investigation is looking into missing absentee ballots in rural Bladen County and whether unsealed ballots illegally handled by collection teams there could have been altered.

Bladen was the only county among the eight within the 9th District where Harris won a majority of mail-in absentee ballots over McCready.

Top of mind: 'Justice' is Merriam-Webster's word of the year

NEW YORK (AP) -- Racial justice. Obstruction of justice. Social justice. The Justice Department. Merriam-Webster has chosen ""justice"" as its 2018 word of the year, driven by the churning news cycle over months and months.

The word follows ""toxic,"" picked by Oxford Dictionaries, and ""misinformation,"" plucked by Dictonary.com.

Peter Sokolowski, Merriam-Webster's editor at large, told The Associated Press ahead of Monday's announcement that ""justice"" consistently bubbled into the top 20 or 30 lookups on the company's website, spiking at times due to specific events but also skating close to the surface for much of the year.

While it's one of those common words people likely know how to spell and use correctly in a sentence, Sokolowski pointed to other reasons that drive search traffic. Among them is an attempt to focus a train of thought around a philosophical problem, or to seek aspirational motivation. Such well-known words are often among the most looked up every year, including those that are slightly abstract, including ""love,"" he said.

The designation for ""justice"" came soon after President Trump's one-time fixer, Michael Cohen, was sentenced to three years in prison for crimes that included arranging the payment of hush money to conceal his boss' alleged sexual affairs. He told a judge he agreed time and again to cover up Trump's ""dirty deeds"" out of ""blind loyalty.""

'Spider-Verse' swings to the top; 'Mortal Engines' tanks

LOS ANGELES (AP) -- ""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse"" swung to the top of the domestic box office in its first weekend in theaters, proving that there is widespread audience interest in big screen animated versions of Marvel's marquee superheroes.

The film led a host of newcomers that debuted to varying success on this pre-Christmas holiday weekend, including Clint Eastwood's drug smuggling drama ""The Mule"" and the Peter Jackson-produced epic ""Mortal Engines"" which bombed in North American theaters.

""Into the Spider-Verse"" earned an estimated $35.4 million from 3,813 theaters against a $90 million production budget according to Sony Pictures on Sunday, which is a record for animated movies in December (although the hybrid ""Alvin and the Chipmunks"" movies were higher). The film features an innovative animation style -- both CGI and hand-drawn -- and focuses on the Miles Morales character as he learns to become the famed web-slinger. It's another financial win for the studio's latest ""expanded Spider-Man universe"" strategy following ""Venom"" and ""Spider-Man: Homecoming.""

And ""Spider-Verse"" has been very well-received among critics, and audiences in exit surveys gave it a rare A+ CinemaScore -- a first for a Spider-Man film. It's also been nominated for a Golden Globe award for best animated feature and picked up a few honors from critics' groups as well, including the New York Film Critics Circle.

""We are playing to both families and fanboys. We're an all-audience film,"" said Adrian Smith, Sony's president of domestic distribution."
250,crooks and liars,https://crooksandliars.com/2018/12/heres-why-gofundme-stupid-wall-scam,"The promoter of the GoFundMe campaign to crowdfund Trump's wall is linked to right-wing propaganda sites and is promoting a scheme which cannot fund a wall now or ever.

Here's a thing that's really cool about living in this country: If a majority of us agree to spend money on a thing, we can collect money for that thing and then spend it. It's called taxation and appropriations, and the U.S. Constitution talks all about it, and assigns some responsibility to our elected officials to do that thing.

However, the United States Constitution does not have any provisions for ridiculous GoFundMe campaigns to pay for racist ridiculous walls, no matter how hard right-wing scammers may wish it to be so. So far, Brian Kolfage's ""We the People Will Fund The Wall"" scam campaign has raised over $10 million out of their $1 billion goal, thanks to some good old-fashioned amplification on Fox News and other right-wing outlets.

Leaving aside campaign founder Brian Kolfage's sketchy dance with Facebook propaganda pages for a minute, his whole pitch reveals just how big of a scam this GoFundMe campaign really is.

Here are Kolfage's claims on that GoFundMe page, followed by some facts:

The government has accepted large private donations before, most recently a billionaire donated $7.5 Million to fund half of the Washington Monument repairs in 2012; this is no different.

Au contraire. It is entirely different, as anyone simply reading the link he supplied would quickly see. When an earthquake damaged the Washington Monument, a billionaire did indeed step up and fund half the repair costs. This could be done because the Washington Monument, like the Lincoln Memorial and other Washington, D.C. landmarks, is a designated national park.

From the article:

Congress allocated $7.5 million in December on the condition that private donations would match that amount. The National Park Service and nonprofit Trust for the National Mall are expected to announce Rubenstein's gift Thursday morning. It will be the largest gift to the nonprofit group, which aims to raise $350 million to restore the mall's grounds and facilities.

Let's pay attention first to the sequence of events with this. First, Congress allocated some funds as they are supposed to do as part of their constitutional duties. They conditioned the expenditure of those funds on the contingency that private donors would match the same amount. Again, here's the sequence: Appropriation, then expenditure on an approved project subject to contingencies being met.

The gift itself was donated to a ""nonprofit Trust for the National Mall"" which exists to support a National Park.

Kolfage contends that putting out a large private hand which is not backed by a non-profit entity to pay for a structure which does not currently exist and which is certainly not supported by a long-standing nonprofit dedicated to supporting National Parks is exactly the same thing. Of course it isn't!

In fact, Kolfage would have a problem with the funds he's collecting, because the only constitutional entity authorized to spend public funds for an unnecessary wall to scratch a racist itch is -- say it with me, now -- CONGRESS.

And let's pretend for a minute that Congress said, okay, we'll allocate some money to a wall on the contigency that private funding matched it, and that somehow passed the soon-to-be very Democratic House of Representatives and garnered 60 votes in the Senate. There's still no non-profit vehicle in which to deposit those funds, and there is no non-profit vehicle connected to this GoFundMe campaign, which means that Kolfage cannot guarantee this:

How will we get the funds to the right place? We have contacted the Trump Administration to secure a point of contact where all the funds will go upon completion. When we get this information secured we will update. We have many very high level contacts already helping.

Anyone who would trust Donald Trump with their money is a fool, and giving money to a campaign that only promises to update when they've had discussions with their very high level contacts has promised absolutely nothing. But the Trump administration cannot accept the funds. Yes, they could be donated to the Treasury but they cannot be earmarked for specific expenditures because again, only Congress can appropriate funds to be spent, not racist people who think making America great again is scamming with right wing memes while harvesting email addresses and hefty donations from people.

Read that again and see if you can imagine Donald tweeting it. I certainly can. Vague, ""trust me"" statements from someone who isn't very trustworthy.

But just in case you weren't convinced, there's this:

Republican Representative Steven Palazzo of Mississippi is introducing legislation to direct the Treasury Department to issue government savings bonds which would allow us to fund the wall with this method. This is just one option, there are others on the table being discussed.

More BS. First of all, introducing legislation is not anything like passing it. Assuming there was such a bond issue, it would not happen for a very long time and does not need a man named Brian Kolfage to collect money via GoFundMe. Savings bonds are pretty simple devices: You loan the government small amounts of money and the government issues a note to pay off that money with interest in a set period of years. You don't need a third party to collect funds on a web site to do that.

We are working with a law firm on a legal document that will bind the government to using the funds for the border wall itself, nothing else.

That law firm will chew up a ton of that money to generate a pile of paper which, at the end of the day, will not change the fact that Congress has to appropriate money. Period. Not Joe Lawyer who wants to jack up some big fees for a thing that cannot be done that way.

We will hold all funds and not release a single penny until we have all legal aspects covered to ensure our money goes only to the wall.

Interest on $10 million is pretty hefty, dude. But really, you're never going to see any of that money. This is all astroturfy PR to encourage haters to hate harder, whether Mexico pays for the wall or not.

If we don't reach our goal or come significantly close we will refund every single penny. We are working on a time frame to achieve.

Again with the vague waves toward ethical behavior using unethical methods. Give it up.

In case you haven't figured it out yet, there is a goal, but it's not really about raising $1 billion for a wall. This is about harvesting email addresses, names, and potential donors to the Trump 2020 campaign. At the rate they're raising money, it'll be many years before they get to that magic number.

Now, about Brian Kolfage. Kolfage may be a veteran and a triple amputee, but he's also a self-promoting purveyor of hate and propaganda on Facebook. He might promote himself as a ""verified"" Facebook entity, but that doesn't mean anything beyond proof of identity and little more. Media Matters has an extensive report on him. Here's just a little of it.

Kolfage has been involved in Facebook networks linking to fake news sites before. In October, the social media company banned a network of other Facebook pages connected to his fake news site Right Wing News for ""coordinated inauthentic behavior.""

Since then, Kolfage appears to have coordinated with two blue badge-verified Facebook pages -- Conservative Post and American Joe -- and is using them in place of the removed pages to promote Right Wing News and now to promote his wall fundraising campaign.

About four days after Facebook removed the network of pages that funneled traffic to Right Wing News, the Conservative Post Facebook page (which has over 1.6 million page likes) began sporadically sharing links to Right Wing News' website, at the time found at rwnofficial.com. Before that, Conservative Post almost exclusively shared links to conservativepost.com.

There's much more. There's always more. The bottom line here is that this is just another right-wing scam to harvest data on gullible people, promoted by Laura Ingraham and other Fox ""News"" personalities. GoFundMe should end it before it does harm to their reputation."
251,financial post,https://business.financialpost.com/pmn/business-pmn/shutdown-suspends-federal-cleanups-at-us-superfund-sites,"BIRMINGHAM, Ala. -- The government shutdown has suspended federal cleanups at Superfund sites around the nation and forced the cancellation of public hearings, deepening the mistrust and resentment of surrounding residents who feel people in power long ago abandoned them to live among the toxic residue of the country's factories and mines.

""We are already hurting, and it's just adding more fuel to the fire,"" says 40-year-old Keisha Brown, whose wood-frame home is in a community nestled among coking plants and other factories on Birmingham's north side.

The mostly African-American community has been forced to cope with high levels of arsenic, lead and other contaminants in the soil that the Environmental Protection Agency has been scraping up and carting away, house by house.

As President Donald Trump and Congress battle over Trump's demand for a wall on the southern U.S. border, the nearly 3-week-old partial government shutdown has stopped federal work on Superfund sites except for cases where the administration deems ""there is an imminent threat to the safety of human life or to the protection of property.""

EPA's shutdown plans said the agency would evaluate about 800 Superfund sites to see how many could pose an immediate threat. As an example of that kind of threat, it cited an acid leak from a mine that could threaten the public water supply. That's the hazard at Northern California's Iron Mountain mine, where EPA workers help prevent an unending flow of lethally acidic runoff off the Superfund site from spilling into rivers downstream.

Practically speaking, said Bonnie Bellow, a former EPA official who worked on Superfund public outreach at the agency, the impact of the stoppage of work at sites across the nation ""wholly depends"" on the length of the shutdown.

""Unless there is immediate risk like a storm, a flood, a week or two of slowdowns is not going to very likely affect the cleanup at the site,"" Bellow said.

In north Birmingham, Brown said it's been a couple of weeks since she's spotted any EPA crews at people's houses. It wasn't clear if state workers or contractors were continuing work.

But long before the shutdown began, Brown harboured doubts the cleanup was working anyway. ""My main concern is the health of the people out here,"" said Brown, who has asthma. ""All of us are sick, and we've got to function on medicine every day.""

In terms of time, the federal government shutdown is a chronological blip in the long history of the site -- which includes ethics charges in a local bribery scandal to block federal cleanup efforts -- but adds to the uncertainty in an area where residents feel forgotten and betrayed.

At the EPA, the shutdown has furloughed the bulk of the agency's roughly 14,000 employees. It also means the EPA isn't getting most of the daily stream of environmental questions and tips from the public. Routine inspections aren't happening. State, local and private emails to EPA officials often get automated messages back promising a response when the shutdown ends.

In Montana, for instance, state officials this month found themselves fielding calls from a tribal member worried about drinking water with a funny look to it, said Kristi Ponozzo, public-policy director at that state's Department of Environmental Quality. The EPA normally provides tribes with technical assistance on water supplies.

With most EPA colleagues idled, Ponozzo said, her agency also had to call off an environmental review meeting for a mining project, potentially delaying the project.

But it's the agency's work at Superfund sites -- lessening the threat from old nuclear-weapons plants, chemical factories, mines and other entities -- that gets much of the attention.

Absent imminent peril, it would be up to state governments or contractors to continue any cleanup during the shutdown ""up to the point that additional EPA direction or funding is needed,"" the EPA said in a statement.

""Sites where cleanup activities have been stopped or shut down will be secured until cleanup activities are able to commence when the federal government reopens,"" the agency said.

For federal Superfund sites in Michigan, the shutdown means there are no EPA colleagues to consult, said Scott Dean, a spokesman for that state's Department of Environmental Quality.

At Michigan Superfund sites, day-to-day field operations were continuing since private contractors do most of the on-the-ground work, Dean said.

Bellow, the former EPA official, said the cancellation of hearings about Superfund sites posed immediate concerns.

In East Chicago, Indiana, for example, the EPA called off a planned public hearing set for last Wednesday to outline how the agency planned to clean up high levels of lead and arsenic in the soil.

The EPA has proposed a seven-month, $26.5 million cleanup that includes treating and removing tainted soil from the area, where a lead smelter previously was located.

During a public meeting Nov. 29, some residents complained that the EPA's approach would leave too much pollution in place. But others didn't get a chance to speak and were hoping to do so at the meeting this week, said Debbie Chizewer, a Northwestern University environmental attorney who represents community groups in the low-income area.

The EPA announced the cancellation in an online notice and gave no indication that it would be rescheduled.

Leaders of the East Chicago Calumet Community Advisory Group asked for a new hearing date and an extension of a Jan. 14 public comment deadline in a letter to the EPA's regional Superfund division.

Calls by The Associated Press to the agency's regional office in Chicago this week were not answered.

Local critics fear the EPA will use the delay caused by the shutdown as justification for pushing ahead with a cleanup strategy they consider flawed, Chizewer said, even though the agency has designated the affected area as an ""environmental justice community"" -- a low-income community of colour that has been disproportionately harmed by pollution.

The EPA has a ""special obligation"" when dealing with such communities, Chizewer said. ""This would be an example of shutting them out for no good reason.""

In North Birmingham, former longtime neighbourhood resident Charlie Powell said most of the people living in and around the Superfund site had already ""just got tired and fed up.""

Powell left the area but started a group called PANIC, People Against Neighborhood Industrial Contamination. He believes money would be better spent helping residents move away from the pollution.

""Can I say hell?"" Powell said when asked what residents have been through.

252,crooks and liars,https://crooksandliars.com/2018/12/cnn-host-slaps-down-lie-pelosis,"CNN's Kate Bolduan made Ben Ferguson admit Nancy Pelosi would be the next Speaker of the House, that she wasn't at risk, and that Democrats are united on their refusal to fund the wall.

Here's a sure-fire way to know when a right-wing pundit is spewing Trump's daily talking points badly. CNN host Kate Bolduan just had to tell Ben Ferguson he had no facts to back up what he was saying, and he backed down and admitted she was right.

What, you ask, was Ferguson going on about? He claimed, ""Nancy Pelosi does have the votes to become Speaker as long as she doesn't do a deal [on immigration] before they vote on her.""

This is the same line Mick Mulvaney spewed this morning, with a bit of a twist. Mulvaney said she didn't have the votes. She does. Ferguson knows she does, so he went on about how if she were to dare to do a deal ""some Democrats"" (whoever they are) wouldn't vote for her.

But it gets better, with Ferguson imagining that when Pelosi wins that squeaker of a vote (it won't be), everyone will come to the table, the heavens will open, and a choir of angels will sing the Hallelujah Chorus before Democrats fork over money for the wall.

Later in the segment, Ferguson tried again when Bolduan pinned him down on the ridiculous claim that Schumer wants a deal and Pelosi didn't. Instead of addressing her question about why they're talking about Pelosi and Schumer instead of the wall, Ferguson again resorted to the absurd theme o' the day.

why are they now making this about nancy pelosi and not about the wall? what does that tell you?

""I think you're talking about the government shutdown here,"" Ferguson answered. Actually, she was specifically asking about whether or not Trump is trying to drive a wedge between Pelosi and Schumer. Clearly Ben didn't have his listening ears on.

He continued, ""I don't think the Democrats in the House are willing to do anything until after she has secured the speakership, because if she does come together with a deal with Schumer, and I think Schumer is probably one of those that understands the optics of this long term, you want to get the government open, especially when Democrats take control of the house, pretty quickly, but she understands she wants to be the speaker.""

""And if she does a deal with Donald Trump, there are Democrats that will leave her and say this is exactly why we didn't want her to be Speaker -- she's already doing deals with Donald Trump,"" he added.

All of this is word salad right-wing talking points and they collapsed under Kate Bolduan's refusal to let him simply spew. She pointed out that this is not what is being reported at all, that Pelosi and Schumer are speaking with one voice, there is no daylight between them, at which point Ferguson deflated.

Here's what's wrong with this: First, the Senate has already passed a clean continuing resolution with no wall funding. It did not go to Trump's desk for signature because Paul Ryan is a coward who wouldn't bring it to the floor for a vote. After January 3rd, the House will pass a mirror of that resolution and send it back to the Senate where it will either receive a voice vote or else every Republican Senator up for election in 2020 who balks will be at risk of losing, and losing badly. At that point it will go to Donald Trump's desk, and he can choose to sign it or veto it.

And always, throughout all of this, it is the Trump shutdown which he owns today, yesterday, and tomorrow and forever. The beauty of this segment isn't the substance as much as it is the joy of watching Kate Bolduan shoot arrows in the talking points and watching them wilt like spinach in boiling water."
253,elite daily,https://www.elitedaily.com/p/can-you-crowdfund-the-border-wall-this-plan-is-kind-of-complicated-15553299,"It's been a couple of years since President Donald Trump set sail on his 2016 presidential campaign trail. While almost two years in the White House have gone by, he's still touting the idea of a border wall between U.S. and Mexico. Tensions are rising as the wall has become a sticking point in budget negotiations, with the president threatening a government shutdown if he doesn't get $5 billion for the wall, according to The Hill. But there might be another way to pay for it, with a citizen supporter of the wall setting up a GoFundMe to cover the costs. But that leaves a very important question: Can you crowdfund the border wall? This plan to foot the bill is kind of complicated.

On Dec. 16, Purple Heart veteran Brian Kolfage set up the GoFundMe to raise money for Trump's border wall, and as of Dec. 20, the campaign has brought in around $3.5 million from over 56,000 donations since its creation. ""If the 63 million people who voted for Trump each pledge $80, we can build the wall,"" Kolfage wrote on the page. ""That equates to roughly 5 Billion Dollars, [sic] even if we get half, that's half the wall. We can do this."" He also promised that if the campaign doesn't reach it $1 billion goal, then he will return all the money back to the donors. Kolfage did not immediately reply to Elite Daily's request for comment on the campaign. But, let's say if the bar is reached, can the government actually use that money to pay for the wall? The answer is -- kind of.

Truthfully, whether the administration can use the funds for the wall is a bit complicated. According to the Principles of Federal Appropriations Law, there's no mandate against private entities or individuals, such as those contributing to Kolfage's GoFundMe, from giving ""gifts"" directly into America's piggy bank -- or as it's more commonly known, the U.S. Treasury. In fact, there's even a form that tells you exactly how to donate to the government, and people actually use it. In the 2018 fiscal year, a total of $775,654 was donated and $2,611,428 in 2017, according to the Treasury website. That money goes into a general account to reduce the public debt, according to Slate, but does not give donors a say in how it's used. However, when talking about donating to a specific government agency or directing how the money is used, the rules get a little more complicated.

For the purposes of this border wall campaign, the agency to look at is the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). According to a DHS directive, the department may accept conditional gifts, meaning gifts that are given for an exact purpose, as long as it doesn't ""interfere with the work of DHS"" or is ""inconsistent with applicable laws or regulations,"" otherwise it has to be reviewed by the Office of the General Counsel. The directive also adds that the department can accept gifts to ""carry out program functions regardless of whether or not appropriated funds are available for that purpose,"" as long as it's allowed under law. Trump asked for $5 billion in funding earlier this month for his security proposal which includes building the wall, according to The New York Times. Judging by the directive, it would seem that even if Trump doesn't get the funds he wants, the DHS could use the crowdfunded money. Elite Daily has reached out to GoFundMe for comment on their platform being used to raise money for the wall, but did not immediately hear back.

Additionally, if it happens that the government cannot accept money to build the wall specifically, there may be a way around it. According to the Terms of Service on Kolfage's GoFundMe page, Rep. Steven Palazzo (R-MS) is working on legislation that would allow the Treasury Department to issue revenue bonds to allow people to fund the wall using the crowdfunding method. Per Palazzo, precedent for this was set during World War II when ""Americans purchased $185 billion in war bonds and financially supported our troops,"" he explained to WLOX on Dec. 17. He believes his Border Bonds Act of 2018 will allow ""patriots of today's era to help support American security.""

Kolfage also assures donors that they are working to ""secure a point of contact"" within the Trump Administration to make sure the money goes where it's supposed to. But, the GoFundMe page doesn't actually confirm that such a person has been found and secured just yet. Elite Daily reached out to the White House for comment on wether they've been in contact with Kolfage, but did not immediately hear back.

The truth is, the legality of crowdfunding the wall is complicated at best, but it looks like there might be a road from the donors to the wall -- albeit a winding one."
254,crooks and liars,https://crooksandliars.com/2019/01/trump-escalates-gop-war-government-workers,"Trump seeks to punish public sector unions and demonize government.

As the New Year begins, imagine that this is how your 2018 ended. You work at a company where the CEO and the management team are notoriously corrupt. They began the year by taking on a $150 million in new debt for the purpose of rewarding themselves and their shareholders with a massive stock buyback. But as the holidays approached, the big boss declares about a third of all the workers will be furloughed or required to work without pay. Then--just in time for Christmas -- the CEO announces the 2 percent raise planned for 2019 will be cancelled. The company, he complains, can't afford the $25 million-dollar cost.

As it turns out, that hypothetical is actually real. Just multiply the dollar figures by 1,000 and replace ""CEO"" with ""President Donald Trump."" The result is the ""happy holidays"" experienced by the 2.2 million employees of the federal government.

Of course, this was no surprise attack on the Americans who do the work of the people's government. The Republican war on the 22.3 million public sector employees of federal, state and local governments has been underway for years. And the twin goals of that GOP assault -- to demonize government itself while fatally wounding the last bastion of American union power--have never changed.

The context for the current GOP punishment of public sector workers is Trump's unnecessary government shutdown. (Unnecessary, that is, because the Senate passed a bill featuring $1.3 billion in border security funding with Trump's blessing on the Wednesday before Christmas, only to have Trump change his mind within 24 hours. And a year ago, Trump and Democratic Minority Leader Chuck Schumer agreed to a deal funding the President's border wall in exchange for a resolution of the fate of the 800,000 ""Dreamers."" Chief of staff John Kelly then blew up the deal.) Of the nation's 2.2 million civilian workers (excluding 600,000 in the postal service), some 340,000 federal employees have now been furloughed, while an additional 500,000 are now working without pay.

The GOP's best and brightest greeted those numbers by essentially telling America's public servants to drop dead.

When a reporter asked about Transportation Security Administration and Border Patrol agents who would be required to continue working on Christmas without getting a paycheck, Rep. Mark Meadows (R-NC) responded, ""It's actually part of what you do when you sign up for any public service position."" Congressman Scott Perry (R-PA) took the derision up a notch, sneering:

""Who's living that they're not going to make it to the next paycheck?""

As it turns out, a lot of federal employees, like the rest of the American workforce, live paycheck-to-paychecks. Just weeks after being warned not to discuss Trump ""resistance"" at work, many federal employees began sharing their #ShutdownStories of the hardships they now endure:

Many declined to identify themselves publicly, so their stories could not be confirmed. Yet their tales of hardship spread widely. One man said he became homeless; he broke his lease in anticipation of moving to another state to train for a new federal job -- and the training was canceled. Another described having to terminate a family member's caregiver as funds dwindled. Several talked of forgoing or returning Christmas gifts.

That talk isn't merely anecdotal. A survey of 1,500 union members in December found that ""about 85 percent said they have limited holiday season spending or are planning to do so because of uncertainty about income.""

Unable to dispatch billions of dollars to build the border wall his base demands, Donald Trump instead dispatched a flurry of baseless talking points. On Christmas Day, the occupant of the Oval Office addressed those hundreds of thousands of federal employees going without pay:

""Many of those workers have said to me, communicated, 'stay out until you get the funding for the wall.'""

Two days after providing no evidence for that bogus claim, President Trump took to Twitter to deliver another one:

Do the Dems realize that most of the people not getting paid are Democrats?

As usual, Trump was wrong. It's not just that Washington DC, Maryland and Northern Virginia do not account for all federal workers. Hundreds of thousands (roughly 80 percent) are distributed around the country and not just in the biggest states like California, Texas and New York. As a percentage of their state workforces, some of the reddest states have the highest shares of Uncle Sam's employees. Just as important, many of the metro areas in which federal salaries make up the biggest slices of all civilian employee earnings are in places like New Bern, North Carolina, Warner Robbins, Georgia and Huntsville, Alabama.

But just as important as Virginia Democratic Senator Mark Warner's larger point that ""federal employees don't go to work wearing red or blue jerseys; they're public servants"" is this: the workers themselves debunked Trump's ridiculous sound bite. As Government Executive reported on December 27:

In a 2016 Government Executive survey, 28 percent of federal employees identified themselves as Democrats, and 26 percent said they were Republicans. But an even greater percentage, 35 percent, identified as independents. And of those in the last category, 42 percent said they leaned Republican, while only 31 percent said they leaned Democratic.

On New Year's Eve, a new survey from Government Exec found that ""Federal Employees Overwhelmingly Oppose Shutdown, Only 30 Percent Support Wall.""

About 71 percent of federal workers oppose the shutdown -- which crawled into its 10th day on Monday -- according to a new survey by Government Business Council and GovExec.com, while 22 percent support it. Nine in 10 of those supporting the shutdown do so because they support Trump's fight for wall funding, though a small handful feel so opposed to the wall that they want agencies to close in order to block the wall from being built.

With even 35 percent of those federal workers who support building the southern border wall opposing the shutdown as a tactic to secure it, it's no wonder one of the largest federal employee unions filed a lawsuit to halt the Trump administration's work-without-pay policy. The president of the American Federation of Government Employees, which represents border patrol and TSA agents among other workers, explained:

""Our members put their lives on the line to keep our country safe. Requiring them to work without pay is nothing short of inhumane.""

But Trump's message never had anything to do with his fidelity to the truth, but to his hardline supporters. And by marking federal employees as ""Democrats,"" the President of the United States was signaling the MAGA crowd that public servants, like immigrants, minorities and Muslims, were a target for their scorn.

Consider the juxtaposition of Donald Trump's statements to military and civilian workers just days apart. On December 26, Trump lied to cheering American servicemen and women in Iraq about the supposedly massive 10 percent pay raise he had secured for them:

""You just got one of the biggest pay raises you've ever received ... You haven't gotten one in more than 10 years -- more than 10 years. And we got you a big one. I got you a big one. I got you a big one.""

But while 1.3 million military personnel did receive a 2.6 percent pay raise, on December 29 informed civilian workers they would be getting none at all for the third time since 2010. The executive order confirmed Trump's warnings from February and August 2018 that he would oppose the planned 2.1 percent increase and $25 billion in adjustments for ""locality pay."" When the White House is boasting of rising wages and claiming (wrongly) that ""we have the best economy we've ever had, in the history of our country,"" just why would Donald Trump feel this move is necessary?

We must maintain efforts to put our Nation on a fiscally sustainable course, and Federal agency budgets cannot sustain such increases...

The cost of employing the Federal workforce is significant. In light of our Nation's fiscal situation, Federal employee pay must be performance-based, and aligned strategically toward recruiting, retaining, and rewarding high-performing Federal employees and those with critical skill sets. Across-the-board pay increases and locality pay increases, in particular, have long-term fixed costs, yet fail to address existing pay disparities or target mission critical recruitment and retention goals.

As President Richard Thissen of National Active and Retired Federal Employees Association (NARFE) put it last year,

""This budget singles out federal workers by implementing a pay freeze, which is perplexing given the president's continual praise of the strong economy and rising wage growth. Denying a modest pay raise during a time of economic prosperity demonstrates disdain for federal workers and needlessly punishes middle-class households.""

Disdain, indeed. After all, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) reported that in fiscal year 2016 federal spending on total civilian employee compensation was $215 billion. Even if that figure was now, say, $250 billion, a two percent increase would only add $5 billion to Uncle Sam's $4.4 trillion budget. Adding in the estimated $25 billion for regional ""locality"" adjustments for higher cost of living areas around the country and the total tab is additional spending is around $30 billion. And that's a drop in the bucket compared to the GOP's Tax Cuts and Job Act which starting in 2018 will drain an estimated $1.5 trillion from the United States Treasury over the next decade. And that tax cut windfall for the wealthy will deliver the vast majority of its benefits to the most affluent people in the United States.

And to be sure, federal employees are not among those most affluent people. Last April, the Federal Salary Council found ""federal employee salaries on average lag behind those of similar private-sector workers by just under 32 percent."" As the Washington Post explained:

The council, consisting of unions representing federal employees and nongovernmental pay experts, oversees the pay system for most white-collar employees below the executive level, the General Schedule. Under a 1990 law, its findings are passed to a higher-level body of administration officials, who in turn make recommendations to the White House for specific raises for 44 city zones and a single figure for all areas outside those zones.

Now, these conclusions are hotly contested. In its 2017 analysis, the Post noted, ""t Congressional Budget Office concluded that federal employees overall earn 3 percent more on average but that there are large differences by educational level: from a 34 percent advantage for federal workers with a high school education or less to a 24 percent shortfall for those with a professional degree or doctorate."" (These comparisons include total compensation combining both salary and benefits.) Unsurprisingly, conservative groups find the reverse of the Federal Salary Council, and then claim government workers far out-earn their private sector counterparts.

And that's no surprise because Republicans have been trying to crush federal employees and their unions for years.

Consider the run up to the 2012 presidential election. In the fall of 2010, Jonathan Cohn explained in The New Republic ""Why Public Employees are the New Welfare Queens."" Rush Limbaugh claimed that public sector employees are ""freeloaders"" and then-Indiana Governor and GOP White House hopeful Mitch Daniels lamented that they are a ""new privileged class in America."" By early 2011, Sarah Palin was denouncing ""unionized public employees [who] are making more money, receiving more generous benefits, and enjoying greater job security than the working families forced to pay for it with ever-higher taxes, deficits and debt."" Minnesota Governor and soon-to-be failed Republican presidential candidate Tim Pawlenty wrote a Wall Street Journal op-ed titled, ""Government Unions vs. Taxpayers"" in which he claimed:

The rise of government unions has been like a silent coup, an inside job engineered by self-interested politicians and fueled by campaign contributions.

""You have public employees making more than their private-sector counterparts,"" Pawlenty charged on Fox News, ""They used to be under-benefited and underpaid. Now they're both over-benefited and overpaid...it needs to stop.""

Now, none of this was true. While there may have been some dispute about the extent of the gap between federal workers and their private sector counterparts, the data on state and local government was overwhelming. Public employees, especially in the South, were under-compensated relative to their private sector analogs at every level of income and educational attainment. Nevertheless, the Republican war on government workers and their unions took on other forms. Consider, for example, the ""2 to 1"" federal employee advantage sound bite then dominating the U.S media:

""The average federal employee makes $120,000 a year. The average private employee makes $60,000 a year."" (Rand Paul)

""It's gotten to a point where the average federal worker makes twice as much as the average private sector worker."" (John Boehner)

""Federal employees receive an average of $123,049 annually in pay and benefits, twice the average of the private sector."" (Tim Pawlenty)

But as with state and local governments, this line of attack is an apples-to-oranges comparison at best and an outright deception at worst. As FactCheck pointed out:

The analysis is based on data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis and crudely done by dividing total compensation (salary and benefits) by the number of current federal civilian employees. Comparing such averages is quite misleading, for two reasons:

First, BEA says the figure is inflated by including compensation that is actually paid to benefit retirees, not just for current workers. The figure is at least several thousand dollars too high, by our calculations.

Second, the average federal civilian worker is better educated, more experienced and more likely to have management or professional responsibilities than the average private worker.

Mitt Romney, the eventual 2012 GOP nominee, got into the act as well. Regurgitating talking points from the right-wing Heritage Foundation and the Cato Institute, Romney declared that ""average government workers are now making $30,000 a year more than the average private-sector worker."" And in the plan to cut federal spending he unveiled last week, Romney took aim at Uncle Sam's workforce:

Align Federal Employee Compensation With The Private Sector -- Savings: $47 Billion. Federal compensation exceeds private sector levels by as much as 30 to 40 percent when benefits are taken into account. This must be corrected.

In September 2011, Romney proclaimed himself a both a champion and a member of the middle class when he said he sought to help ""the great middle class -- the 80 to 90 percent of us in this country."" That November, just days after the Bureau of Labor Statistics found that federal employees made 26 percent less than those comparable workers in the private sector, the $250 million man protested:

""The taxpayers shouldn't have to have money taken out of their pay checks to pay people in government who are our servants who are making a lot more money than we are.""

Of course, it wasn't true then and it's not true now. But what is true is that the federal civilian employees have received pay hikes less than or equal to American military personnel every year this century. Thanks to Congressional Republicans, General Schedule workers got no raises for 2011, 2012 and 2013. Since 2010, federal pay increases exceeded the inflation rate in only three years.

But what is true is that while private sector union membership and political power has plummeted, public sector unions like AFSCME, SEIU, NEA and others combined still represent 34.4 percent of government workers. It is their remaining political power, usually deployed on behalf of Democratic candidates and progressive causes, that Republicans like Donald Trump, Scott Walker and John Kasich have sought to crush. In executive orders, legislatures, state ballot measures and in state and federal courthouses, the GOP has worked without let up to limit the ability of public sector unions to retain members and collect dues. The goal is to leave the last redoubt of union power broken and broke, no match for the unlimited resources for corporate power.

For their part, Democrats are hoping to restore raises for federal workers in 2019 as part of their proposal to fund the government for the rest of the fiscal year. While the House did not address the issue of the recommended 2 percent hike last year, the Senate agreed to a 1.9 percent boost, though it never came to the floor for a vote. But with his announce freezes on federal hiring and pay, Donald Trump wants to kick two million federal workers while they are down. Or more accurately, shut down. For his 150,000 members across 33 federal agencies and departments, Tony Reardon of the National Treasury Employees Union said, Trump's freeze is a ""slap in the face.""

It's actually much worse than that. Trump and his Republican allies want it to be another nail in the coffin for unions."
255,the star,https://www.the-star.co.ke/news/2019/01/03/nancy-pelosi-the-comeback-of-americas-powerful-woman_c1872322,"When Nancy Pelosi is sworn in as Speaker of the House on Thursday, she becomes not just the third most powerful US politician but also the leader of the Trump opposition.

Both loved and loathed, her comeback story is an extraordinary tale of political survival.

After eight years in the political wilderness, Nancy Pelosi is back on top.

In 2007, the California Democrat made history as the first female speaker of the US House of Representatives, but it was short-lived.

This time, she's at the helm of a resurgent party with responsibility for initiating new laws through the lower chamber of Congress, not to mention guiding a slew of new investigations into the president.

And she's done so despite being written off multiple times and labelled a pedestrian public speaker prone to the occasional gaffe, having high disapproval ratings and becoming a lightning rod for Republicans.

Tying her name to embattled Democratic candidates had been an effective weapon for conservatives in the past but in the 2018 mid-term elections, it lost its punch.

In Virginia, for example, Republican incumbent David Brat mentioned Nancy Pelosi and her ""liberal agenda"" 21 times in an hour and a half at a debate.

His Democratic opponent, Abigail Spanberger, finally shot back: ""I question again whether Congressman Brat knows which Democrat in fact he's running against... My name is Abigail Spanberger.""

She went on to win the district, one of 40 Democrats who captured Republican-held seats, giving the Democrats their largest surge in the House since the 1970s Watergate scandal.

Now, with her return to the speaker's chair, Pelosi again becomes the most powerful woman in US politics.

It caps a remarkable journey for someone who grew up the youngest child in a family steeped in East Coast big-city politics, made a political name for herself in the most liberal corners of California and has dominated Democratic politics for nearly a decade and a half.

""People have gone wrong by under-estimating her for years,"" says journalist Elaine Povich, who wrote a 2008 biography about Pelosi. ""Never bet against her. She's consistently the hardest worker, the best organized and great vote counter.""

These skills are going to be sorely tested in the days ahead, as the incoming speaker will have to balance the competing priorities of her Democratic caucus while facing incoming flames from the political Vesuvius that is Donald Trump.

The public had a taste of such confrontations in December, when the two argued in the Oval Office about border wall funding. She emerged from that duel with Democrats singing her praises but for many on the left such fireworks should only be the beginning.

They will be clamouring for aggressive oversight of the president while others want a legislative record that Democrats can run on.

It's a recipe for intra-party conflict and indicates the treacherous path ahead for her to navigate.

Although Republicans have typically painted Pelosi as a ""San Francisco liberal"" enamoured with big government and far to the left on social issues, her roots are from a more practical style of politics on the other side of the continent.

She grew up in a political family, one of seven children in the gritty East Coast city of Baltimore, Maryland, where her father - Thomas ""Big Tommy"" D'Alesandro Jr - was mayor. She was the youngest and the only girl.

To be a politician in mid-century Baltimore meant succeeding at old-school Democratic machine politics. Keeping track of favours received and favours given. Knowing whom to help and whom to hurt - and how to do both. Pelosi managed her family's political accounts, including answering the eight phone lines that connected to the house.

She went to college in nearby Washington where she met and eventually married financier Paul Pelosi. They first moved to Manhattan, and then San Francisco, where Pelosi started as a housewife. She had five children - four daughters and a son - in the space of six years.

In 1976 she became involved in politics, using her old family connections to help then-California Governor Jerry Brown, running for president, win the Maryland primary.

She then rose through the state's Democratic Party ranks, eventually becoming its chair. In 1988 - at the urging of the outgoing Democrat - she ran for a seat in Congress and won.

In the House she worked her way up again. Because she represented a portion of the city with a large gay community, she made increasing Aids research funding a priority. She fought a multi-year bureaucratic battle to have a shuttered military base in San Francisco turned into a national park.

In 2001, she ran against Maryland's Steny Hoyer - whom she once interned with back in Washington - for House minority whip, vote-counter and second in command of the caucus, and won a narrow victory. The next year she moved up to minority leader after Dick Gephardt of Missouri resigned.

She was one of the highest-profile, most outspoken opponents of the US invasion of Iraq in 2003, and in 2005 successfully helped block President George W Bush's call for partial privatisation of the government-run Social Security retirement programme.

When the Democrats won the majority in 2006 for the first time in 12 years, her legislative acumen had been established and her stand on the war - at least in the minds of Democrats - was vindicated. She became the clear choice for Speaker of the House and was elected by her party in a unanimous vote.

In January 2007 the Californian made history as the first female speaker of the US House of Representatives.

But four years later, Democrats lost control of the lower chamber of Congress.

Despite the setback Pelosi kept her head above the turbulent political waters, riding out a series of electoral defeats and beating back challenges within her own ranks, to take the gavel once more.

Speaker of the House is the one congressional job detailed in the US Constitution. It is second in line for the presidency, behind only the vice-president, although such an ascent would require an unlikely set of circumstances in which both offices were vacated.

Its massive office, in the Capitol rotunda, reflects the prestige of the job, with its own balcony looking out toward the Washington Monument.

Unlike the Senate, the majority party in the House - led by the speaker - has virtually unfettered control over the legislative process.

The speaker and her deputies and committee chairs determine what bills are considered and voted on. They set the agenda and decide the rules governing debate. If a speaker can keep her majority in line - and Republicans over the last two years showed that is far from a certainty - the legislative process in the House can purr like a well-tuned machine.

That was the case the last time Pelosi's was speaker.

From 2009 to 2011, when Democrats had unified control of Congress and the White House, her chamber enacted an $840bn stimulus package in the aftermath of the 2008 economic collapse. She passed pro-union and cap-and-trade climate legislation (which never made it past the Senate and into law) and financial reform and a bill prohibiting gender discrimination in pay (which did).

She also pushed hard to get the Affordable Care Act, which became the defining battle of the Barack Obama presidency, through the House and on to the president's desk.

Trump wasn't all that wrong to suggest that Pelosi was feeling some heat from members of her own party.

During the mid-term elections, more than 60 Democratic candidates campaigned on a pledge to oppose her speakership bid. After their mid-term success, a group of 16 incoming House Democrats issued a letter calling on new party leadership. They suggested it was time for the 78-year-old Pelosi to hand over power to a new generation.

In the ensuing weeks, however, the California Democrat went about slowly dismantling the rebellion. She peeled off some of the letter's signatories and sympathisers with promises of plum committee seats or prioritising their issues.

Then came her White House showdown, which set Democrats buzzing and launched a thousand complimentary memes on social media.

A day later Pelosi all but secured her speakership with her biggest concession - agreeing to eight-year term limits for members of the House Democratic leadership, applied retroactively.

""Over the summer, I made it clear that I see myself as a bridge to the next generation of leaders, a recognition of my continuing responsibility to mentor and advance new members into positions of power and responsibility in the House Democratic Caucus,"" she said.

Pelosi is a woman in a party that has swept to power in large part due to the engagement and support of women. Fifty-eight percent of those who voted for Democrats in the House were women. There will be 89 women out of the 235 Democratic members of Congress.

That's a far cry from when Pelosi first entered Congress in 1988, when she was one of only 24 women in the entire 435-seat chamber."
256,the columbian,http://www.columbian.com/news/2019/jan/13/graham-urging-trump-to-reopen-government-for-a-few-weeks/,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Republican lawmaker advising President Donald Trump said he is encouraging the president to reopen the government for several weeks to continue negotiating with Democrats over funding for a U.S.-Mexico border wall before the president takes the more drastic step of declaring a national emergency.

But that may be wishful thinking, given that Sen. Lindsey Graham also says Trump still wants to reach a deal for the wall before agreeing to reopen shuttered government departments. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a leading Democratic negotiator, insists that Trump reopen the government first.

The weeks-old standoff over funding led to the partial government shutdown that hit day 23 on Sunday without an end in sight.

""Before he pulls the plug on the legislative option, and I think we're almost there, I would urge him to open up the government for a short period of time, like three weeks, before he pulls the plug, see if we can get a deal,"" said Graham, a South Carolina Republican. ""If we can't at the end of three weeks, all bets are off.""

""See if he can do it by himself through the emergency powers. That's my recommendation,"" added Graham, who has publicly pushed Trump to use his authority to declare a national emergency to build the wall. Such a step would allow Trump to bypass Congress and tap various pots of unspent federal money, including for military construction and disaster relief and from asset seized by law enforcement, to pay for the wall.

Trump has kept Washington on edge over whether he would resort to such a declaration, citing what he says is a ""crisis"" of drug smuggling and the trafficking of women and children at the border. The president initially sounded as though such a move was imminent, but then pulled back. He has said several times since he first mentioned the idea in public earlier this month that he prefers to try to reach a deal with Congress.

A key question is how much more time is Trump willing to give lawmakers. Graham, who said he and Trump talked by telephone on Sunday morning, said the legislative path ""is just about shut off"" and blamed Pelosi.

The speaker's office had no immediate comment.

Democrats oppose an emergency declaration but may be powerless to block it. Some Republicans are wary, too, fearing how a future Democratic president might use that authority. Such a move, should Trump ultimately go that route, would almost certainly be challenged in the courts.

Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., called Graham's idea to reopen the government a ""great place to start.""

""I do think if we reopen the government, if the president ends this shutdown crisis, we have folks who can negotiate a responsible, modern investment in technology that will actually make us safer,"" Coons said.

Trump has maintained that the border cannot be secured without a wall.

Graham said he thinks Trump is willing to accept the $5.7 billion he has insisted on for the wall, along with some immigration measures Democrats might find acceptable, such as helping immigrants who were illegally brought to the U.S. as children.

Trump has expressed interest in a broader immigration overhaul, but says he first wants the Supreme Court to address the class of immigrants known as ""Dreamers."" Pelosi also has shown no interest in accepting a wall -- she has called it an ""immorality"" -- in exchange for immigration fixes.

And, Trump, who was holed up in the White House as snow blanketed Washington on Sunday, appeared to shoot down Graham's suggestion of a ""wall plus"" deal, saying on Twitter that even Democrats don't want to make ""Dreamers"" part of the negotiations.

""The damage done to our Country from a badly broken Border - Drugs, Crime and so much that is bad - is far greater than a Shutdown, which the Dems can easily fix as soon as they come back to Washington!"" Trump said in a separate tweet.

The White House has been laying the groundwork for an emergency declaration, feared by members of both parties.

Senate Homeland Security Committee Chairman Ron Johnson, R-Wis., said he would ""hate to see"" a declaration because then the wall wouldn't get built, presumably because of legal challenges. Democrats voted in the past for border security and should again, he said.

""I actually want to see this wall get built,"" Johnson said. ""I want to keep pressure on Democrats to actually come to the negotiating table in good faith and fund what they have supported in the past.""

But Graham, who favors a presidential declaration, said the time for talk is running out.

""It's the last option, not the first option, but we're pretty close to that being the only option,"" he said.

Graham and Coons spoke on ""Fox News Sunday."" Johnson appeared on CNN's ""State of the Union."""
257,the columbian,http://www.columbian.com/news/2019/jan/11/federal-work-at-superfund-sites-suspended-during-shutdown/,"BIRMINGHAM, Ala. -- The government shutdown has suspended federal cleanups at Superfund sites around the nation and forced the cancellation of public hearings, deepening the mistrust and resentment of surrounding residents who feel people in power long ago abandoned them to live among the toxic residue of the country's factories and mines.

""We are already hurting, and it's just adding more fuel to the fire,"" says 40-year-old Keisha Brown, whose wood-frame home is in a community nestled among coking plants and other factories on Birmingham's north side.

The mostly African-American community has been forced to cope with high levels of arsenic, lead and other contaminants in the soil that the Environmental Protection Agency has been scraping up and carting away, house by house.

As President Donald Trump and Congress battle over Trump's demand for a wall on the southern U.S. border, the 3-week-old partial government shutdown has stopped federal work on Superfund sites except for cases where the administration deems ""there is an imminent threat to the safety of human life or to the protection of property.""

EPA's shutdown plans said the agency would evaluate about 800 Superfund sites to see how many could pose an immediate threat. As an example of that kind of threat, it cited an acid leak from a mine that could threaten the public water supply. That's the hazard at Northern California's Iron Mountain mine, where EPA workers help prevent an unending flow of lethally acidic runoff off the Superfund site from spilling into rivers downstream.

Practically speaking, said Bonnie Bellow, a former EPA official who worked on Superfund public outreach at the agency, the impact of the stoppage of work at sites across the nation ""wholly depends"" on the length of the shutdown.

""Unless there is immediate risk like a storm, a flood, a week or two of slowdowns is not going to very likely affect the cleanup at the site,"" Bellow said.

In north Birmingham, Brown said it's been a couple of weeks since she's spotted any EPA crews at people's houses. It was unclear if state workers or contractors were continuing work.

But long before the shutdown began, Brown harbored doubts the cleanup was working anyway.

""My main concern is the health of the people out here,"" said Brown, who has asthma. ""All of us are sick, and we've got to function on medicine every day.""

In terms of time, the federal government shutdown is a chronological blip in the long history of the site -- which includes ethics charges in a local bribery scandal to block federal cleanup efforts -- but adds to the uncertainty in an area where residents feel forgotten and betrayed.

At the EPA, the shutdown has furloughed the bulk of the agency's roughly 14,000 employees. It also means the EPA isn't getting most of the daily stream of environmental questions and tips from the public. Routine inspections aren't happening. State, local and private emails to EPA officials often get automated messages back promising a response when the shutdown ends.

In Montana, for instance, state officials this month found themselves fielding calls from a tribal member worried about drinking water with a funny look to it, said Kristi Ponozzo, public-policy director at that state's Department of Environmental Quality. The EPA normally provides tribes with technical assistance on water supplies.

With most EPA colleagues idled, Ponozzo said, her agency also had to call off an environmental review meeting for a mining project, potentially delaying the project.

But it's the agency's work at Superfund sites -- lessening the threat from old nuclear-weapons plants, chemical factories, mines and other entities -- that gets much of the attention.

Absent imminent peril, it would be up to state governments or contractors to continue any cleanup during the shutdown ""up to the point that additional EPA direction or funding is needed,"" the EPA said in a statement.

""Sites where cleanup activities have been stopped or shut down will be secured until cleanup activities are able to commence when the federal government reopens,"" the agency said.

For federal Superfund sites in Michigan, the shutdown means there are no EPA colleagues to consult, said Scott Dean, a spokesman for that state's Department of Environmental Quality.

At Michigan Superfund sites, day-to-day field operations were continuing since private contractors do most of the on-the-ground work, Dean said.

Bellow, the former EPA official, said the cancellation of hearings about Superfund sites posed immediate concerns.

In East Chicago, Indiana, for example, the EPA called off a planned public hearing set for last Wednesday to outline how the agency planned to clean up high levels of lead and arsenic in the soil.

The EPA has proposed a seven-month, $26.5 million cleanup that includes treating and removing tainted soil from the area, where a lead smelter was located.

During a public meeting Nov. 29, some residents complained that the EPA's approach would leave too much pollution in place. But others didn't get a chance to speak and were hoping to do so at the meeting this week, said Debbie Chizewer, a Northwestern University environmental attorney who represents community groups in the low-income area.

The EPA announced the cancellation in an online notice and gave no indication that it would be rescheduled.

Leaders of the East Chicago Calumet Community Advisory Group asked for a new hearing date and an extension of a Jan. 14 public comment deadline in a letter to the EPA's regional Superfund division.

Calls by The Associated Press to the agency's regional office in Chicago this week were not answered.

Local critics fear the EPA will use the delay caused by the shutdown as justification for pushing ahead with a cleanup strategy they consider flawed, Chizewer said, even though the agency has designated the affected area as an ""environmental justice community,"" a low-income community of color that has been disproportionately harmed by pollution.

The EPA has a ""special obligation"" when dealing with such communities, Chizewer said. ""This would be an example of shutting them out for no good reason.""

In North Birmingham, former longtime neighborhood resident Charlie Powell said most of the people living in and around the Superfund site had already ""just got tired and fed up.""

Powell left the area but started a group called PANIC, People Against Neighborhood Industrial Contamination. He said he believes money would be better spent helping residents move away from the pollution.

""Can I say hell?"" Powell said when asked what residents have been through."
258,the charlotte observer,https://www.charlotteobserver.com/news/nation-world/national/article223193915.html,"White House digs in on border wall demand, risking shutdown

WASHINGTON (AP) -- The White House on Sunday pushed the federal government closer to the brink of a partial shutdown later this week, digging in on its demand for $5 billion to build a border wall as congressional Democrats stood firm against it.

""We're going to do whatever is necessary to build the border wall to stop this ongoing crisis of illegal immigration,"" said White House senior adviser Stephen Miller.

Asked if that meant having a government shutdown, he said: ""If it comes to it, absolutely.""

Trump said last week he would be ""proud"" to have a shutdown to get Congress to approve a $5 billion down payment to fulfill his campaign promise to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. But the president doesn't have the votes from the Republican-controlled Congress to support funding for the wall at that level.

Democratic congressional leaders, Sen. Chuck Schumer and Rep. Nancy Pelosi, have proposed no more than $1.6 billion, as outlined in a bipartisan Senate bill. The money would not go for the wall but for fencing upgrades and other border security. Democrats also offered to simply keep funding at its current level, $1.3 billion.

Trump lawyer Giuliani rules out Mueller interview with Trump

WASHINGTON (AP) -- With a number of probes moving closer to the Oval Office, President Donald Trump and his attorney unleashed a fresh series of attacks on the investigators, questioning their integrity while categorically ruling out the possibility of a presidential interview with the special counsel.

Trump and Rudy Giuliani used Twitter and television interviews Sunday to deliver a series of broadsides against special counsel Robert Mueller and federal prosecutors in New York. Giuliani said he was ""disgusted"" by the tactics used by Mueller in his probe into Russian election interference, including in securing guilty pleas from the president's former national security adviser Michael Flynn on a charge of lying to federal investigators.

Trump, Giuliani said, would not submit to an interview by Mueller's team.

""They're a joke,"" Giuliani told ""Fox News Sunday."" ''Over my dead body, but, you know, I could be dead.""

The special counsel, who is investigating possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russia, has continued to request an interview with the president. Last month, the White House sent written answers in response to the special counsel's questions about possible collusion. The White House has resisted answering questions on possible obstruction of justice.

Child's death highlights communication barriers on border

Shortly before a 7-year-old Guatemalan girl died in U.S. custody, her father signed a form stating that his daughter was in good health. But it's unclear how much the man understood on the form, which was written in English and read to him in Spanish by Border Patrol agents.

The death of Jakelin Caal highlights the communication challenges along the U.S.-Mexico border as agents come in contact with an increasing number of migrants who speak neither English nor Spanish.

Her father's native language is the Mayan tongue known as Q'eqchi'. His second language is Spanish. It's unclear whether something was lost in translation or whether it would have made a difference in saving Jakelin after the two were detained and underwent a health screening along a remote stretch of U.S.-Mexico border. But the case raises questions about the Border Patrol's use of English-only forms.

All agents are required to speak Spanish, and they receive formal Spanish training. Reading forms in Spanish is often enough to pose basic questions. But some other Spanish-speaking migrants reported signing paperwork that they later said they did not understand.

Scores of immigrant parents who were separated from their children after crossing the border in the spring said they signed forms agreeing to be deported with the understanding that their kids would be returning with them, only to find themselves deported without them. Many had to wait months before being reunited with them in their homelands.

Talks adopt 'rulebook' to put Paris climate deal into action

KATOWICE, Poland (AP) -- Almost 200 nations, including the world's top greenhouse gas producers, China and the United States, have adopted a set of rules meant to breathe life into the 2015 Paris climate accord by setting out how countries should report their emissions and efforts to reduce them.

But negotiators delayed other key decisions until next year -- a move that frustrated environmentalists and countries that wanted more ambitious goals in light of scientists' warnings that the world must shift sharply away from fossil fuels in the coming decade.

""The majority of the rulebook for the Paris agreement has been created, which is something to be thankful for,"" said Mohamed Adow, a climate policy expert at Christian Aid. ""But the fact countries had to be dragged kicking and screaming to the finish line shows that some nations have not woken up"" to the dire consequences of global warming as outlined in a report by the U.N Panel on Climate Change, or IPCC.

Officials at the talks, which ended late Saturday in the Polish city of Katowice, agreed upon universal rules on how nations can cut emissions. Poor countries secured assurances on financial support to help them reduce emissions, adapt to changes such as rising sea levels and pay for damage that has already happened.

""Through this package, you have made a thousand little steps forward together,"" said Michal Kurtyka, a senior Polish official who led the talks.

French city honors victims of Christmas market attack

PARIS (AP) -- People filled a square in the French city of Strasbourg on Sunday to show respect and sympathy for the victims of last week's shooting attack near a famous Christmas market as the death toll rose to five.

French authorities said a Polish man died in a Strasbourg hospital Sunday, one of a dozen people wounded in last Tuesday's attack. Poland's Foreign Ministry extended condolences Sunday on Twitter to his family.

According to the newspaper DNA, more than 1,000 people attended the memorial, which ended with a minute of applause and a rendition of France's national anthem, ""La Marseillaise.""

The hour-long ceremony took place in Kleber Square, not far from where a gunman opened fire on Tuesday evening. Strasbourg Mayor Roland Ries praised the city's resilience in the face of hardship.

The ""extremely large crowd in the Christmas market"" on Saturday ""was an illustration of our commitment to these values ??on which our living together is based, which we will continue to defend against all those who want to attack it,"" Ries said.

Not into bingo, 84-year-old Texas woman gets college degree

RICHARDSON, Texas (AP) -- After raising five kids and retiring at age 77 from her secretarial job, Janet Fein couldn't be blamed for finally relaxing, but that's not her.

Fein, now 84, went to back to school and will accomplish a long-held goal this week when she graduates from the University of Texas at Dallas with a bachelor's degree.

""I didn't have anything to do in retirement and I didn't think that playing bingo was up to my speed,"" said Fein, who majored in sociology because she felt it was ""substantial.""

She said she enjoyed all the reading and writing papers. ""With each class I already knew a lot, but then I also learned a lot. And that made me happy,"" she said.

People 65 and older make up less than one percent of U.S. college students. In 2015, they accounted for about 67,000 of about 20 million college students, according to the National Center for Education Statistics.

Next-generation of GPS satellites are headed to space

DENVER (AP) -- After months of delays, the U.S. Air Force is about to launch the first of a new generation of GPS satellites, designed to be more accurate, secure and versatile.

But some of their most highly touted features will not be fully available until 2022 or later because of problems in a companion program to develop a new ground control system for the satellites, government auditors said.

The satellite is scheduled to lift off Tuesday from Cape Canaveral, Florida, aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. It's the first of 32 planned GPS III satellites that will replace older ones now in orbit. Lockheed Martin is building the new satellites outside Denver.

GPS is best-known for its widespread civilian applications, from navigation to time-stamping bank transactions. The Air Force estimates that 4 billion people worldwide use the system.

But it was developed by the U.S. military, which still designs, launches and operates the system. The Air Force controls a constellation of 31 GPS satellites from a high-security complex at Schriever Air Force Base outside Colorado Springs.

After fraud probe, new primary may replace GOP candidate

RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- Legislation quickly passed by North Carolina's lawmakers this week would prepare a path for Republicans to dump their nominee in a still-undecided U.S. House race marred with ballot fraud allegations.

""I think (legislators are) worried that Mark Harris might be damaged goods and they want to have the opportunity to have a different Republican nominee,"" said Carter Wrenn, a Republican operative and consultant to former U.S. Sen. Jesse Helms and others for more than 40 years. ""That's how I read those tea leaves.""

If the state elections board decides ballot irregularities or other problems cast the true outcome into doubt and force a redo, the legislation -- if allowed to go into law by Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper -- would require new primary elections in the 9th Congressional District race, in addition to a new general election.

That would allow Republicans another look at Mark Harris, the Republican who led Democrat Dan McCready by 905 votes in unofficial results. Harris hasn't been certified the winner, and an investigation is looking into missing absentee ballots in rural Bladen County and whether unsealed ballots illegally handled by collection teams there could have been altered.

Bladen was the only county among the eight within the 9th District where Harris won a majority of mail-in absentee ballots over McCready.

Top of mind: 'Justice' is Merriam-Webster's word of the year

NEW YORK (AP) -- Racial justice. Obstruction of justice. Social justice. The Justice Department. Merriam-Webster has chosen ""justice"" as its 2018 word of the year, driven by the churning news cycle over months and months.

The word follows ""toxic,"" picked by Oxford Dictionaries, and ""misinformation,"" plucked by Dictonary.com.

Peter Sokolowski, Merriam-Webster's editor at large, told The Associated Press ahead of Monday's announcement that ""justice"" consistently bubbled into the top 20 or 30 lookups on the company's website, spiking at times due to specific events but also skating close to the surface for much of the year.

While it's one of those common words people likely know how to spell and use correctly in a sentence, Sokolowski pointed to other reasons that drive search traffic. Among them is an attempt to focus a train of thought around a philosophical problem, or to seek aspirational motivation. Such well-known words are often among the most looked up every year, including those that are slightly abstract, including ""love,"" he said.

The designation for ""justice"" came soon after President Trump's one-time fixer, Michael Cohen, was sentenced to three years in prison for crimes that included arranging the payment of hush money to conceal his boss' alleged sexual affairs. He told a judge he agreed time and again to cover up Trump's ""dirty deeds"" out of ""blind loyalty.""

'Spider-Verse' swings to the top; 'Mortal Engines' tanks

LOS ANGELES (AP) -- ""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse"" swung to the top of the domestic box office in its first weekend in theaters, proving that there is widespread audience interest in big screen animated versions of Marvel's marquee superheroes.

The film led a host of newcomers that debuted to varying success on this pre-Christmas holiday weekend, including Clint Eastwood's drug smuggling drama ""The Mule"" and the Peter Jackson-produced epic ""Mortal Engines"" which bombed in North American theaters.

""Into the Spider-Verse"" earned an estimated $35.4 million from 3,813 theaters against a $90 million production budget according to Sony Pictures on Sunday, which is a record for animated movies in December (although the hybrid ""Alvin and the Chipmunks"" movies were higher). The film features an innovative animation style -- both CGI and hand-drawn -- and focuses on the Miles Morales character as he learns to become the famed web-slinger. It's another financial win for the studio's latest ""expanded Spider-Man universe"" strategy following ""Venom"" and ""Spider-Man: Homecoming.""

And ""Spider-Verse"" has been very well-received among critics, and audiences in exit surveys gave it a rare A+ CinemaScore -- a first for a Spider-Man film. It's also been nominated for a Golden Globe award for best animated feature and picked up a few honors from critics' groups as well, including the New York Film Critics Circle.

""We are playing to both families and fanboys. We're an all-audience film,"" said Adrian Smith, Sony's president of domestic distribution."

Sen. Lindsey Graham is encouraging Trump to reopen government for several weeks to continue negotiating with Democrats over the border wall Trump wants to build on the U.S.-Mexico border. If there's no deal at the end of that time, Graham says Trump would be free to take the more dramatic step of declaring a national emergency to build it.

As President Donald Trump is said to be mulling ""other options"" for funding his border wall between the U.S. and Mexico, according to the Associated Press, a dark horse arises on the internet.

A GoFundMe campaign popped up Sunday, hoping to raise funds for Trump's proposed wall between the U.S. and Mexico, which isn't news in and of itself. There are plenty of those around.

But the organizers of this campaign are so encouraged that they've raised more-than $700,000 in just three days that they've bumped their original goal of $200 million up to a cool billion.

The GoFundMe organizer is listed as triple-amputee Air Force veteran Brian Kolfage, who lost both legs and his right arm in a blast at Balad Air Force Base in Iraq in 2004, according to the Arizona Daily Star. The fundraiser is titled, ""We the people will fund the wall.""

The contact listing for the organizer says ""The Wall Funding Team"" is located in Miramar, Fla.

""As a veteran who has given so much, 3 limbs, I feel deeply invested to this nation to ensure future generations have everything we have today,"" Kolfage wrote in the GoFundMe campaign description. ""Too many Americans have been murdered by illegal aliens and too many illegals are taking advantage of the United States taxpayers with no means of ever contributing to our society.

""I have grandparents who immigrated to America legally, they did it the correct way and it's time we uphold our laws, and get this wall BUILT! It's up to Americans to help out and pitch in to get this project rolling.""

Multiple studies and reports have shown, though, that illegal immigrants commit crime, violent or nonviolent, at lesser rates than do native-born Americans.

Kolfage's GoFundMe campaign was listed as the ""Top fundraiser"" on the front page of the crowd-sourced social fundraising website as of Wednesday afternoon, despite Kolfage's claims that the platform was trying to hide his fundraiser from potential donors.

Kolfage's Facebook page, where he posts content relevant to his conservative political beliefs, has more than 90,000 followers.

""We have contacted the Trump Administration to secure a point of contact where all funds will go upon completion,"" the campaign says. ""When get this information secured we will update. We have many very high level contacts already helping."""

White House digs in on border wall demand, risking shutdown

WASHINGTON (AP) -- The White House on Sunday pushed the federal government closer to the brink of a partial shutdown later this week, digging in on its demand for $5 billion to build a border wall as congressional Democrats stood firm against it.

""We're going to do whatever is necessary to build the border wall to stop this ongoing crisis of illegal immigration,"" said White House senior adviser Stephen Miller.

Asked if that meant having a government shutdown, he said: ""If it comes to it, absolutely.""

Trump said last week he would be ""proud"" to have a shutdown to get Congress to approve a $5 billion down payment to fulfil his campaign promise to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. But the president doesn't have the votes from the Republican-controlled Congress to support funding for the wall at that level.

Democratic congressional leaders, Sen. Chuck Schumer and Rep. Nancy Pelosi, have proposed no more than $1.6 billion, as outlined in a bipartisan Senate bill. The money would not go for the wall but for fencing upgrades and other border security. Democrats also offered to simply keep funding at its current level, $1.3 billion.

Trump lawyer Giuliani rules out Mueller interview with Trump

WASHINGTON (AP) -- With a number of probes moving closer to the Oval Office, President Donald Trump and his attorney unleashed a fresh series of attacks on the investigators, questioning their integrity while categorically ruling out the possibility of a presidential interview with the special counsel.

Trump and Rudy Giuliani used Twitter and television interviews Sunday to deliver a series of broadsides against special counsel Robert Mueller and federal prosecutors in New York. Giuliani said he was ""disgusted"" by the tactics used by Mueller in his probe into Russian election interference, including in securing guilty pleas from the president's former national security adviser Michael Flynn on a charge of lying to federal investigators.

Trump, Giuliani said, would not submit to an interview by Mueller's team.

""They're a joke,"" Giuliani told ""Fox News Sunday."" ""Over my dead body, but, you know, I could be dead.""

The special counsel, who is investigating possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russia, has continued to request an interview with the president. Last month, the White House sent written answers in response to the special counsel's questions about possible collusion. The White House has resisted answering questions on possible obstruction of justice.

Child's death highlights communication barriers on border

Shortly before a 7-year-old Guatemalan girl died in U.S. custody, her father signed a form stating that his daughter was in good health. But it's unclear how much the man understood on the form, which was written in English and read to him in Spanish by Border Patrol agents.

The death of Jakelin Caal highlights the communication challenges along the U.S.-Mexico border as agents come in contact with an increasing number of migrants who speak neither English nor Spanish.

Her father's native language is the Mayan tongue known as Q'eqchi'. His second language is Spanish. It's unclear whether something was lost in translation or whether it would have made a difference in saving Jakelin after the two were detained and underwent a health screening along a remote stretch of U.S.-Mexico border. But the case raises questions about the Border Patrol's use of English-only forms.

All agents are required to speak Spanish, and they receive formal Spanish training. Reading forms in Spanish is often enough to pose basic questions. But some other Spanish-speaking migrants reported signing paperwork that they later said they did not understand.

Scores of immigrant parents who were separated from their children after crossing the border in the spring said they signed forms agreeing to be deported with the understanding that their kids would be returning with them, only to find themselves deported without them. Many had to wait months before being reunited with them in their homelands.

Talks adopt 'rulebook' to put Paris climate deal into action

KATOWICE, Poland (AP) -- Almost 200 nations, including the world's top greenhouse gas producers, China and the United States, have adopted a set of rules meant to breathe life into the 2015 Paris climate accord by setting out how countries should report their emissions and efforts to reduce them.

But negotiators delayed other key decisions until next year -- a move that frustrated environmentalists and countries that wanted more ambitious goals in light of scientists' warnings that the world must shift sharply away from fossil fuels in the coming decade.

""The majority of the rulebook for the Paris agreement has been created, which is something to be thankful for,"" said Mohamed Adow, a climate policy expert at Christian Aid. ""But the fact countries had to be dragged kicking and screaming to the finish line shows that some nations have not woken up"" to the dire consequences of global warming as outlined in a report by the U.N Panel on Climate Change, or IPCC.

Officials at the talks, which ended late Saturday in the Polish city of Katowice, agreed upon universal rules on how nations can cut emissions. Poor countries secured assurances on financial support to help them reduce emissions, adapt to changes such as rising sea levels and pay for damage that has already happened.

""Through this package, you have made a thousand little steps forward together,"" said Michal Kurtyka, a senior Polish official who led the talks.

French city honours victims of Christmas market attack

PARIS (AP) -- People filled a square in the French city of Strasbourg on Sunday to show respect and sympathy for the victims of last week's shooting attack near a famous Christmas market as the death toll rose to five.

French authorities said a Polish man died in a Strasbourg hospital Sunday, one of a dozen people wounded in last Tuesday's attack. Poland's Foreign Ministry extended condolences Sunday on Twitter to his family.

According to the newspaper DNA, more than 1,000 people attended the memorial, which ended with a minute of applause and a rendition of France's national anthem, ""La Marseillaise.""

The hour-long ceremony took place in Kleber Square, not far from where a gunman opened fire on Tuesday evening. Strasbourg Mayor Roland Ries praised the city's resilience in the face of hardship.

The ""extremely large crowd in the Christmas market"" on Saturday ""was an illustration of our commitment to these values ??on which our living together is based, which we will continue to defend against all those who want to attack it,"" Ries said.

Not into bingo, 84-year-old Texas woman gets college degree

RICHARDSON, Texas (AP) -- After raising five kids and retiring at age 77 from her secretarial job, Janet Fein couldn't be blamed for finally relaxing, but that's not her.

Fein, now 84, went to back to school and will accomplish a long-held goal this week when she graduates from the University of Texas at Dallas with a bachelor's degree.

""I didn't have anything to do in retirement and I didn't think that playing bingo was up to my speed,"" said Fein, who majored in sociology because she felt it was ""substantial.""

She said she enjoyed all the reading and writing papers. ""With each class I already knew a lot, but then I also learned a lot. And that made me happy,"" she said.

People 65 and older make up less than one per cent of U.S. college students. In 2015, they accounted for about 67,000 of about 20 million college students, according to the National Center for Education Statistics.

Next-generation of GPS satellites are headed to space

DENVER (AP) -- After months of delays, the U.S. Air Force is about to launch the first of a new generation of GPS satellites, designed to be more accurate, secure and versatile.

But some of their most highly touted features will not be fully available until 2022 or later because of problems in a companion program to develop a new ground control system for the satellites, government auditors said.

The satellite is scheduled to lift off Tuesday from Cape Canaveral, Florida, aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. It's the first of 32 planned GPS III satellites that will replace older ones now in orbit. Lockheed Martin is building the new satellites outside Denver.

GPS is best-known for its widespread civilian applications, from navigation to time-stamping bank transactions. The Air Force estimates that 4 billion people worldwide use the system.

But it was developed by the U.S. military, which still designs, launches and operates the system. The Air Force controls a constellation of 31 GPS satellites from a high-security complex at Schriever Air Force Base outside Colorado Springs.

After fraud probe, new primary may replace GOP candidate

RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- Legislation quickly passed by North Carolina's lawmakers this week would prepare a path for Republicans to dump their nominee in a still-undecided U.S. House race marred with ballot fraud allegations.

""I think (legislators are) worried that Mark Harris might be damaged goods and they want to have the opportunity to have a different Republican nominee,"" said Carter Wrenn, a Republican operative and consultant to former U.S. Sen. Jesse Helms and others for more than 40 years. ""That's how I read those tea leaves.""

If the state elections board decides ballot irregularities or other problems cast the true outcome into doubt and force a redo, the legislation -- if allowed to go into law by Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper -- would require new primary elections in the 9th Congressional District race, in addition to a new general election.

That would allow Republicans another look at Mark Harris, the Republican who led Democrat Dan McCready by 905 votes in unofficial results. Harris hasn't been certified the winner, and an investigation is looking into missing absentee ballots in rural Bladen County and whether unsealed ballots illegally handled by collection teams there could have been altered.

Bladen was the only county among the eight within the 9th District where Harris won a majority of mail-in absentee ballots over McCready.

Top of mind: 'Justice' is Merriam-Webster's word of the year

NEW YORK (AP) -- Racial justice. Obstruction of justice. Social justice. The Justice Department. Merriam-Webster has chosen ""justice"" as its 2018 word of the year, driven by the churning news cycle over months and months.

The word follows ""toxic,"" picked by Oxford Dictionaries, and ""misinformation,"" plucked by Dictonary.com.

Peter Sokolowski, Merriam-Webster's editor at large, told The Associated Press ahead of Monday's announcement that ""justice"" consistently bubbled into the top 20 or 30 lookups on the company's website, spiking at times due to specific events but also skating close to the surface for much of the year.

While it's one of those common words people likely know how to spell and use correctly in a sentence, Sokolowski pointed to other reasons that drive search traffic. Among them is an attempt to focus a train of thought around a philosophical problem, or to seek aspirational motivation. Such well-known words are often among the most looked up every year, including those that are slightly abstract, including ""love,"" he said.

The designation for ""justice"" came soon after President Trump's one-time fixer, Michael Cohen, was sentenced to three years in prison for crimes that included arranging the payment of hush money to conceal his boss' alleged sexual affairs. He told a judge he agreed time and again to cover up Trump's ""dirty deeds"" out of ""blind loyalty.""

'Spider-Verse' swings to the top; 'Mortal Engines' tanks

LOS ANGELES (AP) -- ""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse"" swung to the top of the domestic box office in its first weekend in theatres, proving that there is widespread audience interest in big screen animated versions of Marvel's marquee superheroes.

The film led a host of newcomers that debuted to varying success on this pre-Christmas holiday weekend, including Clint Eastwood's drug smuggling drama ""The Mule"" and the Peter Jackson-produced epic ""Mortal Engines"" which bombed in North American theatres.

""Into the Spider-Verse"" earned an estimated $35.4 million from 3,813 theatres against a $90 million production budget according to Sony Pictures on Sunday, which is a record for animated movies in December (although the hybrid ""Alvin and the Chipmunks"" movies were higher). The film features an innovative animation style -- both CGI and hand-drawn -- and focuses on the Miles Morales character as he learns to become the famed web-slinger. It's another financial win for the studio's latest ""expanded Spider-Man universe"" strategy following ""Venom"" and ""Spider-Man: Homecoming.""

And ""Spider-Verse"" has been very well-received among critics, and audiences in exit surveys gave it a rare A+ CinemaScore -- a first for a Spider-Man film. It's also been nominated for a Golden Globe award for best animated feature and picked up a few honours from critics' groups as well, including the New York Film Critics Circle.

""We are playing to both families and fanboys. We're an all-audience film,"" said Adrian Smith, Sony's president of domestic distribution.

4 p.m.

Vice President Mike Pence says Democrats were ""unwilling to even negotiate"" an end to the partial government shutdown and the standoff over President Donald Trump's desire for a border barrier.

Pence spoke outside the West Wing after a contentious meeting Wednesday between Trump and congressional leaders.

Pence says, ""I think the president made his position very clear today that there will be no deal without a wall.""

Pence says Trump asked House Speaker Nancy Pelosi whether she would be willing to agree to funding for a wall or a barrier on the southern border if he re-opened the government quickly.

Pence says, ""When she said 'No,' the president said 'Goodbye.""

Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said Trump had a ""temper tantrum."" Pence says of the president, ""I don't recall him ever raising his voice.""

Top Democrats say President Donald Trump walked out of a meeting with congressional leaders as talks to end the partial government shutdown remain at an impasse.

Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said Trump asked House Speaker Nancy Pelosi at Wednesday's White House meeting whether she would agree to fund his wall.

When she said ""no,"" Schumer says, Trump got up and said, ""Then we have nothing to discuss."" Schumer says, ""And he just walked out.""

Schumer is calling Trump's actions ""really, really unfortunate.""

Trump is also weighing in on the meeting by tweet, calling it ""a total waste of time.""

He tweets that once Pelosi rejected his long-stalled border wall, he ""said bye-bye, nothing else works!""

Congressional leaders from both parties have returned to the White House for another round of negotiations with President Donald Trump on the ongoing partial government shutdown.

The two sides have made no apparent progress in the past week, with Trump sticking to his demand of $5.7 billion for a border barrier and Democrats insisting they won't give him the money.

Trump has been making a public case that there is a ""crisis"" at the southern border. And he's still threatening to declare a national emergency to circumvent Congress if he can't get the wall money from them.

He told reporters during a visit to the Capitol earlier Wednesday that he may turn to a declaration ""at some point"" if top Democrats Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi ""don't agree"" with his assessment about the problems at the border.

President Donald Trump says Republicans are ""totally unified"" in the shutdown standoff over his long-promised southern border wall, though some GOP lawmakers have been expressing concern about the 19-day partial government closure.

Trump traveled to Capitol Hill on Wednesday to meet with Senate Republicans. He says there was ""no discussion about anything other than solidarity.""

Trump has been considering a national emergency declaration to bypass Congress to build the wall. He says he ""may do that at some point"" if he can't get a deal with Democrats.

Trump also plans to meet with top congressional Democrats and Republicans at the White House on Wednesday.

President Donald Trump arrived on Capitol Hill claiming he has ""tremendous"" support as he headed into a meeting with Republican senators uneasy with the government shutdown over his border wall.

Asked how long the shutdown would last, Trump told reporters Wednesday ""whatever it takes.""

The partial shutdown is now in its 19th day, the second longest ever.

Trump and Vice President Mike Pence arrived for the private lunch meeting with the Senate GOP caucus to shore up support.

Several Republican senators have said the government should be re-opened while talks continue over border security and Trump's demand for money to build the wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.

President Donald Trump says he thinks he and the Democrats are ""getting closer"" to a deal to end the budget stalemate that has partially shut down the government despite no evidence that any progress has been made.

And he's suggesting the partial government shutdown could be ""a blessing in disguise"" because, he suggests, it could lead to a broader immigration deal.

Trump spoke Wednesday during an Oval Office bill signing on anti-human trafficking legislation. It's a day after he delivered a prime-time address trying to make the case for his long-stalled U.S.-Mexico border wall.

Trump says that he would like to see ""real immigration reform in this country because we need it."" He says, ""Everybody wants to see immigration reform,"" adding that perhaps the stalemate ""will turn out to be a blessing in disguise.""

Gone are the days when the U.S. and Mexican governments regularly exchanged statements over President Donald Trump's insistence on a border wall.

Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said Wednesday he won't be drawn into what he calls a U.S. internal dispute, an apparent reference to the 19-day-old partial U.S. government shutdown over a border barrier.

Lopez Obrador says, ""We are not going to respond to situations arising from internal affairs in the United States.""

Unlike his predecessor, the Mexican leader didn't have to respond to any specific aspersion about Mexico, because Trump didn't make any in his Tuesday night address to the American public. Relations between the two leaders have been surprisingly cordial, given their ideological differences.

Lopez Obrador said, ""Of course, there are those ... who want us to get into a confrontation. We always want a friendly relationship with the United States, a cooperative relationship.""

As a presidential candidate Trump promised Mexico would pay for a border wall, but Mexico refused.

President Donald Trump is using a bill signing focused on curbing human trafficking to push his case for a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border.

Trump says a southern border that is not secured exacerbates the incidents of human trafficking. He says, ""As long as we have a border that is not secure, we're going to suffer the consequences of that.""

Wednesday's bill signing came a day after Trump's prime-time speech designed to persuade Americans that illegal immigration and trafficking at the border are a crisis.

Democrats have called Trump's promised wall costly, ineffective and ""immoral"" and say he's ""manufacturing a crisis.""

The bill Trump signed is designed to enhance an annual State Department report that measures global efforts to eliminate human trafficking.

The White House says it's the fourth bipartisan bill the Republican president has signed in the last few weeks to prevent human trafficking.

Congressional Democrats say they'll head to the White House with the plan to reopen the government -- the same one they've been presenting. They're asking President Donald Trump to accept a bipartisan bill to fund border security without the wall.

Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Wednesday the president ""could end the Trump shutdown and re-open the government today, and he should.""

Pelosi and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer spoke at an event where they were flanked by federal workers going without pay during the shutdown, now in its 19th day.

Schumer called workers the ""collateral damage"" of Trump's ""temper tantrum."" He said the president failed to ""persuade a soul"" during his ""divisive"" prime-time address Tuesday night to the nation.

Trump meets with congressional leaders at the White House Wednesday afternoon. He rejected the Senate's bipartisan funding bill in December, sparking the shutdown.

The White House is trying to keep jittery congressional Republicans from defecting over the toll the partial government shutdown is taking in their states.

President Donald Trump and Democrats have been at an impasse over funding for his proposed border wall, which has led to a partial government shutdown, now in its 19th day.

Trump meets with Senate Republicans Wednesday on Capitol Hill just hours after he argued on national television that a border wall was needed to resolve a security and humanitarian ""crisis.""

Senators say the shutdown has led to disruptions in agricultural payments for farmers, as well as for home buyers trying to secure government-backed home loans. Lawmakers also are worried about missed paychecks for government workers Friday.

As many as half a dozen GOP senators have said the government should reopen while border security negotiations with Democrats continue.

President Donald Trump again linked illegal immigration along the southern border with drugs and violent crime as he urged Democratic lawmakers to fund his proposed border wall.

In his first national address from the Oval Office, the president gave no indication he was softening his stance that the partial government shutdown would continue without money for the wall.

Trump argued Tuesday night that the wall was needed to resolve what he called a security and humanitarian ""crisis.""

He addressed the nation as the shutdown stretched through its third week, with hundreds of thousands of federal workers going without pay and some congressional Republicans growing increasingly jittery about the impasse.

Trump plans to visit Senate Republicans at the Capitol on Wednesday before meeting with Democratic leaders at the White House."

Dec. 18

The New York Times on a judge's rebuke of Michael Flynn and President Donald Trump's charitable foundation:

A bit of common sense and common decency intruded on Tuesday into the crazy world of Donald Trump.

In New York, the state attorney general announced that the president had agreed that the ""charity"" he used as a piggy bank has no reason to exist.

In Washington, a federal judge let a former top presidential aide know that you can parrot political spin or you can tell the truth, but you can't do both to someone who can send you to prison.

Michael Flynn, Mr. Trump's former national security adviser, appeared before Judge Emmet Sullivan to be sentenced to what he expected would be a term of probation, after pleading guilty to lying to federal investigators about conversations with the Russian ambassador. The office of the special counsel, Robert Mueller, had earlier filed a memo that said it would be right for Mr. Flynn to avoid prison after his extensive co-operation in the investigation of Trump ties to Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential campaign and after.

Then last week, in a memo about their client's sentencing, Mr. Flynn's lawyers implied that he had been tricked into lying and that the F.B.I. acted improperly in interviewing him -- points raised by pro-Trump commentators elaborating on the president's claims of being victimized by a witch hunt.

Judge Sullivan was having none of it.

""I cannot recall an instance of a court ever accepting a guilty plea from someone who did not maintain he was guilty,"" Judge Sullivan said, ""and I do not intend to start today.""

Chastened, Mr. Flynn told the judge that nobody tricked him, that he lied and that he knew he shouldn't have.

The judge was not upset only about Mr. Flynn's sneaky prevarication. He said he felt ""disgust"" at Mr. Flynn's offences, that a retired three-star general would lie to the F.B.I. ""while on the physical premises of the White House,"" and, acting as an unregistered agent of a foreign country, Turkey, while he was an adviser to Mr. Trump (to which he admitted but was not charged). It was a bracing reminder of the brazenness of his misdeeds and of the standards the public should be able to expect of those who serve them.

Realizing that Judge Sullivan was considering a term of up to six months in prison, Mr. Flynn accepted his offer to delay the sentencing for 90 days until he has completed his co-operation with the special counsel.

""Good luck today in court to General Michael Flynn,"" Mr. Trump had tweeted first thing Tuesday morning.

""Thanks for nothing, Mr. President,"" Mr. Flynn might have thought as he left court.

Mr. Flynn should be grateful the judge offered him the chance to come clean. By contrast, the Donald J. Trump Foundation, a charity that provided no charity, quite properly received none from the New York attorney general's office.

Attorney General Barbara Underwood accused it of ""a shocking pattern of illegality"" that ""amounted to the Trump Foundation functioning as little more than a checkbook to serve Mr. Trump's business and political interests.""

Whatever money that remains will be disbursed under the supervision of Ms. Underwood's office and the judge overseeing the continuing lawsuit her office filed in June, seeking $2.8 million in restitution and a ban on Mr. Trump and his three oldest children serving on the boards of other non-profit organizations.

In a series of stories exposing the foundation's true nature, The Washington Post found that its largest donation was to fix a fountain in front of the Plaza Hotel in Manhattan, which Mr. Trump owned at the time, that its funds were used to buy a portrait of Mr. Trump, and that it illegally provided political donations and paid for personal legal settlements.

All this comes just days after prosecutors announced that they believed that Mr. Trump had conspired with the owner of The National Enquirer and his fixer Michael Cohen to violate campaign finance laws by paying hush money to two women who said they had affairs with him. It's also just been reported that prosecutors are investigating spending by the Trump inaugural committee. The president still faces lawsuits on the constitutionality of his enriching himself while in office. Meanwhile, the special counsel's inquiry may be expanding rather than winding down.

It's fitting that despite all his bluster and threats, a president who's demonstrated such contempt for the rule of law is finding it so formidable.

That this goes to the essence of American governance was best summed up by Paula Duncan, the Trump enthusiast who was among the jurors who found Mr. Trump's former campaign chief Paul Manafort guilty of fraud, even though she had hoped he wouldn't be convicted.

Explaining her decision after the verdict, she told Fox News, ""No one's above the law.""

The Wall Street Journal on a judge's ruling on the Affordable Care Act's individual mandate:

No one opposes ObamaCare more than we do, and Democrats are now confirming that it was designed as a way-station to government-run health care. But a federal judge's ruling that the law is unconstitutional is likely to be overturned on appeal and may boomerang politically on Republicans.

Judge Reed O'Connor ruled for some 20 state plaintiffs that the Affordable Care Act's individual mandate is no longer legal because Republicans repealed its financial penalty as part of the 2017 tax reform. Recall that Chief Justice John Roberts joined four Justices to say ObamaCare's mandate was illegal as a command to individuals to buy insurance under the Commerce Clause. ""The Framers gave Congress the power to regulate commerce, not to compel it,"" he wrote.

Yet the Chief famously salvaged ObamaCare by unilaterally rewriting the mandate to be a ""tax"" that was within Congress's power. Never mind that Democrats had expressly said the penalty was not a tax. Majority Leader Roberts declared it to be so.

Enter Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, who argues in Texas v. U.S. that since Congress has repealed the mandate, the tax is no longer a tax, and ObamaCare is thus illegal. Judge O'Connor agreed with that logic, and he went further in ruling that since Congress said the mandate is crucial to the structure of ObamaCare, then all of ObamaCare must fall along with the mandate.

We'll admit to a certain satisfaction in seeing the Chief Justice hoist on his own logic. But his ruling in NFIB v. Sebelius was in 2012 and there is more at issue legally now than the ""tax"" issue in that opinion. One legal complication is that Congress in 2017 repealed the financial part of the individual mandate, not the structure of the mandate itself. Republicans used budget rules to pass tax reform so they couldn't repeal the mandate's express language.

The Affordable Care Act has also been up and running since 2014, which means so-called reliance interests come into play when considering a precedent. Millions of people now rely on ObamaCare's subsidies and rules, which argues against judges repealing the law by fiat.

Judge O'Connor breezes past this like a liberal Ninth Circuit appeals judge handling a Donald Trump appeal. He's right that Democrats claimed the individual mandate was essential to the Affordable Care Act. But when Congress killed the financial penalty in 2017 it left the rest of ObamaCare intact. When judging congressional intent, a judge must account for the amending Congress as well as the original Congress.

In any case, the Supreme Court's ""severability"" doctrine calls for restraint in declaring an entire law illegal merely because one part of it is. Our guess is that even the right-leaning Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals judges will overturn Judge O'Connor on this point.

As for the politics, Democrats claim to be alarmed by the ruling but the truth is they're elated. They want to use it to further pound Republicans for denying health insurance for pre-existing conditions if the law is overturned. Democrats campaigned across the country against Mr. Paxton's lawsuit to gain House and Senate seats in November, and they will now press votes in Congress so they can compound the gains in 2020.

President Trump hailed the ruling in a tweet, but he has never understood the Affordable Care Act. His Administration has done good work revising regulations to reduce health-care costs and increase access, but the risk is that the lawsuit will cause Republicans in Congress to panic politically and strike a deal with Democrats that reinforces ObamaCare. This is what happens when conservatives fall into the liberal trap of thinking they can use the courts to achieve policy goals that need to be won in Congress.

The Washington Post on withdrawing all 2,000 U.S. troops out of Syria:

PRESIDENT TRUMP'S sudden move to yank U.S. troops out of Syria undermined at a stroke several foreign policy goals he has championed. The president promised to finish the job of destroying the Islamic State, but the withdrawal will leave thousands of its fighters still in place. He vowed to roll back Iran's aggression across the Middle East, but his decision will allow its forces to entrench in the country that is the keystone of Tehran's ambitions. He promised to protect Israel, but that nation will now be left to face alone the buildup by Iran and its proxies along its northern border.

The president's top national security advisers had carefully developed and articulated a strategy of maintaining a U.S. presence in Syria until the Islamic State was beyond revival and Iran withdrew its forces -- a plan they were defending up until this week. Mr. Trump has again demonstrated, to them and to the world, that no U.S. policy or foreign commitment is immune from his whims.

Mr. Trump claimed the Islamic State had been defeated, but that is not the view of the Defence and State Departments. Thousands of jihadist fighters are still in Syria and control splotches of territory in the Euphrates Valley. A U.S. withdrawal will give the extremists an opportunity to reconstitute, as they did in Iraq following the premature U.S. withdrawal ordered by President Barack Obama.

Until Wednesday, a prime talking point of senior national security officials was that, ""if we've learned one thing over the years, (the) enduring defeat of a group like this means you can't just defeat their physical space and then leave,"" as the State Department's special envoy for the global campaign against the Islamic State, Brett McGurk, put it last week. Defence Secretary Jim Mattis said it another way in September: ""Getting rid of the caliphate doesn't mean you then blindly say, 'Okay, we got rid of it,' march out, and then wonder why the caliphate comes back.""

Mr. Trump has justified some of his most controversial decisions, including his continued support for Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, as needed to contain Iran's threat to the United States and its allies. But the Syrian withdrawal hands Tehran and its ally Russia a windfall. Iran has deployed thousands of fighters and allied militiamen to Syria and aspires to create a corridor to Lebanon and the Mediterranean, as well as a new front against Israel along the Golan Heights. In reaction to that threat, Mr. Trump's national security adviser, John Bolton, announced Sept. 24 that ""We're not going to leave (Syria) as long as Iranian troops are outside Iranian borders, and that includes Iranian proxies and militias.""

U.S. ambitions in Syria have never been backed by adequate resources, and a case could be made that neither Congress nor the American public were prepared to support the mission suggested by Mr. Bolton. But Mr. Trump's decision appears to have been precipitated by the bellicose rhetoric of Turkey's Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who last week threatened -- not for the first time -- a military operation against Syrian Kurds, even though U.S. troops are positioned around them. The autocratic Turkish ruler appears to have extracted multiple favours from Mr. Trump in recent days, including the sale of U.S. Patriot missiles and a promise to reexamine the possible extradition of his rival, Fethullah Gulen, from Pennsylvania. If Mr. Trump received anything in return, he hasn't disclosed it.

The Syrian Kurdish forces, which have fought alongside the United States and played a crucial role in liberating most of eastern Syria from the jihadists, will be perhaps the foremost victims of Mr. Trump's decision. Betrayed by Washington, they will now be subject to a military offensive by Turkey. The stab in the back will send an unforgettable message to all who are asked to co-operate with the United States in the fight against terrorism: Washington is an unreliable and dangerous partner.

The Orange County (California) Register on Mick Mulvaney as Trump's choice for chief of staff:

President Trump has found a new chief of staff, albeit an interim one, in his director of the Office of Management and Budget, Mick Mulvaney.

That of chief is a terribly important post, perhaps government's most consequential aside from that of his boss. In theory, at least, the chief of staff is the gatekeeper for everything the president does, everyone he sees, everyone he talks to on the phone.

Perhaps, though few would expect this to be the case, the arbiter of every time he sends out a tweet, and of what it should say.

A Washington insider, a former congressman, Mulvaney is in many ways ideal for the job. He wants it, badly, whereas others with similarly impressive resumes touted for the job have indicated a strong desire to spend more time with their families, from Vice-President Pence's staff chief Nick Ayers of Georgia to former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie.

Mulvaney shares the conservative values currently espoused by the president and was a founder of the House Freedom Caucus in 2013, the group that always taunted the Republican leadership, opposing much government funding, including debt limit increases and budget agreements made with the Democrats.

But he also, after Trump secured the Republican nomination in 2016, called the candidate ""a terrible human being"" who he only was voting for out of an even greater dislike of Hillary Clinton.

It's not as if other presidential allies of today haven't said bad things about him in the past. On the campaign trail, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz called his rival ""a narcissist at a level I don't think this country's ever seen,"" for instance.

But if you were the nation's chief executive -- or the CEO of a much smaller entity, for that matter -- could you hire as your top aide and work with a person who had once dubbed you ""terrible""?

Or does this kind of talk come with the territory in politics, where many strange bedfellows are made because of having to run in elections against once and perhaps future allies? Should Trump indeed elevate this practical choice for staff chief to permanent status immediately?

Los Angeles Times on banning bump stocks, which allow semi-automatic weapons to fire like machine-guns:

The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives said Tuesday that it had finalized a rule reclassifying so-called bump stocks -- the devices that can make a semiautomatic rifle fire nearly as quickly a fully automatic weapon -- as machine-guns, which makes it illegal to manufacture, sell or possess them. The agency said a year ago it had the authority to reclassify the devices, and President Trump -- in the wake of the Parkland, Fla., school shooting -- directed the ATF to speed up the process. Tuesday's announcement -- a rare bit of welcome news from the Trump administration -- makes it official; White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters that owners of the conversion devices will have until March 21 to destroy them or turn them in to the ATF.

This is a good step. Unfortunately, it's all but certain to be challenged in the courts, and it's on shaky legal ground because of the way the new rule evolved. The Obama administration determined that because bump stocks have ""no automatically functioning mechanical parts and (perform) no automated mechanical functions when installed,"" they did not fit the definition of a machine-gun in federal law, which meant the ATF lacked the authority to regulate them. Tuesday's announcement, by contrast, hinges not on the technical specifications, but on the functionality. In essence, if it fires like a machine-gun, it's a machine-gun. Cue the lawyers.

We hope the administration prevails in whatever challenges emerge, but the sure-fire way to resolve this would be for Congress to legislate bump stocks and related gadgets out of existence. Such devices serve no function other than to evade the strict congressional limit on machine-guns by, as the ATF said, harnessing ""the recoil energy of the semiautomatic firearm in a manner that allows the trigger to reset and continue firing"" without the shooter having to pull the trigger for each shot.

A mass shooter in Las Vegas used bump stocks affixed to semiautomatic rifles to fire more than 1,000 rounds in a matter of minutes from a 32nd-floor suite of the Mandalay Bay Hotel into a crowd of some 20,000 people, killing 58 concertgoers and injuring hundreds of others. It was the largest single mass shooting in the modern era, drawing attention to bump stocks and sparking outraged demands by many -- the Los Angeles Times included -- that the devices be banned.

As welcome as this new rule is, it will do little to corral our national problem with gun violence. The vast majority of gun deaths come in ones and twos, led by suicides. ...

But it is progress. And the president deserves credit for sticking with his promise to find a way to ban bump stocks. ...

China Daily says telecommunications giant Huawei is a victim of U.S. panic attacks:

This year has not been an annus mirabilis for China's Huawei Technologies Ltd, the world's largest supplier of telecommunications network equipment and second-biggest maker of smartphones.

Although it has been constantly in the news and it is said there is no such thing as bad publicity, it has been making headlines because of the spurious claims it somehow poses a threat to the West, even world peace. It has never been explained exactly how.

In fact it is not because of anything it has done, but because its success has brought it into the crosshairs of the United States' anxiety attacks against China.

Huawei is at the forefront of 5G technology. This latest generation mobile network technology promises to bring the much anticipated and heralded internet of things to life and the US is determined to be the 5G leader.

Not only because whichever country develops the technology that is adopted as standard will have a huge commercial advantage. But also because by setting the standard it will have a knowledge advantage.

As a result, first the US and then one after another its most obedient allies have blocked Huawei from entering their 5G markets on security grounds.

None of them have offered any specific justification for blocking Huawei. They just repeat their claim that the company poses a security risk. That is why objective observers have concluded that those countries are politicizing a commercial issue.

It sets a harmful precedent. What if other countries used the same excuse to block US companies (not confined to the telecom sector)? The US companies are very competitive in many fields, including those that could pose huge security risks, such as finance.

While Huawei will not go unscathed from being prevented from entering key markets, as a competitive player, it still has a vast market to access in other parts of the world. It has signed contracts to supply 5G equipment to 25 telecom carriers, and more than 10,000 5G base stations have been shipped.

In stark contrast to the US and its allies, India for instance, has invited Huawei to conduct 5G trials in the country and complimented it on the role it has played in helping to develop its telecom industry.

The efforts of the US and its allies to try to shield their companies against a Chinese competitor are politically motivated, not the result of a fact-based or transparent decision-making process. And they are counterproductive to the concerted efforts that are needed to ensure the security of 5G networks.

The Army is looking for a few good robots. Not to fight -- not yet, at least -- but to help the men and women who do.

These robots aren't taking up arms, but the companies making them have waged a different kind of battle. At stake is a contract worth almost half a billion dollars for 3,000 backpack-sized robots that can defuse bombs and scout enemy positions. Competition for the work has spilled over into Congress and federal court.

Euro currency remains a work in progress on 20th birthday

FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- The euro is about to celebrate its 20th birthday, but the countries that use it are still wrestling with how the shared currency should work and how to fix flaws exposed by the debt crisis that marred its second decade.

The euro was launched on Jan. 1, 1999, when 10 countries fixed their exchange rates to it and handed decisions on interest rates to the newly-founded European Central Bank. Euro notes and coins went into circulation three years later.

The shared currency was seen as a solution to the constant quarrels over exchange rates that had marked European politics after World War II and as a logical extension of the European Union's tariff-free trade zone. Britain, notably, opted out, but 19 of 28 EU countries use the euro.

North Korea's 'Singapore shops' expose gap in sanctions push

PYONGYANG, North Korea (AP) -- Despite the unwanted publicity of a criminal trial for one of their main suppliers, business is booming at Pyongyang's 'Singapore shops,' which sell everything from Ukrainian vodka to brand-name knock-offs from China. The stores stock many of the very things United Nations' sanctions banning trade in luxury goods are intended to block and provide a nagging reminder that not all potential trade partners are lining up behind the U.N.'s pronouncements or the Trump administration's policy of maximum pressure on the North.

Especially when there's a buck -- or a few million bucks -- to be made.

The stores are anything but secret.

US pending home sales slipped 0.7 per cent in November

WASHINGTON (AP) -- Fewer Americans signed contracts to buy homes in November as higher mortgage rates and prices continued to squeeze would-be buyers out of the market.

The National Association of Realtors said Friday that its pending home sales index dipped 0.7 per cent last month to 101.4. The index based on contract signings has dropped 7.7 per cent over the past year and has recorded 11 straight year-over-year decreases.

Tesla names Oracle's Ellison to board in SEC settlement

NEW YORK (AP) -- Tesla named Oracle's Larry Ellison and an executive from Walgreens to its board Friday as part of a settlement with U.S. regulators who demanded more oversight of CEO Elon Musk.

Ellison and Kathleen Wilson-Thompson, an executive vice-president at Walgreens Boots Alliance, join the board as independent directors, effective immediately.

Musk got into trouble with the Securities and Exchange Commission in early August when he said in a tweet that he had ""funding secured"" to take the electric car company private at $420 per share.

GOP and Democrats trade blame for shutdown, no deal in sight

WASHINGTON (AP) -- The partial government shutdown will almost certainly be handed off to a divided government to solve in the new year, as both parties traded blame Friday and President Donald Trump sought to raise the stakes in the weeklong impasse.

As agreement eludes Washington in the waning days of the Republican monopoly on power, it sets up the first big confrontation between Trump and newly empowered Democrats. Trump is sticking with his demand for money to build a border wall with Mexico, and Democrats, who take control of the House on Jan. 3, are refusing to give him what he wants.

Trump raised the stakes on Friday, reissuing threats to shut the U.S.-Mexico border to pressure Congress to fund the wall and to shut off aid to three Central American countries from which many migrants have fled.

EPA proposes easing regulation of mercury from coal plants

WASHINGTON (AP) -- The Environmental Protection Agency is considering backing off of its regulation of toxic mercury emissions from coal-fired power plants.

In an announcement Friday, the EPA proposes what would be another Trump administration rollback of federal enforcement under the Clean Air Act. It's the latest administration effort on behalf of the country's coal industry.

The Associated Press"
265,johnson city press,http://www.johnsoncitypress.com/Government/2019/01/14/Congress-to-face-same-question-When-will-shutdown-end.html,"One Republican senator says he's offered President Donald Trump a possible solution, though it may just be wishful thinking.

Sen. Lindsey Graham is encouraging Trump to reopen government for several weeks to continue negotiating with Democrats over the border wall Trump wants to build on the U.S.-Mexico border. If there's no deal at the end of that time, Graham says Trump would be free to take the more dramatic step of declaring a national emergency to build it.

But the South Carolina Republican says Trump still wants a deal on funding for the wall before agreeing to reopen shuttered government departments. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat, insists Trump reopen the government first.

Their weeks-old standoff led to the partial government shutdown, now on day 24 without a clear end in sight.

Trump insisted on Twitter Monday that he wanted to deal, declaring: ""I've been waiting all weekend. Democrats must get to work now. Border must be secured!""

Targeting Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, Trump also argued that the shutdown ""has become their, and the Democrats, fault!"" Trump weeks ago asserted that he would ""own"" the shutdown and polls show that he is taking most of the blame.

Graham, who has publicly pushed Trump to use his authority to declare a national emergency to build the wall, is suggesting a short-term fix.

""Before he pulls the plug on the legislative option, and I think we're almost there, I would urge him to open up the government for a short period of time, like three weeks, before he pulls the plug, see if we can get a deal,"" Graham said. ""If we can't at the end of three weeks, all bets are off.

""See if he can do it by himself through the emergency powers. That's my recommendation,"" added Graham, who has publicly pushed Trump to use his authority to declare a national emergency to build the wall. Such a step would allow Trump to bypass Congress and tap various pots of unspent federal money, including for military construction and disaster relief as well as from assets seized by law enforcement, to pay for the wall.

Trump has kept Washington on edge over whether he would resort to such a declaration, citing what he says is a ""crisis"" of drug smuggling and the trafficking of women and children at the border. The president initially sounded as though such a move was imminent, but then pulled back. He has said several times since he first mentioned the idea in public this month that he prefers a legislative solution.

A key question is how much more time is Trump willing to give lawmakers. Graham, who spoke with Trump by telephone on Sunday morning, said the legislative path ""is just about shut off"" and blamed intransigence by Pelosi.

The speaker's office had no immediate comment.

Democrats oppose an emergency declaration but may be powerless to block it. Some Republicans are wary, too, fearing how a future Democratic president might use that authority. Such a move, should Trump ultimately go that route, would almost certainly be challenged in the courts.

Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., called Graham's idea to reopen the government a ""great place to start.""

""I do think if we reopen the government, if the president ends this shutdown crisis, we have folks who can negotiate a responsible, modern investment in technology that will actually make us safer,"" Coons said.

Trump says technology is nice, but that the border can't be secured without a wall.

The White House has been laying the groundwork for an emergency declaration, which is feared by lawmakers in both parties.

Senate Homeland Security Committee Chairman Ron Johnson, R-Wis., said he'd ""hate to see"" a declaration issued because the wall wouldn't get built, presumably because of legal challenges. Democrats voted in the past for border security and should again, he said.

""I actually want to see this wall get built,"" Johnson said. ""I want to keep pressure on Democrats to actually come to the negotiating table in good faith and fund what they have supported in the past.""

Graham favors a declaration and said the time for talk is running out.

""It's the last option, not the first option, but we're pretty close to that being the only option,"" he said.

Graham and Coons spoke on ""Fox News Sunday"" and Johnson appeared on CNN's ""State of the Union."""
266,nwi.com,https://www.nwitimes.com/news/national/federal-work-at-superfund-sites-suspended-during-shutdown/article_9144e104-8ca9-56f4-910c-c342aa16ac37.html,"BIRMINGHAM, Ala. -- The government shutdown has suspended federal cleanups at Superfund sites around the nation and forced the cancellation of public hearings, deepening the mistrust and resentment of surrounding residents who feel people in power long ago abandoned them to live among the toxic residue of the country's factories and mines.

""We are already hurting, and it's just adding more fuel to the fire,"" says 40-year-old Keisha Brown, whose wood-frame home is in a community nestled among coking plants and other factories on Birmingham's north side.

The mostly African-American community has been forced to cope with high levels of arsenic, lead and other contaminants in the soil that the Environmental Protection Agency has been scraping up and carting away, house by house.

As President Donald Trump and Congress battle over Trump's demand for a wall on the southern U.S. border, the 3-week-old partial government shutdown has stopped federal work on Superfund sites except for cases where the administration deems ""there is an imminent threat to the safety of human life or to the protection of property.""

EPA's shutdown plans said the agency would evaluate about 800 Superfund sites to see how many could pose an immediate threat. As an example of that kind of threat, it cited an acid leak from a mine that could threaten the public water supply. That's the hazard at Northern California's Iron Mountain mine, where EPA workers help prevent an unending flow of lethally acidic runoff off the Superfund site from spilling into rivers downstream.

Practically speaking, said Bonnie Bellow, a former EPA official who worked on Superfund public outreach at the agency, the impact of the stoppage of work at sites across the nation ""wholly depends"" on the length of the shutdown.

""Unless there is immediate risk like a storm, a flood, a week or two of slowdowns is not going to very likely affect the cleanup at the site,"" Bellow said.

In north Birmingham, Brown said it's been a couple of weeks since she's spotted any EPA crews at people's houses. It was unclear if state workers or contractors were continuing work.

But long before the shutdown began, Brown harbored doubts the cleanup was working anyway.

""My main concern is the health of the people out here,"" said Brown, who has asthma. ""All of us are sick, and we've got to function on medicine every day.""

In terms of time, the federal government shutdown is a chronological blip in the long history of the site -- which includes ethics charges in a local bribery scandal to block federal cleanup efforts -- but adds to the uncertainty in an area where residents feel forgotten and betrayed.

At the EPA, the shutdown has furloughed the bulk of the agency's roughly 14,000 employees. It also means the EPA isn't getting most of the daily stream of environmental questions and tips from the public. Routine inspections aren't happening. State, local and private emails to EPA officials often get automated messages back promising a response when the shutdown ends.

In Montana, for instance, state officials this month found themselves fielding calls from a tribal member worried about drinking water with a funny look to it, said Kristi Ponozzo, public-policy director at that state's Department of Environmental Quality. The EPA normally provides tribes with technical assistance on water supplies.

With most EPA colleagues idled, Ponozzo said, her agency also had to call off an environmental review meeting for a mining project, potentially delaying the project.

But it's the agency's work at Superfund sites -- lessening the threat from old nuclear-weapons plants, chemical factories, mines and other entities -- that gets much of the attention.

Absent imminent peril, it would be up to state governments or contractors to continue any cleanup during the shutdown ""up to the point that additional EPA direction or funding is needed,"" the EPA said in a statement.

""Sites where cleanup activities have been stopped or shut down will be secured until cleanup activities are able to commence when the federal government reopens,"" the agency said.

For federal Superfund sites in Michigan, the shutdown means there are no EPA colleagues to consult, said Scott Dean, a spokesman for that state's Department of Environmental Quality.

At Michigan Superfund sites, day-to-day field operations were continuing since private contractors do most of the on-the-ground work, Dean said.

Bellow, the former EPA official, said the cancellation of hearings about Superfund sites posed immediate concerns.

In East Chicago, Indiana, for example, the EPA called off a planned public hearing set for last Wednesday to outline how the agency planned to clean up high levels of lead and arsenic in the soil.

The EPA has proposed a seven-month, $26.5 million cleanup that includes treating and removing tainted soil from the area, where a lead smelter was located.

During a public meeting Nov. 29, some residents complained that the EPA's approach would leave too much pollution in place. But others didn't get a chance to speak and were hoping to do so at the meeting this week, said Debbie Chizewer, a Northwestern University environmental attorney who represents community groups in the low-income area.

The EPA announced the cancellation in an online notice and gave no indication that it would be rescheduled.

Leaders of the East Chicago Calumet Community Advisory Group asked for a new hearing date and an extension of a Jan. 14 public comment deadline in a letter to the EPA's regional Superfund division.

Calls by The Associated Press to the agency's regional office in Chicago this week were not answered.

Local critics fear the EPA will use the delay caused by the shutdown as justification for pushing ahead with a cleanup strategy they consider flawed, Chizewer said, even though the agency has designated the affected area as an ""environmental justice community,"" a low-income community of color that has been disproportionately harmed by pollution.

The EPA has a ""special obligation"" when dealing with such communities, Chizewer said. ""This would be an example of shutting them out for no good reason.""

In North Birmingham, former longtime neighborhood resident Charlie Powell said most of the people living in and around the Superfund site had already ""just got tired and fed up.""

Powell left the area but started a group called PANIC, People Against Neighborhood Industrial Contamination. He said he believes money would be better spent helping residents move away from the pollution.

""Can I say hell?"" Powell said when asked what residents have been through.

267,arkansasonline,https://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2019/jan/06/sides-give-no-ground-in-huddle-on-stand/,"WASHINGTON -- The government shutdown that has halted paychecks for hundreds of thousands of federal workers began its third week Saturday with no end in sight, as Vice President Mike Pence, top White House officials and senior congressional aides met for more than two hours without reaching a deal to reopen the government.

Inside the meeting at the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, Pence refused to budge from the more than $5 billion President Donald Trump has demanded from Congress to pay for a portion of his promised wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, according to two Democratic officials briefed on the negotiations.

The standoff -- which has heavily affected national parks and other operations and threatens to halt payments as varied as food stamps and tax refunds -- has made Trump's unrealized border wall the linchpin of his presidency as he seeks to make good on a signature campaign promise.

The two sides are scheduled to meet again this afternoon, but there was little hope that the broad divide between Trump and Democrats over his demand for wall funding would be bridged anytime soon. Saturday's talks came a day after Trump said the government shutdown could continue for ""months or even years"" if Democrats did not relent on their steadfast refusal to grant him the wall money.

The White House said funding was not discussed in-depth, but the administration was clear that it needed funding for a wall and that it wanted to resolve the shutdown all at once.

While Trump has stood by his $5.7 billion demand, Senate Democrats have offered $1.3 billion for border security, including fencing, and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California, and the top Senate Democrat, Charles Schumer of New York, have repeatedly said that they will not agree to any wall funding. Pelosi has called a border wall an ""immorality.""

The vice president's office said that Pence had reiterated the president's position that any deal needed to include funding for the wall. The office also said that Democrats had requested additional information from the Department of Homeland Security about its needs to deal with border issues.

Pence was deputized by Trump to oversee Saturday's talks, but he did not have the president's blessing to float new or specific numbers as he did last month in a meeting with Schumer, according to two Trump aides who were not authorized to speak publicly. That meant few specifics were discussed Saturday, as Democratic staff members repeatedly pushed the administration to reopen the federal government and negotiate differences over the border after the shutdown ends.

But the administration -- represented by Pence, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney and senior adviser Jared Kushner -- refused, according to multiple officials.

""Not much headway made today,"" Trump tweeted Saturday afternoon. ""Second meeting set for tomorrow. After so many decades, must finally and permanently fix the problems on the Southern Border!""

Before the meeting began Saturday morning, Trump took a combative tone in several Twitter messages and claimed that news coverage documenting cracks in Republican support for his hard-line position were inaccurate.

""Great support coming from all sides for Border Security (including Wall) on our very dangerous Southern Border,"" Trump tweeted. ""Teams negotiating this weekend! Washington Post and NBC reporting of events, including Fake sources, has been very inaccurate (to put it mildly)!""

Trump spent much of Saturday on the phone with allies, talking through his positioning on the shutdown and hearing their reviews of his Friday news conference in the Rose Garden, according to a person close to him. Two people regularly on his call list -- Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., and Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. -- have encouraged Trump to hold fast and refuse to agree to reopen the government unless wall funding is secured, the person said.

""I've never seen the president as resolved on any issue as he is on this,"" Meadows said Saturday. ""But he is open to new ideas about how to end the impasse.""

During Saturday's meeting, Democratic aides asked the White House to lay out in formal detail the administration's funding request for the border -- including its specific security requests, what the money would be used for, and what in the Homeland Security budget the administration would cut to make the numbers work, people familiar with the meeting said.

Democrats ""emphasized that it's important for us to have an updated budget request from the White House because they have been all over the map,"" said another official briefed on the discussion. The White House plans to provide those figures before the group meets again this afternoon.

With talks stalled Saturday, Pelosi announced that House Democrats plan to start approving individual bills to reopen shuttered agencies starting with the Treasury Department to ensure Americans receive their tax refunds.

""While President Trump threatens to keep the government shut down for 'years,' Democrats are taking immediate further action to reopen government, so that we can meet the needs of the American people, protect our borders and respect our workers,"" Pelosi said.

Some centrist Republicans on Saturday urged Trump and congressional leaders to reopen the government, reflecting growing unease in their ranks about the prolonged shutdown and the political cost the GOP might pay.

""With Nancy Pelosi as speaker, it's going to have to be a compromise solution,"" Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick, R-Pa., a moderate and former FBI agent who represents the Philadelphia suburbs, said in an interview. ""It's our most basic function as members of Congress to fund the government, and we need to have these battles on immigration and other issues on their own turf, separately.""

A number of Republicans, including Sen. Cory Gardner, R-Colo., have said in recent days that a shutdown is not the ""right answer.""

On Friday, Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., became the third member of his party in the Senate to call for an end to the shutdown, joining Gardner and Sen. Susan Collins of Maine.

In an op-ed article for the newspaper The Hill published Friday evening, Tillis encouraged Congress to strike a deal that would provide ""long-term certainty to the DACA population"" -- the participants in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program who were brought to the United States as children -- and ""force out the extreme elements on either side of the aisle.""

""When it comes to securing our borders, it's important to note that the real solution is not going to be a big, literal physical wall, but rather an all-the-above, all-hands-on-deck approach,"" he wrote, adding his support for solutions including ""physical barriers and steel fences.""

In an interview with NBC's Meet the Press, set to air today, Mulvaney argued that the administration was willing to deal. He said Trump was willing to forgo a concrete wall for steel or other materials.

""If he has to give up a concrete wall, replace it with a steel fence to do that so that Democrats can say, 'See? He's not building a wall anymore,' that should help us move in the right direction,'"" Mulvaney said.

White House senior aides were to depart late Saturday for Camp David for a staff retreat where discussions about policy and priorities for 2019 are to be planned, and the president is expected to join them today. Mulvaney is spearheading the gathering as a way of connecting with his new deputies and colleagues, according to officials.

On Friday, federal agencies were directed to hold off on enacting pay raises for top administration officials during the shutdown.

The guidance was issued in a memo from Margaret Weichert, the acting director of the Office of Personnel Management.

The raises were the result of a pay freeze for top federal officials, including the vice president and Cabinet secretaries, that was on the verge of expiring because of the shutdown.

In the memo, Weichert writes that, ""In the current absence of Congressional guidance,"" the Office of Personnel Management ""believes it would be prudent for agencies to continue to pay these senior political officials at the frozen rate until appropriations legislation is enacted that would clarify the status of the freeze.""

White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said earlier Friday that the administration was ""aware of the issue"" and ""exploring options to prevent this from being implemented while some federal workers are furloughed.""

Trump had also told reporters that he ""might consider"" asking Cabinet secretaries and other top officials to forgo the raises. Pence committed to doing so.

Sanders, in her statement, called the raises ""another unnecessary byproduct of the shutdown"" and put the onus on Congress, saying it ""can easily take care of this by funding the government and securing our borders.""

That's my recommendation,"" added Graham, who has publicly pushed Trump to use his authority to declare a national emergency to build the wall. Such a step would allow Trump to bypass Congress and tap various pots of unspent federal money, including for military construction and disaster relief and from assets seized by law enforcement, to pay for the wall.

Trump has kept Washington on edge over whether he would resort to such a declaration, citing what he says is a ""crisis"" of drug smuggling and the trafficking of women and children at the border. The president initially sounded as though such a move was imminent, but then pulled back. He has said several times since he first mentioned the idea in public earlier this month that he prefers to try to reach a deal with Congress.

A key question is how much more time is Trump willing to give lawmakers. Graham, who said he and Trump talked by telephone on Sunday morning, said the legislative path ""is just about shut off"" and blamed Pelosi.

The speaker's office had no immediate comment.

Democrats oppose an emergency declaration but may be powerless to block it. Some Republicans are wary, too, fearing how a future Democratic president might use that authority. Such a move, should Trump ultimately go that route, would almost certainly be challenged in the courts.

Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., called Graham's idea to reopen the government a ""great place to start.""

""I do think if we reopen the government, if the president ends this shutdown crisis, we have folks who can negotiate a responsible, modern investment in technology that will actually make us safer,"" Coons said.

Trump has maintained that the border cannot be secured without a wall.

Graham said he thinks Trump is willing to accept the $5.7 billion he has insisted on for the wall, along with some immigration measures Democrats might find acceptable, such as helping immigrants in the U.S. illegally who were illegally brought here as children.

Trump has expressed interest in a broader immigration overhaul but says he first wants the Supreme Court to address that class of immigrants, known as Dreamers. Pelosi also has shown no interest in accepting a wall -- she has called it an ""immorality"" -- in exchange for immigration fixes.

And Trump, who was holed up in the White House as snow blanketed Washington on Sunday, appeared to shoot down Graham's suggestion of a ""wall plus"" deal, saying on Twitter that even Democrats don't want to make Dreamers part of the negotiations.

""The damage done to our Country from a badly broken Border - Drugs, Crime and so much that is bad - is far greater than a Shutdown, which the Dems can easily fix as soon as they come back to Washington!"" Trump said in a separate tweet.

The White House has been laying the groundwork for an emergency declaration, feared by members of both parties.

Senate Homeland Security Committee Chairman Ron Johnson, R-Wis., said he would ""hate to see"" a declaration because then the wall wouldn't get built, presumably because of legal challenges. Democrats voted in the past for border security and should again, he said.

""I actually want to see this wall get built,"" Johnson said. ""I want to keep pressure on Democrats to actually come to the negotiating table in good faith and fund what they have supported in the past.""

But Graham, who favors a presidential declaration, said the time for talk is running out.

""It's the last option, not the first option, but we're pretty close to that being the only option,"" he said.

Graham and Coons spoke on Fox News Sunday. Johnson appeared on CNN's State of the Union."
269,eurasia review,http://www.eurasiareview.com/16012019-president-trumps-losing-strategy-embracing-brazil-and-confronting-china-oped/,"The US embraces a regime doomed to failure and threatens the world's most dynamic economy. President Trump has lauded Brazil's newly elected President Jair Bolsonaro and promises to promote close economic, political, social and cultural ties. In contrast the Trump regime is committed to dismantling China's growth model, imposing harsh and pervasive sanctions, and promoting the division and fragmentation of greater China.

Washington's choice of allies and enemies is based on a narrow conception of short-term advantage and strategic losses.

In this paper we will discuss the reasons why the US-Brazilian relation fits in with Washington's pursuit for global domination and why Washington fears the dynamic growth and challenge of an independent and competitive China.

Brazil's President, Jair Bolsonaro from day one, has announced a program to reverse nearly a century of state directed economic growth. He has announced the privatization of the entire public sector, including the strategic finance, banking, minerals, infrastructure, transport, energy and manufacturing activities. Moreover, the sellout has prioritized the centrality of foreign multi-national corporations. Previous authoritarian civilian and military regimes protected nationalized firms as part of tripartite alliances which included foreign, state and domestic private enterprises.

In contrast to previous elected civilian regimes which strived - not always successfully - to increase pensions, wages and living standards and recognized labor legislation, President Bolsonaro has promised to fire thousands of public sector employees, reduce pensions and increase retirement age while lowering salaries and wages in order to increase profits and lower costs to capitalists.

President Bolsonaro promises to reverse land reform, expell, arrest and assault peasant households in order to re-instate landlords and encourage foreign investors in their place. The deforestation of the Amazon and its handover to cattle barons and land speculators will include the seizure of millions of acres of indigenous land.

In foreign policy, the new Brazilian regime pledges to follow US policy on every strategic issue: Brazil supports Trump's economic attacks on China, embraces Israel's land grabs in the Middle East, (including moving its capital to Jerusalem), back US plots to boycott and policies to overthrow the governments of Cuba, Venezuela and Nicaragua. For the first time, Brazil has offered the Pentagon military bases, and military forces in any and all forthcoming invasions or wars.

The US celebration of President Bolsonaro's gratuitous handovers of resources and wealth and surrender of sovereignty is celebrated in the pages of the Financial Times, the Washington Post and the New York Times who predict a period of growth, investment and recovery - if the regime has the 'courage' to impose its sellout.

As has occurred in numerous recent experiences with right wing neo-liberal regime changes in Argentina, Mexico, Colombia and Ecuador, financial page journalists and experts have allowed their ideological dogma to blind them to the eventual pitfalls and crises.

The Bolsonaro regime's economic policies ignore the fact that they depend on agro- mineral exports to China and compete with US exports ...Brazilian ago-business elites will resent the switch of trading partners.. They will oppose, defeat and undermine Bolsonaro's anti- China campaign if he dares to persists.

Foreign investors will takeover public enterprises but are not likely to expand production given the sharp reduction of employment, salaries and wages, as the consumer market declines.

Banks may make loans but demand high interest rates for high 'risks' especially as the government will face increased social opposition from trade unions and social movements, and greater violence from the militarization of society.

Bolsonaro lacks a majority in Congress who depend on the electoral support of millions of public employees, wage and salaried workers ,pensioners,and gender and racial minorities. Congressional alliance will be difficult without corruption and compromises ...Bolsonaro's cabinet includes several key ministers who are under investigation for fraud and money laundering. His anti-corruption rhetoric will evaporate in the face of judicial investigations and exposés.

Brazil is unlikely to provide any meaningful military forces for regional or international US military adventures. The military agreements with the US will carry little weight in the face of deep domestic turmoil.

Bolsanaro's neo-liberal policies will deepen inequalities especially among the fifty million who have recently risen out of poverty. The US embrace of Brazil will enrich Wall Street who will take the money and run, leaving the US facing the ire and rejection of their failed ally.

Unlike Brazil, China is not prepared to submit to economic plunder and to surrender its sovereignty. China is following its own long-term strategy which focuses on developing the most advanced sectors of the economy - including cutting edge electronics and communication technology.

Chinese researchers already produce more patents and referred scientific articles than the US. They graduate more engineers, advanced researchers and innovative scientists than the US based on high levels of state funding . China with an investment rate of over 44% in 2017, far surpasses the US. China has advanced, from low to high value added exports including electrical cars at competitive prices. For example, Chinese i-phones are outcompeting Apple in both price and quality.

China has opened its economy to US multi-national corporations in exchange for access to advanced technology, what Washington dubs as 'forced' seizures.

China has promoted multi-lateral trade and investment agreement ,including over sixty countries, in large-scale long-term infrastructure agreements throughout Asia and Africa.

Instead of following China's economic example Washington whines of unfair trade, technological theft, market restrictions and state constraints on private investments.

China offers long-term opportunities for Washington to upgrade its economic and social performance - if Washington recognized that Chinese competition is a positive incentive.

Instead of large-scale public investments in upgrading and promoting the export sector, Washington has turned to military threats, economic sanctions and tariffs which protect backward US industrial sectors. Instead of negotiating for markets with an independent China, Washington embraces vassal regimes like Brazil's under newly elected President Jair Bolsonaro who relies on US economic control and takeovers.

The US has an easy path to dominating Brazil for short-term gains - profits, markets and resources, but the Brazilian model is not viable or sustainable. In contrast the US needs to negotiate, bargain and agree to reciprocal competitive agreements with China ..The end result of cooperating with China would allow the US to learn and grow in a sustainable fashion.

Why has the US chosen the road of embracing a backward-looking Brazil rather than a future leader- nation?

Basically, the US is structurally embedded in a high militarized political system which is driven by the quest for world domination - 'imperialism'. The US does not want to compete with an innovative China, it seeks to coerce China to dismantle the institution, policies and priorities which make China great.

Washington demands that China surrender the relative autonomy of the state, increase US penetration of strategic sectors and rely on free market bankers and academics. US economic policy is shaped by bankers,corrupt speculators and lobbyists for special regional interests, including regimes like Israel. China's economic policy is shaped by industrial interests, guided by the strategic goals of the central state authority capable and willing to arrest hundreds of top officials on the take.

The US cannot contain China's upward trajectory with military encirclement - because Beijing's economic strategy neutralizes US military bases and defeats tariff constraints through the diversification of major new trading deals. For example, China is negotiating with India to vastly increase imports of agricultural commodities, including rice, sugar, milk, soy beans meal and cotton.India currently has a major trade deficit with China especially machinery and industrial goods and is eager to replace US exporters China has major trade and investment agreements throughout Southeast Asia, South Korea, Japan, Pakistan, Russia and Australia as well as Africa, Latin America (Brazil and Argentina) and the Middle East (Iran, Iraq and Israel).

The US has little leverage for 'squeezing' China, even in high tech sectors as China is less dependent on the US know-how. Washington has secured agreements with China, increasing exports of cars and entertainment; China can easily agree to enforce curbing so-called 'property theft' especially since it is no longer an important factor since most of China innovations are domestically created. Moreover, big business and Wall Street demand the Trump regime reach an open markets agreement with China and ignore its autarkic enemies.

Given China's continued buoyant economy (6.5% GDP in 2018), its increased emphasis in expanding social services, the consumer market and easing of credit , Trump's coercive tariff policies are doomed and the military threats will only encourage China to expand and upgrade its military defense and superior space programs.

Whatever temporary and limited trade agreements emerge from US-China negotiations, the Trump regime will continue to pursue its unipolar imperial agenda of embracing vassal regimes, like Brazil, and confronting China.

The future belongs to independent, innovative and competitive China not to vassal, militarized and submissive regimes like Brazil."
270,arkansasonline,https://www.arkansasonline.com/news/2018/dec/21/a-brick-in-the-wall-20181221/,"Asked about the nearest restroom in the Parliament building, the Right Honourable F.E. Smith directed a fellow: ""First left, go along the corridor. You'll see a door marked 'gentlemen,' but don't let that deter you.""

We've re-written the lede on this editorial more'n once now. As far as the government shutdown, is you is, or is you ain't? As of this writing, we really don't know. See the front page this morning for the latest. This president changes his mind so often you might need a score card to keep up.

Our considered editorial opinion on the government: Keep it open. The government of the United States needs to be functioning.

And our considered editorial opinion on the border wall with Mexico: Build that baby.

The two don't have to be mutually exclusive. Our president and this Congress just passed major prison reform (on the federal level). They can work together--with a little compromise and a lot less tweeting.

Speaking of a re-write: In January, the price tag for the ""big, beautiful"" wall on the southern border stood at $33 billion. A month later, Republicans were asking for $25 billion. Nearly a year later, the president was asking for $5 billion. We've heard of deflation, but never in government work.

There are many Americans who want the wall on southern border, and justifiably so. The president is right to push for its funding. If some of our friends on the left want to know why, we give them 1986.

President Ronald Reagan and his people agreed to an immigration compromise in the middle of his second term: Amnesty for illegal immigrants already here, in exchange for more border restrictions. But he was out-maneuvered by the Democrats in Congress. Amnesty we got. More border restrictions we didn't.

Ever since, certain wary politicians from a lovely part of the country who happen to be members of a certain starboard-leaning political party have demanded: Enforcement first!

Because the world is not new every morning, as it is for fools and geese. Amnesty could be granted by waving a wand, or at least a government order. But the Congress has to agree to pay for more border security. Republicans are right to be skeptical, even unbelieving, when promises are made to them about future funding. When it comes to border funding and promises, Democrats in Washington, D.C., have proven that they can't be trusted. Fool us once, shame on you . . . .

How many places have had walls protecting national borders, and for how long? Can we include France, Greece, Israel, Norway, Spain . . . Jericho? The building of walls to protect those inside from intruders goes back a way. Any nation ought to be allowed to decide who gets in, and why. Should a nation be allowed to prefer engineers and doctors and computer specialists to, say, unskilled workers? And maybe the next year, open the doors a little wider if unskilled workers are needed at that time? Some say no. And we admit to being confused by their reasoning.

We take Gentle Reader back to 2006, when Dr. Charles Krauthammer wrote this on these pages: ""We essentially have an NFL draft where the United States has the first, oh, million or so draft picks. And rather than exercising those picks, i.e., choosing by whatever criteria we want--such as education, enterprise, technical skills and creativity--we admit the tiniest fraction of the best and brightest and permit millions of the unskilled to pour in instead."" He always put things best.

Now whether this ""wall"" will be, or should be, a wall without scare quotes is another matter. President Trump says he wants an actual, physical wall. Which by some estimates will cost as much as $20 billion to complete. Not to mention annual upkeep. And that's a government estimate. So any honest guess would probably add a few billion to that number.

But a border can also be secured with cameras and drones and wire and patrols. And if those measures only create choke points, that would still make the border manageable, instead of the non-border it is today.

Americans must, one day, get our southern border under control. Unlimited immigration not only hurts workers in this country, it's also dangerous. And rare. We'd refer readers to the borders of other countries all around the world. Even around the liberal democracies who are so practiced at shaming the arrogant Americans for our misdeeds.

These aren't the days of gentlemen in Congress. Security first this time. Which means a real border. Congress has proven time and again it knows how to break promises. On the border wall, the president should keep his.

271,australian financial review,https://www.afr.com/news/politics/world/trump-border-wall-us-government-shutdown-fix-a-line-in-the-sand-for-conservatives-20190111-h19y5h,"Take, for instance, the Securities and Exchange Commission, which has reportedly urged companies that were looking to sell shares on the stock market for the first time this month to delay their IPOs.

Critical jobs such as air traffic controllers are working without pay; national parks are closed; food inspection services have been suspended.

If it keeps going, annual tax refunds could be delayed or even scrapped.

Friday [Saturday AEDT] marks the first missed full pay cheque for many of those employees - a milestone that has already deepened anger among workers about the political stand-off.

Every two weeks it runs - it's now well into its third - economists estimate the shutdown will wipe around 0.1 percentage point from US gross domestic product.

But aside from the real world impacts, the latest periodic display of American political dysfunction provides a masterclass on the changed political reality that now faces the President.

Having comprehensively lost control the House of Representatives in the November midterm elections, power has shifted away from Trump and decisively to the Democrats, who campaigned and won public support on the need to rein in a reckless president.

That loss of control over what gets through Congress has raised the stakes for Trump, whose most important promise to his political base was the construction of a wall along America's 3000-kilometre southern border.

While its effectiveness as a way of preventing illegal migration has always been disputed - many experts and Democrats say the money is better spent on extra security personnel and greater use of modern technology - the wall itself is perhaps the foundational principle of this presidency.

His pitch to the American voters who put him into office only really began once he threw out the idea of ""building a wall"" as he battled to draw attention to himself in a huge field of Republican pretenders in the lead-up to the 2016 primaries.

When it struck a deep chord, the president doubled down, vowing he would build it and, famously, that Mexico would even pay.

Which is why it's staggering that the president has waited until now to push for the $US5.7 billion ($7.9 billion) in funding he says is needed to build the structure - a point many of his normally loyal shock-jock supporters have reminded the president of in recent weeks.

For the past two years the president's party controlled both houses of Congress. Yet little was done by the White House to craft a funding package that included his signature promise.

That delay has been exacerbated by what is now increasingly seen as a serious miscalculation by the White House just before Christmas, when Trump and his strategists decided incoming house speaker Nancy Pelosi would grant the president his wish as soon as she secured her own leadership election.

It's a sign, say analysts, of a president who repeatedly misreads the congress.

You see it in his decision almost a month ago to claim full responsibility for the coming shutdown, to this week's attempt to bludgeon a compromise from Democrats, who still remember the Tea Party's refusal to support President Barack Obama on any issue, regardless of its merits.

The partial shutdown has been in effect since December 22 after an earlier temporary funding measure expired.

Democrat leaders Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer have refused the President's demand to tie the border wall money to the need to reopen the government.

By January 12 the shutdown will become the longest on record, after a week of failed attempts to find common ground.

Trump abruptly walked out of a White House meeting with Pelosi and Schumer on Wednesday calling it a ""total waste of time"" after the duo again refused his demands to fund the wall.

""Nancy said, NO. I said bye-bye,"" he wrote. ""Nothing else works!""

Fuming, Trump said he found China to be ""far more honourable than cryin' Chuck and Nancy"".

""I really do. I think that China is actually much easier to deal with than the opposition party.""

For her part Pelosi hit back, digging at the president's comfortable upbringing, unlike many of the unpaid federal workers.

""He thinks maybe they could just ask their father for more money. But they can't,"" she said.

As the tit-for-tat continued, Trump tried to increase pressure on Democrats - and importantly, galvanise a growing list of Republicans fearful of a backlash from furloughed federal workers in their own districts - by taking to prime time television for his first-ever address to the nation.

On Thursday he flew to Texas to investigate what he and his supporters repeatedly describe as a ""crisis"" and ""emergency"" on the border.

""There is no reason why we can't come to a deal"" with Democrats, Trump said as he flew out of Washington. ""But you have another side that doesn't care about border security ... they don't give a damn about crime ... they don't care about gang members coming in and stabbing people, and cutting people up.""

For all the heated rhetoric, Trump is struggling to convince voters that the crisis is stark enough to justify shutting down parts of the government indefinitely.

An average of polls taken since it began shows Americans blame Republicans, with 50 per cent saying Trump himself is most to blame, and 35 per cent fingering Democrats.

Part of that is because there is little evidence that illegal border crossings have become more frequent. Government figures show arrests rates have been steady at around 400,000 a year, down from over a million in the 1990s.

The impasse - and the damage it is causing the president - mean Trump now has only one option to extract himself from what many see as a self-inflicted crisis.

Expectations are high that Trump will in coming days act on his threat to reach for the so-called nuclear option; by declaring a national emergency so he can commandeer resources from others parts of the government such as Defense to build his wall.

""I have the absolute right to declare a national emergency,"" he said on Thursday. ""I haven't done it yet. I may do it. If this doesn't work out, probably I will do it. I would almost say definitely.""

Used in the past for crises such as the 9/11 terrorist attacks, and to impose foreign sanctions or freeze assets, such presidential decrees have always been sparingly applied.

But for Trump and even the Democrats who will almost certainly challenge any move to bypass Congress, pulling that trigger would give the president a win in the eyes of his supporters.

If the effort is ultimately struck down by the courts, Trump will be able to blame the judiciary and tell his supporters that he did everything he could in his powers to build the wall.

Equally, Democrats will have been seen to stand firm against the President's demands.

But more importantly, by expanding the use of ""national emergency"" declarations to include a slow-burning crisis such as border security, Trump would have established a major precedent for future presidents. That hasn't been lost on his conservative critics.

Many Republicans are worried that a Democrat president would one day use the same logic to impose laws against the will of Congress on issues such as healthcare or climate change.

While the declaration would provide a short-term political solution for Trump, it's long-term consequences would be profound. Not least because it would weaken the traditional role of Congress to fund government, and shift that power towards the president.

For genuine conservatives, that should be a line in the sand."

The move will cause pain to those working-class communities, and since it runs counter to President Donald Trump's rhetoric about restoring manufacturing jobs, you knew it would instigate a Twitter tirade.

But you also know that for GM to remain a leader and survive the next potential recession without another bailout, this is what it must do.

It's not enough, though. Investors show little faith in the long-term earnings prospects of US automakers, and the $US6 billion ($8.65 billion) in annual savings you project from the plant closures probably isn't enough to truly transform GM.

Meanwhile in China, the electric-car market is booming, but the Chevy Bolt isn't. You must work faster to get costs under control and pursue a profitable electric-vehicle strategy unencumbered by White House bluster and an outdated image of GM.

Aquarius is the visionary of the zodiac, and that trait was on display in your dealmaking at Disney.

First with Pixar, then Marvel and Lucasfilm (""Star Wars""), your acquisitions have allowed the company to dominate the box office and continue drawing swarms of fans to Disney's theme parks.

But your vision is less understood when it comes to your recent $US85 billion takeover of 21st Century Fox's TV and film studios.

In theory, owning these assets will cement Disney's position as it pursues a new audience of TV streamers through the soon-to-come Disney+ app.

Yet, this megadeal and Disney+ also complicate a previously meticulous strategy.

This year, you must focus on tidying up the Magic Kingdom so that its success can outlast your time at the helm.

Retirement is just a couple of years away and there's much work to be done, including grooming a successor.

That will only get more difficult if Disney+ causes strife within the empire by forcing different divisions to compete for content and resources.

You must also take care not to alienate fans as you start to preserve some of Disney's best movies and TV shows for the app.

More reflection on this new streaming strategy may serve the company - and your legacy - better in the long run.

Pisces, you'll set the tone for the year early on when you unveil your much-anticipated plan for steering the embattled industrial giant out of its current crisis.

You've made some missteps in your first few months as CEO: you ruled out an equity raise only to put one back on the table; your attempt to ease investors' anxiety via a CNBC appearance backfired; and your decision to re-hire a long-time insider to chair the eyesore gas-turbine business confounded investors expecting deep-rooted cultural change.

But there have also been signs of progress, including your decision to appoint a power and insurance expert to the board and to start shopping for a new auditor.

To regain investors' confidence, you must inject more transparency into GE's earnings, provide clarity on its liabilities and, most importantly, present a viable plan for reducing its bloated debt load.

An equity raise would give you breathing room, as would scrapping the spinoff portion of a planned GE Healthcare divestiture.

But your most difficult challenge is finding a way to balance restructuring and debt repayment with growth investments, so that whatever remains of GE once you're done has a competitive leg to stand on.

The past few years have a been a struggle, but an Aries doesn't back down.

Just when you finished cleaning house at Viacom and started seeing the fruit of the regime change, arguably worse problems arose at CBS.

Now, with the removal of Les Moonves following the numerous sexual-misconduct allegations made against him, and the overhaul of a board that had turned hostile to you, you're probably through the worst of it.

CBS is in culture-repair mode, and Viacom is making progress turning around its Paramount film studio and ramping up TV production.

Still, you know that neither company can thrive on its own in the long run as Disney and AT&T get bigger and join Netflix and Amazon.com in streaming domination.

This is the year to finally do what you've long wanted - to recombine CBS and Viacom.

It may even make sense to form a three-way merger involving CBS's new chairman, Strauss Zelnick, and his $US12 billion video-game company, Take-Two Interactive Software as another step toward building direct-to-consumer relationships.

Scale and content are the themes in the industry, and CBS and Viacom could use more of both. Take your cue from the ram and charge ahead.

You have difficult days ahead. While you imagined this would be one of the most exciting times for AT&T, the stock instead finished 2018 near an almost eight-year low.

Investors don't yet grasp your vision for turning a stable wireless-service carrier into a cyclical and challenged media conglomerate that is now trying to go head-to-head with Disney, Netflix and Amazon - especially when Verizon Communications seems to be moving in the opposite direction.

The pressure is on to prove that the Time Warner assets and beleaguered DirecTV business can both flourish within AT&T, and also that the company's mountain of debt and wireless spending needs - related to the crucial build-out of AT&T's 5G network - won't get in the way of shareholders' beloved dividend payments.

You'll launch a new video-streaming service in 2019 that will offer three pricing tiers with varying assortments of movies and shows, which does help attract a wider audience and serves as a threat to other offerings out there.

But it may also cause further confusion for consumers in an already muddled marketplace of streaming packages.

There's little room for error, so in the event of any unforeseen setbacks or economic disruptions, you may have to look to the dividend as the sacrificial lamb.

Geminis are said to always be looking for their other half, and it's true that you've been no stranger to corporate tie-ups.

You built Alliance Boots through mergers, then combined it with Walgreens four years ago.

But lately, the company has taken a back seat from dealmaking, preferring partnerships over acquisitions, while others in the health-care space have done industry-shifting vertical megadeals.

Rival CVS Health Corp is re-imagining the health-care business with its $US77 billion takeover of insurer Aetna.

Meanwhile, Walgreens was left with a consolation prize of just under 2000 Rite Aid stores after regulators stood in the way of a larger transaction between the pharmacy chains.

Since then, you've been talking with Humana about taking mutual investment stakes and expanding an existing senior-focused health-care alliance.

You argue that partnerships provide many of the advantages of a merger without having to shell out billions of dollars, and you're not wrong about that.

But they are fundamentally half-measures that may leave Walgreens ill-prepared to deal with the retail and pharmacy threat of Amazon, and the heft of other vertically consolidated health-care giants.

Like your Gemini peer above, you have been forging alliances with businesses around your industry, seeking to remake Altria as cigarettes become less relevant and a real cannabis industry rises from their ashes.

Altria hasn't often made big acquisitions, but in 2018 that changed as you recognised the urgent need to diversify Altria's portfolio of Marlboro cigarettes, Skoal rings and other traditional tobacco products.

First, Altria agreed to pay $US1.8 billion for a 45 per cent stake in Cronos Group , one of Canada's fast-growing cannabis producers.

Just a few weeks later, you closed a $US12.8 billion deal for a 35 per cent stake in Juul Labs , the maker of electronic cigarettes that are popular among younger smokers.

It was a smart move; the only question is, why did you stop at 35 per cent?

Buying Juul Labs outright may be down the road, and it would even be a logical precursor to a recombination with Philip Morris International.

The two of you are already partnering on the iQos tobacco-heating device to target older smokers, a product that may complement Juul's.

Deepening all these ties would give you greater control over Altria's future.

Cancers can be a bit impulsive - like the times you picked fights with sell-siders, spelunkers and the SEC, tweeted out ""funding secured"" and blazed up live on air.

Tesla's shareholders were understandably unnerved by some of your actions in 2018, but all seemingly was forgiven after unexpectedly good third-quarter results,

That was until this week, when shares plunged more than 8 per cent after you reported that Model 3 deliveries had missed forecasts.

What the performance outlook is from here will be the big question for 2019.

The picture is hazy, with federal tax credits for Tesla's vehicles due to decline and Model 3 sales likely shifting toward lower-spec versions (though the vaunted $US35,000 version remains elusive).

Another, related, mystery is whether Tesla will raise more capital. You say it isn't necessary, but prudence suggests Tesla should have capitalised on its sky-high stock price and sold more already.

You closed the year in unexpected, yet familiar, fashion by sending a modified Model X on a bumpy ride through a short Boring Co tunnel in Los Angeles, thereby demonstrating a new future for transportation, we are told.

As useful as an uneventful 2019 might be, that's the one thing we can't see in the stars.

Your nearly seven years leading IBM have been defined by falling revenue, massive cost cuts and a stream of hogwash about how IBM is transforming into a technology leader.

It is not. But then, Leo, you roared in 2018 by striking a $US34 billion acquisition of business-software firm Red Hat.

It was one of the largest corporate acquisitions of the year, and by far the largest in IBM's 107-year history.

The price you paid was steep, but an expensive roll of the dice is better than the status quo, and IBM and Red Hat together would seem to make a more compelling cloud-computing alternative than they could on their own.

Your legacy rests on proving that the combined company can become a go-to shepherd for corporations that badly want to modernise their technology.

Right now, that role is mostly filled by rivals such as Microsoft and Oracle.

Leos are reputed to be fierce and passionate, and you'll need all those qualities and more to integrate the two wildly different cultures of IBM and Red Hat, and keep IBM going well into its second century.

Virgo, you'll turn 89 this year, making it more important than ever that Berkshire Hathaway's next generation of leadership be given a chance to get properly acquainted with investors.

Virgos are known to be methodical perfectionists, a quality that's been key to your decades of successful investing and dealmaking, but you could do better when it comes to messaging around your succession plan.

You aren't ready to pass the torch and there's no sign you need to, but at least start to share the stage at appearances like Berkshire's annual investor meeting.

Greg Abel and Ajit Jain, the executives you'll most likely name as your replacements, were notably absent from the feature moment of last year's meeting - the Q&A session - which draws investors from around the world looking to hear your market musings, outlook for Berkshire's array of businesses and about your hunt for takeover targets.

After the S&P 500 index fell in 2018 by the most since the financial crisis, it's time to strike at least one last megadeal.

To put a dent in Berkshire's cash, which long ago reached unproductive levels, would be the greatest gift to your successor so that he's not left to resort to a large dividend payout.

Surely there are some Buffett-worthy bargains out there now - perhaps even one from this old wish list.

Netflix has tried to give TV fans close to everything they want at an affordable price and without ads.

It's only appropriate that as co-founder and CEO of the business, you're a Libra, a sign characterised by people-pleasers.

But in 2019, the sustainability of Netflix's generosity - and that of its lenders - will be tested.

Disney and AT&T are both launching streaming services aimed at Netflix's Achilles' heel: Many of its most-watched shows are the property of other companies, such as Disney and AT&T, that are in the early days of cutting off their supply to Netflix and confining their content to their own products.

You've tried to neutralise some of that competition by signing deals directly with top content creators.

Netflix's value proposition may also still ultimately be better for consumers should it sustain the variety and breadth of its library.

However, as subscriber growth slows and some users defect to these new services, you may need to turn to price increases.

Investors have always explained away Netflix's cash burn rate, but they may not be so willing to give the benefit of the doubt when Disney starts flexing its muscle.

In your seven years in the corner office, the challenges have never been more daunting than they are now, and I know that can sting, Scorpio.

Apple propelled itself into the most profitable company in the US - and the most valuable in the world, until recently - thanks to the sales power of the iPhone, but it's running out of steam.

Investors believe iPhone sales will decline in 2019, and it'll be tough for Apple to make up the difference with your higher-priced phones.

You don't typically make big-ticket acquisitions, but the Apple holiday helpers have been busy writing cheques not for companies, but for high-profile projects for Apple's coming Netflix-like web video service.

There's programming coming from Oprah Winfrey, from the ""Peanuts"" cartoon kids, an elephant documentary and a lot more.

You might need a strategy to go with that high-priced programming, though. With investors betting that Apple's growth relies on its ability to sell subscriptions to web video, news and other internet services, all eyes are on how you'll manage to offset the waning growth of the smartphone product that delivers two-thirds of Apple's revenue.

That's why Fidelity in 2018 pioneered the zero-fee index fund, bringing the management cost war to its logical conclusion.

But now may not be the best time to try to pitch investors a broad market index fund.

Those products launched in August, just one month before the S&P 500 index peaked at its record high and then sold off.

Volatile environments are when Fidelity's stock pickers have shined brightest - that's how the firm built its reputation, after all.

If things remain rocky, will you try to get your zero-cost funds out of the limelight and pivot back to the active management side of the business?

That's more than enough to keep you busy in the new year, but as the most powerful woman in investing, you also have a platform to help fix the gender imbalance on Wall Street.

Fund management is still a men's club, even though diversity and client returns are shown to go hand in hand.

Even your firm has grappled with cultural issues following allegations of sexual harassment made against former portfolio managers.

Continue to help Fidelity do its part as the industry - and the business world as a whole - slowly becomes a more equitable place."
273,champaign news-gazette,http://www.news-gazette.com/news/2019-01-11/work-superfund-sites-suspended-during-shutdown.html,"BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) -- The government shutdown has suspended federal cleanups at Superfund sites around the nation and forced the cancellation of public hearings, deepening the mistrust and resentment of surrounding residents who feel people in power long ago abandoned them to live among the toxic residue of the country's factories and mines.

""We are already hurting, and it's just adding more fuel to the fire,"" says 40-year-old Keisha Brown, whose wood-frame home is in a community nestled among coking plants and other factories on Birmingham's north side.

The mostly African-American community has been forced to cope with high levels of arsenic, lead and other contaminants in the soil that the Environmental Protection Agency has been scraping up and carting away, house by house.

As President Donald Trump and Congress battle over Trump's demand for a wall on the southern U.S. border, the 3-week-old partial government shutdown has stopped federal work on Superfund sites except for cases where the administration deems ""there is an imminent threat to the safety of human life or to the protection of property.""

EPA's shutdown plans said the agency would evaluate about 800 Superfund sites to see how many could pose an immediate threat. As an example of that kind of threat, it cited an acid leak from a mine that could threaten the public water supply. That's the hazard at Northern California's Iron Mountain mine, where EPA workers help prevent an unending flow of lethally acidic runoff off the Superfund site from spilling into rivers downstream.

Practically speaking, said Bonnie Bellow, a former EPA official who worked on Superfund public outreach at the agency, the impact of the stoppage of work at sites across the nation ""wholly depends"" on the length of the shutdown.

""Unless there is immediate risk like a storm, a flood, a week or two of slowdowns is not going to very likely affect the cleanup at the site,"" Bellow said.

In north Birmingham, Brown said it's been a couple of weeks since she's spotted any EPA crews at people's houses. It was unclear if state workers or contractors were continuing work.

But long before the shutdown began, Brown harbored doubts the cleanup was working anyway.

""My main concern is the health of the people out here,"" said Brown, who has asthma. ""All of us are sick, and we've got to function on medicine every day.""

In terms of time, the federal government shutdown is a chronological blip in the long history of the site -- which includes ethics charges in a local bribery scandal to block federal cleanup efforts -- but adds to the uncertainty in an area where residents feel forgotten and betrayed.

At the EPA, the shutdown has furloughed the bulk of the agency's roughly 14,000 employees. It also means the EPA isn't getting most of the daily stream of environmental questions and tips from the public. Routine inspections aren't happening. State, local and private emails to EPA officials often get automated messages back promising a response when the shutdown ends.

In Montana, for instance, state officials this month found themselves fielding calls from a tribal member worried about drinking water with a funny look to it, said Kristi Ponozzo, public-policy director at that state's Department of Environmental Quality. The EPA normally provides tribes with technical assistance on water supplies.

With most EPA colleagues idled, Ponozzo said, her agency also had to call off an environmental review meeting for a mining project, potentially delaying the project.

But it's the agency's work at Superfund sites -- lessening the threat from old nuclear-weapons plants, chemical factories, mines and other entities -- that gets much of the attention.

Absent imminent peril, it would be up to state governments or contractors to continue any cleanup during the shutdown ""up to the point that additional EPA direction or funding is needed,"" the EPA said in a statement.

""Sites where cleanup activities have been stopped or shut down will be secured until cleanup activities are able to commence when the federal government reopens,"" the agency said.

For federal Superfund sites in Michigan, the shutdown means there are no EPA colleagues to consult, said Scott Dean, a spokesman for that state's Department of Environmental Quality.

At Michigan Superfund sites, day-to-day field operations were continuing since private contractors do most of the on-the-ground work, Dean said.

Bellow, the former EPA official, said the cancellation of hearings about Superfund sites posed immediate concerns.

In East Chicago, Indiana, for example, the EPA called off a planned public hearing set for last Wednesday to outline how the agency planned to clean up high levels of lead and arsenic in the soil.

The EPA has proposed a seven-month, $26.5 million cleanup that includes treating and removing tainted soil from the area, where a lead smelter was located.

During a public meeting Nov. 29, some residents complained that the EPA's approach would leave too much pollution in place. But others didn't get a chance to speak and were hoping to do so at the meeting this week, said Debbie Chizewer, a Northwestern University environmental attorney who represents community groups in the low-income area.

The EPA announced the cancellation in an online notice and gave no indication that it would be rescheduled.

Leaders of the East Chicago Calumet Community Advisory Group asked for a new hearing date and an extension of a Jan. 14 public comment deadline in a letter to the EPA's regional Superfund division.

Calls by The Associated Press to the agency's regional office in Chicago this week were not answered.

Local critics fear the EPA will use the delay caused by the shutdown as justification for pushing ahead with a cleanup strategy they consider flawed, Chizewer said, even though the agency has designated the affected area as an ""environmental justice community,"" a low-income community of color that has been disproportionately harmed by pollution.

The EPA has a ""special obligation"" when dealing with such communities, Chizewer said. ""This would be an example of shutting them out for no good reason.""

In North Birmingham, former longtime neighborhood resident Charlie Powell said most of the people living in and around the Superfund site had already ""just got tired and fed up.""

Powell left the area but started a group called PANIC, People Against Neighborhood Industrial Contamination. He said he believes money would be better spent helping residents move away from the pollution.

""Can I say hell?"" Powell said when asked what residents have been through.

274,bradenton herald,https://www.bradenton.com/news/politics-government/national-politics/article224069750.html,"With illegal immigration at its lowest level in a decade, it's nothing short of stunning that the federal government is shut down over funding for a border wall.

Yet here we are, entering a third week of the shutdown because President Donald Trump has inexplicably chosen to dig his heels in on getting $5 billion to build a wall along stretches of the U.S. border with Mexico that do not already have such a barrier in place.

""As long as it takes,"" Trump said last week when asked how long he was willing to let the shutdown last. ""I mean, look, I'm prepared. I think the people of the country think I'm right. I think the people of this country think I'm right.""

Except, polling shows the opposite. Major polls conducted last month by Quinnipiac, Harvard, NPR and others all showed that a majority of Americans do not support the wall. And the number of wall supporters shrinks even more when asked if it is worth shutting down the government over.

The reality is that immigration from Mexico has been decreasing since 2007, and the number of unauthorized immigrants living in the U.S. is at its lowest level since 2004, according to the Pew Research Center.

Further, the majority of illegal immigration to the United States from Mexico occurs in and around heavily secured ports of entry like San Diego, El Paso and Brownsville, Texas, where 654 miles of wall, fencing and other barriers already exist. Spending billions to build a structure along vast, rural stretches of the border doesn't help with security at the sections of the border that most need help.

No one is arguing for unsecure borders. The newly installed Democratic Congress voted Thursday to approve a stopgap funding bill that would reopen the federal government and provide $1.3 billion for border security in the form of manpower and equipment but not a wall. Trump has said he won't sign it, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell refuses to let a bill come to the Senate floor that the president won't sign.

It's hard to know what the president's end game is. He couldn't get the border wall approved when Republicans controlled both the House and the Senate, so it seems odd to take this stance on the heels of a midterm election in which Democrats made their biggest gains in 40 years and took control of the House.

Trump may feel he is being true to his base of ardent supporters, among whom the border wall ranked high on their list of priorities. But his focus is sorely misplaced. Rather, his attention should be focused on the independent voters who took a chance on him in 2016 believing his style could prove effective at getting things done in Washington. Shutting down the federal government in an effort to get $5 billion for a wall that most Americans don't feel the country needs is the opposite of getting things done.

Laura Kelly is already on the case for Kansas kids with decision to name new DCF leader ' The Kansas City Star

This is why voters elected incoming Gov. Laura Kelly: Because we need to do so much better for Kansas children, because we badly need transparency in state government and because there is zero time to waste in recovering all that was lost under Governors Sam Brownback and Jeff Colyer.

So good for her for marching so briskly into 2019. On Thursday, Kelly announced that she will replace Gina Meier-Hummel as head of the state's child welfare system. The Kansas Department for Children and Families was on what seemed like permanent crisis footing long before Meier-Hummel got there in fall of 2017. But it has remained troubled under her sometimes questionable leadership, and a change was in order.

Meier-Hummel had a difficult job and did make some improvements, which began with a top-to-bottom audit.

But she talked about transparency and didn't show enough of it. She decided to hire inexperienced and unlicensed social workers to fill jobs investigating reports of abuse and neglect. And she replaced contracts for foster care, family preservation and other services with grants that got around rules on no-bid arrangements.

Kelly asked the Colyer administration that she'll soon supplant -- in 11 days, her announcement noted, and we're glad she's counting -- not to implement those grants at this point. Meier-Hummel immediately said she'd honor that request.

The governor-elect also said outright that the state's procurement process wasn't followed and that agency officials had tried to keep her from learning more about how the grantees were chosen.

We wanted Kelly to clean house and name names, for the sake of the state's struggling families, and she's already doing that.

As The Star has reported, the agency gave a major grant to a Florida nonprofit already facing heavy criticism for its foster care. An agency spokeswoman argued that they'd been hired to provide family preservation services, not foster care, but it's still the same nonprofit group.

Meier-Hummel will be succeeded on an interim basis by Laura Howard, who for now will head both the DCF and the Kansas Department for Aging and Disability Services. A former regional administrator in a federal agency overseeing substance abuse and mental health services, Howard is currently director of the Public Management Center in the School of Public Affairs and Administration at the University of Kansas.

Meier-Hummel responded to Kelly's no-nonsense announcement with a news release of her own. It listed her achievements, including starting a new Wichita abuse and neglect reporting line, ""changing key policies and procedures and implementing further mandated training"" and reducing the number of missing and runaway kids by just over a quarter. The suspended grants are in the ""absolute best interest"" of Kansas children and families, the DCF's announcement said.

That's a matter of opinion, but ours is that Kelly has done the right thing and is off to a promising start even before being sworn in as governor."
275,renewamerica.com,http://www.renewamerica.com/columns/keyes/190108,"Alan Keyes blasts 'globalist elitist faction' hoping to end U.S. sovereignty

By Alan Keyes

President Trump continues to refine the substance behind the ""Wall"" meme he has used so effectively to dramatize the urgent need to regain control of our nation's southern border. In an article I wrote in January of last year, I observed and supported his efforts to do so:

Whatever lies they tell America's citizenry, the Democrat Party's contingent in Congress supports the globalist elitist faction's effort to surrender control of the borders of our country, along with the sovereignty of the people of the United States. If President Trump succeeds in his efforts to refortify our borders, that success will thwart the effort to bring down the government - of, by, and for the people - that the U.S. Constitution is supposed to implement. This will thwart the globalists' scheme to put the UN in charge of regulating the flow of migrants into the U.S.

As the globalist former German Prime Minister Angela Merkel recently admitted, President Trump's policies are already thwarting the imposition of the so-called ""New"" World Order. Actually, it aims to return all the earth to age-old oligarchic despotism. Indeed, the new technologies of the information age empower elitists to impose more pervasive and effective totalitarian control than ever before.

As Merkel asserts, President Trump's resolve to defend our sovereignty as a free people shatter this totalitarian elitist nightmare. That resolve could allow us to preserve our Union, reassert effective control over all its territory and preserve intact the representative, democratic republic ordained and established by the U.S. Constitution. But if the elitist totalitarians succeed in wresting sovereign control from our constitutional self-government, they will be in a position to pressure our Union until it disintegrates. With ""sanctuary cities"" and states abetting illegal immigration in defiance of federal law, that disintegration has already begun.

It is exacerbated by the encouragement of ""identity politics."" However specious in fact, such politics relies on ideological memes that emphatically discard any effort to promote and maintain the sense of common humanity that must inform our identity as a people. Instead, ""identity politics"" promotes into matters of public policy, strenuous, angry, and sometimes violent racial, ethnic, and even whimsically individual sensitivities. This is bound to foment intractable strife, given the multi-ethnic composition of our population. As issues for public law and enforcement, rather than private choice, agreement, and mutual self-arbitration, such sensitivities foment the disintegration of our body politic. This is precisely the result elitist faction globalists mean to produce.

With this aim in mind, they fund and organize the push to erase our borders and increase the flow of illegal immigration into our country. But if President Trump's policies for border control succeed, that will thwart both results. With the flow of illegals curtailed, our electoral process will be less susceptible to illegal manipulation by blatantly anti-constitutional schemers eager to allow illegal immigrants to vote in our national elections. Their actions are already tainting our electoral outcomes, as the mess in Broward County, Florida, during the recent midterms made abundantly clear.

President Trump's use of the ""Wall"" meme effectively highlights the purpose of securing our safety and sovereignty as a people. It focuses the mind on what is ultimately at stake. Along with their media parrots, elitist faction tools in both the Democratic and Republican parties want everyone to see the issue simply in terms of people striving to escape poverty by coming to the United States. But the strategic objective of the globalist totalitarian elitists who are exploiting, organizing, and leading them against our borders is to overthrow the sovereignty of the American people. So, in fact, they seek to erase the experiment in constitutional, republican, and democratic government that allowed Americans to produce the stable, energetic regime of individual liberty that has made us the focus of hope for people elsewhere still harshly burdened by oppressive elitist tyrannies.

Democrats who refuse to give priority to restoring control of our borders should be called to account for what, in effect, amounts to aiding and abetting elitists' scheme to discredit and erase our right use of freedom. Their pretense of compassion for people seeking a better life serves to mask the real objective, which is to reassert the age-old lie that regular folks must depend, for their safety, on the wicked rule of elite, self-worshiping tyrants, whose abuse of power inevitably destroys the happiness of the people they purport to secure. The people of the United States are the one people in the history of the earth who, by their self-government, combined safety and happiness, with results that approve the right of all humanity to live without the insult of dictatorship, no matter what party or demagogue offers to impose it upon them.

That result required a combination of goodwill, prevalent decency, and courage Americans have, in the past, always managed to achieve. The battle over funding for the ""Wall"" requires that we do so now. Some call it Trump's Wall. But it actually represents the resolve of the American people. Will we hold fast to the God-endowed responsibilities and hopes we more than once secured and which our Constitution challenges us to pass to our posterity? Or will we succumb to the deceitful slurs of treacherous leaders who deplore our decent liberty and think they now stand on the brink of extinguishing it?

President Trump's insistence on controlling our borders offers Americans the chance to prove the elitists wrong - but only if the people who elected him work strenuously to encourage and support his stand. If the government shutdown is prolonged, so be it. After all, self-government requires, from time to time, that a people determined to be free prove that it knows how to survive without any government but what corresponds to their own goodwill.

276,bradenton herald,https://www.bradenton.com/news/politics-government/national-politics/article224499960.html,"Congress returns to Washington for its first full week of legislative business since control of the House reverted to Democrats, but lawmakers will be confronted with the same lingering question: When will the partial government shutdown end?

One Republican senator says he's offered President Donald Trump a possible solution, though it may just be wishful thinking.

Sen. Lindsey Graham is encouraging Trump to reopen government for several weeks to continue negotiating with Democrats over the border wall Trump wants to build on the U.S.-Mexico border. If there's no deal at the end of that time, Graham says Trump would be free to take the more dramatic step of declaring a national emergency to build it.

But the South Carolina Republican says Trump still wants a deal on funding for the wall before agreeing to reopen shuttered government departments. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat, insists Trump reopen the government first.

Their weeks-old standoff led to the partial government shutdown, now on day 24 without a clear end in sight.

""Before he pulls the plug on the legislative option, and I think we're almost there, I would urge him to open up the government for a short period of time, like three weeks, before he pulls the plug, see if we can get a deal,"" Graham said. ""If we can't at the end of three weeks, all bets are off.

""See if he can do it by himself through the emergency powers. That's my recommendation,"" added Graham, who has publicly pushed Trump to use his authority to declare a national emergency to build the wall. Such a step would allow Trump to bypass Congress and tap various pots of unspent federal money, including for military construction and disaster relief as well as from assets seized by law enforcement, to pay for the wall.

Trump has kept Washington on edge over whether he would resort to such a declaration, citing what he says is a ""crisis"" of drug smuggling and the trafficking of women and children at the border. The president initially sounded as though such a move was imminent, but then pulled back. He has said several times since he first mentioned the idea in public this month that he prefers a legislative solution.

A key question is how much more time is Trump willing to give lawmakers. Graham, who spoke with Trump by telephone on Sunday morning, said the legislative path ""is just about shut off"" and blamed intransigence by Pelosi.

The speaker's office had no immediate comment.

Democrats oppose an emergency declaration but may be powerless to block it. Some Republicans are wary, too, fearing how a future Democratic president might use that authority. Such a move, should Trump ultimately go that route, would almost certainly be challenged in the courts.

Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., called Graham's idea to reopen the government a ""great place to start.""

""I do think if we reopen the government, if the president ends this shutdown crisis, we have folks who can negotiate a responsible, modern investment in technology that will actually make us safer,"" Coons said.

Trump says technology is nice, but that the border can't be secured without a wall.

The White House has been laying the groundwork for an emergency declaration, which is feared by lawmakers in both parties.

Senate Homeland Security Committee Chairman Ron Johnson, R-Wis., said he'd ""hate to see"" a declaration issued because the wall wouldn't get built, presumably because of legal challenges. Democrats voted in the past for border security and should again, he said.

""I actually want to see this wall get built,"" Johnson said. ""I want to keep pressure on Democrats to actually come to the negotiating table in good faith and fund what they have supported in the past.""

Graham favors a declaration and said the time for talk is running out.

""It's the last option, not the first option, but we're pretty close to that being the only option,"" he said.

Graham and Coons spoke on ""Fox News Sunday"" and Johnson appeared on CNN's ""State of the Union."""

As President Donald Trump is said to be mulling ""other options"" for funding his border wall between the U.S. and Mexico, according to the Associated Press, a dark horse arises on the internet.

A GoFundMe campaign popped up Sunday, hoping to raise funds for Trump's proposed wall between the U.S. and Mexico, which isn't news in and of itself. There are plenty of those around.

But the organizers of this campaign are so encouraged that they've raised more-than $700,000 in just three days that they've bumped their original goal of $200 million up to a cool billion.

The GoFundMe organizer is listed as triple-amputee Air Force veteran Brian Kolfage, who lost both legs and his right arm in a blast at Balad Air Force Base in Iraq in 2004, according to the Arizona Daily Star.

The contact listing for the organizer says ""The Wall Funding Team"" is located in Miramar, Fla.

""As a veteran who has given so much, 3 limbs, I feel deeply invested to this nation to ensure future generations have everything we have today,"" Kolfage wrote in the GoFundMe campaign description. ""Too many Americans have been murdered by illegal aliens and too many illegals are taking advantage of the United States taxpayers with no means of ever contributing to our society.

""I have grandparents who immigrated to America legally, they did it the correct way and it's time we uphold our laws, and get this wall BUILT! It's up to Americans to help out and pitch in to get this project rolling.""

Multiple studies and reports have shown, though, that illegal immigrants commit crime, violent or nonviolent, at lesser rates than do native-born Americans.

Kolfage's GoFundMe campaign was listed as the ""Top fundraiser"" on the front page of the crowd-sourced social fundraising website as of Wednesday afternoon, despite Kolfage's claims that the platform was trying to hide his fundraiser from potential donors.

Kolfage's Facebook page, where he posts content relevant to his conservative political beliefs, has more than 90,000 followers.

""We have contacted the Trump Administration to secure a point of contact where all funds will go upon completion,"" the campaign says. ""When get this information secured we will update. We have many very high level contacts already helping."""

Background to President Trump's phenomenal 2nd year in office

With the Christmas holiday of 2018 coming to an end, the Trump Administration has unarguably accomplished more in its first two years than any other Presidency in American history. Following a triumphal first year in office, President Trump's second year was one marked with unprecedented achievements that surpassed expectations and broke records. Since being elected to public office on Friday January 20th 2017, President Trump and his Administration have highlighted virtually every major achievement fulfilling the many bold campaign promises made during the historic 2016 Presidential election. Despite the habitual persistence of the Fake News media outlets (CNN, ABC, MSNBC, New York Times, Washington Post, Huffington Post, etc) and obstructionist Democrats to portray the Trump Presidency in a negative light, or the Machiavellian efforts of the Federal Reserve to arbitrarily raise interest rates, the American economy has ascended to its highest levels and more Americans have entered the workforce now more than ever before in history.

Despite being abused, ignored and belittled by many of our global enemies in recent years, the United States now stands as a greater threat to our foreign adversaries and a far greater defender of our real and faithful allies. Thankfully, the Washington Examiner is one of the few newspapers to compile an updated list detailing most of Trump's greatest accomplishments since taking office nearly 2 years ago; a list of incredible achievements entirely overlooked by the mainstream liberal media. I will examine the Washington Examiner's findings and categorize the greatest of Trump's historic second year achievements and how they have impacted the United States economy, national security, budget, immigration reform, and more during 2018.

Trump Year 2 Achievements

GDP Growth: In August, the Commerce Department announces that U.S Gross Domestic Product (GDP) surges to a record 4.2% growth for second quarter earnings. This milestone marks the first time in over a decade that growth exceeds more than 3%.

Consumer Confidence: Consumer Confidence rises to its highest level in 18 years. The Conference Board revealed that its Consumer Confidence index increased to a reading of 137.9 in October, the highest reading since September 2000.

Stock Market: The U.S stock market crashed multiple records throughout 2018, especially in October when the Dow Jones Industrial Average on Wednesday finished at a record high for the 15th time this year as investors were cheered even greater economic success. The Dow reached its highest level in October 2018, with Treasury yields rising at its highest since the day after President Trump was elected in 2017.

American Jobs: An enormous 4 million new jobs have been created since Trump took office. More people are employed than ever before in the nation's history, while the U.S faces its lowest levels of unemployment since 1969. Job openings in the country reached an all-time high and outnumber job seekers for the first time on record. Black (5.9%), Hispanic (4.5%), and Asian American (2%) unemployment levels have plummeted to its lowest numbers in history. In addition to this, female unemployment dropped to its lowest levels (3.6%) in May 2018 since October 1953 and youth (18 years and under) dropped to its lowest unemployment in 50 years.

The unemployment rate for Americans without a high school diploma reached a record 18-year low 3.5%. Rate for disabled Americans recently hit a record low. Optimism for finding good available jobs climbed 25% in May. President Trump has reopened America's factories, with the rate of manufacturing jobs surging to a record high in two decades. In August, wages arose to its fastest rate since June 2009, with the Council of Economic Advisers discovering that real wage compensation has grown by 1.4 % throughout the year. Homeownership reached its highest levels for Hispanic Americans in history, while the poverty rate for Hispanics along with Blacks have reached all-time lows. Small-business optimism has reached its highest in history. 95% of U.S manufacturers have rated the economy at its highest levels in history. This year, retail sales surged, up another 6% over the last year, with 0.5%in July 2018, an increase of 6.4% from July 2017. More companies are choosing to invest in the American economy now more than ever, taking advantage or President Trump's lower tax rate. Since Trump was elected, over $450 billion has already flowed back into the U.S. economy, including more than $300 billion in the first quarter of 2018. In addition to rising optimism, workers have never been so pleased to invest into the economy. To counter the many Obama era regulations, Trump launched massive deregulation at a rapid pace, signing 22 deregulatory actions in eliminating every one regulatory action during his first year in office. To accomplish this, Trump took advantage of the Congressional Rule Act to repeal more regulations than any other sitting President in history. Tax cuts and Worker development: Following the historic Tax cuts and Jobs act, signed into law on December 22nd, 2017, the American economy has surged to record heights of success. The act provided more than $5.5 trillion in gross tax cuts in 2018, with nearly 60% benefiting American families. The tax cut nearly doubled the standard deductible which allowed for most households to file taxes on only one page instead of two as in years past, along with increasing Child tax credits to financially assist developing families. As a master of industry , President Trump personally lowered America's corporate tax rate from what was the highest in the world, allowing American businesses to compete with companies overseas and win. Fulfilling a key promise of his first 500 days plan, President Trump removed dozens of tax-breaks for special interests while terminating loopholes for the wealthy. 9 in 10 Americans now see an increase in their wages according to the U.S Treasury Department. And thanks to this Act, nearly 100 electrical, water and heating companies have agreed to lower rates for their services. In a unified effort, the President worked with key members of Congress and the Executive, including Senator Tim Scott and HUD Secretary Ben Carson, who spearheads the endeavor, to create the interagency White House Opportunity and Revitalization Council. Created on December 12, 2018, the Council will, ""encourage public and private investment in urban and economically distressed areas, including qualified opportunity zones.""

Healthcare and Drug abuse: Thanks to the passage of the Tax cuts and Jobs Act, the Obamacare Individual Mandate (regarded as the core of the failing healthcare plan) was officially terminated. This marks a major victory in minimizing the financial woes inflicted by exorbitant insurance premiums and a blow to Obama's legacy health plan after Republicans failed to pass a repeal-replace plan in the Senate last year. In addition to this, President Trump did away with Obamacare's Independent Payment Advisory Board, also known as the ""death panels."" On May 30th 2018, President Trump signed into law the Right-to-Try Act, expanding healthcare benefits and options to terminally ill patients. Trump made much needed revisions to the flawed Medicare 340B program, saving senior citizens an estimated $320 million on drugs in 2018 alone.

The Department of Health and Human Services proposed to revise the Title X rule, which would withhold tax payer dollars to elements in the abortion industry that violates the law. In addition to this, the department extended and reinstated the Mexico City policy in refusing any aid to oversea abortions. To combat the Obama-era policies that favored abortion clinics, President Trump overturned one of the Obama administration's midnight regulations (one of the final traitorous acts to stab Trump in the back before he assumed office), which prohibited states from defunding certain abortion facilities. Trump also signed a major order to ensure that Christian organizations are not forced to choose between violating their religious beliefs in complying with Obamacare's suppressive contraceptive mandate or close down their establishment.

Under President Trump, $6 billion in funding were spent to combat the global opioid abuse epidemic through passing the Initiative: Stop Opioid Abuse and Reduce Drug Supply and Demand, introducing new measures to keep dangerous drugs out of American communities. In April 2018, the DEA launched a massive search and arrested 28 medical professionals revoking147 registrations for prescribing too much opioids for patients. First Lady Melania Trump and CRTV host Eric Bolling were hosted by Liberty University in a special discussion on the harmful effects of opioid abuse and how to better prevent its harmful spread. The Trump Administration reformed the Medicare program to block hospitals from overcharging low-income senior citizens on their drug prescriptions - saving seniors hundreds of millions of dollars this year alone. The Department of Justice recently secured its first indictments against crony Chinese fentanyl manufactures, which sell hundreds of pounds of the deadly drugs to troubled inner-city communities.

Law, Order and the Courts: Since assuming office in 2017, President Trump has appointed over two dozen U.S Circuit court judges, the most confirmed in such a short time. In addition to this, after a contentious series of hearings and false accusations of sexual assault, President Trump nominated Brett M. Kavanaugh to the U.S Supreme Court. This following Trump's major accomplishment in confirming Neil Gorsuch to the court in 2017, the quickest nomination of a Justice in Presidential history. Earlier this year, President Trump signed an executive order focusing more federal resources on dismantling transnational criminal organizations such as Mexican drug cartels. Trump has encouraged federal prosecutors to enforce the death penalty when possible in cases involving illegal drug trafficking. He also signed into law legislation that made it easier to target websites that enable sex trafficking while strengthening penalties for demented individuals who promote or facilitate prostitution. A newly created interagency task force assists in this endeavor.

Safeguarding the border: The Trump Administration secured $1.6 billion for border wall construction in the March 2018 omnibus bill, and is currently battling against stubborn Senate Democrats for at least $5 billion in additional funds. Construction of a 14-mile long border wall has already begun in San Diego and is being constructed in other key entry points shared with Mexico. Trump has been instrumental in strengthening ICE and border patrol officials in arresting (796 in 2017 alone = an 83% increase from 2016) and deporting violent MS-13 gang members.

In addition to this, the Department of Justice allied with Central American authorities in filing criminal charges against 4,000 MS-13 gang members. Since 2017, ICE officials have seized over 900,000 pounds of dangerous drugs (heroin, cocaine and fentanyl) from captured criminal aliens. The President has even authorized the deployment of the National Guard to protect and preserve the southern border from harm, especially amid the recent migrant caravan invasion from Honduras.

President Trump has fulfilled a key campaign promise in the implementation of stricter vetting measures to ensure greater border security against illegal migrants. These measures better reveal the identities of those seeking to enter, revealing whether or not they bear a criminal record. According to statistics by the Department of Homeland Security, 96,448 people were initially booked into an ICE detention facility, an increase of 22.5% over 2017 along with 256,086 illegal migrants removed after crossing the border.

Trade and Energy: President Trump is consistently making good on one of his most important campaign promises in negotiating and renegotiating better trade deals, achieving free, fair, and reciprocal trade for the United States. Trump made a deal to increase U.S energy exports to European Union member countries. And the Trump Administration successfully litigated multiple WTO disputes targeting unfair trade practices and upholding our right to enact fair trade laws. With South Korea, Trump revised a trade agreement that resulted in increases toward automobile exports from the U.S. On November 30th 2018, President Trump, former Mexican President Enrique Pena Nieto and Prime Minister Justin Trudeau all signed the U.S. Mexico Canada Agreement - or USMCA. Signed during the G-20 summit, this historic trade deal looks to replace the failing NAFTA deal and create renewed trade between the North American countries. President Trump has also secured new negotiations to trade with Japan. In maintaining a key promise, Trump has enforced multiple restrictive tariffs (heavily on aluminum and steel) against Communist China, checking the authoritarian nation for their criminal trading tendencies (currency manipulation, forced technology transfers, rampant IP theft, ludicrous trade barriers, etc.).

The trade war between U.S and China includes a 25% tariff on $50 billion of goods imported from China, along with an additional 10% tariff on $200 billion of Chinese goods. Following negotiations at the G-20 summit, The United States has most recently secured a potential new trade deal with the Chinese that amounts to $250 billion, in addition to a removing recent tariffs, so long as President Jinping agrees to end his nation's criminal trading practices. In addition to tariffs against China, Trump has also made a recent agreement with the E.U that will reduce trade barriers and increase trade of American soybeans to Europe. In the fall of 2018, President Trump successfully won a major dispute with the WTO regarding Indonesia's unfair denial of U.S agricultural exports.

President Trump torpedoed the Obama Administration's restrictive Clean Air Act and replaced the plan with something far more efficient toward reducing harmful emissions - the Clean Power Plan, passed August 21st, 2018. As a result of reinvesting in American energy independence, the United States has produced more oil now than ever before. Triumphantly, the U.S is now the largest crude oil producer in the World, while becoming a net natural gas producer for the first time in nearly 6 decades. Trump has turned down Obama's hydraulic fracturing rule, which would have cost the fracking industry a burdensome $32 million per year. President Trump has drastically expanded U.S offshore drilling and opened a lease sale on oil and gas in the Gulf of Mexico in August 2018.

Foreign Relations and Defense: On May 14th 2018, the nation of Israel celebrated its 70th anniversary as an independent country, praising the Trump Administration for moving the American Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, the God-ordained capital of the Jewish state. President Trump also continues to safeguard Israel through maintaining his decision to scrap the Iranian nuclear deal and re-impose sanctions, ensuring that the United States does not honor the billions paid to the leading sponsor of global terrorism - Iran. On June 12th, 2018, the United States hosted the historic peace summit with North Korean President Kim Jong-Un, ushering in the beginnings of peace and denuclearization to the Korean Peninsula and an end to the ongoing Korean War (1950-present). This meeting resulted in North Korea halting its nuclear weapons testing facilities and agreeing to substantial peace-keeping measures with American and South Korean officials.

President Trump passed sweeping sanctions against corrupt Venezuelan dictator Nicholas Maduro and his collapsing socialist regime, while passing measures to ensure that the U.S does not pay for Venezuela's debt. In April 2018, President Trump launched air strikes against Syria's chemical weapons facilities in lieu of a devastating chemical attack, presumably launched by Bashar al-Assad. In December 2018, Trump announced the withdraw of all American troops from Syria after the successful defeat of the demonic terror group, ISIS. Under Trump, the rebuilt U.S military conquered nearly all of ISIS's forces and recaptured key territory that had been formerly lost under Obama's presidency.

On January 30th 2018, President Trump signs an executive order to keep Guantanamo bay open. In order to full rebuild the formerly dilapidated U.S military, $700 billion in military funding was approved by Congress for 2018 and $716 billion for 2019, along with passing the largest military pay raise in history. The Trump Administration implemented the first fully articulated cyber security strategy in nearly 15 years. And, in a historic move, President Trump and Vice-President Pence unveiled the creation of a sixth branch of government: the Space Force. Trump encouraged North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) allies to increase defense spending to their agree-upon levels, agreeing to pay their fair share instead of allowing the United States to pay an overwhelming amount in their stead. Eight NATO countries promised to reach the 2% benchmark by the end of 2018 while 15 other nations vow to do so by 2024.

Conclusion

The second year of the Trump Presidency has profoundly reinforced a record-breaking year of triumph and success which began in 2017. The Trump Administration surpasses all other former Presidencies in the renowned progress attained for the United States, creating a new era of national exceptionalism and greatness unseen in the 242 years of American history. Whether in defense, the economy, trade, or foreign relations, President Trump has delivered many of his powerful promises for the benefit of the American people at an unprecedented pace. Minus the Fake News inspired ""crises"" involving the Robert Mueller witch-hunt investigation along with the tax evasion and illegal payoffs by disgraced former lawyer Michael Cohen, the President's record accomplishments are largely left out of the scope of mainstream media. Thanks only to the few balanced, more conservative news sources like: the Washington Examiner, Fox News, InfoWars, the Daily Caller, and Breitbart, are Americans more aware of the increasingly immense scope of President Trump's achievements and the current state of American prosperity. Truly, the second year of the Trump Presidency marked a historic age for restored excellence in the United States and charts another 6 years to for even greater success to follow.

279,bradenton herald,https://www.bradenton.com/news/business/article224277975.html,"The government shutdown has suspended federal cleanups at Superfund sites around the nation and forced the cancellation of public hearings, deepening the mistrust and resentment of surrounding residents who feel people in power long ago abandoned them to live among the toxic residue of the country's factories and mines.

""We are already hurting, and it's just adding more fuel to the fire,"" says 40-year-old Keisha Brown, whose wood-frame home is in a community nestled among coking plants and other factories on Birmingham's north side.

The mostly African-American community has been forced to cope with high levels of arsenic, lead and other contaminants in the soil that the Environmental Protection Agency has been scraping up and carting away, house by house.

As President Donald Trump and Congress battle over Trump's demand for a wall on the southern U.S. border, the nearly 3-week-old partial government shutdown has stopped federal work on Superfund sites except for cases where the administration deems ""there is an imminent threat to the safety of human life or to the protection of property.""

EPA's shutdown plans said the agency would evaluate about 800 Superfund sites to see how many could pose an immediate threat. As an example of that kind of threat, it cited an acid leak from a mine that could threaten the public water supply. That's the hazard at Northern California's Iron Mountain mine, where EPA workers help prevent an unending flow of lethally acidic runoff off the Superfund site from spilling into rivers downstream.

Practically speaking, said Bonnie Bellow, a former EPA official who worked on Superfund public outreach at the agency, the impact of the stoppage of work at sites across the nation ""wholly depends"" on the length of the shutdown.

""Unless there is immediate risk like a storm, a flood, a week or two of slowdowns is not going to very likely affect the cleanup at the site,"" Bellow said.

In north Birmingham, Brown said it's been a couple of weeks since she's spotted any EPA crews at people's houses. It wasn't clear if state workers or contractors were continuing work.

But long before the shutdown began, Brown harbored doubts the cleanup was working anyway. ""My main concern is the health of the people out here,"" said Brown, who has asthma. ""All of us are sick, and we've got to function on medicine every day.""

In terms of time, the federal government shutdown is a chronological blip in the long history of the site -- which includes ethics charges in a local bribery scandal to block federal cleanup efforts -- but adds to the uncertainty in an area where residents feel forgotten and betrayed.

At the EPA, the shutdown has furloughed the bulk of the agency's roughly 14,000 employees. It also means the EPA isn't getting most of the daily stream of environmental questions and tips from the public. Routine inspections aren't happening. State, local and private emails to EPA officials often get automated messages back promising a response when the shutdown ends.

In Montana, for instance, state officials this month found themselves fielding calls from a tribal member worried about drinking water with a funny look to it, said Kristi Ponozzo, public-policy director at that state's Department of Environmental Quality. The EPA normally provides tribes with technical assistance on water supplies.

With most EPA colleagues idled, Ponozzo said, her agency also had to call off an environmental review meeting for a mining project, potentially delaying the project.

But it's the agency's work at Superfund sites -- lessening the threat from old nuclear-weapons plants, chemical factories, mines and other entities -- that gets much of the attention.

Absent imminent peril, it would be up to state governments or contractors to continue any cleanup during the shutdown ""up to the point that additional EPA direction or funding is needed,"" the EPA said in a statement.

""Sites where cleanup activities have been stopped or shut down will be secured until cleanup activities are able to commence when the federal government reopens,"" the agency said.

For federal Superfund sites in Michigan, the shutdown means there are no EPA colleagues to consult, said Scott Dean, a spokesman for that state's Department of Environmental Quality.

At Michigan Superfund sites, day-to-day field operations were continuing since private contractors do most of the on-the-ground work, Dean said.

Bellow, the former EPA official, said the cancellation of hearings about Superfund sites posed immediate concerns.

In East Chicago, Indiana, for example, the EPA called off a planned public hearing set for last Wednesday to outline how the agency planned to clean up high levels of lead and arsenic in the soil.

The EPA has proposed a seven-month, $26.5 million cleanup that includes treating and removing tainted soil from the area, where a lead smelter previously was located.

During a public meeting Nov. 29, some residents complained that the EPA's approach would leave too much pollution in place. But others didn't get a chance to speak and were hoping to do so at the meeting this week, said Debbie Chizewer, a Northwestern University environmental attorney who represents community groups in the low-income area.

The EPA announced the cancellation in an online notice and gave no indication that it would be rescheduled.

Leaders of the East Chicago Calumet Community Advisory Group asked for a new hearing date and an extension of a Jan. 14 public comment deadline in a letter to the EPA's regional Superfund division.

Calls by The Associated Press to the agency's regional office in Chicago this week were not answered.

Local critics fear the EPA will use the delay caused by the shutdown as justification for pushing ahead with a cleanup strategy they consider flawed, Chizewer said, even though the agency has designated the affected area as an ""environmental justice community"" -- a low-income community of color that has been disproportionately harmed by pollution.

The EPA has a ""special obligation"" when dealing with such communities, Chizewer said. ""This would be an example of shutting them out for no good reason.""

In North Birmingham, former longtime neighborhood resident Charlie Powell said most of the people living in and around the Superfund site had already ""just got tired and fed up.""

Powell left the area but started a group called PANIC, People Against Neighborhood Industrial Contamination. He believes money would be better spent helping residents move away from the pollution.

""Can I say hell?"" Powell said when asked what residents have been through.

280,bradenton herald,https://www.bradenton.com/news/business/article223342450.html,"Excerpts from recent editorials in the United States and abroad:

The New York Times on a judge's rebuke of Michael Flynn and President Donald Trump's charitable foundation:

A bit of common sense and common decency intruded on Tuesday into the crazy world of Donald Trump.

In New York, the state attorney general announced that the president had agreed that the ""charity"" he used as a piggy bank has no reason to exist.

In Washington, a federal judge let a former top presidential aide know that you can parrot political spin or you can tell the truth, but you can't do both to someone who can send you to prison.

Michael Flynn, Mr. Trump's former national security adviser, appeared before Judge Emmet Sullivan to be sentenced to what he expected would be a term of probation, after pleading guilty to lying to federal investigators about conversations with the Russian ambassador. The office of the special counsel, Robert Mueller, had earlier filed a memo that said it would be right for Mr. Flynn to avoid prison after his extensive cooperation in the investigation of Trump ties to Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential campaign and after.

Then last week, in a memo about their client's sentencing, Mr. Flynn's lawyers implied that he had been tricked into lying and that the F.B.I. acted improperly in interviewing him -- points raised by pro-Trump commentators elaborating on the president's claims of being victimized by a witch hunt.

Judge Sullivan was having none of it.

""I cannot recall an instance of a court ever accepting a guilty plea from someone who did not maintain he was guilty,"" Judge Sullivan said, ""and I do not intend to start today.""

Chastened, Mr. Flynn told the judge that nobody tricked him, that he lied and that he knew he shouldn't have.

The judge was not upset only about Mr. Flynn's sneaky prevarication. He said he felt ""disgust"" at Mr. Flynn's offenses, that a retired three-star general would lie to the F.B.I. ""while on the physical premises of the White House,"" and, acting as an unregistered agent of a foreign country, Turkey, while he was an adviser to Mr. Trump (to which he admitted but was not charged). It was a bracing reminder of the brazenness of his misdeeds and of the standards the public should be able to expect of those who serve them.

Realizing that Judge Sullivan was considering a term of up to six months in prison, Mr. Flynn accepted his offer to delay the sentencing for 90 days until he has completed his cooperation with the special counsel.

""Good luck today in court to General Michael Flynn,"" Mr. Trump had tweeted first thing Tuesday morning.

""Thanks for nothing, Mr. President,"" Mr. Flynn might have thought as he left court.

Mr. Flynn should be grateful the judge offered him the chance to come clean. By contrast, the Donald J. Trump Foundation, a charity that provided no charity, quite properly received none from the New York attorney general's office.

Attorney General Barbara Underwood accused it of ""a shocking pattern of illegality"" that ""amounted to the Trump Foundation functioning as little more than a checkbook to serve Mr. Trump's business and political interests.""

Whatever money that remains will be disbursed under the supervision of Ms. Underwood's office and the judge overseeing the continuing lawsuit her office filed in June, seeking $2.8 million in restitution and a ban on Mr. Trump and his three oldest children serving on the boards of other nonprofit organizations.

In a series of stories exposing the foundation's true nature, The Washington Post found that its largest donation was to fix a fountain in front of the Plaza Hotel in Manhattan, which Mr. Trump owned at the time, that its funds were used to buy a portrait of Mr. Trump, and that it illegally provided political donations and paid for personal legal settlements.

All this comes just days after prosecutors announced that they believed that Mr. Trump had conspired with the owner of The National Enquirer and his fixer Michael Cohen to violate campaign finance laws by paying hush money to two women who said they had affairs with him. It's also just been reported that prosecutors are investigating spending by the Trump inaugural committee. The president still faces lawsuits on the constitutionality of his enriching himself while in office. Meanwhile, the special counsel's inquiry may be expanding rather than winding down.

It's fitting that despite all his bluster and threats, a president who's demonstrated such contempt for the rule of law is finding it so formidable.

That this goes to the essence of American governance was best summed up by Paula Duncan, the Trump enthusiast who was among the jurors who found Mr. Trump's former campaign chief Paul Manafort guilty of fraud, even though she had hoped he wouldn't be convicted.

Explaining her decision after the verdict, she told Fox News, ""No one's above the law.""

The Wall Street Journal on a judge's ruling on the Affordable Care Act's individual mandate:

No one opposes ObamaCare more than we do, and Democrats are now confirming that it was designed as a way-station to government-run health care. But a federal judge's ruling that the law is unconstitutional is likely to be overturned on appeal and may boomerang politically on Republicans.

Judge Reed O'Connor ruled for some 20 state plaintiffs that the Affordable Care Act's individual mandate is no longer legal because Republicans repealed its financial penalty as part of the 2017 tax reform. Recall that Chief Justice John Roberts joined four Justices to say ObamaCare's mandate was illegal as a command to individuals to buy insurance under the Commerce Clause. ""The Framers gave Congress the power to regulate commerce, not to compel it,"" he wrote.

Yet the Chief famously salvaged ObamaCare by unilaterally rewriting the mandate to be a ""tax"" that was within Congress's power. Never mind that Democrats had expressly said the penalty was not a tax. Majority Leader Roberts declared it to be so.

Enter Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, who argues in Texas v. U.S. that since Congress has repealed the mandate, the tax is no longer a tax, and ObamaCare is thus illegal. Judge O'Connor agreed with that logic, and he went further in ruling that since Congress said the mandate is crucial to the structure of ObamaCare, then all of ObamaCare must fall along with the mandate.

We'll admit to a certain satisfaction in seeing the Chief Justice hoist on his own logic. But his ruling in NFIB v. Sebelius was in 2012 and there is more at issue legally now than the ""tax"" issue in that opinion. One legal complication is that Congress in 2017 repealed the financial part of the individual mandate, not the structure of the mandate itself. Republicans used budget rules to pass tax reform so they couldn't repeal the mandate's express language.

The Affordable Care Act has also been up and running since 2014, which means so-called reliance interests come into play when considering a precedent. Millions of people now rely on ObamaCare's subsidies and rules, which argues against judges repealing the law by fiat.

Judge O'Connor breezes past this like a liberal Ninth Circuit appeals judge handling a Donald Trump appeal. He's right that Democrats claimed the individual mandate was essential to the Affordable Care Act. But when Congress killed the financial penalty in 2017 it left the rest of ObamaCare intact. When judging congressional intent, a judge must account for the amending Congress as well as the original Congress.

In any case, the Supreme Court's ""severability"" doctrine calls for restraint in declaring an entire law illegal merely because one part of it is. Our guess is that even the right-leaning Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals judges will overturn Judge O'Connor on this point.

As for the politics, Democrats claim to be alarmed by the ruling but the truth is they're elated. They want to use it to further pound Republicans for denying health insurance for pre-existing conditions if the law is overturned. Democrats campaigned across the country against Mr. Paxton's lawsuit to gain House and Senate seats in November, and they will now press votes in Congress so they can compound the gains in 2020.

President Trump hailed the ruling in a tweet, but he has never understood the Affordable Care Act. His Administration has done good work revising regulations to reduce health-care costs and increase access, but the risk is that the lawsuit will cause Republicans in Congress to panic politically and strike a deal with Democrats that reinforces ObamaCare. This is what happens when conservatives fall into the liberal trap of thinking they can use the courts to achieve policy goals that need to be won in Congress.

The Washington Post on withdrawing all 2,000 U.S. troops out of Syria:

PRESIDENT TRUMP'S sudden move to yank U.S. troops out of Syria undermined at a stroke several foreign policy goals he has championed. The president promised to finish the job of destroying the Islamic State, but the withdrawal will leave thousands of its fighters still in place. He vowed to roll back Iran's aggression across the Middle East, but his decision will allow its forces to entrench in the country that is the keystone of Tehran's ambitions. He promised to protect Israel, but that nation will now be left to face alone the buildup by Iran and its proxies along its northern border.

The president's top national security advisers had carefully developed and articulated a strategy of maintaining a U.S. presence in Syria until the Islamic State was beyond revival and Iran withdrew its forces -- a plan they were defending up until this week. Mr. Trump has again demonstrated, to them and to the world, that no U.S. policy or foreign commitment is immune from his whims.

Mr. Trump claimed the Islamic State had been defeated, but that is not the view of the Defense and State Departments. Thousands of jihadist fighters are still in Syria and control splotches of territory in the Euphrates Valley. A U.S. withdrawal will give the extremists an opportunity to reconstitute, as they did in Iraq following the premature U.S. withdrawal ordered by President Barack Obama.

Until Wednesday, a prime talking point of senior national security officials was that, ""if we've learned one thing over the years, (the) enduring defeat of a group like this means you can't just defeat their physical space and then leave,"" as the State Department's special envoy for the global campaign against the Islamic State, Brett McGurk, put it last week. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said it another way in September: ""Getting rid of the caliphate doesn't mean you then blindly say, 'Okay, we got rid of it,' march out, and then wonder why the caliphate comes back.""

Mr. Trump has justified some of his most controversial decisions, including his continued support for Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, as needed to contain Iran's threat to the United States and its allies. But the Syrian withdrawal hands Tehran and its ally Russia a windfall. Iran has deployed thousands of fighters and allied militiamen to Syria and aspires to create a corridor to Lebanon and the Mediterranean, as well as a new front against Israel along the Golan Heights. In reaction to that threat, Mr. Trump's national security adviser, John Bolton, announced Sept. 24 that ""We're not going to leave (Syria) as long as Iranian troops are outside Iranian borders, and that includes Iranian proxies and militias.""

U.S. ambitions in Syria have never been backed by adequate resources, and a case could be made that neither Congress nor the American public were prepared to support the mission suggested by Mr. Bolton. But Mr. Trump's decision appears to have been precipitated by the bellicose rhetoric of Turkey's Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who last week threatened -- not for the first time -- a military operation against Syrian Kurds, even though U.S. troops are positioned around them. The autocratic Turkish ruler appears to have extracted multiple favors from Mr. Trump in recent days, including the sale of U.S. Patriot missiles and a promise to reexamine the possible extradition of his rival, Fethullah Gulen, from Pennsylvania. If Mr. Trump received anything in return, he hasn't disclosed it.

The Syrian Kurdish forces, which have fought alongside the United States and played a crucial role in liberating most of eastern Syria from the jihadists, will be perhaps the foremost victims of Mr. Trump's decision. Betrayed by Washington, they will now be subject to a military offensive by Turkey. The stab in the back will send an unforgettable message to all who are asked to cooperate with the United States in the fight against terrorism: Washington is an unreliable and dangerous partner.

The Orange County (California) Register on Mick Mulvaney as Trump's choice for chief of staff:

President Trump has found a new chief of staff, albeit an interim one, in his director of the Office of Management and Budget, Mick Mulvaney.

That of chief is a terribly important post, perhaps government's most consequential aside from that of his boss. In theory, at least, the chief of staff is the gatekeeper for everything the president does, everyone he sees, everyone he talks to on the phone.

Perhaps, though few would expect this to be the case, the arbiter of every time he sends out a tweet, and of what it should say.

A Washington insider, a former congressman, Mulvaney is in many ways ideal for the job. He wants it, badly, whereas others with similarly impressive resumes touted for the job have indicated a strong desire to spend more time with their families, from Vice President Pence's staff chief Nick Ayers of Georgia to former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie.

Mulvaney shares the conservative values currently espoused by the president and was a founder of the House Freedom Caucus in 2013, the group that always taunted the Republican leadership, opposing much government funding, including debt limit increases and budget agreements made with the Democrats.

But he also, after Trump secured the Republican nomination in 2016, called the candidate ""a terrible human being"" who he only was voting for out of an even greater dislike of Hillary Clinton.

It's not as if other presidential allies of today haven't said bad things about him in the past. On the campaign trail, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz called his rival ""a narcissist at a level I don't think this country's ever seen,"" for instance.

But if you were the nation's chief executive -- or the CEO of a much smaller entity, for that matter -- could you hire as your top aide and work with a person who had once dubbed you ""terrible""?

Or does this kind of talk come with the territory in politics, where many strange bedfellows are made because of having to run in elections against once and perhaps future allies? Should Trump indeed elevate this practical choice for staff chief to permanent status immediately?

Los Angeles Times on banning bump stocks, which allow semi-automatic weapons to fire like machine guns:

The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives said Tuesday that it had finalized a rule reclassifying so-called bump stocks -- the devices that can make a semiautomatic rifle fire nearly as quickly a fully automatic weapon -- as machine guns, which makes it illegal to manufacture, sell or possess them. The agency said a year ago it had the authority to reclassify the devices, and President Trump -- in the wake of the Parkland, Fla., school shooting -- directed the ATF to speed up the process. Tuesday's announcement -- a rare bit of welcome news from the Trump administration -- makes it official; White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters that owners of the conversion devices will have until March 21 to destroy them or turn them in to the ATF.

This is a good step. Unfortunately, it's all but certain to be challenged in the courts, and it's on shaky legal ground because of the way the new rule evolved. The Obama administration determined that because bump stocks have ""no automatically functioning mechanical parts and (perform) no automated mechanical functions when installed,"" they did not fit the definition of a machine gun in federal law, which meant the ATF lacked the authority to regulate them. Tuesday's announcement, by contrast, hinges not on the technical specifications, but on the functionality. In essence, if it fires like a machine gun, it's a machine gun. Cue the lawyers.

We hope the administration prevails in whatever challenges emerge, but the sure-fire way to resolve this would be for Congress to legislate bump stocks and related gadgets out of existence. Such devices serve no function other than to evade the strict congressional limit on machine guns by, as the ATF said, harnessing ""the recoil energy of the semiautomatic firearm in a manner that allows the trigger to reset and continue firing"" without the shooter having to pull the trigger for each shot.

A mass shooter in Las Vegas used bump stocks affixed to semiautomatic rifles to fire more than 1,000 rounds in a matter of minutes from a 32nd-floor suite of the Mandalay Bay Hotel into a crowd of some 20,000 people, killing 58 concertgoers and injuring hundreds of others. It was the largest single mass shooting in the modern era, drawing attention to bump stocks and sparking outraged demands by many -- the Los Angeles Times included -- that the devices be banned.

As welcome as this new rule is, it will do little to corral our national problem with gun violence. The vast majority of gun deaths come in ones and twos, led by suicides. ...

But it is progress. And the president deserves credit for sticking with his promise to find a way to ban bump stocks. ...

China Daily says telecommunications giant Huawei is a victim of U.S. panic attacks:

This year has not been an annus mirabilis for China's Huawei Technologies Ltd, the world's largest supplier of telecommunications network equipment and second-biggest maker of smartphones.

Although it has been constantly in the news and it is said there is no such thing as bad publicity, it has been making headlines because of the spurious claims it somehow poses a threat to the West, even world peace. It has never been explained exactly how.

In fact it is not because of anything it has done, but because its success has brought it into the crosshairs of the United States' anxiety attacks against China.

Huawei is at the forefront of 5G technology. This latest generation mobile network technology promises to bring the much anticipated and heralded internet of things to life and the US is determined to be the 5G leader.

Not only because whichever country develops the technology that is adopted as standard will have a huge commercial advantage. But also because by setting the standard it will have a knowledge advantage.

As a result, first the US and then one after another its most obedient allies have blocked Huawei from entering their 5G markets on security grounds.

None of them have offered any specific justification for blocking Huawei. They just repeat their claim that the company poses a security risk. That is why objective observers have concluded that those countries are politicizing a commercial issue.

It sets a harmful precedent. What if other countries used the same excuse to block US companies (not confined to the telecom sector)? The US companies are very competitive in many fields, including those that could pose huge security risks, such as finance.

While Huawei will not go unscathed from being prevented from entering key markets, as a competitive player, it still has a vast market to access in other parts of the world. It has signed contracts to supply 5G equipment to 25 telecom carriers, and more than 10,000 5G base stations have been shipped.

In stark contrast to the US and its allies, India for instance, has invited Huawei to conduct 5G trials in the country and complimented it on the role it has played in helping to develop its telecom industry.

The efforts of the US and its allies to try to shield their companies against a Chinese competitor are politically motivated, not the result of a fact-based or transparent decision-making process. And they are counterproductive to the concerted efforts that are needed to ensure the security of 5G networks."
281,bradenton herald,https://www.bradenton.com/latest-news/article224126560.html,"The Latest on President Donald Trump and the partial government shutdown (all times local):

3:16 p.m.

Congressional leaders from both parties have returned to the White House for another round of negotiations with President Donald Trump on the ongoing partial government shutdown.

The two sides have made no apparent progress in the past week, with Trump sticking to his demand of $5.7 billion for a border barrier and Democrats insisting they won't give him the money.

Trump has been making a public case that there is a ""crisis"" at the southern border. And he's still threatening to declare a national emergency to circumvent Congress if he can't get the wall money from them.

He told reporters during a visit to the Capitol earlier Wednesday that he may turn to a declaration ""at some point"" if top Democrats Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi ""don't agree"" with his assessment about the problems at the border.

President Donald Trump says Republicans are ""totally unified"" in the shutdown standoff over his long-promised southern border wall, though some GOP lawmakers have been expressing concern about the 19-day partial government closure.

Trump traveled to Capitol Hill on Wednesday to meet with Senate Republicans. He says there was ""no discussion about anything other than solidarity.""

Trump has been considering a national emergency declaration to bypass Congress to build the wall. He says he ""may do that at some point"" if he can't get a deal with Democrats.

Trump also plans to meet with top congressional Democrats and Republicans at the White House on Wednesday.

President Donald Trump arrived on Capitol Hill claiming he has ""tremendous"" support as he headed into a meeting with Republican senators uneasy with the government shutdown over his border wall.

Asked how long the shutdown would last, Trump told reporters Wednesday ""whatever it takes.""

The partial shutdown is now in its 19th day, the second longest ever.

Trump and Vice President Mike Pence arrived for the private lunch meeting with the Senate GOP caucus to shore up support.

Several Republican senators have said the government should be re-opened while talks continue over border security and Trump's demand for money to build the wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.

President Donald Trump says he thinks he and the Democrats are ""getting closer"" to a deal to end the budget stalemate that has partially shut down the government despite no evidence that any progress has been made.

And he's suggesting the partial government shutdown could be ""a blessing in disguise"" because, he suggests, it could lead to a broader immigration deal.

Trump spoke Wednesday during an Oval Office bill signing on anti-human trafficking legislation. It's a day after he delivered a prime-time address trying to make the case for his long-stalled U.S.-Mexico border wall.

Trump says that he would like to see ""real immigration reform in this country because we need it."" He says, ""Everybody wants to see immigration reform,"" adding that perhaps the stalemate ""will turn out to be a blessing in disguise.""

Gone are the days when the U.S. and Mexican governments regularly exchanged statements over President Donald Trump's insistence on a border wall.

Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said Wednesday he won't be drawn into what he calls a U.S. internal dispute, an apparent reference to the 19-day-old partial U.S. government shutdown over a border barrier.

Lopez Obrador says, ""We are not going to respond to situations arising from internal affairs in the United States.""

Unlike his predecessor, the Mexican leader didn't have to respond to any specific aspersion about Mexico, because Trump didn't make any in his Tuesday night address to the American public. Relations between the two leaders have been surprisingly cordial, given their ideological differences.

Lopez Obrador said, ""Of course, there are those ... who want us to get into a confrontation. We always want a friendly relationship with the United States, a cooperative relationship.""

As a presidential candidate Trump promised Mexico would pay for a border wall, but Mexico refused.

President Donald Trump is using a bill signing focused on curbing human trafficking to push his case for a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border.

Trump says a southern border that is not secured exacerbates the incidents of human trafficking. He says, ""As long as we have a border that is not secure, we're going to suffer the consequences of that.""

Wednesday's bill signing came a day after Trump's prime-time speech designed to persuade Americans that illegal immigration and trafficking at the border are a crisis.

Democrats have called Trump's promised wall costly, ineffective and ""immoral"" and say he's ""manufacturing a crisis.""

The bill Trump signed is designed to enhance an annual State Department report that measures global efforts to eliminate human trafficking.

The White House says it's the fourth bipartisan bill the Republican president has signed in the last few weeks to prevent human trafficking.

Congressional Democrats say they'll head to the White House with the plan to reopen the government -- the same one they've been presenting. They're asking President Donald Trump to accept a bipartisan bill to fund border security without the wall.

Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Wednesday the president ""could end the Trump shutdown and re-open the government today, and he should.""

Pelosi and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer spoke at an event where they were flanked by federal workers going without pay during the shutdown, now in its 19th day.

Schumer called workers the ""collateral damage"" of Trump's ""temper tantrum."" He said the president failed to ""persuade a soul"" during his ""divisive"" prime-time address Tuesday night to the nation.

Trump meets with congressional leaders at the White House Wednesday afternoon. He rejected the Senate's bipartisan funding bill in December, sparking the shutdown.

The White House is trying to keep jittery congressional Republicans from defecting over the toll the partial government shutdown is taking in their states.

President Donald Trump and Democrats have been at an impasse over funding for his proposed border wall, which has led to a partial government shutdown, now in its 19th day.

Trump meets with Senate Republicans Wednesday on Capitol Hill just hours after he argued on national television that a border wall was needed to resolve a security and humanitarian ""crisis.""

Senators say the shutdown has led to disruptions in agricultural payments for farmers, as well as for home buyers trying to secure government-backed home loans. Lawmakers also are worried about missed paychecks for government workers Friday.

As many as half a dozen GOP senators have said the government should reopen while border security negotiations with Democrats continue.

President Donald Trump again linked illegal immigration along the southern border with drugs and violent crime as he urged Democratic lawmakers to fund his proposed border wall.

In his first national address from the Oval Office, the president gave no indication he was softening his stance that the partial government shutdown would continue without money for the wall.

Trump argued Tuesday night that the wall was needed to resolve what he called a security and humanitarian ""crisis.""

He addressed the nation as the shutdown stretched through its third week, with hundreds of thousands of federal workers going without pay and some congressional Republicans growing increasingly jittery about the impasse.

Trump plans to visit Senate Republicans at the Capitol on Wednesday before meeting with Democratic leaders at the White House."
282,bradenton herald,https://www.bradenton.com/news/nation-world/national/article223193915.html,"White House digs in on border wall demand, risking shutdown

WASHINGTON (AP) -- The White House on Sunday pushed the federal government closer to the brink of a partial shutdown later this week, digging in on its demand for $5 billion to build a border wall as congressional Democrats stood firm against it.

""We're going to do whatever is necessary to build the border wall to stop this ongoing crisis of illegal immigration,"" said White House senior adviser Stephen Miller.

Asked if that meant having a government shutdown, he said: ""If it comes to it, absolutely.""

Trump said last week he would be ""proud"" to have a shutdown to get Congress to approve a $5 billion down payment to fulfill his campaign promise to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. But the president doesn't have the votes from the Republican-controlled Congress to support funding for the wall at that level.

Democratic congressional leaders, Sen. Chuck Schumer and Rep. Nancy Pelosi, have proposed no more than $1.6 billion, as outlined in a bipartisan Senate bill. The money would not go for the wall but for fencing upgrades and other border security. Democrats also offered to simply keep funding at its current level, $1.3 billion.

Trump lawyer Giuliani rules out Mueller interview with Trump

WASHINGTON (AP) -- With a number of probes moving closer to the Oval Office, President Donald Trump and his attorney unleashed a fresh series of attacks on the investigators, questioning their integrity while categorically ruling out the possibility of a presidential interview with the special counsel.

Trump and Rudy Giuliani used Twitter and television interviews Sunday to deliver a series of broadsides against special counsel Robert Mueller and federal prosecutors in New York. Giuliani said he was ""disgusted"" by the tactics used by Mueller in his probe into Russian election interference, including in securing guilty pleas from the president's former national security adviser Michael Flynn on a charge of lying to federal investigators.

Trump, Giuliani said, would not submit to an interview by Mueller's team.

""They're a joke,"" Giuliani told ""Fox News Sunday."" ''Over my dead body, but, you know, I could be dead.""

The special counsel, who is investigating possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russia, has continued to request an interview with the president. Last month, the White House sent written answers in response to the special counsel's questions about possible collusion. The White House has resisted answering questions on possible obstruction of justice.

Child's death highlights communication barriers on border

Shortly before a 7-year-old Guatemalan girl died in U.S. custody, her father signed a form stating that his daughter was in good health. But it's unclear how much the man understood on the form, which was written in English and read to him in Spanish by Border Patrol agents.

The death of Jakelin Caal highlights the communication challenges along the U.S.-Mexico border as agents come in contact with an increasing number of migrants who speak neither English nor Spanish.

Her father's native language is the Mayan tongue known as Q'eqchi'. His second language is Spanish. It's unclear whether something was lost in translation or whether it would have made a difference in saving Jakelin after the two were detained and underwent a health screening along a remote stretch of U.S.-Mexico border. But the case raises questions about the Border Patrol's use of English-only forms.

All agents are required to speak Spanish, and they receive formal Spanish training. Reading forms in Spanish is often enough to pose basic questions. But some other Spanish-speaking migrants reported signing paperwork that they later said they did not understand.

Scores of immigrant parents who were separated from their children after crossing the border in the spring said they signed forms agreeing to be deported with the understanding that their kids would be returning with them, only to find themselves deported without them. Many had to wait months before being reunited with them in their homelands.

Talks adopt 'rulebook' to put Paris climate deal into action

KATOWICE, Poland (AP) -- Almost 200 nations, including the world's top greenhouse gas producers, China and the United States, have adopted a set of rules meant to breathe life into the 2015 Paris climate accord by setting out how countries should report their emissions and efforts to reduce them.

But negotiators delayed other key decisions until next year -- a move that frustrated environmentalists and countries that wanted more ambitious goals in light of scientists' warnings that the world must shift sharply away from fossil fuels in the coming decade.

""The majority of the rulebook for the Paris agreement has been created, which is something to be thankful for,"" said Mohamed Adow, a climate policy expert at Christian Aid. ""But the fact countries had to be dragged kicking and screaming to the finish line shows that some nations have not woken up"" to the dire consequences of global warming as outlined in a report by the U.N Panel on Climate Change, or IPCC.

Officials at the talks, which ended late Saturday in the Polish city of Katowice, agreed upon universal rules on how nations can cut emissions. Poor countries secured assurances on financial support to help them reduce emissions, adapt to changes such as rising sea levels and pay for damage that has already happened.

""Through this package, you have made a thousand little steps forward together,"" said Michal Kurtyka, a senior Polish official who led the talks.

French city honors victims of Christmas market attack

PARIS (AP) -- People filled a square in the French city of Strasbourg on Sunday to show respect and sympathy for the victims of last week's shooting attack near a famous Christmas market as the death toll rose to five.

French authorities said a Polish man died in a Strasbourg hospital Sunday, one of a dozen people wounded in last Tuesday's attack. Poland's Foreign Ministry extended condolences Sunday on Twitter to his family.

According to the newspaper DNA, more than 1,000 people attended the memorial, which ended with a minute of applause and a rendition of France's national anthem, ""La Marseillaise.""

The hour-long ceremony took place in Kleber Square, not far from where a gunman opened fire on Tuesday evening. Strasbourg Mayor Roland Ries praised the city's resilience in the face of hardship.

The ""extremely large crowd in the Christmas market"" on Saturday ""was an illustration of our commitment to these values ??on which our living together is based, which we will continue to defend against all those who want to attack it,"" Ries said.

Not into bingo, 84-year-old Texas woman gets college degree

RICHARDSON, Texas (AP) -- After raising five kids and retiring at age 77 from her secretarial job, Janet Fein couldn't be blamed for finally relaxing, but that's not her.

Fein, now 84, went to back to school and will accomplish a long-held goal this week when she graduates from the University of Texas at Dallas with a bachelor's degree.

""I didn't have anything to do in retirement and I didn't think that playing bingo was up to my speed,"" said Fein, who majored in sociology because she felt it was ""substantial.""

She said she enjoyed all the reading and writing papers. ""With each class I already knew a lot, but then I also learned a lot. And that made me happy,"" she said.

People 65 and older make up less than one percent of U.S. college students. In 2015, they accounted for about 67,000 of about 20 million college students, according to the National Center for Education Statistics.

Next-generation of GPS satellites are headed to space

DENVER (AP) -- After months of delays, the U.S. Air Force is about to launch the first of a new generation of GPS satellites, designed to be more accurate, secure and versatile.

But some of their most highly touted features will not be fully available until 2022 or later because of problems in a companion program to develop a new ground control system for the satellites, government auditors said.

The satellite is scheduled to lift off Tuesday from Cape Canaveral, Florida, aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. It's the first of 32 planned GPS III satellites that will replace older ones now in orbit. Lockheed Martin is building the new satellites outside Denver.

GPS is best-known for its widespread civilian applications, from navigation to time-stamping bank transactions. The Air Force estimates that 4 billion people worldwide use the system.

But it was developed by the U.S. military, which still designs, launches and operates the system. The Air Force controls a constellation of 31 GPS satellites from a high-security complex at Schriever Air Force Base outside Colorado Springs.

After fraud probe, new primary may replace GOP candidate

RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- Legislation quickly passed by North Carolina's lawmakers this week would prepare a path for Republicans to dump their nominee in a still-undecided U.S. House race marred with ballot fraud allegations.

""I think (legislators are) worried that Mark Harris might be damaged goods and they want to have the opportunity to have a different Republican nominee,"" said Carter Wrenn, a Republican operative and consultant to former U.S. Sen. Jesse Helms and others for more than 40 years. ""That's how I read those tea leaves.""

If the state elections board decides ballot irregularities or other problems cast the true outcome into doubt and force a redo, the legislation -- if allowed to go into law by Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper -- would require new primary elections in the 9th Congressional District race, in addition to a new general election.

That would allow Republicans another look at Mark Harris, the Republican who led Democrat Dan McCready by 905 votes in unofficial results. Harris hasn't been certified the winner, and an investigation is looking into missing absentee ballots in rural Bladen County and whether unsealed ballots illegally handled by collection teams there could have been altered.

Bladen was the only county among the eight within the 9th District where Harris won a majority of mail-in absentee ballots over McCready.

Top of mind: 'Justice' is Merriam-Webster's word of the year

NEW YORK (AP) -- Racial justice. Obstruction of justice. Social justice. The Justice Department. Merriam-Webster has chosen ""justice"" as its 2018 word of the year, driven by the churning news cycle over months and months.

The word follows ""toxic,"" picked by Oxford Dictionaries, and ""misinformation,"" plucked by Dictonary.com.

Peter Sokolowski, Merriam-Webster's editor at large, told The Associated Press ahead of Monday's announcement that ""justice"" consistently bubbled into the top 20 or 30 lookups on the company's website, spiking at times due to specific events but also skating close to the surface for much of the year.

While it's one of those common words people likely know how to spell and use correctly in a sentence, Sokolowski pointed to other reasons that drive search traffic. Among them is an attempt to focus a train of thought around a philosophical problem, or to seek aspirational motivation. Such well-known words are often among the most looked up every year, including those that are slightly abstract, including ""love,"" he said.

The designation for ""justice"" came soon after President Trump's one-time fixer, Michael Cohen, was sentenced to three years in prison for crimes that included arranging the payment of hush money to conceal his boss' alleged sexual affairs. He told a judge he agreed time and again to cover up Trump's ""dirty deeds"" out of ""blind loyalty.""

'Spider-Verse' swings to the top; 'Mortal Engines' tanks

LOS ANGELES (AP) -- ""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse"" swung to the top of the domestic box office in its first weekend in theaters, proving that there is widespread audience interest in big screen animated versions of Marvel's marquee superheroes.

The film led a host of newcomers that debuted to varying success on this pre-Christmas holiday weekend, including Clint Eastwood's drug smuggling drama ""The Mule"" and the Peter Jackson-produced epic ""Mortal Engines"" which bombed in North American theaters.

""Into the Spider-Verse"" earned an estimated $35.4 million from 3,813 theaters against a $90 million production budget according to Sony Pictures on Sunday, which is a record for animated movies in December (although the hybrid ""Alvin and the Chipmunks"" movies were higher). The film features an innovative animation style -- both CGI and hand-drawn -- and focuses on the Miles Morales character as he learns to become the famed web-slinger. It's another financial win for the studio's latest ""expanded Spider-Man universe"" strategy following ""Venom"" and ""Spider-Man: Homecoming.""

And ""Spider-Verse"" has been very well-received among critics, and audiences in exit surveys gave it a rare A+ CinemaScore -- a first for a Spider-Man film. It's also been nominated for a Golden Globe award for best animated feature and picked up a few honors from critics' groups as well, including the New York Film Critics Circle.

""We are playing to both families and fanboys. We're an all-audience film,"" said Adrian Smith, Sony's president of domestic distribution."
283,cnn,http://cnnphilippines.com/world/2019/01/04/Democrats-United-States-Congress-Nancy-Pelosi.html,"(CNN) -- Nancy Pelosi was officially elected the new House speaker on Thursday in a majority vote by the United States' House of Representatives on the first day of the 116th Congress.

She defeated the Republican nominee Kevin McCarthy, winning 220 votes. McCarthy becomes the House minority leader.

As House speaker, Pelosi will regularly face off against President Donald Trump and will preside over an emboldened and energized Democratic majority that is poised to launch aggressive oversight of the President and his administration.

One of the most immediate challenges confronting Pelosi as leader of the new House Democratic majority will be the fight over the President's long-promised border wall that triggered a standoff between congressional Democrats and the President and resulted in a partial government shutdown, which is now in its second week.

Pelosi also makes history as she reclaims a title she previously held when she served as the first and so far only female House speaker from 2007 to 2011.

""We enter this new Congress with a sense of great hope and confidence for the future and deep humility,"" Pelosi said in remarks shortly after being elected to the speakership.

""Our nation is at a historic moment,"" she continued. ""Two months ago, the American people spoke and demanded a new dawn.""

A small, but vocal, faction of Democrats initially worked to derail Pelosi's bid to become the next speaker following the 2018 midterm elections, but no challenger against her ever emerged and she ultimately succeed in winning over many of her critics.

Twelve Democrats voted for others besides Pelosi, including former Vice President Joe Biden, Sen. Tammy Duckworth of Illinois, Rep. Cheri Bustos of Illinois, Rep. Stephanie Murphy of Florida, Rep. John Lewis of Georgia, Rep. Joe Kennedy of Massachusetts, Rep. Marcia Fudge of Ohio, and Stacey Abrams, who unsuccessfully ran for governor of Georgia. Three Democrats voted present.

Pelosi has already outlined a plan for Democrats to pass a legislative package later in the day on Thursday to re-open shuttered parts of the government. Contrary to the President's demands for $5 billion for a border wall, however, the legislation does not provide any new wall funding, setting up an early confrontation between the new Democratic majority and the administration.

Pelosi spoke about other priorities on the Democratic agenda after her election on Thursday -- describing climate change as well as income inequality as pressing problems that need to be addressed.

""We will call upon bold thinking to address the disparity of income in America, which is at the root of the crisis of confidence felt by so many Americans,"" Pelosi said.

""We must also face the existential threat of our time: the climate crisis,"" she added.

In a nod to the historic nature of her election, Pelosi said she felt ""particularly proud"" to serve as ""the woman speaker of the House of this Congress which marks the 100th year of women having the right to vote.""

She added that it is a ""privilege to serve with over 100 women members of Congress, the largest number in history.""

Pelosi always projected confidence that she would reclaim the Speaker's gavel, but faced criticism and pushback along the way.

At the end of November, she secured the nomination to become speaker by winning support from a majority of House Democrats -- a total of 203 votes in closed-door leadership elections. But she came up slightly short of the total 218 votes typically needed to win the speakership in the final January vote.

To become Speaker requires the support of a majority of all members of the House who are present and voting, a threshold that could be as high as 218 votes. It would be possible for Pelosi to win with fewer votes, as several previous House speakers have, if some members vote present or decline to participate.

Ahead of the final vote, Pelosi deployed her deal-making abilities to win over detractors, and by mid-December, she appeared to have secured the votes necessary to prevail after negotiating an agreement with some of the Democrats who had been lobbying to block her from the speakership. As part of the agreement, Pelosi backed a proposal to enact term limits for the party's top three leaders.

""I see myself as a bridge to the next generation of leaders, a recognition of my continuing responsibility to mentor and advance new Members into positions of power and responsibility in the House Democratic Caucus,"" Pelosi said in a statement at the time."

Dec. 18

The New York Times on a judge's rebuke of Michael Flynn and President Donald Trump's charitable foundation:

A bit of common sense and common decency intruded on Tuesday into the crazy world of Donald Trump.

In New York, the state attorney general announced that the president had agreed that the ""charity"" he used as a piggy bank has no reason to exist.

In Washington, a federal judge let a former top presidential aide know that you can parrot political spin or you can tell the truth, but you can't do both to someone who can send you to prison.

Michael Flynn, Mr. Trump's former national security adviser, appeared before Judge Emmet Sullivan to be sentenced to what he expected would be a term of probation, after pleading guilty to lying to federal investigators about conversations with the Russian ambassador. The office of the special counsel, Robert Mueller, had earlier filed a memo that said it would be right for Mr. Flynn to avoid prison after his extensive co-operation in the investigation of Trump ties to Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential campaign and after.

Then last week, in a memo about their client's sentencing, Mr. Flynn's lawyers implied that he had been tricked into lying and that the F.B.I. acted improperly in interviewing him -- points raised by pro-Trump commentators elaborating on the president's claims of being victimized by a witch hunt.

Judge Sullivan was having none of it.

""I cannot recall an instance of a court ever accepting a guilty plea from someone who did not maintain he was guilty,"" Judge Sullivan said, ""and I do not intend to start today.""

Chastened, Mr. Flynn told the judge that nobody tricked him, that he lied and that he knew he shouldn't have.

The judge was not upset only about Mr. Flynn's sneaky prevarication. He said he felt ""disgust"" at Mr. Flynn's offences, that a retired three-star general would lie to the F.B.I. ""while on the physical premises of the White House,"" and, acting as an unregistered agent of a foreign country, Turkey, while he was an adviser to Mr. Trump (to which he admitted but was not charged). It was a bracing reminder of the brazenness of his misdeeds and of the standards the public should be able to expect of those who serve them.

Realizing that Judge Sullivan was considering a term of up to six months in prison, Mr. Flynn accepted his offer to delay the sentencing for 90 days until he has completed his co-operation with the special counsel.

""Good luck today in court to General Michael Flynn,"" Mr. Trump had tweeted first thing Tuesday morning.

""Thanks for nothing, Mr. President,"" Mr. Flynn might have thought as he left court.

Mr. Flynn should be grateful the judge offered him the chance to come clean. By contrast, the Donald J. Trump Foundation, a charity that provided no charity, quite properly received none from the New York attorney general's office.

Attorney General Barbara Underwood accused it of ""a shocking pattern of illegality"" that ""amounted to the Trump Foundation functioning as little more than a checkbook to serve Mr. Trump's business and political interests.""

Whatever money that remains will be disbursed under the supervision of Ms. Underwood's office and the judge overseeing the continuing lawsuit her office filed in June, seeking $2.8 million in restitution and a ban on Mr. Trump and his three oldest children serving on the boards of other non-profit organizations.

In a series of stories exposing the foundation's true nature, The Washington Post found that its largest donation was to fix a fountain in front of the Plaza Hotel in Manhattan, which Mr. Trump owned at the time, that its funds were used to buy a portrait of Mr. Trump, and that it illegally provided political donations and paid for personal legal settlements.

All this comes just days after prosecutors announced that they believed that Mr. Trump had conspired with the owner of The National Enquirer and his fixer Michael Cohen to violate campaign finance laws by paying hush money to two women who said they had affairs with him. It's also just been reported that prosecutors are investigating spending by the Trump inaugural committee. The president still faces lawsuits on the constitutionality of his enriching himself while in office. Meanwhile, the special counsel's inquiry may be expanding rather than winding down.

It's fitting that despite all his bluster and threats, a president who's demonstrated such contempt for the rule of law is finding it so formidable.

That this goes to the essence of American governance was best summed up by Paula Duncan, the Trump enthusiast who was among the jurors who found Mr. Trump's former campaign chief Paul Manafort guilty of fraud, even though she had hoped he wouldn't be convicted.

Explaining her decision after the verdict, she told Fox News, ""No one's above the law.""

The Wall Street Journal on a judge's ruling on the Affordable Care Act's individual mandate:

No one opposes ObamaCare more than we do, and Democrats are now confirming that it was designed as a way-station to government-run health care. But a federal judge's ruling that the law is unconstitutional is likely to be overturned on appeal and may boomerang politically on Republicans.

Judge Reed O'Connor ruled for some 20 state plaintiffs that the Affordable Care Act's individual mandate is no longer legal because Republicans repealed its financial penalty as part of the 2017 tax reform. Recall that Chief Justice John Roberts joined four Justices to say ObamaCare's mandate was illegal as a command to individuals to buy insurance under the Commerce Clause. ""The Framers gave Congress the power to regulate commerce, not to compel it,"" he wrote.

Yet the Chief famously salvaged ObamaCare by unilaterally rewriting the mandate to be a ""tax"" that was within Congress's power. Never mind that Democrats had expressly said the penalty was not a tax. Majority Leader Roberts declared it to be so.

Enter Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, who argues in Texas v. U.S. that since Congress has repealed the mandate, the tax is no longer a tax, and ObamaCare is thus illegal. Judge O'Connor agreed with that logic, and he went further in ruling that since Congress said the mandate is crucial to the structure of ObamaCare, then all of ObamaCare must fall along with the mandate.

We'll admit to a certain satisfaction in seeing the Chief Justice hoist on his own logic. But his ruling in NFIB v. Sebelius was in 2012 and there is more at issue legally now than the ""tax"" issue in that opinion. One legal complication is that Congress in 2017 repealed the financial part of the individual mandate, not the structure of the mandate itself. Republicans used budget rules to pass tax reform so they couldn't repeal the mandate's express language.

The Affordable Care Act has also been up and running since 2014, which means so-called reliance interests come into play when considering a precedent. Millions of people now rely on ObamaCare's subsidies and rules, which argues against judges repealing the law by fiat.

Judge O'Connor breezes past this like a liberal Ninth Circuit appeals judge handling a Donald Trump appeal. He's right that Democrats claimed the individual mandate was essential to the Affordable Care Act. But when Congress killed the financial penalty in 2017 it left the rest of ObamaCare intact. When judging congressional intent, a judge must account for the amending Congress as well as the original Congress.

In any case, the Supreme Court's ""severability"" doctrine calls for restraint in declaring an entire law illegal merely because one part of it is. Our guess is that even the right-leaning Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals judges will overturn Judge O'Connor on this point.

As for the politics, Democrats claim to be alarmed by the ruling but the truth is they're elated. They want to use it to further pound Republicans for denying health insurance for pre-existing conditions if the law is overturned. Democrats campaigned across the country against Mr. Paxton's lawsuit to gain House and Senate seats in November, and they will now press votes in Congress so they can compound the gains in 2020.

President Trump hailed the ruling in a tweet, but he has never understood the Affordable Care Act. His Administration has done good work revising regulations to reduce health-care costs and increase access, but the risk is that the lawsuit will cause Republicans in Congress to panic politically and strike a deal with Democrats that reinforces ObamaCare. This is what happens when conservatives fall into the liberal trap of thinking they can use the courts to achieve policy goals that need to be won in Congress.

The Washington Post on withdrawing all 2,000 U.S. troops out of Syria:

PRESIDENT TRUMP'S sudden move to yank U.S. troops out of Syria undermined at a stroke several foreign policy goals he has championed. The president promised to finish the job of destroying the Islamic State, but the withdrawal will leave thousands of its fighters still in place. He vowed to roll back Iran's aggression across the Middle East, but his decision will allow its forces to entrench in the country that is the keystone of Tehran's ambitions. He promised to protect Israel, but that nation will now be left to face alone the buildup by Iran and its proxies along its northern border.

The president's top national security advisers had carefully developed and articulated a strategy of maintaining a U.S. presence in Syria until the Islamic State was beyond revival and Iran withdrew its forces -- a plan they were defending up until this week. Mr. Trump has again demonstrated, to them and to the world, that no U.S. policy or foreign commitment is immune from his whims.

Mr. Trump claimed the Islamic State had been defeated, but that is not the view of the Defence and State Departments. Thousands of jihadist fighters are still in Syria and control splotches of territory in the Euphrates Valley. A U.S. withdrawal will give the extremists an opportunity to reconstitute, as they did in Iraq following the premature U.S. withdrawal ordered by President Barack Obama.

Until Wednesday, a prime talking point of senior national security officials was that, ""if we've learned one thing over the years, (the) enduring defeat of a group like this means you can't just defeat their physical space and then leave,"" as the State Department's special envoy for the global campaign against the Islamic State, Brett McGurk, put it last week. Defence Secretary Jim Mattis said it another way in September: ""Getting rid of the caliphate doesn't mean you then blindly say, 'Okay, we got rid of it,' march out, and then wonder why the caliphate comes back.""

Mr. Trump has justified some of his most controversial decisions, including his continued support for Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, as needed to contain Iran's threat to the United States and its allies. But the Syrian withdrawal hands Tehran and its ally Russia a windfall. Iran has deployed thousands of fighters and allied militiamen to Syria and aspires to create a corridor to Lebanon and the Mediterranean, as well as a new front against Israel along the Golan Heights. In reaction to that threat, Mr. Trump's national security adviser, John Bolton, announced Sept. 24 that ""We're not going to leave (Syria) as long as Iranian troops are outside Iranian borders, and that includes Iranian proxies and militias.""

U.S. ambitions in Syria have never been backed by adequate resources, and a case could be made that neither Congress nor the American public were prepared to support the mission suggested by Mr. Bolton. But Mr. Trump's decision appears to have been precipitated by the bellicose rhetoric of Turkey's Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who last week threatened -- not for the first time -- a military operation against Syrian Kurds, even though U.S. troops are positioned around them. The autocratic Turkish ruler appears to have extracted multiple favours from Mr. Trump in recent days, including the sale of U.S. Patriot missiles and a promise to reexamine the possible extradition of his rival, Fethullah Gulen, from Pennsylvania. If Mr. Trump received anything in return, he hasn't disclosed it.

The Syrian Kurdish forces, which have fought alongside the United States and played a crucial role in liberating most of eastern Syria from the jihadists, will be perhaps the foremost victims of Mr. Trump's decision. Betrayed by Washington, they will now be subject to a military offensive by Turkey. The stab in the back will send an unforgettable message to all who are asked to co-operate with the United States in the fight against terrorism: Washington is an unreliable and dangerous partner.

The Orange County (California) Register on Mick Mulvaney as Trump's choice for chief of staff:

President Trump has found a new chief of staff, albeit an interim one, in his director of the Office of Management and Budget, Mick Mulvaney.

That of chief is a terribly important post, perhaps government's most consequential aside from that of his boss. In theory, at least, the chief of staff is the gatekeeper for everything the president does, everyone he sees, everyone he talks to on the phone.

Perhaps, though few would expect this to be the case, the arbiter of every time he sends out a tweet, and of what it should say.

A Washington insider, a former congressman, Mulvaney is in many ways ideal for the job. He wants it, badly, whereas others with similarly impressive resumes touted for the job have indicated a strong desire to spend more time with their families, from Vice-President Pence's staff chief Nick Ayers of Georgia to former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie.

Mulvaney shares the conservative values currently espoused by the president and was a founder of the House Freedom Caucus in 2013, the group that always taunted the Republican leadership, opposing much government funding, including debt limit increases and budget agreements made with the Democrats.

But he also, after Trump secured the Republican nomination in 2016, called the candidate ""a terrible human being"" who he only was voting for out of an even greater dislike of Hillary Clinton.

It's not as if other presidential allies of today haven't said bad things about him in the past. On the campaign trail, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz called his rival ""a narcissist at a level I don't think this country's ever seen,"" for instance.

But if you were the nation's chief executive -- or the CEO of a much smaller entity, for that matter -- could you hire as your top aide and work with a person who had once dubbed you ""terrible""?

Or does this kind of talk come with the territory in politics, where many strange bedfellows are made because of having to run in elections against once and perhaps future allies? Should Trump indeed elevate this practical choice for staff chief to permanent status immediately?

Los Angeles Times on banning bump stocks, which allow semi-automatic weapons to fire like machine-guns:

The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives said Tuesday that it had finalized a rule reclassifying so-called bump stocks -- the devices that can make a semiautomatic rifle fire nearly as quickly a fully automatic weapon -- as machine-guns, which makes it illegal to manufacture, sell or possess them. The agency said a year ago it had the authority to reclassify the devices, and President Trump -- in the wake of the Parkland, Fla., school shooting -- directed the ATF to speed up the process. Tuesday's announcement -- a rare bit of welcome news from the Trump administration -- makes it official; White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters that owners of the conversion devices will have until March 21 to destroy them or turn them in to the ATF.

This is a good step. Unfortunately, it's all but certain to be challenged in the courts, and it's on shaky legal ground because of the way the new rule evolved. The Obama administration determined that because bump stocks have ""no automatically functioning mechanical parts and (perform) no automated mechanical functions when installed,"" they did not fit the definition of a machine-gun in federal law, which meant the ATF lacked the authority to regulate them. Tuesday's announcement, by contrast, hinges not on the technical specifications, but on the functionality. In essence, if it fires like a machine-gun, it's a machine-gun. Cue the lawyers.

We hope the administration prevails in whatever challenges emerge, but the sure-fire way to resolve this would be for Congress to legislate bump stocks and related gadgets out of existence. Such devices serve no function other than to evade the strict congressional limit on machine-guns by, as the ATF said, harnessing ""the recoil energy of the semiautomatic firearm in a manner that allows the trigger to reset and continue firing"" without the shooter having to pull the trigger for each shot.

A mass shooter in Las Vegas used bump stocks affixed to semiautomatic rifles to fire more than 1,000 rounds in a matter of minutes from a 32nd-floor suite of the Mandalay Bay Hotel into a crowd of some 20,000 people, killing 58 concertgoers and injuring hundreds of others. It was the largest single mass shooting in the modern era, drawing attention to bump stocks and sparking outraged demands by many -- the Los Angeles Times included -- that the devices be banned.

As welcome as this new rule is, it will do little to corral our national problem with gun violence. The vast majority of gun deaths come in ones and twos, led by suicides. ...

But it is progress. And the president deserves credit for sticking with his promise to find a way to ban bump stocks. ...

China Daily says telecommunications giant Huawei is a victim of U.S. panic attacks:

This year has not been an annus mirabilis for China's Huawei Technologies Ltd, the world's largest supplier of telecommunications network equipment and second-biggest maker of smartphones.

Although it has been constantly in the news and it is said there is no such thing as bad publicity, it has been making headlines because of the spurious claims it somehow poses a threat to the West, even world peace. It has never been explained exactly how.

In fact it is not because of anything it has done, but because its success has brought it into the crosshairs of the United States' anxiety attacks against China.

Huawei is at the forefront of 5G technology. This latest generation mobile network technology promises to bring the much anticipated and heralded internet of things to life and the US is determined to be the 5G leader.

Not only because whichever country develops the technology that is adopted as standard will have a huge commercial advantage. But also because by setting the standard it will have a knowledge advantage.

As a result, first the US and then one after another its most obedient allies have blocked Huawei from entering their 5G markets on security grounds.

None of them have offered any specific justification for blocking Huawei. They just repeat their claim that the company poses a security risk. That is why objective observers have concluded that those countries are politicizing a commercial issue.

It sets a harmful precedent. What if other countries used the same excuse to block US companies (not confined to the telecom sector)? The US companies are very competitive in many fields, including those that could pose huge security risks, such as finance.

While Huawei will not go unscathed from being prevented from entering key markets, as a competitive player, it still has a vast market to access in other parts of the world. It has signed contracts to supply 5G equipment to 25 telecom carriers, and more than 10,000 5G base stations have been shipped.

In stark contrast to the US and its allies, India for instance, has invited Huawei to conduct 5G trials in the country and complimented it on the role it has played in helping to develop its telecom industry.

The efforts of the US and its allies to try to shield their companies against a Chinese competitor are politically motivated, not the result of a fact-based or transparent decision-making process. And they are counterproductive to the concerted efforts that are needed to ensure the security of 5G networks."
285,winnipegfreepress.com,https://www.winnipegfreepress.com/arts-and-life/life/greenpage/federal-work-at-superfund-sites-suspended-during-shutdown-504238402.html,"BIRMINGHAM, Ala. - The government shutdown has suspended federal cleanups at Superfund sites around the nation and forced the cancellation of public hearings, deepening the mistrust and resentment of surrounding residents who feel people in power long ago abandoned them to live among the toxic residue of the country's factories and mines.

""We are already hurting, and it's just adding more fuel to the fire,"" says 40-year-old Keisha Brown. Her home is in a community nestled among plants that turn coal into carbon-rich fuel and other factories on Birmingham's north side.

The mostly African-American community has been forced to cope with high levels of arsenic, lead and other contaminants in the soil that the Environmental Protection Agency has been scraping up and carting away, house by house.

As President Donald Trump and Congress battle over Trump's demand for a wall on the southern U.S. border, the 3-week-old partial government shutdown has stopped federal work on Superfund sites except for cases where the administration deems ""there is an imminent threat to the safety of human life or to the protection of property.""

EPA's shutdown plans said the agency would evaluate about 800 Superfund sites to see how many could pose an immediate threat. As an example of that kind of threat, it cited an acid leak from a mine that could threaten the public water supply. That's the hazard at Northern California's Iron Mountain mine, where EPA workers help prevent an unending flow of lethally acidic runoff off the Superfund site from spilling into rivers downstream.

Practically speaking, said Bonnie Bellow, a former EPA official who worked on Superfund public outreach at the agency, the impact of the stoppage of work at sites across the nation ""wholly depends"" on the length of the shutdown.

""Unless there is immediate risk like a storm, a flood, a week or two of slowdowns is not going to very likely affect the cleanup at the site,"" Bellow said.

In north Birmingham, Brown said it's been a couple of weeks since she's spotted any EPA crews at people's houses. It was unclear if state workers or contractors were continuing work.

But long before the shutdown began, Brown harboured doubts the cleanup was working anyway.

""My main concern is the health of the people out here,"" said Brown, who has asthma. ""All of us are sick, and we've got to function on medicine every day.""

In terms of time, the federal government shutdown is a chronological blip in the long history of the site -- which includes ethics charges in a local bribery scandal to block federal cleanup efforts -- but adds to the uncertainty in an area where residents feel forgotten and betrayed.

At the EPA, the shutdown has furloughed the bulk of the agency's roughly 14,000 employees. It also means the EPA isn't getting most of the daily stream of environmental questions and tips from the public. Routine inspections aren't happening. State, local and private emails to EPA officials often get automated messages back promising a response when the shutdown ends.

In Montana, for instance, state officials this month found themselves fielding calls from a tribal member worried about drinking water with a funny look to it, said Kristi Ponozzo, public-policy director at that state's Department of Environmental Quality. The EPA normally provides tribes with technical assistance on water supplies.

With most EPA colleagues idled, Ponozzo said, her agency also had to call off an environmental review meeting for a mining project, potentially delaying the project.

But it's the agency's work at Superfund sites -- lessening the threat from old nuclear-weapons plants, chemical factories, mines and other entities -- that gets much of the attention.

Absent imminent peril, it would be up to state governments or contractors to continue any cleanup during the shutdown ""up to the point that additional EPA direction or funding is needed,"" the EPA said in a statement.

""Sites where cleanup activities have been stopped or shut down will be secured until cleanup activities are able to commence when the federal government reopens,"" the agency said.

For federal Superfund sites in Michigan, the shutdown means there are no EPA colleagues to consult, said Scott Dean, a spokesman for that state's Department of Environmental Quality.

At Michigan Superfund sites, day-to-day field operations were continuing since private contractors do most of the on-the-ground work, Dean said.

Bellow, the former EPA official, said the cancellation of hearings about Superfund sites posed immediate concerns.

In East Chicago, Indiana, for example, the EPA called off a planned public hearing set for last Wednesday to outline how the agency planned to clean up high levels of lead and arsenic in the soil.

The EPA has proposed a seven-month, $26.5 million cleanup that includes treating and removing tainted soil from the area, where a lead smelter was located.

During a public meeting Nov. 29, some residents complained that the EPA's approach would leave too much pollution in place. Others didn't get a chance to speak and were hoping to do so at the meeting this week, said Debbie Chizewer, a Northwestern University environmental attorney who represents community groups in the low-income area.

The EPA announced the cancellation in an online notice and gave no indication that it would be rescheduled.

Leaders of the East Chicago Calumet Community Advisory Group asked for a new hearing date and an extension of a Jan. 14 public comment deadline in a letter to the EPA's regional Superfund division.

Calls by The Associated Press to the agency's regional office in Chicago this week were not answered.

Local critics fear the EPA will use the delay caused by the shutdown as justification for pushing ahead with a cleanup strategy they consider flawed, Chizewer said, even though the agency has designated the affected area as an ""environmental justice community,"" a low-income community of colour that has been disproportionately harmed by pollution.

The EPA has a ""special obligation"" when dealing with such communities, Chizewer said. ""This would be an example of shutting them out for no good reason.""

In North Birmingham, former longtime neighbourhood resident Charlie Powell said most of the people living in and around the Superfund site had already ""just got tired and fed up.""

Powell left the area but started a group called PANIC, People Against Neighborhood Industrial Contamination. He said he believes money would be better spent helping residents move away from the pollution.

""Can I say hell?"" Powell said when asked what residents have been through.

WASHINGTON (AP) -- Pushing the government to the brink of a partial shutdown, the White House is insisting that Congress provide $5 billion to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border despite lawmaker resistance from both parties.

Without a resolution, parts of the federal government will shut down at midnight Friday.

""We're going to do whatever is necessary to build the border wall to stop this ongoing crisis of illegal immigration,"" White House senior adviser Stephen Miller said Sunday.

Asked if that meant having a government shutdown, he said: ""If it comes to it, absolutely.""

Trump said last week he would be ""proud"" to have a shutdown to get Congress to approve a $5 billion down payment to fulfil his campaign promise to build a border wall. But the president doesn't have the votes from the Republican-controlled Congress to support funding for the wall at that level.

Child's death highlights communication barriers on border

Shortly before a 7-year-old Guatemalan girl died in U.S. custody, her father signed a form stating that his daughter was in good health. But it's unclear how much the man understood on the form, which was written in English and read to him in Spanish by Border Patrol agents.

The death of Jakelin Caal highlights the communication challenges along the U.S.-Mexico border as agents come in contact with an increasing number of migrants who speak neither English nor Spanish.

Her father's native language is the Mayan tongue known as Q'eqchi'. His second language is Spanish. It's unclear whether something was lost in translation or whether it would have made a difference in saving Jakelin after the two were detained and underwent a health screening along a remote stretch of U.S.-Mexico border. But the case raises questions about the Border Patrol's use of English-only forms.

All agents are required to speak Spanish, and they receive formal Spanish training. Reading forms in Spanish is often enough to pose basic questions. But some other Spanish-speaking migrants reported signing paperwork that they later said they did not understand.

Scores of immigrant parents who were separated from their children after crossing the border in the spring said they signed forms agreeing to be deported with the understanding that their kids would be returning with them, only to find themselves deported without them. Many had to wait months before being reunited with them in their homelands.

US conducts 6 airstrikes against Somalia extremists, 62 dead

JOHANNESBURG (AP) -- The U.S. military says it has carried out six airstrikes in the Gandarshe area of Somalia which killed a total of 62 al-Shabab extremist rebels.

In a statement issued Monday, the U.S. military's Africa Command said it carried out four strikes on Dec. 15 in which 34 people were killed and two more on Dec. 16 which killed 28. All the air attacks were in the Gandarshe coastal area south of the capital, Mogadishu, it said.

No civilians were injured or killed in the attacks, it said.

All six strikes were carried out in close co-ordination with Somalia's government, it said. The airstrikes were ""conducted to prevent al-Shabab from using remote areas as a safe haven to plot, direct, inspire, and recruit for future attacks,"" it said.

Al-Shabab uses parts of southern and central Somalia to plot and direct extremist attacks, steal humanitarian aid, extort the local populace to fund its operations, and shelter radicals, said the statement.

Saudi Arabia rejects US Senate's 'interference' in kingdom

RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) -- Saudi Arabia issued an unusually strong rebuke of the U.S. Senate on Monday, rejecting a bipartisan resolution that put the blame for the killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi squarely on the Saudi crown prince and describing it as interference in the kingdom's affairs.

It's the latest sign of how the relationship between the royal court and Congress has deteriorated, more than two months after Khashoggi was killed and dismembered by Saudi agents inside the kingdom's consulate in Istanbul. The assassins have been linked to Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.

U.S. Senators last Thursday passed the measure that blamed the prince for Khashoggi's killing and called on Riyadh to ""ensure appropriate accountability."" Senators also passed a separate measure calling for the end of U.S. aid to the Saudi-led war in Yemen.

In a lengthy statement early Monday, Saudi Arabia said the Senate's resolution ""contained blatant interferences"" in the kingdom's internal affairs and undermines its regional and international role. The resolution was based on ""unsubstantiated claims and allegations,"" the statement also said.

""The kingdom categorically rejects any interference in its internal affairs, any and all accusations, in any manner, that disrespect its leadership ... and any attempts to undermine its sovereignty or diminish its stature,"" it said.

Most teen drug use is down, but officials fret vaping boom

NEW YORK (AP) -- Twice as many high school students used nicotine-tinged electronic cigarettes this year compared with last year, an unprecedented jump in a large annual survey of teen smoking, drinking and drug use.

It was the largest single-year increase in the survey's 44-year history, far surpassing a mid-1970s surge in marijuana smoking.

The findings, released Monday, echo those of a government survey earlier this year. That survey also found a dramatic rise in vaping among children and prompted federal regulators to press for measures that make it harder for kids to get them.

Experts attribute the jump to newer versions of e-cigarettes, like those by Juul Labs Inc. that resemble computer flash drives and can be used discreetly.

Trina Hale, a junior at South Charleston High School in West Virginia, said vaping -- specifically Juul -- exploded at her school this year.

Locked away, forgotten: Muslim Uighur wives of Pakistani men

ISLAMABAD (AP) -- The last time Chaudhry Javed Atta saw his wife was over a year ago -- the Pakistani trader in dried and fresh produce was leaving their home in northwestern China's heavily Muslim Xinjiang region to go back to his country to renew his visa.

He remembers the last thing she told him: ""As soon as you leave, they will take me to the camp and I will not come back.""

That was August, 2017. By then, Atta and Amina Manaji, from the Muslim ethnic Uighur group native to Xinjiang, had been married for 14 years.

Atta is one of scores of Pakistani businessmen __ and he says there are more than 200 __ whose spouses have disappeared, taken to what Chinese authorities tell them are education centres.

Beijing has been accused of interning members of its Muslim population -- by some reports as many as 1 million -- to ""re-educate"" them away from their faith. It is seen as a response to riots and violent attacks that the government blamed on separatists.

Talks adopt 'rulebook' to put Paris climate deal into action

KATOWICE, Poland (AP) -- Almost 200 nations, including the world's top greenhouse gas producers, China and the United States, have adopted a set of rules meant to breathe life into the 2015 Paris climate accord by setting out how countries should report their emissions and efforts to reduce them.

But negotiators delayed other key decisions until next year -- a move that frustrated environmentalists and countries that wanted more ambitious goals in light of scientists' warnings that the world must shift sharply away from fossil fuels in the coming decade.

""The majority of the rulebook for the Paris agreement has been created, which is something to be thankful for,"" said Mohamed Adow, a climate policy expert at Christian Aid. ""But the fact countries had to be dragged kicking and screaming to the finish line shows that some nations have not woken up"" to the dire consequences of global warming as outlined in a report by the U.N Panel on Climate Change, or IPCC.

Officials at the talks, which ended late Saturday in the Polish city of Katowice, agreed upon universal rules on how nations can cut emissions. Poor countries secured assurances on financial support to help them reduce emissions, adapt to changes such as rising sea levels and pay for damage that has already happened.

""Through this package, you have made a thousand little steps forward together,"" said Michal Kurtyka, a senior Polish official who led the talks.

Nissan to replace rock-star chairman amid arrest scandal

TOKYO (AP) -- Nissan's board is meeting to pick a chairman to replace Carlos Ghosn, arrested last month on charges of violating financial regulations.

Monday's meeting comes amid an unfolding scandal that threatens the Japanese automaker's two-decade alliance with Renault SA of France and its global brand, as well as highlighting shoddy governance at the manufacturer of the Leaf electric car.

Ghosn and another board member Greg Kelly were formally charged last week with falsifying financial reports in underreporting Ghosn's income by about 5 billion yen ($44 million) between 2011 and 2015. They were arrested Nov. 19 by Tokyo prosecutors and remain in detention.

A source close to Ghosn's family says Ghosn is innocent as the alleged income was never decided upon or paid. Aubrey Harwell, the U.S. lawyer for Kelly, an American, says he is innocent, and that Nissan insiders and outside experts had advised him the financial reporting was proper.

The chairman must be selected from among the board members. Whether a decision will come Monday remains unclear. Three outside board members, racecar driver Keiko Ihara, Masakazu Toyoda, an academic, and Jean-Baptiste Duzan, formerly of Renault, are making that decision. There are nine board members, including Ghosn and Kelly.

Top of mind: 'Justice' is Merriam-Webster's word of the year

NEW YORK (AP) -- Racial justice. Obstruction of justice. Social justice. The Justice Department. Merriam-Webster has chosen ""justice"" as its 2018 word of the year, driven by the churning news cycle over months and months.

The word follows ""toxic,"" picked by Oxford Dictionaries, and ""misinformation,"" plucked by Dictonary.com.

Peter Sokolowski, Merriam-Webster's editor at large, told The Associated Press ahead of Monday's announcement that ""justice"" consistently bubbled into the top 20 or 30 lookups on the company's website, spiking at times due to specific events but also skating close to the surface for much of the year.

While it's one of those common words people likely know how to spell and use correctly in a sentence, Sokolowski pointed to other reasons that drive search traffic. Among them is an attempt to focus a train of thought around a philosophical problem, or to seek aspirational motivation. Such well-known words are often among the most looked up every year, including those that are slightly abstract, including ""love,"" he said.

The designation for ""justice"" came soon after President Trump's one-time fixer, Michael Cohen, was sentenced to three years in prison for crimes that included arranging the payment of hush money to conceal his boss' alleged sexual affairs. He told a judge he agreed time and again to cover up Trump's ""dirty deeds"" out of ""blind loyalty."""

288,star-telegram,https://www.star-telegram.com/news/politics-government/national-politics/article224126560.html,"The Latest on President Donald Trump and the partial government shutdown (all times local):

3:16 p.m.

Congressional leaders from both parties have returned to the White House for another round of negotiations with President Donald Trump on the ongoing partial government shutdown.

The two sides have made no apparent progress in the past week, with Trump sticking to his demand of $5.7 billion for a border barrier and Democrats insisting they won't give him the money.

Trump has been making a public case that there is a ""crisis"" at the southern border. And he's still threatening to declare a national emergency to circumvent Congress if he can't get the wall money from them.

He told reporters during a visit to the Capitol earlier Wednesday that he may turn to a declaration ""at some point"" if top Democrats Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi ""don't agree"" with his assessment about the problems at the border.

President Donald Trump says Republicans are ""totally unified"" in the shutdown standoff over his long-promised southern border wall, though some GOP lawmakers have been expressing concern about the 19-day partial government closure.

Trump traveled to Capitol Hill on Wednesday to meet with Senate Republicans. He says there was ""no discussion about anything other than solidarity.""

Trump has been considering a national emergency declaration to bypass Congress to build the wall. He says he ""may do that at some point"" if he can't get a deal with Democrats.

Trump also plans to meet with top congressional Democrats and Republicans at the White House on Wednesday.

President Donald Trump arrived on Capitol Hill claiming he has ""tremendous"" support as he headed into a meeting with Republican senators uneasy with the government shutdown over his border wall.

Asked how long the shutdown would last, Trump told reporters Wednesday ""whatever it takes.""

The partial shutdown is now in its 19th day, the second longest ever.

Trump and Vice President Mike Pence arrived for the private lunch meeting with the Senate GOP caucus to shore up support.

Several Republican senators have said the government should be re-opened while talks continue over border security and Trump's demand for money to build the wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.

President Donald Trump says he thinks he and the Democrats are ""getting closer"" to a deal to end the budget stalemate that has partially shut down the government despite no evidence that any progress has been made.

And he's suggesting the partial government shutdown could be ""a blessing in disguise"" because, he suggests, it could lead to a broader immigration deal.

Trump spoke Wednesday during an Oval Office bill signing on anti-human trafficking legislation. It's a day after he delivered a prime-time address trying to make the case for his long-stalled U.S.-Mexico border wall.

Trump says that he would like to see ""real immigration reform in this country because we need it."" He says, ""Everybody wants to see immigration reform,"" adding that perhaps the stalemate ""will turn out to be a blessing in disguise.""

Gone are the days when the U.S. and Mexican governments regularly exchanged statements over President Donald Trump's insistence on a border wall.

Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said Wednesday he won't be drawn into what he calls a U.S. internal dispute, an apparent reference to the 19-day-old partial U.S. government shutdown over a border barrier.

Lopez Obrador says, ""We are not going to respond to situations arising from internal affairs in the United States.""

Unlike his predecessor, the Mexican leader didn't have to respond to any specific aspersion about Mexico, because Trump didn't make any in his Tuesday night address to the American public. Relations between the two leaders have been surprisingly cordial, given their ideological differences.

Lopez Obrador said, ""Of course, there are those ... who want us to get into a confrontation. We always want a friendly relationship with the United States, a cooperative relationship.""

As a presidential candidate Trump promised Mexico would pay for a border wall, but Mexico refused.

President Donald Trump is using a bill signing focused on curbing human trafficking to push his case for a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border.

Trump says a southern border that is not secured exacerbates the incidents of human trafficking. He says, ""As long as we have a border that is not secure, we're going to suffer the consequences of that.""

Wednesday's bill signing came a day after Trump's prime-time speech designed to persuade Americans that illegal immigration and trafficking at the border are a crisis.

Democrats have called Trump's promised wall costly, ineffective and ""immoral"" and say he's ""manufacturing a crisis.""

The bill Trump signed is designed to enhance an annual State Department report that measures global efforts to eliminate human trafficking.

The White House says it's the fourth bipartisan bill the Republican president has signed in the last few weeks to prevent human trafficking.

Congressional Democrats say they'll head to the White House with the plan to reopen the government -- the same one they've been presenting. They're asking President Donald Trump to accept a bipartisan bill to fund border security without the wall.

Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Wednesday the president ""could end the Trump shutdown and re-open the government today, and he should.""

Pelosi and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer spoke at an event where they were flanked by federal workers going without pay during the shutdown, now in its 19th day.

Schumer called workers the ""collateral damage"" of Trump's ""temper tantrum."" He said the president failed to ""persuade a soul"" during his ""divisive"" prime-time address Tuesday night to the nation.

Trump meets with congressional leaders at the White House Wednesday afternoon. He rejected the Senate's bipartisan funding bill in December, sparking the shutdown.

The White House is trying to keep jittery congressional Republicans from defecting over the toll the partial government shutdown is taking in their states.

President Donald Trump and Democrats have been at an impasse over funding for his proposed border wall, which has led to a partial government shutdown, now in its 19th day.

Trump meets with Senate Republicans Wednesday on Capitol Hill just hours after he argued on national television that a border wall was needed to resolve a security and humanitarian ""crisis.""

Senators say the shutdown has led to disruptions in agricultural payments for farmers, as well as for home buyers trying to secure government-backed home loans. Lawmakers also are worried about missed paychecks for government workers Friday.

As many as half a dozen GOP senators have said the government should reopen while border security negotiations with Democrats continue.

President Donald Trump again linked illegal immigration along the southern border with drugs and violent crime as he urged Democratic lawmakers to fund his proposed border wall.

In his first national address from the Oval Office, the president gave no indication he was softening his stance that the partial government shutdown would continue without money for the wall.

Trump argued Tuesday night that the wall was needed to resolve what he called a security and humanitarian ""crisis.""

He addressed the nation as the shutdown stretched through its third week, with hundreds of thousands of federal workers going without pay and some congressional Republicans growing increasingly jittery about the impasse.

Trump plans to visit Senate Republicans at the Capitol on Wednesday before meeting with Democratic leaders at the White House."

One Republican senator says he's offered President Donald Trump a possible solution, though it may just be wishful thinking.

Sen. Lindsey Graham is encouraging Trump to reopen government for several weeks to continue negotiating with Democrats over the border wall Trump wants to build on the U.S.-Mexico border. If there's no deal at the end of that time, Graham says Trump would be free to take the more dramatic step of declaring a national emergency to build it.

But the South Carolina Republican says Trump still wants a deal on funding for the wall before agreeing to reopen shuttered government departments. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat, insists Trump reopen the government first.

Their weeks-old standoff led to the partial government shutdown, now on day 24 without a clear end in sight.

""Before he pulls the plug on the legislative option, and I think we're almost there, I would urge him to open up the government for a short period of time, like three weeks, before he pulls the plug, see if we can get a deal,"" Graham said. ""If we can't at the end of three weeks, all bets are off.

""See if he can do it by himself through the emergency powers. That's my recommendation,"" added Graham, who has publicly pushed Trump to use his authority to declare a national emergency to build the wall. Such a step would allow Trump to bypass Congress and tap various pots of unspent federal money, including for military construction and disaster relief as well as from assets seized by law enforcement, to pay for the wall.

Trump has kept Washington on edge over whether he would resort to such a declaration, citing what he says is a ""crisis"" of drug smuggling and the trafficking of women and children at the border. The president initially sounded as though such a move was imminent, but then pulled back. He has said several times since he first mentioned the idea in public this month that he prefers a legislative solution.

A key question is how much more time is Trump willing to give lawmakers. Graham, who spoke with Trump by telephone on Sunday morning, said the legislative path ""is just about shut off"" and blamed intransigence by Pelosi.

The speaker's office had no immediate comment.

Democrats oppose an emergency declaration but may be powerless to block it. Some Republicans are wary, too, fearing how a future Democratic president might use that authority. Such a move, should Trump ultimately go that route, would almost certainly be challenged in the courts.

Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., called Graham's idea to reopen the government a ""great place to start.""

""I do think if we reopen the government, if the president ends this shutdown crisis, we have folks who can negotiate a responsible, modern investment in technology that will actually make us safer,"" Coons said.

Trump says technology is nice, but that the border can't be secured without a wall.

The White House has been laying the groundwork for an emergency declaration, which is feared by lawmakers in both parties.

Senate Homeland Security Committee Chairman Ron Johnson, R-Wis., said he'd ""hate to see"" a declaration issued because the wall wouldn't get built, presumably because of legal challenges. Democrats voted in the past for border security and should again, he said.

""I actually want to see this wall get built,"" Johnson said. ""I want to keep pressure on Democrats to actually come to the negotiating table in good faith and fund what they have supported in the past.""

Graham favors a declaration and said the time for talk is running out.

""It's the last option, not the first option, but we're pretty close to that being the only option,"" he said.

Graham and Coons spoke on ""Fox News Sunday"" and Johnson appeared on CNN's ""State of the Union."""
290,star-telegram,https://www.star-telegram.com/news/nation-world/national/article223193915.html,"White House digs in on border wall demand, risking shutdown

WASHINGTON (AP) -- The White House on Sunday pushed the federal government closer to the brink of a partial shutdown later this week, digging in on its demand for $5 billion to build a border wall as congressional Democrats stood firm against it.

""We're going to do whatever is necessary to build the border wall to stop this ongoing crisis of illegal immigration,"" said White House senior adviser Stephen Miller.

Asked if that meant having a government shutdown, he said: ""If it comes to it, absolutely.""

Trump said last week he would be ""proud"" to have a shutdown to get Congress to approve a $5 billion down payment to fulfill his campaign promise to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. But the president doesn't have the votes from the Republican-controlled Congress to support funding for the wall at that level.

Democratic congressional leaders, Sen. Chuck Schumer and Rep. Nancy Pelosi, have proposed no more than $1.6 billion, as outlined in a bipartisan Senate bill. The money would not go for the wall but for fencing upgrades and other border security. Democrats also offered to simply keep funding at its current level, $1.3 billion.

Trump lawyer Giuliani rules out Mueller interview with Trump

WASHINGTON (AP) -- With a number of probes moving closer to the Oval Office, President Donald Trump and his attorney unleashed a fresh series of attacks on the investigators, questioning their integrity while categorically ruling out the possibility of a presidential interview with the special counsel.

Trump and Rudy Giuliani used Twitter and television interviews Sunday to deliver a series of broadsides against special counsel Robert Mueller and federal prosecutors in New York. Giuliani said he was ""disgusted"" by the tactics used by Mueller in his probe into Russian election interference, including in securing guilty pleas from the president's former national security adviser Michael Flynn on a charge of lying to federal investigators.

Trump, Giuliani said, would not submit to an interview by Mueller's team.

""They're a joke,"" Giuliani told ""Fox News Sunday."" ''Over my dead body, but, you know, I could be dead.""

The special counsel, who is investigating possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russia, has continued to request an interview with the president. Last month, the White House sent written answers in response to the special counsel's questions about possible collusion. The White House has resisted answering questions on possible obstruction of justice.

Child's death highlights communication barriers on border

Shortly before a 7-year-old Guatemalan girl died in U.S. custody, her father signed a form stating that his daughter was in good health. But it's unclear how much the man understood on the form, which was written in English and read to him in Spanish by Border Patrol agents.

The death of Jakelin Caal highlights the communication challenges along the U.S.-Mexico border as agents come in contact with an increasing number of migrants who speak neither English nor Spanish.

Her father's native language is the Mayan tongue known as Q'eqchi'. His second language is Spanish. It's unclear whether something was lost in translation or whether it would have made a difference in saving Jakelin after the two were detained and underwent a health screening along a remote stretch of U.S.-Mexico border. But the case raises questions about the Border Patrol's use of English-only forms.

All agents are required to speak Spanish, and they receive formal Spanish training. Reading forms in Spanish is often enough to pose basic questions. But some other Spanish-speaking migrants reported signing paperwork that they later said they did not understand.

Scores of immigrant parents who were separated from their children after crossing the border in the spring said they signed forms agreeing to be deported with the understanding that their kids would be returning with them, only to find themselves deported without them. Many had to wait months before being reunited with them in their homelands.

Talks adopt 'rulebook' to put Paris climate deal into action

KATOWICE, Poland (AP) -- Almost 200 nations, including the world's top greenhouse gas producers, China and the United States, have adopted a set of rules meant to breathe life into the 2015 Paris climate accord by setting out how countries should report their emissions and efforts to reduce them.

But negotiators delayed other key decisions until next year -- a move that frustrated environmentalists and countries that wanted more ambitious goals in light of scientists' warnings that the world must shift sharply away from fossil fuels in the coming decade.

""The majority of the rulebook for the Paris agreement has been created, which is something to be thankful for,"" said Mohamed Adow, a climate policy expert at Christian Aid. ""But the fact countries had to be dragged kicking and screaming to the finish line shows that some nations have not woken up"" to the dire consequences of global warming as outlined in a report by the U.N Panel on Climate Change, or IPCC.

Officials at the talks, which ended late Saturday in the Polish city of Katowice, agreed upon universal rules on how nations can cut emissions. Poor countries secured assurances on financial support to help them reduce emissions, adapt to changes such as rising sea levels and pay for damage that has already happened.

""Through this package, you have made a thousand little steps forward together,"" said Michal Kurtyka, a senior Polish official who led the talks.

French city honors victims of Christmas market attack

PARIS (AP) -- People filled a square in the French city of Strasbourg on Sunday to show respect and sympathy for the victims of last week's shooting attack near a famous Christmas market as the death toll rose to five.

French authorities said a Polish man died in a Strasbourg hospital Sunday, one of a dozen people wounded in last Tuesday's attack. Poland's Foreign Ministry extended condolences Sunday on Twitter to his family.

According to the newspaper DNA, more than 1,000 people attended the memorial, which ended with a minute of applause and a rendition of France's national anthem, ""La Marseillaise.""

The hour-long ceremony took place in Kleber Square, not far from where a gunman opened fire on Tuesday evening. Strasbourg Mayor Roland Ries praised the city's resilience in the face of hardship.

The ""extremely large crowd in the Christmas market"" on Saturday ""was an illustration of our commitment to these values ??on which our living together is based, which we will continue to defend against all those who want to attack it,"" Ries said.

Not into bingo, 84-year-old Texas woman gets college degree

RICHARDSON, Texas (AP) -- After raising five kids and retiring at age 77 from her secretarial job, Janet Fein couldn't be blamed for finally relaxing, but that's not her.

Fein, now 84, went to back to school and will accomplish a long-held goal this week when she graduates from the University of Texas at Dallas with a bachelor's degree.

""I didn't have anything to do in retirement and I didn't think that playing bingo was up to my speed,"" said Fein, who majored in sociology because she felt it was ""substantial.""

She said she enjoyed all the reading and writing papers. ""With each class I already knew a lot, but then I also learned a lot. And that made me happy,"" she said.

People 65 and older make up less than one percent of U.S. college students. In 2015, they accounted for about 67,000 of about 20 million college students, according to the National Center for Education Statistics.

Next-generation of GPS satellites are headed to space

DENVER (AP) -- After months of delays, the U.S. Air Force is about to launch the first of a new generation of GPS satellites, designed to be more accurate, secure and versatile.

But some of their most highly touted features will not be fully available until 2022 or later because of problems in a companion program to develop a new ground control system for the satellites, government auditors said.

The satellite is scheduled to lift off Tuesday from Cape Canaveral, Florida, aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. It's the first of 32 planned GPS III satellites that will replace older ones now in orbit. Lockheed Martin is building the new satellites outside Denver.

GPS is best-known for its widespread civilian applications, from navigation to time-stamping bank transactions. The Air Force estimates that 4 billion people worldwide use the system.

But it was developed by the U.S. military, which still designs, launches and operates the system. The Air Force controls a constellation of 31 GPS satellites from a high-security complex at Schriever Air Force Base outside Colorado Springs.

After fraud probe, new primary may replace GOP candidate

RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- Legislation quickly passed by North Carolina's lawmakers this week would prepare a path for Republicans to dump their nominee in a still-undecided U.S. House race marred with ballot fraud allegations.

""I think (legislators are) worried that Mark Harris might be damaged goods and they want to have the opportunity to have a different Republican nominee,"" said Carter Wrenn, a Republican operative and consultant to former U.S. Sen. Jesse Helms and others for more than 40 years. ""That's how I read those tea leaves.""

If the state elections board decides ballot irregularities or other problems cast the true outcome into doubt and force a redo, the legislation -- if allowed to go into law by Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper -- would require new primary elections in the 9th Congressional District race, in addition to a new general election.

That would allow Republicans another look at Mark Harris, the Republican who led Democrat Dan McCready by 905 votes in unofficial results. Harris hasn't been certified the winner, and an investigation is looking into missing absentee ballots in rural Bladen County and whether unsealed ballots illegally handled by collection teams there could have been altered.

Bladen was the only county among the eight within the 9th District where Harris won a majority of mail-in absentee ballots over McCready.

Top of mind: 'Justice' is Merriam-Webster's word of the year

NEW YORK (AP) -- Racial justice. Obstruction of justice. Social justice. The Justice Department. Merriam-Webster has chosen ""justice"" as its 2018 word of the year, driven by the churning news cycle over months and months.

The word follows ""toxic,"" picked by Oxford Dictionaries, and ""misinformation,"" plucked by Dictonary.com.

Peter Sokolowski, Merriam-Webster's editor at large, told The Associated Press ahead of Monday's announcement that ""justice"" consistently bubbled into the top 20 or 30 lookups on the company's website, spiking at times due to specific events but also skating close to the surface for much of the year.

While it's one of those common words people likely know how to spell and use correctly in a sentence, Sokolowski pointed to other reasons that drive search traffic. Among them is an attempt to focus a train of thought around a philosophical problem, or to seek aspirational motivation. Such well-known words are often among the most looked up every year, including those that are slightly abstract, including ""love,"" he said.

The designation for ""justice"" came soon after President Trump's one-time fixer, Michael Cohen, was sentenced to three years in prison for crimes that included arranging the payment of hush money to conceal his boss' alleged sexual affairs. He told a judge he agreed time and again to cover up Trump's ""dirty deeds"" out of ""blind loyalty.""

'Spider-Verse' swings to the top; 'Mortal Engines' tanks

LOS ANGELES (AP) -- ""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse"" swung to the top of the domestic box office in its first weekend in theaters, proving that there is widespread audience interest in big screen animated versions of Marvel's marquee superheroes.

The film led a host of newcomers that debuted to varying success on this pre-Christmas holiday weekend, including Clint Eastwood's drug smuggling drama ""The Mule"" and the Peter Jackson-produced epic ""Mortal Engines"" which bombed in North American theaters.

""Into the Spider-Verse"" earned an estimated $35.4 million from 3,813 theaters against a $90 million production budget according to Sony Pictures on Sunday, which is a record for animated movies in December (although the hybrid ""Alvin and the Chipmunks"" movies were higher). The film features an innovative animation style -- both CGI and hand-drawn -- and focuses on the Miles Morales character as he learns to become the famed web-slinger. It's another financial win for the studio's latest ""expanded Spider-Man universe"" strategy following ""Venom"" and ""Spider-Man: Homecoming.""

And ""Spider-Verse"" has been very well-received among critics, and audiences in exit surveys gave it a rare A+ CinemaScore -- a first for a Spider-Man film. It's also been nominated for a Golden Globe award for best animated feature and picked up a few honors from critics' groups as well, including the New York Film Critics Circle.

""We are playing to both families and fanboys. We're an all-audience film,"" said Adrian Smith, Sony's president of domestic distribution."
291,wccftech,https://wccftech.com/the-financial-year-in-tech-2018-highs-lows-and-future-trends/,"2018. What a year it's been. The tech industry has given us huge highs and lows this year and stock prices have soared and tumbled in equal measure. Here, we take a look at the high level of the major tech companies and industry trends we follow here at Wccftech as well as what we can look forward to in 2019 with my usual forward guidance. It's worth keeping in mind for anyone watching the market at the moment that liquidity is extremely thin in December and as such, any buyers and sellers are moving markets by bigger margins on smaller volumes than normal.

The little electric car company that could finally showed us that it... could? That's right, we're talking about turn a profit. Tesla has been a rollercoaster stock in recent years and the ""will it, won't it"" saga has gone on for a long time. Tesla has turned a profit once before this year but we don't count that since it came from selling electric car credits to other manufacturers. 2018 is the year that Tesla finally turned the corner and hit profitability from ACTUALLY MAKING CARS. The Model 3 did what Elon Musk promised and ramped production to a level that allowed the carmaker to turn a profit. Volatility aside, the stock is basically flat in Q4 which is actually a great performance considering a lot of other stuff is down 20%.

A long, drawn out saga running to several years in length. Michael Dell's eponymous company, having had enough of activist investors who battered the company's stock given its heavy exposure to PC and lack of alternative revenue streams went private in a media frenzy back in 2013 with backing from Silver Lake, Microsoft and others to try to restructure away from the gaze of Wall Street. 5 years later and with even more arguments with activist investors over the wrangling from its non-IPO return to public markets and appropriate valuation levels, the firm is about to re-enter the limelight as a publicly traded tech company again.

Under Satya Nadella, Microsoft has continued to reposition itself successfully into what was supposed to be the ""post-PC"" era. PC is still a thing of course but Microsoft has definitely been an earnings success story for the year. Windows 10 has been gaining traction, gaming and cloud have grown faster than expected and the recent tie-up with Refinitiv (formerly Thomson Reuters Financial & Risk division) will likely see its Office 365 product gain greater penetration, a move which the company would no doubt welcome as it looks to shift users to a subscription model which much of the tech world pursues.

The world's first trillion dollar company. Well, for a little while at least. Apple has since dialled back its sky high valuation with a market cap that looks to finish the year around $750 billion, but the history books have been written and nobody will take that away from Tim Cook.

Related Apple Rumored to Use in-Hole Display Technology for Its 2020 iPhone Lineup, According to Tipster

Love him or hate him, President Trump has had a big success in terms of tech world finances with his plan to make big companies bring overseas cash hauls home. Big tech was one of the worst offenders when it came to squirreling away cash in tax havens and just letting it sit there doing nothing. A massive discount to bringing the cash back to US shores and deeming the cash repatriated later and we've got capital doing what it should be doing again, looking for the best way to be invested and gain a return. As predicted in my piece 2 years ago, this has seen an increase in dealmaking and M&A activity across the technology industry.

While 2017 was regarded by many as the rise of the cryptos, 2018 was the year that cryptocurrencies, digital assets, whatever you choose to call them came crashing down to the ground and hard. With widespread institutional and regulatory investigation into what is going on in the crypto world. Distributed Ledger Technology (DLT) seems to be the undisputed takeaway from the crypto boom and certainly has many real world applications but the replacement of fiat is a long way off. Good news for GPU buyers but bad news for a lot of investors.

For a variety of reasons, numerous chip stocks have had a mediocre year. The bursting of the crypto bubble hit AMD (NASDAQ:AMD) and NVIDIA (NASDAQ:NVDA) hard, although AMD does finish the year with its stock up (from about $11/share to about $17/share) as it has continued to successfully reposition its CPU business. NVIDIA, Intel (NASDAQ:INTC), Qualcomm (NASDAQ:QCOM) and Broadcom (NASDAQ:AVGO) are all down on the year. Couple this with fallout from the trade war between the US and China hitting Qualcomm's attempts to acquire NXP (NASDAQ:NXPI) (Chinese regulators didn't approve the deal) and although the companies have made money this year, stock performance hasn't matched trading performance. Quite normal in the tech world where companies often trade at huge multiples of P/E on the basis of future expectations.

What Trump giveth with one hand (tax cuts), Trump taketh with the other (tariffs). It's impossible to discuss finances (and in particular tech finances) in the current climate without touching on politics and the trade war between the US and China. Tariffs have started to bite and tech has undoubtedly borne a significant part of the burden of the trade war between the two giants. ZTE, Huawei, Apple, NVIDIA, Foxconn and others have all been scrambling to figure out whether the trade war has legs or not and what to do to mitigate it if indeed it does become a long term part of the financial landscape.

Yep, 2018 has seen numerous problems for the electric carmaker, particularly in the shape of the famed ""funding secured"" tweet from Elon who was looking to take the company private to escape short sellers. An SEC investigation, loss of board control, lawsuits from shorts and ultimately fines for both the company and Elon Musk ensued. Volatility in the stock has been off the charts and it finishes the year basically flat. Investors will be hoping for a quieter 2019 where its CEO avoids the controversy he has become known for and focusses on delivering cars.

It's been a tough year for social media, particularly in the shape of Snap (NYSE:SNAP) despite better than expected earnings in February, the overall story of the year has been one of poor performance. A slated redesign, criticism from stars and a two thirds collapse in share price. Competition from Facebook ((NASDDAQ:FB) owned Instagram has been intense and many question whether Snap has the legs to continue at its current level of investment.

Facebook itself of course has had its own issues this year with international government scrutiny of its operations at a high water mark following a number of scandals in recent years, culminating in the Cambridge Analytica debacle. Facebook finishes the year almost a third down on its opening price.

Have we reached peak iPhone? The market seems to think so and it looks like Apple does too. From the heady heights of being the first trillion dollar company in the world, Apple's stock has collapsed by over 35% following continued legal tussles with Qualcomm, supplier profit warnings indicating scaled back orders for the latest devices and Apple itself saying it will no longer break out sales numbers of its devices in earnings reports. The trade war hasn't helped of course given that Apple's devices are mostly manufactured in China.

Apple is still making huge, fistfuls of money of course, but the mammoth growth prospects of yesteryear on current product line-up look mediocre at best.

Politics aside, Brexit has seen numerous jewels in the UK's business crown get snapped up cheaply by foreign companies as the pound has continued its rollercoaster ride. With cable (GBPUSD) bumbling along at lows not seen since the 1980s and the prospect of a no-deal Brexit coming into rapidly sharper focus by the day, business faces significant disruption as political deadlock in parliament means contingency planning in EU countries by numerous financial services firms is already well underway with investment in the UK put on hold and sizeable business from the UK's finance industry already in the process of moving to Frankfurt, Paris, Amsterdam and others.

This of course also makes investing a hugely worrisome affair for us Brits as in the event that sterling recovers after we've moved money abroad, the gains will all be eaten away when we try to bring it back to the UK. Similarly, if a Labour government led by Corbyn comes to power any time soon, it is likely that the market will react badly and UK based investments will perform poorly. Politics unfortunately interfering in business.

2 years ago, we called the incoming President Trump a ""too early to tell"". Politics aside, it's clear that the President has created significant uncertainty in the global business landscape, perhaps none more so than with his tariffs on China and his approach to multilateral international trade in general. Couple this with fierce criticism of his own handpicked Fed Chair Jerome Powell for US monetary policy and then Steve Mnuchin scrambling (and failing) to attempt to reassure markets in the face of investor concern over his boss' seeming hatred of the Fed and it's difficult to see how the market will react positively.

Finance and tech company finances in 2019 and beyond are likely to be dominated by the political landscape. We've already seen a huge selloff in the equities markets in the fourth quarter of 2018 with investor confidence shaken significantly by the huge degrees of uncertainty created in the global economy. Politics aside, it is clear that President Trump has rattled global markets and investor confidence in sustained growth after one of the longest bull market runs in living memory.

It's not just the US either, although most major tech companies are US listed. The FTSE 100 (UK), Nikkei (Japan), Hang Seng (Hong Kong), DAX (Germany), CAC (France) and other major global indices have all joined the Dow, S&P, NASDAQ and PHLX SOX in collapsing into freefall territory since October, with trading over the Christmas period being particularly poor and the US officially hitting a bear market just before Christmas.

It's worth keeping in mind that this may be the result of rattled investors amid the traditionally light volumes that accompany December trading, however the market has had ample opportunity to recover in Q4 and seems to have been struggled to do so. As such, this seems like something that is less likely to be just shrugged off come January. Stocks are still predicted to grow in 2019, but perhaps with less vigour than in the past. A retrospective may be required of global political leaders if they are indeed to shepherd us towards stable, continued growth.

Tech stocks have fuelled much of the overall market growth since the 2008 crisis and investors have piled into them hoping to ride the wave of ever higher gains. When a market gets valued that highly, inevitably the correction will disproportionately hit it and this is some of what we've seen happening recently with gains and losses on blue chips amplified in tech stocks.

Monetary policy is likely to continue to be tightened, albeit Jerome Powell seems to have taken note of President Trump's dismay at continued rate hikes and has indicated that the Fed is approaching what it feels is a neutral rate with markets pricing in 50 basis points spread over a couple of hikes in 2019. Trump has reportedly acknowledged to his new chief of staff Mick Mulvaney that he doesn't have the ability to fire Jerome Powell outright and it is unlikely that the President would be able to justify a stock market collapse or a recession as sufficient cause to fire the beleaguered Fed chair (who technically reports to Congress, not the President).

Even so, it may be that the continuous public pressure from Trump leads to a Powell resignation. That would be problematic since the entire objective of central bank independence is to avoid political interests driving monetary policy with short termism in mind and the chaos that ensues with such policy decision-making.

Political deadlock in US domestic policy with the incoming Democrat majority in the House of Representatives means that the President is likely to do what many of his predecessors did when they couldn't get things through congress and turn an even sharper eye onto foreign policy. The trouble is, US foreign policy under Trump is the kind that markets don't seem particularly fond of.

If markets don't recover quickly in 2019, look for sector rotation out of high growth tech stocks into more staple goods companies as well as money leaving equities and moving into fixed income. Particularly highly priced P/E stocks may suffer disproportionately in this case but it's important to note that there will likely still be value in equities, stock pickers will just need to be more judicious in their selections and focus on companies with solid strategies and earnings and reasonable P/E ratios.

It's also worth keeping in mind that poor stock performance alone doesn't mean the company itself is doing badly. NVIDIA has lost over 55% from its high this year and is even down 35% on its start of year stock price, the company is still making money of course but is now trading at a much more sedate 17 P/E which could look very attractive in a couple of quarters time once its excess inventory has worked its way through the system. For medium to longer term investors, the bear market looks to be a buying opportunity.

Even without a recession (which is probably due), the investing world will be highly charged and looking out for any misstep in the global system of governance which has existed for a long time. Protectionism, stepping away from the rules based international order of markets, a nasty Brexit, trade wars moving away from just tariff based issues and into broader regulatory retaliations as well as aggressive unwinding of US government bond positions will all be danger signals for traditional technology growth stocks.

Tech still has a lot to give and fintech in particular is probably still a growth area, however concerns over some startups getting into areas which they know little about, particularly given how heavily regulated the financial services industry is can be problematic. Robinhood recently found this out when it tried to launch a Checking and Savings account paying 3% interest but then discovered it wasn't insured to offer such facilities. A rebrand later and senate recommendations to the SEC and FDIC to keep an eye on fintechs have made for a steep learning curve for the company.

If the global political landscape can simmer down a bit, we may just have a positive 2019, but nerves have definitely been shaken. Much like Tesla investors will be hoping Elon Musk calms down a bit, global investors will be hoping that the various political storms which are brewing can just back off to give some calmer horizons.

As ever, I wish all of you and your friends/families a prosperous year of investing in 2019."

5:25 p.m.

The House has approved a bill to fund the Treasury Department, the IRS and other agencies for the next year as part of a Democratic strategy to reopen the government on a piecemeal basis.

The Democratic-controlled House voted 240-188 on Wednesday to approve the funding bill, which also would reopen the Federal Communications Commission, the Small Business Administration and the federal judiciary, among other agencies.

Eight Republicans joined 232 Democrats to support the bill.

House Appropriations Committee Chairwoman Nita Lowey says taxpayers rely on the IRS to assist them in filing taxes and financial planning but now ""don't have anyone they can turn to"" for answers.

The bill is unlikely to move forward in the Republican-controlled Senate, where Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has dismissed it as political theater.

Vice President Mike Pence says Democrats were ""unwilling to even negotiate"" an end to the partial government shutdown and the standoff over President Donald Trump's desire for a border barrier.

Pence spoke outside the West Wing after a contentious meeting Wednesday between Trump and congressional leaders.

Pence says, ""I think the president made his position very clear today that there will be no deal without a wall.""

Pence says Trump asked House Speaker Nancy Pelosi whether she would be willing to agree to funding for a wall or a barrier on the southern border if he re-opened the government quickly.

Pence says, ""When she said 'No,' the president said 'Goodbye.""

Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said Trump had a ""temper tantrum."" Pence says of the president, ""I don't recall him ever raising his voice.""

Top Democrats say President Donald Trump walked out of a meeting with congressional leaders as talks to end the partial government shutdown remain at an impasse.

Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said Trump asked House Speaker Nancy Pelosi at Wednesday's White House meeting whether she would agree to fund his wall.

When she said ""no,"" Schumer says, Trump got up and said, ""Then we have nothing to discuss."" Schumer says, ""And he just walked out.""

Schumer is calling Trump's actions ""really, really unfortunate.""

Trump is also weighing in on the meeting by tweet, calling it ""a total waste of time.""

He tweets that once Pelosi rejected his long-stalled border wall, he ""said bye-bye, nothing else works!""

Congressional leaders from both parties have returned to the White House for another round of negotiations with President Donald Trump on the ongoing partial government shutdown.

The two sides have made no apparent progress in the past week, with Trump sticking to his demand of $5.7 billion for a border barrier and Democrats insisting they won't give him the money.

Trump has been making a public case that there is a ""crisis"" at the southern border. And he's still threatening to declare a national emergency to circumvent Congress if he can't get the wall money from them.

He told reporters during a visit to the Capitol earlier Wednesday that he may turn to a declaration ""at some point"" if top Democrats Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi ""don't agree"" with his assessment about the problems at the border.

President Donald Trump says Republicans are ""totally unified"" in the shutdown standoff over his long-promised southern border wall, though some GOP lawmakers have been expressing concern about the 19-day partial government closure.

Trump traveled to Capitol Hill on Wednesday to meet with Senate Republicans. He says there was ""no discussion about anything other than solidarity.""

Trump has been considering a national emergency declaration to bypass Congress to build the wall. He says he ""may do that at some point"" if he can't get a deal with Democrats.

Trump also plans to meet with top congressional Democrats and Republicans at the White House on Wednesday.

President Donald Trump arrived on Capitol Hill claiming he has ""tremendous"" support as he headed into a meeting with Republican senators uneasy with the government shutdown over his border wall.

Asked how long the shutdown would last, Trump told reporters Wednesday ""whatever it takes.""

The partial shutdown is now in its 19th day, the second longest ever.

Trump and Vice President Mike Pence arrived for the private lunch meeting with the Senate GOP caucus to shore up support.

Several Republican senators have said the government should be re-opened while talks continue over border security and Trump's demand for money to build the wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.

President Donald Trump says he thinks he and the Democrats are ""getting closer"" to a deal to end the budget stalemate that has partially shut down the government despite no evidence that any progress has been made.

And he's suggesting the partial government shutdown could be ""a blessing in disguise"" because, he suggests, it could lead to a broader immigration deal.

Trump spoke Wednesday during an Oval Office bill signing on anti-human trafficking legislation. It's a day after he delivered a prime-time address trying to make the case for his long-stalled U.S.-Mexico border wall.

Trump says that he would like to see ""real immigration reform in this country because we need it."" He says, ""Everybody wants to see immigration reform,"" adding that perhaps the stalemate ""will turn out to be a blessing in disguise.""

Gone are the days when the U.S. and Mexican governments regularly exchanged statements over President Donald Trump's insistence on a border wall.

Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said Wednesday he won't be drawn into what he calls a U.S. internal dispute, an apparent reference to the 19-day-old partial U.S. government shutdown over a border barrier.

Lopez Obrador says, ""We are not going to respond to situations arising from internal affairs in the United States.""

Unlike his predecessor, the Mexican leader didn't have to respond to any specific aspersion about Mexico, because Trump didn't make any in his Tuesday night address to the American public. Relations between the two leaders have been surprisingly cordial, given their ideological differences.

Lopez Obrador said, ""Of course, there are those ... who want us to get into a confrontation. We always want a friendly relationship with the United States, a cooperative relationship.""

As a presidential candidate Trump promised Mexico would pay for a border wall, but Mexico refused.

President Donald Trump is using a bill signing focused on curbing human trafficking to push his case for a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border.

Trump says a southern border that is not secured exacerbates the incidents of human trafficking. He says, ""As long as we have a border that is not secure, we're going to suffer the consequences of that.""

Wednesday's bill signing came a day after Trump's prime-time speech designed to persuade Americans that illegal immigration and trafficking at the border are a crisis.

Democrats have called Trump's promised wall costly, ineffective and ""immoral"" and say he's ""manufacturing a crisis.""

The bill Trump signed is designed to enhance an annual State Department report that measures global efforts to eliminate human trafficking.

The White House says it's the fourth bipartisan bill the Republican president has signed in the last few weeks to prevent human trafficking.

Congressional Democrats say they'll head to the White House with the plan to reopen the government -- the same one they've been presenting. They're asking President Donald Trump to accept a bipartisan bill to fund border security without the wall.

Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Wednesday the president ""could end the Trump shutdown and re-open the government today, and he should.""

Pelosi and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer spoke at an event where they were flanked by federal workers going without pay during the shutdown, now in its 19th day.

Schumer called workers the ""collateral damage"" of Trump's ""temper tantrum."" He said the president failed to ""persuade a soul"" during his ""divisive"" prime-time address Tuesday night to the nation.

Trump meets with congressional leaders at the White House Wednesday afternoon. He rejected the Senate's bipartisan funding bill in December, sparking the shutdown.

The White House is trying to keep jittery congressional Republicans from defecting over the toll the partial government shutdown is taking in their states.

President Donald Trump and Democrats have been at an impasse over funding for his proposed border wall, which has led to a partial government shutdown, now in its 19th day.

Trump meets with Senate Republicans Wednesday on Capitol Hill just hours after he argued on national television that a border wall was needed to resolve a security and humanitarian ""crisis.""

Senators say the shutdown has led to disruptions in agricultural payments for farmers, as well as for home buyers trying to secure government-backed home loans. Lawmakers also are worried about missed paychecks for government workers Friday.

As many as half a dozen GOP senators have said the government should reopen while border security negotiations with Democrats continue.

President Donald Trump again linked illegal immigration along the southern border with drugs and violent crime as he urged Democratic lawmakers to fund his proposed border wall.

In his first national address from the Oval Office, the president gave no indication he was softening his stance that the partial government shutdown would continue without money for the wall.

Trump argued Tuesday night that the wall was needed to resolve what he called a security and humanitarian ""crisis.""

He addressed the nation as the shutdown stretched through its third week, with hundreds of thousands of federal workers going without pay and some congressional Republicans growing increasingly jittery about the impasse.

Trump plans to visit Senate Republicans at the Capitol on Wednesday before meeting with Democratic leaders at the White House."
293,star-telegram,https://www.star-telegram.com/news/nation-world/national/article223342450.html,"Excerpts from recent editorials in the United States and abroad:

The New York Times on a judge's rebuke of Michael Flynn and President Donald Trump's charitable foundation:

A bit of common sense and common decency intruded on Tuesday into the crazy world of Donald Trump.

In New York, the state attorney general announced that the president had agreed that the ""charity"" he used as a piggy bank has no reason to exist.

In Washington, a federal judge let a former top presidential aide know that you can parrot political spin or you can tell the truth, but you can't do both to someone who can send you to prison.

Michael Flynn, Mr. Trump's former national security adviser, appeared before Judge Emmet Sullivan to be sentenced to what he expected would be a term of probation, after pleading guilty to lying to federal investigators about conversations with the Russian ambassador. The office of the special counsel, Robert Mueller, had earlier filed a memo that said it would be right for Mr. Flynn to avoid prison after his extensive cooperation in the investigation of Trump ties to Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential campaign and after.

Then last week, in a memo about their client's sentencing, Mr. Flynn's lawyers implied that he had been tricked into lying and that the F.B.I. acted improperly in interviewing him -- points raised by pro-Trump commentators elaborating on the president's claims of being victimized by a witch hunt.

Judge Sullivan was having none of it.

""I cannot recall an instance of a court ever accepting a guilty plea from someone who did not maintain he was guilty,"" Judge Sullivan said, ""and I do not intend to start today.""

Chastened, Mr. Flynn told the judge that nobody tricked him, that he lied and that he knew he shouldn't have.

The judge was not upset only about Mr. Flynn's sneaky prevarication. He said he felt ""disgust"" at Mr. Flynn's offenses, that a retired three-star general would lie to the F.B.I. ""while on the physical premises of the White House,"" and, acting as an unregistered agent of a foreign country, Turkey, while he was an adviser to Mr. Trump (to which he admitted but was not charged). It was a bracing reminder of the brazenness of his misdeeds and of the standards the public should be able to expect of those who serve them.

Realizing that Judge Sullivan was considering a term of up to six months in prison, Mr. Flynn accepted his offer to delay the sentencing for 90 days until he has completed his cooperation with the special counsel.

""Good luck today in court to General Michael Flynn,"" Mr. Trump had tweeted first thing Tuesday morning.

""Thanks for nothing, Mr. President,"" Mr. Flynn might have thought as he left court.

Mr. Flynn should be grateful the judge offered him the chance to come clean. By contrast, the Donald J. Trump Foundation, a charity that provided no charity, quite properly received none from the New York attorney general's office.

Attorney General Barbara Underwood accused it of ""a shocking pattern of illegality"" that ""amounted to the Trump Foundation functioning as little more than a checkbook to serve Mr. Trump's business and political interests.""

Whatever money that remains will be disbursed under the supervision of Ms. Underwood's office and the judge overseeing the continuing lawsuit her office filed in June, seeking $2.8 million in restitution and a ban on Mr. Trump and his three oldest children serving on the boards of other nonprofit organizations.

In a series of stories exposing the foundation's true nature, The Washington Post found that its largest donation was to fix a fountain in front of the Plaza Hotel in Manhattan, which Mr. Trump owned at the time, that its funds were used to buy a portrait of Mr. Trump, and that it illegally provided political donations and paid for personal legal settlements.

All this comes just days after prosecutors announced that they believed that Mr. Trump had conspired with the owner of The National Enquirer and his fixer Michael Cohen to violate campaign finance laws by paying hush money to two women who said they had affairs with him. It's also just been reported that prosecutors are investigating spending by the Trump inaugural committee. The president still faces lawsuits on the constitutionality of his enriching himself while in office. Meanwhile, the special counsel's inquiry may be expanding rather than winding down.

It's fitting that despite all his bluster and threats, a president who's demonstrated such contempt for the rule of law is finding it so formidable.

That this goes to the essence of American governance was best summed up by Paula Duncan, the Trump enthusiast who was among the jurors who found Mr. Trump's former campaign chief Paul Manafort guilty of fraud, even though she had hoped he wouldn't be convicted.

Explaining her decision after the verdict, she told Fox News, ""No one's above the law.""

The Wall Street Journal on a judge's ruling on the Affordable Care Act's individual mandate:

No one opposes ObamaCare more than we do, and Democrats are now confirming that it was designed as a way-station to government-run health care. But a federal judge's ruling that the law is unconstitutional is likely to be overturned on appeal and may boomerang politically on Republicans.

Judge Reed O'Connor ruled for some 20 state plaintiffs that the Affordable Care Act's individual mandate is no longer legal because Republicans repealed its financial penalty as part of the 2017 tax reform. Recall that Chief Justice John Roberts joined four Justices to say ObamaCare's mandate was illegal as a command to individuals to buy insurance under the Commerce Clause. ""The Framers gave Congress the power to regulate commerce, not to compel it,"" he wrote.

Yet the Chief famously salvaged ObamaCare by unilaterally rewriting the mandate to be a ""tax"" that was within Congress's power. Never mind that Democrats had expressly said the penalty was not a tax. Majority Leader Roberts declared it to be so.

Enter Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, who argues in Texas v. U.S. that since Congress has repealed the mandate, the tax is no longer a tax, and ObamaCare is thus illegal. Judge O'Connor agreed with that logic, and he went further in ruling that since Congress said the mandate is crucial to the structure of ObamaCare, then all of ObamaCare must fall along with the mandate.

We'll admit to a certain satisfaction in seeing the Chief Justice hoist on his own logic. But his ruling in NFIB v. Sebelius was in 2012 and there is more at issue legally now than the ""tax"" issue in that opinion. One legal complication is that Congress in 2017 repealed the financial part of the individual mandate, not the structure of the mandate itself. Republicans used budget rules to pass tax reform so they couldn't repeal the mandate's express language.

The Affordable Care Act has also been up and running since 2014, which means so-called reliance interests come into play when considering a precedent. Millions of people now rely on ObamaCare's subsidies and rules, which argues against judges repealing the law by fiat.

Judge O'Connor breezes past this like a liberal Ninth Circuit appeals judge handling a Donald Trump appeal. He's right that Democrats claimed the individual mandate was essential to the Affordable Care Act. But when Congress killed the financial penalty in 2017 it left the rest of ObamaCare intact. When judging congressional intent, a judge must account for the amending Congress as well as the original Congress.

In any case, the Supreme Court's ""severability"" doctrine calls for restraint in declaring an entire law illegal merely because one part of it is. Our guess is that even the right-leaning Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals judges will overturn Judge O'Connor on this point.

As for the politics, Democrats claim to be alarmed by the ruling but the truth is they're elated. They want to use it to further pound Republicans for denying health insurance for pre-existing conditions if the law is overturned. Democrats campaigned across the country against Mr. Paxton's lawsuit to gain House and Senate seats in November, and they will now press votes in Congress so they can compound the gains in 2020.

President Trump hailed the ruling in a tweet, but he has never understood the Affordable Care Act. His Administration has done good work revising regulations to reduce health-care costs and increase access, but the risk is that the lawsuit will cause Republicans in Congress to panic politically and strike a deal with Democrats that reinforces ObamaCare. This is what happens when conservatives fall into the liberal trap of thinking they can use the courts to achieve policy goals that need to be won in Congress.

The Washington Post on withdrawing all 2,000 U.S. troops out of Syria:

PRESIDENT TRUMP'S sudden move to yank U.S. troops out of Syria undermined at a stroke several foreign policy goals he has championed. The president promised to finish the job of destroying the Islamic State, but the withdrawal will leave thousands of its fighters still in place. He vowed to roll back Iran's aggression across the Middle East, but his decision will allow its forces to entrench in the country that is the keystone of Tehran's ambitions. He promised to protect Israel, but that nation will now be left to face alone the buildup by Iran and its proxies along its northern border.

The president's top national security advisers had carefully developed and articulated a strategy of maintaining a U.S. presence in Syria until the Islamic State was beyond revival and Iran withdrew its forces -- a plan they were defending up until this week. Mr. Trump has again demonstrated, to them and to the world, that no U.S. policy or foreign commitment is immune from his whims.

Mr. Trump claimed the Islamic State had been defeated, but that is not the view of the Defense and State Departments. Thousands of jihadist fighters are still in Syria and control splotches of territory in the Euphrates Valley. A U.S. withdrawal will give the extremists an opportunity to reconstitute, as they did in Iraq following the premature U.S. withdrawal ordered by President Barack Obama.

Until Wednesday, a prime talking point of senior national security officials was that, ""if we've learned one thing over the years, (the) enduring defeat of a group like this means you can't just defeat their physical space and then leave,"" as the State Department's special envoy for the global campaign against the Islamic State, Brett McGurk, put it last week. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said it another way in September: ""Getting rid of the caliphate doesn't mean you then blindly say, 'Okay, we got rid of it,' march out, and then wonder why the caliphate comes back.""

Mr. Trump has justified some of his most controversial decisions, including his continued support for Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, as needed to contain Iran's threat to the United States and its allies. But the Syrian withdrawal hands Tehran and its ally Russia a windfall. Iran has deployed thousands of fighters and allied militiamen to Syria and aspires to create a corridor to Lebanon and the Mediterranean, as well as a new front against Israel along the Golan Heights. In reaction to that threat, Mr. Trump's national security adviser, John Bolton, announced Sept. 24 that ""We're not going to leave (Syria) as long as Iranian troops are outside Iranian borders, and that includes Iranian proxies and militias.""

U.S. ambitions in Syria have never been backed by adequate resources, and a case could be made that neither Congress nor the American public were prepared to support the mission suggested by Mr. Bolton. But Mr. Trump's decision appears to have been precipitated by the bellicose rhetoric of Turkey's Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who last week threatened -- not for the first time -- a military operation against Syrian Kurds, even though U.S. troops are positioned around them. The autocratic Turkish ruler appears to have extracted multiple favors from Mr. Trump in recent days, including the sale of U.S. Patriot missiles and a promise to reexamine the possible extradition of his rival, Fethullah Gulen, from Pennsylvania. If Mr. Trump received anything in return, he hasn't disclosed it.

The Syrian Kurdish forces, which have fought alongside the United States and played a crucial role in liberating most of eastern Syria from the jihadists, will be perhaps the foremost victims of Mr. Trump's decision. Betrayed by Washington, they will now be subject to a military offensive by Turkey. The stab in the back will send an unforgettable message to all who are asked to cooperate with the United States in the fight against terrorism: Washington is an unreliable and dangerous partner.

The Orange County (California) Register on Mick Mulvaney as Trump's choice for chief of staff:

President Trump has found a new chief of staff, albeit an interim one, in his director of the Office of Management and Budget, Mick Mulvaney.

That of chief is a terribly important post, perhaps government's most consequential aside from that of his boss. In theory, at least, the chief of staff is the gatekeeper for everything the president does, everyone he sees, everyone he talks to on the phone.

Perhaps, though few would expect this to be the case, the arbiter of every time he sends out a tweet, and of what it should say.

A Washington insider, a former congressman, Mulvaney is in many ways ideal for the job. He wants it, badly, whereas others with similarly impressive resumes touted for the job have indicated a strong desire to spend more time with their families, from Vice President Pence's staff chief Nick Ayers of Georgia to former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie.

Mulvaney shares the conservative values currently espoused by the president and was a founder of the House Freedom Caucus in 2013, the group that always taunted the Republican leadership, opposing much government funding, including debt limit increases and budget agreements made with the Democrats.

But he also, after Trump secured the Republican nomination in 2016, called the candidate ""a terrible human being"" who he only was voting for out of an even greater dislike of Hillary Clinton.

It's not as if other presidential allies of today haven't said bad things about him in the past. On the campaign trail, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz called his rival ""a narcissist at a level I don't think this country's ever seen,"" for instance.

But if you were the nation's chief executive -- or the CEO of a much smaller entity, for that matter -- could you hire as your top aide and work with a person who had once dubbed you ""terrible""?

Or does this kind of talk come with the territory in politics, where many strange bedfellows are made because of having to run in elections against once and perhaps future allies? Should Trump indeed elevate this practical choice for staff chief to permanent status immediately?

Los Angeles Times on banning bump stocks, which allow semi-automatic weapons to fire like machine guns:

The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives said Tuesday that it had finalized a rule reclassifying so-called bump stocks -- the devices that can make a semiautomatic rifle fire nearly as quickly a fully automatic weapon -- as machine guns, which makes it illegal to manufacture, sell or possess them. The agency said a year ago it had the authority to reclassify the devices, and President Trump -- in the wake of the Parkland, Fla., school shooting -- directed the ATF to speed up the process. Tuesday's announcement -- a rare bit of welcome news from the Trump administration -- makes it official; White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters that owners of the conversion devices will have until March 21 to destroy them or turn them in to the ATF.

This is a good step. Unfortunately, it's all but certain to be challenged in the courts, and it's on shaky legal ground because of the way the new rule evolved. The Obama administration determined that because bump stocks have ""no automatically functioning mechanical parts and (perform) no automated mechanical functions when installed,"" they did not fit the definition of a machine gun in federal law, which meant the ATF lacked the authority to regulate them. Tuesday's announcement, by contrast, hinges not on the technical specifications, but on the functionality. In essence, if it fires like a machine gun, it's a machine gun. Cue the lawyers.

We hope the administration prevails in whatever challenges emerge, but the sure-fire way to resolve this would be for Congress to legislate bump stocks and related gadgets out of existence. Such devices serve no function other than to evade the strict congressional limit on machine guns by, as the ATF said, harnessing ""the recoil energy of the semiautomatic firearm in a manner that allows the trigger to reset and continue firing"" without the shooter having to pull the trigger for each shot.

A mass shooter in Las Vegas used bump stocks affixed to semiautomatic rifles to fire more than 1,000 rounds in a matter of minutes from a 32nd-floor suite of the Mandalay Bay Hotel into a crowd of some 20,000 people, killing 58 concertgoers and injuring hundreds of others. It was the largest single mass shooting in the modern era, drawing attention to bump stocks and sparking outraged demands by many -- the Los Angeles Times included -- that the devices be banned.

As welcome as this new rule is, it will do little to corral our national problem with gun violence. The vast majority of gun deaths come in ones and twos, led by suicides. ...

But it is progress. And the president deserves credit for sticking with his promise to find a way to ban bump stocks. ...

China Daily says telecommunications giant Huawei is a victim of U.S. panic attacks:

This year has not been an annus mirabilis for China's Huawei Technologies Ltd, the world's largest supplier of telecommunications network equipment and second-biggest maker of smartphones.

Although it has been constantly in the news and it is said there is no such thing as bad publicity, it has been making headlines because of the spurious claims it somehow poses a threat to the West, even world peace. It has never been explained exactly how.

In fact it is not because of anything it has done, but because its success has brought it into the crosshairs of the United States' anxiety attacks against China.

Huawei is at the forefront of 5G technology. This latest generation mobile network technology promises to bring the much anticipated and heralded internet of things to life and the US is determined to be the 5G leader.

Not only because whichever country develops the technology that is adopted as standard will have a huge commercial advantage. But also because by setting the standard it will have a knowledge advantage.

As a result, first the US and then one after another its most obedient allies have blocked Huawei from entering their 5G markets on security grounds.

None of them have offered any specific justification for blocking Huawei. They just repeat their claim that the company poses a security risk. That is why objective observers have concluded that those countries are politicizing a commercial issue.

It sets a harmful precedent. What if other countries used the same excuse to block US companies (not confined to the telecom sector)? The US companies are very competitive in many fields, including those that could pose huge security risks, such as finance.

While Huawei will not go unscathed from being prevented from entering key markets, as a competitive player, it still has a vast market to access in other parts of the world. It has signed contracts to supply 5G equipment to 25 telecom carriers, and more than 10,000 5G base stations have been shipped.

In stark contrast to the US and its allies, India for instance, has invited Huawei to conduct 5G trials in the country and complimented it on the role it has played in helping to develop its telecom industry.

The efforts of the US and its allies to try to shield their companies against a Chinese competitor are politically motivated, not the result of a fact-based or transparent decision-making process. And they are counterproductive to the concerted efforts that are needed to ensure the security of 5G networks."

Trump is also canceling plans to visit his Florida resort, Mar-a-Lago, and will remain in Washington over the New Year's holiday, Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney said.

About 25 percent of the federal government has been shut down since Saturday, with roughly 800,000 workers affected, including an estimated 350,000 who are on furlough at home.

""We will be forced to close the Southern Border entirely if the Obstructionist Democrats do not give us the money to finish the Wall & also change the ridiculous immigration laws that our Country is saddled with,"" Trump said in a morning tweet.

We will be forced to close the Southern Border entirely if the Obstructionist Democrats do not give us the money to finish the Wall & also change the ridiculous immigration laws that our Country is saddled with. Hard to believe there was a Congress & President who would approve!

-- Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) December 28, 2018 In a reprise of his threat before the midterm elections to cut off aid to Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador as a caravan of migrants was making its way toward the United States, Trump said that those three countries ""are doing nothing for the United States but taking our money.""

""Word is that a new Caravan is forming in Honduras and they are doing nothing about it,"" he said, without providing further details. ""We will be cutting off all aid to these 3 countries -- taking advantage of U.S. for years!""

Despite Trump's threat, the United States this month announced a new collaboration with Mexico on a program to curb migration from Central American countries, with much of the $10.6 billion U.S. contribution to be drawn from existing aid programs.

Trump's tweets come as Congress has effectively given up on breaking the impasse over the president's demands for border-wall funding, all but ensuring that the partial government shutdown will stretch into at least the start of the new year.

[ What closes when the government shuts down ]

The House and the Senate convened for just minutes Thursday before gaveling closed until next week. During the brief session in the House, Republicans shot down a Democratic attempt to vote on legislation to reopen the government.

Trump's previous threats to build a wall and force Mexico to pay for it led to diplomatic clashes with the government of former president Enrique Peña Nieto. But new President Andrés Manuel López Obrador, a leftist, has tried to avoid such disputes.

Asked about Trump's latest tweets, López Obrador told reporters Friday: ""We have acted prudently and cautiously and we have not expressed an opinion on this theme, because this is an internal matter of the U.S. government and we prefer to abstain"" from making a statement.

He added that the Mexican government ""is seeking to always maintain a very good relationship with the government of the United States.""

As he did Thursday, Trump remained out of public view on Friday. In an appearance on Fox News , Mulvaney said that the president had ""canceled his plans for Christmas, and now he's canceled his plan for New Year's.""

""He's staying in Washington, D.C., over New Year's,"" said Mulvaney, who is set to become Trump's acting chief of staff next month.

[ Borderline: Navigating the invisible boundary and physical barriers that define the U.S.-Mexico border ]

Even though Trump will be in town and Republicans control both chambers of Congress, Mulvaney acknowledged that little progress on a deal is expected until the start of the new Congress on Jan. 3, when Democrats will retake the House.

Contending that Democrats ""have simply shut down the discussions,"" Mulvaney claimed that Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.) ""was really interested in doing a deal"" in their recent negotiations, ""but the more we're hearing this week is that it's [House Minority Leader] Nancy Pelosi who's preventing that from happening.""

""Nancy Pelosi, in fairness, does not have the votes for the speakership yet,"" Mulvaney said. ""She cannot be seen by her party as being weak on negotiating with Donald Trump. So we fully expect that until she is elected speaker and has locked that vote up, we don't expect to hear from the Democrats again.""

According to a Washington Post tally , Pelosi, who won the Democratic caucus's nomination for the speakership in late November, appears to have secured enough support to be elected speaker in January.

Throughout the negotiations, Pelosi and Schumer have presented a united front, issuing several joint statements and appearing together at an Oval Office meeting with Trump and Vice President Pence on Dec. 11.

Pelosi's spokesman, Drew Hammill, said in a statement Friday that Democrats ""are united against the President's immoral, ineffective and expensive wall -- the wall that he specifically promised that Mexico would pay for.""

Democrats will not consider any offers that have not been publicly endorsed by Trump himself, he said, adding that the last time the White House directly reached out to Pelosi was when the president called her following the Oval Office meeting.

""While we await the president's public proposal, Democrats have made it clear that, under a House Democratic majority, we will vote swiftly to reopen government on Day One,"" Hammill said.

At the heart of the stalemate is Trump's demand for $5 billion in funding for his proposed wall at the U.S.-Mexico border. Congressional Democrats have rejected that figure and in recent weeks have refused to publicly endorse a figure above $1.3 billion, which continues existing funding levels and includes money for new border fencing and levee walls, but not the concrete wall Trump once demanded before he started more recently talking about ""steel slats.""

Legislation with that level of funding, which would have kept the entire government open through Feb. 8, passed the Senate unanimously last week, but Trump subsequently rejected it.

Mulvaney said Friday that ""some folks use the term 'wall' and they mean different things.""

""Everyone agrees that what we can and should be building on that southern border is that steel barrier that the president tweeted out. That's what he wants to build. The Democrats, believe it or not, don't call that a wall,"" he said.

Nancy Pelosi is set to regain the House speakership Thursday and instantly cement her place as the most powerful woman in American politics.

It is a job she has done before, even during a Republican presidency, but Pelosi faces a novel challenge in her new role as President Trump's chief adversary -- how to balance her esteem for the office he holds against her barely veiled contempt for the man who holds it.

""I respect the office that he holds and the agencies of government that he appoints to -- I think I respect them more than he does, looking at who he has appointed to those offices,"" she told The Washington Post in an interview as she prepared to take the speaker's gavel.

Navigating that dilemma has affected the limited talks to end the partial government shutdown, now in its second week, over the president's demand for money for a U.S.-Mexico border wall, and it is certain to define Pelosi's dealings with Trump in the new era of divided government.

It is an unpredictable chapter in the historic career of the 78-year-old Pelosi, the nation's first female speaker, as she retakes the gavel after eight years.

When she entered the Oval Office on Dec. 11 for a meeting with Trump and Senate Minority Leader Charles E. Schumer (D-N.Y.), she had a phrase in mind that she planned to use in private -- ""Trump shutdown.""

House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) works on her speech in her new Capitol Hill office Wednesday, the day before she is set to retake the speaker's gavel. (Melina Mara/The Washington Post) She did not realize she would deliver that line in front of television cameras. The world watched as the president interrupted her after she uttered those words at the outset of a wild 15-minute exchange: ""Did you say 'Trump' ?""

Moments later, Pelosi urged him to kick out the media and proceed with private talks more befitting, in her view, the stakes and the setting.

""What I saw in that Oval Office circus was someone struggling really to try and respect the institution of the president while having total disdain for the man himself,"" said Jim Manley, who was a top aide to then-Senate Majority Leader Harry M. Reid (D-Nev.), who served alongside Pelosi. ""She's smart enough to know that she can't go into the gutter, but you know she's going to find ways to tweak the guy.""

The needling, aided by Schumer, paid political dividends after Trump proclaimed at the end of the meeting that he was ""proud to shut down the government for border security"" -- words that have been shown on a seemingly endless loop as the president deals with the damage.

Shortly after leaving the meeting, Pelosi told a private gathering of fellow Democrats that the wall was a ""like a manhood thing"" for Trump, a comment seemingly calibrated to unnerve the president -- and promptly and widely leaked to the media.

Trump, for his part, has needled Pelosi while expressing respect for her.

""I like her. Can you believe it? I like Nancy Pelosi. I mean, she's tough and she's smart,"" he said after the midterm elections, when Democrats recaptured the House with a 40-seat gain. Later, he offered to solicit Republican votes when she was struggling to persuade Democrats to elect her speaker.

[ 'It's like a manhood thing for him': Pelosi's power play with Trump serves as message to opponents ]

Pelosi said of Trump in the interview: ""We have to stipulate to a set of facts if we're going to ever negotiate. But he simply won't do it. What he talks about with the wall isn't true. It isn't true about terrorists coming over the wall, people with illnesses flooding the country. I mean, really?""

Beyond the factual divide, Pelosi says she sees in Trump a lack of ""shared values about our country"" and belief in governance, as well as a ""disrespect for the dignity and worth of a person.""

Yet she still speaks routinely -- if somewhat mechanically -- about her desire to work in tandem with Trump on issues of mutual interest, that she would seek to ""light the way"" and ""extend the hand of friendship.""

""We're about dignity and a tone that is respectful of the offices that we hold, and the office he holds,"" she added. ""We're not stooping to his level, no.""

Pelosi can have difficulty masking her disdain. Often that is by implication -- speaking effusively about George W. Bush's personal character or quoting from Ronald Reagan's 1989 farewell address , in which he said the nation should be ""open to anyone with the will and the heart to get here.""

Other times, she is more explicit. At one point in the interview, Pelosi picked at a political scab of Trump's, noting he was ""elected -- not by a majority of the popular vote -- but nonetheless to be president of the United States."" At another, she said her dealings with Trump have been largely respectful, ""except for saying I can't speak for myself,"" a reference to Trump bringing up in the Oval Office her difficulty corralling speaker votes. She secured the necessary votes a day later.

Pelosi denied trying to openly needle Trump by calling the wall a matter of ""manhood"" -- something she did publicly in an October appearance at Harvard University before she repeated it privately to Democrats last month.

""I don't think he has any concern about that. He likes publicity, good or bad, doesn't he?"" she said, adding, ""It's a guy thing -- maybe I should say it that way. Maybe it's a guy thing.""

Pelosi returned to the White House on Wednesday -- behind closed doors and joined by a broader cast of congressional leaders, a setting several Democratic aides cast as a White House effort to avoid a repeat of the earlier fiasco. Rather than with words, this time she made her point with her power.

She declared House Democrats would vote Thursday to reopen the government without funding the wall -- on Republican-written legislation, a move orchestrated to isolate Trump and split the GOP around him. ""We're asking the president to open up government,"" Pelosi said. ""We are giving him a Republican path to do that. Why would he not do it?""

Friends, family and foes, even those within her party who pressed for her to step aside for the next generation, praise her political skills.

""She'll cut your head off, and you won't even know you're bleeding,"" Pelosi's daughter Alexandra said Wednesday on CNN.

Pressed on the advice she's gotten on dealing with Trump, Pelosi insisted she makes her own advice -- a point she made by paraphrasing a passage from a 57-year-old papal encyclical.

""I observe, judge, act -- I learned that from the pope,"" she said. ""Observe. Judge. Act.""

[ Pelosi strikes deal with rebels, will step aside by 2022 to win speaker votes ]

Despite Pelosi's image as a liberal partisan, an image driven relentlessly by GOP campaign ads, she has a long history working productively with Republicans -- first as a junior lawmaker serving on bipartisan House Appropriations and Intelligence committees, later during her first two years as speaker, dealing with Bush.

Like Trump, Bush at the time had weak approval ratings and inspired deep enmity in the Democratic base -- to the point that some lawmakers floated impeaching him. And while Pelosi was personally against the Iraq War and campaigned against it to win the majority, she was never heard to speak askance of Bush's manhood or any other aspect of his character.

Bush signed several major laws passed by Democrats, led by Pelosi and Reid, including energy, tax and foreign-aid bills, and in the final months of his presidency, the leaders worked closely together to address an epochal financial crisis.

""President Bush was very committed to continuing what had been started [in Iraq] and to see it through, and so they clashed on that,"" said Daniel P. Meyer, who served as Bush's legislative affairs director during Pelosi's speakership. ""But it was a professional relationship. I don't think there was personal animus in any way, shape or form.""

Her initial interactions with Trump, Meyer said, portend a different relationship: ""He's not going to hold back, and that reflects his style. And she, apparently, is going to respond somewhat in kind.""

Pelosi still speaks fondly of Bush and his late father, whose photograph she keeps in her Capitol Hill office alongside those of Presidents John F. Kennedy and Barack Obama. And she rejects entirely any comparison between her dealings with Bush and with Trump.

""He was a Republican, I'm a Democrat,"" she said of Bush. ""We differed on a woman's right to choose, the war in Iraq, those kinds of things. But in our negotiations we recognized certain facts.""

Trump's allies in the White House and on Capitol Hill are fond of pointing out -- and potentially exploiting -- the difficulties Pelosi will probably have managing her caucus's aggressive left flank. Rep.-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez (D-N.Y.), for instance, tweeted criticism of Democratic leaders Monday over the makeup of a special climate-change committee and Wednesday announced she would vote against rules changes backed by Pelosi.

But Pelosi has more experience managing those dynamics than they might realize. Former congresswoman Lynn Woolsey (D-Calif.), a leader of the Democratic antiwar bloc, said Pelosi skillfully managed that aggressive faction while she was sparring with Bush over Iraq.

""Nancy did not lead it, but she never got in our way,"" she said. In one instance, Pelosi rejected the idea of Woolsey and others inviting Tom Hayden, a controversial former student radical, to Capitol Hill.

Woolsey said Pelosi was right, as Hayden's presence ""would have been the story instead of what we were really aiming to accomplish.""

Trump, Woolsey said, ""is going to know that he's up against something very real and very tough."""
296,wv metronews,http://wvmetronews.com/2019/01/14/manchin-addresses-federal-employees-in-fairmont-could-join-bi-partisan-effort-to-end-shutdown/,"FAIRMONT, W.Va. -- Sen. Joe Manchin, D-W.Va., would like to be part of the solution in ending the now weeks-long government shutdown that has kept some federal employees from work and has required others to work without pay.

Manchin spoke at a roundtable Monday morning in front of around 100 federal employees at the High Technology Foundation in Fairmont.

""You have a lot of essentials -- people that work for the prisons, people work TSA, people work air traffic controls,"" Manchin said. ""They're required to come to work, and if they don't come to work they are in jeopardy of losing their job and if they do come to work they can't get paid.""

The Washington Post reported Monday afternoon Manchin is attempting to join a bi-partisan group of U.S. senators who hope to force an end to the government shutdown, which is closing in on four full weeks.

Much of the disagreement in Washington D.C. centers on the impasse between the President and Congressional Democrats, who have yet to find a bridge to meet on border security funding.

""Just building a secured fence or wall, whatever you want to call it, is not going to fix the immigration problem,"" Manchin said. ""And not building a wall is not going to fix it. You need to have a structure, and we agree to that. But there's more to it.""

Manchin said a wall with no sightlines is a mistake, but he would support some kind of structure at the border.

""There's no disagreement on those six bills,"" Manchin said. ""The President just won't sign because he uses that as a leverage for Homeland Security. I want border security. I have voted for it and will continue to vote for it, but also you have to fix the immigration broken problem that you have.""

He likened it to a ""chicken or the egg"" debate -- unsure of which problem you solve first.

""If you're going to solve an immigration problem, that means we want to get rid of the people that came here the wrong way for the wrong reasons -- committed crimes, praying on our society and our people,"" Manchin said. ""We need to throw them out and keep them out. Well, you can't throw them out and keep them out if you don't have a secured border.""

Over the course of the round-table, Manchin fielded questions from federal prison employees from Hazelton's federal facility, IRS and FBI employees, and a number of other ""infuriated"" federal employees who said the time without pay was hardly a vacation -- whether you are working or not.

One FBI employee who is deemed non-essential asked Manchin why Congress can't ever meet their Oct. 1 deadline for passing a budget, saying no President should be permitted to hold Americans hostage.

Another employee with the IRS derided the Catch 22 nature of a shutdown -- an employee who is deemed non-essential can't always go outside of their normal realm to find other work, because they would need to make sure that work complies with human resource practices at their agency.

The problem: human resources is also deemed non-essential and will not be available to answer that question.

Manchin's message: ""Send me e-mails. Call my office. Call Sen. Capito's office. Tell us what's going on.""

President Trump has backed off his threat last week of declaring a national emergency to re-open the government, calling on Congressional Democrats to cast their votes with him.

Congressional Democrats have essentially deemed a wall a ""non-starter,"" and the two sides are around $4 billion apart in funding."
297,star-telegram,https://www.star-telegram.com/news/state/texas/article223310670.html,"Don't answer that question ""No"" without visiting the fundraiser site first.

As President Donald Trump is said to be mulling ""other options"" for funding his border wall between the U.S. and Mexico, according to the Associated Press, a dark horse arises on the internet.

A GoFundMe campaign popped up Sunday, hoping to raise funds for Trump's proposed wall between the U.S. and Mexico, which isn't news in and of itself. There are plenty of those around.

But the organizers of this campaign are so encouraged that they've raised more-than $700,000 in just three days that they've bumped their original goal of $200 million up to a cool billion.

The GoFundMe organizer is listed as triple-amputee Air Force veteran Brian Kolfage, who lost both legs and his right arm in a blast at Balad Air Force Base in Iraq in 2004, according to the Arizona Daily Star.

The contact listing for the organizer says ""The Wall Funding Team"" is located in Miramar, Fla.

""As a veteran who has given so much, 3 limbs, I feel deeply invested to this nation to ensure future generations have everything we have today,"" Kolfage wrote in the GoFundMe campaign description. ""Too many Americans have been murdered by illegal aliens and too many illegals are taking advantage of the United States taxpayers with no means of ever contributing to our society.

""I have grandparents who immigrated to America legally, they did it the correct way and it's time we uphold our laws, and get this wall BUILT! It's up to Americans to help out and pitch in to get this project rolling.""

Multiple studies and reports have shown, though, that illegal immigrants commit crime, violent or nonviolent, at lesser rates than do native-born Americans.

Kolfage's GoFundMe campaign was listed as the ""Top fundraiser"" on the front page of the crowd-sourced social fundraising website as of Wednesday afternoon, despite Kolfage's claims that the platform was trying to hide his fundraiser from potential donors.

Kolfage's Facebook page, where he posts content relevant to his conservative political beliefs, has more than 90,000 followers.

""We have contacted the Trump Administration to secure a point of contact where all funds will go upon completion,"" the campaign says. ""When get this information secured we will update. We have many very high level contacts already helping."""
298,kron4.com,https://www.kron4.com/news/national/nancy-pelosi-poised-to-be-elected-house-speaker-in-new-congress/1684845694,"A small, but vocal, faction of Democrats initially worked to derail Pelosi's bid to become the next Speaker following the 2018 midterm elections, but no challenger against her ever emerged and she ultimately succeed in winning over many of her critics.

The longtime House Democratic leader is now on the verge of winning back the position of power she previously held when she served as the first and so far only female House speaker from 2007 to 2011.

In the role of speaker, Pelosi will be one of the most visible members of the Democratic Party to regularly face off against President Donald Trump and will preside over an emboldened and energized Democratic majority that is poised to launch aggressive oversight of the President and his administration.

One of the most immediate challenges that will confront Pelosi as leader of the new House Democratic majority will be the fight over the President's long-promised border wall that triggered a standoff between congressional Democrats and the President and resulted in a partial government shutdown, which is now in its second week.

Pelosi has already outlined a plan for Democrats to pass a legislative package later in the day on Thursday to re-open shuttered parts of the government. Contrary to the President's demands for $5 billion for a border wall, however, the legislation does not provide any new wall funding, setting up an early confrontation between the new Democratic majority and the administration.

Pelosi always projected confidence that she would reclaim the Speaker's gavel, but faced criticism and pushback along the way.

At the end of November, she secured the nomination to become speaker by winning support from a majority of House Democrats -- a total of 203 votes in closed-door leadership elections. But she came up slightly short of the total 218 votes typically needed to win the speakership in the final January vote.

To become Speaker requires the support of a majority of all members of the House who are present and voting, a threshold that could be as high as 218 votes. It would be possible for Pelosi to win with fewer votes, as several previous House speakers have, if some members vote present or decline to participate.

Ahead of the final vote, Pelosi deployed her deal-making abilities to win over detractors, and by mid-December, she appeared to have secured the votes necessary to prevail after negotiating an agreement with some of the Democrats who had been lobbying to block her from the speakership. As part of the agreement, Pelosi backed a proposal to enact term limits for the party's top three leaders.

""I see myself as a bridge to the next generation of leaders, a recognition of my continuing responsibility to mentor and advance new Members into positions of power and responsibility in the House Democratic Caucus,"" Pelosi said in a statement at the time."
299,sun herald,https://www.sunherald.com/news/nation-world/article224499960.html,"Congress returns to Washington for its first full week of legislative business since control of the House reverted to Democrats, but lawmakers will be confronted with the same lingering question: When will the partial government shutdown end?

One Republican senator says he's offered President Donald Trump a possible solution, though it may just be wishful thinking.

Sen. Lindsey Graham is encouraging Trump to reopen government for several weeks to continue negotiating with Democrats over the border wall Trump wants to build on the U.S.-Mexico border. If there's no deal at the end of that time, Graham says Trump would be free to take the more dramatic step of declaring a national emergency to build it.

But the South Carolina Republican says Trump still wants a deal on funding for the wall before agreeing to reopen shuttered government departments. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat, insists Trump reopen the government first.

Their weeks-old standoff led to the partial government shutdown, now on day 24 without a clear end in sight.

""Before he pulls the plug on the legislative option, and I think we're almost there, I would urge him to open up the government for a short period of time, like three weeks, before he pulls the plug, see if we can get a deal,"" Graham said. ""If we can't at the end of three weeks, all bets are off.

""See if he can do it by himself through the emergency powers. That's my recommendation,"" added Graham, who has publicly pushed Trump to use his authority to declare a national emergency to build the wall. Such a step would allow Trump to bypass Congress and tap various pots of unspent federal money, including for military construction and disaster relief as well as from assets seized by law enforcement, to pay for the wall.

Trump has kept Washington on edge over whether he would resort to such a declaration, citing what he says is a ""crisis"" of drug smuggling and the trafficking of women and children at the border. The president initially sounded as though such a move was imminent, but then pulled back. He has said several times since he first mentioned the idea in public this month that he prefers a legislative solution.

A key question is how much more time is Trump willing to give lawmakers. Graham, who spoke with Trump by telephone on Sunday morning, said the legislative path ""is just about shut off"" and blamed intransigence by Pelosi.

The speaker's office had no immediate comment.

Democrats oppose an emergency declaration but may be powerless to block it. Some Republicans are wary, too, fearing how a future Democratic president might use that authority. Such a move, should Trump ultimately go that route, would almost certainly be challenged in the courts.

Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., called Graham's idea to reopen the government a ""great place to start.""

""I do think if we reopen the government, if the president ends this shutdown crisis, we have folks who can negotiate a responsible, modern investment in technology that will actually make us safer,"" Coons said.

Trump says technology is nice, but that the border can't be secured without a wall.

The White House has been laying the groundwork for an emergency declaration, which is feared by lawmakers in both parties.

Senate Homeland Security Committee Chairman Ron Johnson, R-Wis., said he'd ""hate to see"" a declaration issued because the wall wouldn't get built, presumably because of legal challenges. Democrats voted in the past for border security and should again, he said.

""I actually want to see this wall get built,"" Johnson said. ""I want to keep pressure on Democrats to actually come to the negotiating table in good faith and fund what they have supported in the past.""

Graham favors a declaration and said the time for talk is running out.

""It's the last option, not the first option, but we're pretty close to that being the only option,"" he said.

Graham and Coons spoke on ""Fox News Sunday"" and Johnson appeared on CNN's ""State of the Union."""

301,automotive news,https://www.autonews.com/manufacturing/year-living-badly,"Regrettable developments for Musk, Ghosn, Stronach and others

The past year had its shining moments of achievement and success. But 2018 might also have earned the label ""The Year of Living Badly.""

It was peppered with quarrels, smackdowns, mishaps, regrettable comments and all of the usual ill-advised goofs that make the auto industry the daily drama it is.

Frank Stronach built a multibillion-dollar fortune in auto parts before retiring as chairman of Magna International in 2011. But leaving his daughter, Belinda, in charge of running the family's other diverse holdings, an entertainment and horse-racing conglomerate of 253 businesses called the Stronach Group, has not suited the Magna founder. In October, Stronach, 86, filed a $397 million lawsuit in Ontario against Belinda, 52, a former Magna executive and Canadian politician, alleging mismanagement of the assets. Stronach also named two of his grandchildren as defendants. In November, Stronach's son, Andrew, 50, filed his own lawsuit against his sister with similar complaints. According to the suits, the Stronach Group has faced liquidity problems in recent years and has been the source of father-daughter management squabbles.

Tesla CEO and founder Elon Musk was stripped of his chairman role after setting Wall Street ablaze with a casual statement via Twitter that he was considering taking Tesla private for $82 billion. The stunning assertion could have had colossal impact on investors holding Tesla stock. Musk indicated that he had the ""funding secured"" to do the deal. The Securities and Exchange Commission responded by filing suit in federal court in New York accusing Musk of misleading investors with a false public statement. In September, the SEC settled with Musk, who agreed to step down as chairman and pay a $20 million fine without admitting wrongdoing.

If the SEC lawsuit wasn't enough, Musk dared to stir up more trouble for himself by appearing in a YouTube podcast interview while smoking weed. Recreational marijuana use is legal in California. But that legal point did not stop all hell from breaking loose for Tesla -- again. First, the resulting public reaction sent the company's stock price down by 6 percent. Critics also pointed out that smoking weed was a violation of Tesla's own employee conduct policy, and one ex-Tesla worker surfaced in the news complaining about the hypocrisy of her own firing by the company for medical use of cannabis.

For the past 19 years, Nissan Motor Co. has become the shadow of the man who pulled it back from ruin in 1999, Carlos Ghosn, its long-serving CEO and chairman. In November, all fuzzy affection went out the window when Ghosn's handpicked successor as CEO, Hiroto Saikawa, 65, accused Ghosn of several years of financial improprieties. Ghosn was arrested and taken to jail in Tokyo, where he was later charged. Ghosn, 64, was locked in a spartan cell with a straw mat to sleep on through the holiday season, undergoing daily police interrogations and living on a meager diet of mostly rice. Ghosn is accused of deferring about one-half of his compensation package until some unspecified time in the future, thereby keeping it out of Nissan's public disclosure documents and away from public scrutiny and possible criticism. It is not clear whether that practice, which Ghosn allegedly followed for several years, was illegal. What is clear is that Nissan is probably no longer wondering how to thank Ghosn at his retirement party for his 19 years of leadership.

The Germans were no less forgiving of one of their prominent industry leaders in 2018. Authorities took Audi CEO Rupert Stadler into custody in June, holding him personally responsible for a diesel emissions scandal and cover-up that has boiled at Volkswagen and its affiliated companies for years. Stadler, who had run the luxury automaker since 2007, was taken to the slammer over his alleged role in dieselgate, the automaker's admitted practice of relying on illegal ""defeat devices"" that allow its vehicles to improperly pass pollution emission tests. Audi also agreed to pay a fine to the German government of approximately $925 million over the scandal.

Industry executives have been biting their lip ever since President Donald Trump took office, with his tweeted vows to throw out the North American Free Trade Agreement, challenge vehicle importers and roll back the drive to higher fuel economy standards. In 2018, he lived up to his promises -- even as many around the industry trembled in anxiety. POTUS pain point No. 1 was the imposition of tariffs on imported steel and aluminum. Trump championed U.S. production, much to the delight of domestic producers, but not so much to automakers and suppliers who rely on complex supply lines of metal objects passing back and forth across American borders. Tariffs added higher costs to products ranging from raw aluminum ingots to finished production tools coming out of Ontario mom and pop shops.

POTUS pain point No. 2 came as Trump turned the whip onto China as a manufacturing base, slapping tariffs on $250 billion worth of Chinese goods, including car parts, and threatening tariffs on $267 billion more.

POTUS pain point No. 3 came in the form of public tongue lashings against automakers. After branding Germany's auto exporters as a threat to U.S. security, Trump took General Motors CEO Mary Barra to task for GM's decision to close plants in the Midwest -- tacking on the threat of a punitive action against GM. Citing the automaker's 2009 federal bailout, Trump tweeted, ""The U.S. saved General Motors, and this is the THANKS we get! We are now looking at cutting all @GM subsidies, including ... for electric cars.""

It was a fresh marketing pitch for consumers with more than a little money: Instead of buying a new vehicle and being locked into the purchase for two or three or more years, why not let buyers have a subscription? They could pay one monthly price for a vehicle that includes insurance and maintenance coverage, and they could trade the car for a different model when the mood struck. There was a certain allure to the idea, and luxury brands glommed onto it in 2018. But the high program fees -- ranging from $800 to $2,000 a month -- found fewer takers than expected. By year end, Lincoln was admitting surprise at how little interest its subscription plan was seeing, and Cadillac was reportedly on the verge of phasing it out. Volvo's Care by Volvo subscription program, which has been a relative success, triggered a rebellion in California, where dealers complained to state regulators that Volvo's program was violating its dealer franchise agreements.

One dark night in March, a 49-year-old woman in dark clothes was crossing a multilane street in Tempe, Ariz., walking her bicycle out of a cluster of roadside trees, not in a designated pedestrian crosswalk and under less than favorable street light, when one of Uber's autonomous-drive test vehicles -- rolling along below the speed limit in self-driving mode with a human driver behind the wheel -- struck and killed her. It was a tragic accident, but the news quickly became a publicity headache for an auto industry that has put all of its chips on the future of self-driving vehicles. Testing immediately halted at Uber and Toyota, and advocacy groups spent the next several months questioning the soundness of autonomous driving in general, and the degree to which it could or should be regulated. Police later claimed the Uber backup driver had been streaming a TV show on a cellphone at the time of the collision. Observers still noted the specific difficulties of the Tempe accident -- the dark night, the poor street lighting -- and reasoned that even a fully engaged human driver would have been challenged to avoid the pedestrian. But that was precisely the problem, critics responded: Autonomous technologies are supposed to deliver safety beyond human error.

Meridian Magnesium Products of America has done well in the past few years landing contracts for its magnesium dashboards -- large, lightweight cross members that help automakers trim vehicle weight. Meridian has been supplying the Ford F-150 pickup, BMW X5, Mercedes-Benz crossovers and FCA vans, among others. But on May 2, a fire at Meridian's Eaton Rapids, Mich., plant halted production. Whose fault the accident was or what started the fire at a plant with no record of previous safety violations has not been reported. Two Meridian workers were injured, and the production crash caused supply chain problems across the U.S. industry, including a halt in customer vehicle output. Chief among them was Ford, which had to mobilize logistics teams to get its all-important profit-making F-150s back into production using alternative suppliers and backup supplies out of Europe. By summer's end, Ford would blame the fire for a $600 million drag on earnings.

Bad luck seemed to stalk Faraday Future's billionaire CEO Jia Yueting all year. For the record, good luck has been in short supply for the China-based U.S. automaking startup's founder for some time, as financial problems from old ventures dog him. In 2017, Jia backed out of a plan to construct a billion-dollar plant in Las Vegas for Faraday electric vehicles, instead opting to renovate a former tire factory in Silicon Valley for the project. Faraday's cash ran out in 2018 and it laid off hundreds of its California work force of 1,000. Faraday, seen as a Chinese-backed direct competitor to luxury EV maker Tesla, attracted $2 billion in new equity from the Chinese insurance company Evergrande Health, with the first $800 million arriving in cash in early 2018. But by midyear, almost all of those funds had been spent and Jia was recently found fighting Evergrande in court over its effort to force him to step down."
302,sun herald,https://www.sunherald.com/news/nation-world/article223193915.html,"White House digs in on border wall demand, risking shutdown

WASHINGTON (AP) -- The White House on Sunday pushed the federal government closer to the brink of a partial shutdown later this week, digging in on its demand for $5 billion to build a border wall as congressional Democrats stood firm against it.

""We're going to do whatever is necessary to build the border wall to stop this ongoing crisis of illegal immigration,"" said White House senior adviser Stephen Miller.

Asked if that meant having a government shutdown, he said: ""If it comes to it, absolutely.""

Trump said last week he would be ""proud"" to have a shutdown to get Congress to approve a $5 billion down payment to fulfill his campaign promise to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. But the president doesn't have the votes from the Republican-controlled Congress to support funding for the wall at that level.

Democratic congressional leaders, Sen. Chuck Schumer and Rep. Nancy Pelosi, have proposed no more than $1.6 billion, as outlined in a bipartisan Senate bill. The money would not go for the wall but for fencing upgrades and other border security. Democrats also offered to simply keep funding at its current level, $1.3 billion.

WASHINGTON (AP) -- With a number of probes moving closer to the Oval Office, President Donald Trump and his attorney unleashed a fresh series of attacks on the investigators, questioning their integrity while categorically ruling out the possibility of a presidential interview with the special counsel.

Trump and Rudy Giuliani used Twitter and television interviews Sunday to deliver a series of broadsides against special counsel Robert Mueller and federal prosecutors in New York. Giuliani said he was ""disgusted"" by the tactics used by Mueller in his probe into Russian election interference, including in securing guilty pleas from the president's former national security adviser Michael Flynn on a charge of lying to federal investigators.

Trump, Giuliani said, would not submit to an interview by Mueller's team.

""They're a joke,"" Giuliani told ""Fox News Sunday."" ''Over my dead body, but, you know, I could be dead.""

The special counsel, who is investigating possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russia, has continued to request an interview with the president. Last month, the White House sent written answers in response to the special counsel's questions about possible collusion. The White House has resisted answering questions on possible obstruction of justice.

Child's death highlights communication barriers on border

Shortly before a 7-year-old Guatemalan girl died in U.S. custody, her father signed a form stating that his daughter was in good health. But it's unclear how much the man understood on the form, which was written in English and read to him in Spanish by Border Patrol agents.

The death of Jakelin Caal highlights the communication challenges along the U.S.-Mexico border as agents come in contact with an increasing number of migrants who speak neither English nor Spanish.

Her father's native language is the Mayan tongue known as Q'eqchi'. His second language is Spanish. It's unclear whether something was lost in translation or whether it would have made a difference in saving Jakelin after the two were detained and underwent a health screening along a remote stretch of U.S.-Mexico border. But the case raises questions about the Border Patrol's use of English-only forms.

All agents are required to speak Spanish, and they receive formal Spanish training. Reading forms in Spanish is often enough to pose basic questions. But some other Spanish-speaking migrants reported signing paperwork that they later said they did not understand.

Scores of immigrant parents who were separated from their children after crossing the border in the spring said they signed forms agreeing to be deported with the understanding that their kids would be returning with them, only to find themselves deported without them. Many had to wait months before being reunited with them in their homelands.

Talks adopt 'rulebook' to put Paris climate deal into action

KATOWICE, Poland (AP) -- Almost 200 nations, including the world's top greenhouse gas producers, China and the United States, have adopted a set of rules meant to breathe life into the 2015 Paris climate accord by setting out how countries should report their emissions and efforts to reduce them.

But negotiators delayed other key decisions until next year -- a move that frustrated environmentalists and countries that wanted more ambitious goals in light of scientists' warnings that the world must shift sharply away from fossil fuels in the coming decade.

""The majority of the rulebook for the Paris agreement has been created, which is something to be thankful for,"" said Mohamed Adow, a climate policy expert at Christian Aid. ""But the fact countries had to be dragged kicking and screaming to the finish line shows that some nations have not woken up"" to the dire consequences of global warming as outlined in a report by the U.N Panel on Climate Change, or IPCC.

Officials at the talks, which ended late Saturday in the Polish city of Katowice, agreed upon universal rules on how nations can cut emissions. Poor countries secured assurances on financial support to help them reduce emissions, adapt to changes such as rising sea levels and pay for damage that has already happened.

""Through this package, you have made a thousand little steps forward together,"" said Michal Kurtyka, a senior Polish official who led the talks.

French city honors victims of Christmas market attack

PARIS (AP) -- People filled a square in the French city of Strasbourg on Sunday to show respect and sympathy for the victims of last week's shooting attack near a famous Christmas market as the death toll rose to five.

French authorities said a Polish man died in a Strasbourg hospital Sunday, one of a dozen people wounded in last Tuesday's attack. Poland's Foreign Ministry extended condolences Sunday on Twitter to his family.

According to the newspaper DNA, more than 1,000 people attended the memorial, which ended with a minute of applause and a rendition of France's national anthem, ""La Marseillaise.""

The hour-long ceremony took place in Kleber Square, not far from where a gunman opened fire on Tuesday evening. Strasbourg Mayor Roland Ries praised the city's resilience in the face of hardship.

The ""extremely large crowd in the Christmas market"" on Saturday ""was an illustration of our commitment to these values ??on which our living together is based, which we will continue to defend against all those who want to attack it,"" Ries said.

Not into bingo, 84-year-old Texas woman gets college degree

RICHARDSON, Texas (AP) -- After raising five kids and retiring at age 77 from her secretarial job, Janet Fein couldn't be blamed for finally relaxing, but that's not her.

Fein, now 84, went to back to school and will accomplish a long-held goal this week when she graduates from the University of Texas at Dallas with a bachelor's degree.

""I didn't have anything to do in retirement and I didn't think that playing bingo was up to my speed,"" said Fein, who majored in sociology because she felt it was ""substantial.""

She said she enjoyed all the reading and writing papers. ""With each class I already knew a lot, but then I also learned a lot. And that made me happy,"" she said.

People 65 and older make up less than one percent of U.S. college students. In 2015, they accounted for about 67,000 of about 20 million college students, according to the National Center for Education Statistics.

Next-generation of GPS satellites are headed to space

DENVER (AP) -- After months of delays, the U.S. Air Force is about to launch the first of a new generation of GPS satellites, designed to be more accurate, secure and versatile.

But some of their most highly touted features will not be fully available until 2022 or later because of problems in a companion program to develop a new ground control system for the satellites, government auditors said.

The satellite is scheduled to lift off Tuesday from Cape Canaveral, Florida, aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. It's the first of 32 planned GPS III satellites that will replace older ones now in orbit. Lockheed Martin is building the new satellites outside Denver.

GPS is best-known for its widespread civilian applications, from navigation to time-stamping bank transactions. The Air Force estimates that 4 billion people worldwide use the system.

But it was developed by the U.S. military, which still designs, launches and operates the system. The Air Force controls a constellation of 31 GPS satellites from a high-security complex at Schriever Air Force Base outside Colorado Springs.

After fraud probe, new primary may replace GOP candidate

RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- Legislation quickly passed by North Carolina's lawmakers this week would prepare a path for Republicans to dump their nominee in a still-undecided U.S. House race marred with ballot fraud allegations.

""I think (legislators are) worried that Mark Harris might be damaged goods and they want to have the opportunity to have a different Republican nominee,"" said Carter Wrenn, a Republican operative and consultant to former U.S. Sen. Jesse Helms and others for more than 40 years. ""That's how I read those tea leaves.""

If the state elections board decides ballot irregularities or other problems cast the true outcome into doubt and force a redo, the legislation -- if allowed to go into law by Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper -- would require new primary elections in the 9th Congressional District race, in addition to a new general election.

That would allow Republicans another look at Mark Harris, the Republican who led Democrat Dan McCready by 905 votes in unofficial results. Harris hasn't been certified the winner, and an investigation is looking into missing absentee ballots in rural Bladen County and whether unsealed ballots illegally handled by collection teams there could have been altered.

Bladen was the only county among the eight within the 9th District where Harris won a majority of mail-in absentee ballots over McCready.

Top of mind: 'Justice' is Merriam-Webster's word of the year

NEW YORK (AP) -- Racial justice. Obstruction of justice. Social justice. The Justice Department. Merriam-Webster has chosen ""justice"" as its 2018 word of the year, driven by the churning news cycle over months and months.

The word follows ""toxic,"" picked by Oxford Dictionaries, and ""misinformation,"" plucked by Dictonary.com.

Peter Sokolowski, Merriam-Webster's editor at large, told The Associated Press ahead of Monday's announcement that ""justice"" consistently bubbled into the top 20 or 30 lookups on the company's website, spiking at times due to specific events but also skating close to the surface for much of the year.

While it's one of those common words people likely know how to spell and use correctly in a sentence, Sokolowski pointed to other reasons that drive search traffic. Among them is an attempt to focus a train of thought around a philosophical problem, or to seek aspirational motivation. Such well-known words are often among the most looked up every year, including those that are slightly abstract, including ""love,"" he said.

The designation for ""justice"" came soon after President Trump's one-time fixer, Michael Cohen, was sentenced to three years in prison for crimes that included arranging the payment of hush money to conceal his boss' alleged sexual affairs. He told a judge he agreed time and again to cover up Trump's ""dirty deeds"" out of ""blind loyalty.""

'Spider-Verse' swings to the top; 'Mortal Engines' tanks

LOS ANGELES (AP) -- ""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse"" swung to the top of the domestic box office in its first weekend in theaters, proving that there is widespread audience interest in big screen animated versions of Marvel's marquee superheroes.

The film led a host of newcomers that debuted to varying success on this pre-Christmas holiday weekend, including Clint Eastwood's drug smuggling drama ""The Mule"" and the Peter Jackson-produced epic ""Mortal Engines"" which bombed in North American theaters.

""Into the Spider-Verse"" earned an estimated $35.4 million from 3,813 theaters against a $90 million production budget according to Sony Pictures on Sunday, which is a record for animated movies in December (although the hybrid ""Alvin and the Chipmunks"" movies were higher). The film features an innovative animation style -- both CGI and hand-drawn -- and focuses on the Miles Morales character as he learns to become the famed web-slinger. It's another financial win for the studio's latest ""expanded Spider-Man universe"" strategy following ""Venom"" and ""Spider-Man: Homecoming.""

And ""Spider-Verse"" has been very well-received among critics, and audiences in exit surveys gave it a rare A+ CinemaScore -- a first for a Spider-Man film. It's also been nominated for a Golden Globe award for best animated feature and picked up a few honors from critics' groups as well, including the New York Film Critics Circle.

""We are playing to both families and fanboys. We're an all-audience film,"" said Adrian Smith, Sony's president of domestic distribution."
303,sun herald,https://www.sunherald.com/news/business/article223342450.html,"Excerpts from recent editorials in the United States and abroad:

The New York Times on a judge's rebuke of Michael Flynn and President Donald Trump's charitable foundation:

A bit of common sense and common decency intruded on Tuesday into the crazy world of Donald Trump.

In New York, the state attorney general announced that the president had agreed that the ""charity"" he used as a piggy bank has no reason to exist.

In Washington, a federal judge let a former top presidential aide know that you can parrot political spin or you can tell the truth, but you can't do both to someone who can send you to prison.

Michael Flynn, Mr. Trump's former national security adviser, appeared before Judge Emmet Sullivan to be sentenced to what he expected would be a term of probation, after pleading guilty to lying to federal investigators about conversations with the Russian ambassador. The office of the special counsel, Robert Mueller, had earlier filed a memo that said it would be right for Mr. Flynn to avoid prison after his extensive cooperation in the investigation of Trump ties to Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential campaign and after.

Then last week, in a memo about their client's sentencing, Mr. Flynn's lawyers implied that he had been tricked into lying and that the F.B.I. acted improperly in interviewing him -- points raised by pro-Trump commentators elaborating on the president's claims of being victimized by a witch hunt.

Judge Sullivan was having none of it.

""I cannot recall an instance of a court ever accepting a guilty plea from someone who did not maintain he was guilty,"" Judge Sullivan said, ""and I do not intend to start today.""

Chastened, Mr. Flynn told the judge that nobody tricked him, that he lied and that he knew he shouldn't have.

The judge was not upset only about Mr. Flynn's sneaky prevarication. He said he felt ""disgust"" at Mr. Flynn's offenses, that a retired three-star general would lie to the F.B.I. ""while on the physical premises of the White House,"" and, acting as an unregistered agent of a foreign country, Turkey, while he was an adviser to Mr. Trump (to which he admitted but was not charged). It was a bracing reminder of the brazenness of his misdeeds and of the standards the public should be able to expect of those who serve them.

Realizing that Judge Sullivan was considering a term of up to six months in prison, Mr. Flynn accepted his offer to delay the sentencing for 90 days until he has completed his cooperation with the special counsel.

""Good luck today in court to General Michael Flynn,"" Mr. Trump had tweeted first thing Tuesday morning.

""Thanks for nothing, Mr. President,"" Mr. Flynn might have thought as he left court.

Mr. Flynn should be grateful the judge offered him the chance to come clean. By contrast, the Donald J. Trump Foundation, a charity that provided no charity, quite properly received none from the New York attorney general's office.

Attorney General Barbara Underwood accused it of ""a shocking pattern of illegality"" that ""amounted to the Trump Foundation functioning as little more than a checkbook to serve Mr. Trump's business and political interests.""

Whatever money that remains will be disbursed under the supervision of Ms. Underwood's office and the judge overseeing the continuing lawsuit her office filed in June, seeking $2.8 million in restitution and a ban on Mr. Trump and his three oldest children serving on the boards of other nonprofit organizations.

In a series of stories exposing the foundation's true nature, The Washington Post found that its largest donation was to fix a fountain in front of the Plaza Hotel in Manhattan, which Mr. Trump owned at the time, that its funds were used to buy a portrait of Mr. Trump, and that it illegally provided political donations and paid for personal legal settlements.

All this comes just days after prosecutors announced that they believed that Mr. Trump had conspired with the owner of The National Enquirer and his fixer Michael Cohen to violate campaign finance laws by paying hush money to two women who said they had affairs with him. It's also just been reported that prosecutors are investigating spending by the Trump inaugural committee. The president still faces lawsuits on the constitutionality of his enriching himself while in office. Meanwhile, the special counsel's inquiry may be expanding rather than winding down.

It's fitting that despite all his bluster and threats, a president who's demonstrated such contempt for the rule of law is finding it so formidable.

That this goes to the essence of American governance was best summed up by Paula Duncan, the Trump enthusiast who was among the jurors who found Mr. Trump's former campaign chief Paul Manafort guilty of fraud, even though she had hoped he wouldn't be convicted.

Explaining her decision after the verdict, she told Fox News, ""No one's above the law.""

The Wall Street Journal on a judge's ruling on the Affordable Care Act's individual mandate:

No one opposes ObamaCare more than we do, and Democrats are now confirming that it was designed as a way-station to government-run health care. But a federal judge's ruling that the law is unconstitutional is likely to be overturned on appeal and may boomerang politically on Republicans.

Judge Reed O'Connor ruled for some 20 state plaintiffs that the Affordable Care Act's individual mandate is no longer legal because Republicans repealed its financial penalty as part of the 2017 tax reform. Recall that Chief Justice John Roberts joined four Justices to say ObamaCare's mandate was illegal as a command to individuals to buy insurance under the Commerce Clause. ""The Framers gave Congress the power to regulate commerce, not to compel it,"" he wrote.

Yet the Chief famously salvaged ObamaCare by unilaterally rewriting the mandate to be a ""tax"" that was within Congress's power. Never mind that Democrats had expressly said the penalty was not a tax. Majority Leader Roberts declared it to be so.

Enter Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, who argues in Texas v. U.S. that since Congress has repealed the mandate, the tax is no longer a tax, and ObamaCare is thus illegal. Judge O'Connor agreed with that logic, and he went further in ruling that since Congress said the mandate is crucial to the structure of ObamaCare, then all of ObamaCare must fall along with the mandate.

We'll admit to a certain satisfaction in seeing the Chief Justice hoist on his own logic. But his ruling in NFIB v. Sebelius was in 2012 and there is more at issue legally now than the ""tax"" issue in that opinion. One legal complication is that Congress in 2017 repealed the financial part of the individual mandate, not the structure of the mandate itself. Republicans used budget rules to pass tax reform so they couldn't repeal the mandate's express language.

The Affordable Care Act has also been up and running since 2014, which means so-called reliance interests come into play when considering a precedent. Millions of people now rely on ObamaCare's subsidies and rules, which argues against judges repealing the law by fiat.

Judge O'Connor breezes past this like a liberal Ninth Circuit appeals judge handling a Donald Trump appeal. He's right that Democrats claimed the individual mandate was essential to the Affordable Care Act. But when Congress killed the financial penalty in 2017 it left the rest of ObamaCare intact. When judging congressional intent, a judge must account for the amending Congress as well as the original Congress.

In any case, the Supreme Court's ""severability"" doctrine calls for restraint in declaring an entire law illegal merely because one part of it is. Our guess is that even the right-leaning Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals judges will overturn Judge O'Connor on this point.

As for the politics, Democrats claim to be alarmed by the ruling but the truth is they're elated. They want to use it to further pound Republicans for denying health insurance for pre-existing conditions if the law is overturned. Democrats campaigned across the country against Mr. Paxton's lawsuit to gain House and Senate seats in November, and they will now press votes in Congress so they can compound the gains in 2020.

President Trump hailed the ruling in a tweet, but he has never understood the Affordable Care Act. His Administration has done good work revising regulations to reduce health-care costs and increase access, but the risk is that the lawsuit will cause Republicans in Congress to panic politically and strike a deal with Democrats that reinforces ObamaCare. This is what happens when conservatives fall into the liberal trap of thinking they can use the courts to achieve policy goals that need to be won in Congress.

The Washington Post on withdrawing all 2,000 U.S. troops out of Syria:

PRESIDENT TRUMP'S sudden move to yank U.S. troops out of Syria undermined at a stroke several foreign policy goals he has championed. The president promised to finish the job of destroying the Islamic State, but the withdrawal will leave thousands of its fighters still in place. He vowed to roll back Iran's aggression across the Middle East, but his decision will allow its forces to entrench in the country that is the keystone of Tehran's ambitions. He promised to protect Israel, but that nation will now be left to face alone the buildup by Iran and its proxies along its northern border.

The president's top national security advisers had carefully developed and articulated a strategy of maintaining a U.S. presence in Syria until the Islamic State was beyond revival and Iran withdrew its forces -- a plan they were defending up until this week. Mr. Trump has again demonstrated, to them and to the world, that no U.S. policy or foreign commitment is immune from his whims.

Mr. Trump claimed the Islamic State had been defeated, but that is not the view of the Defense and State Departments. Thousands of jihadist fighters are still in Syria and control splotches of territory in the Euphrates Valley. A U.S. withdrawal will give the extremists an opportunity to reconstitute, as they did in Iraq following the premature U.S. withdrawal ordered by President Barack Obama.

Until Wednesday, a prime talking point of senior national security officials was that, ""if we've learned one thing over the years, (the) enduring defeat of a group like this means you can't just defeat their physical space and then leave,"" as the State Department's special envoy for the global campaign against the Islamic State, Brett McGurk, put it last week. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said it another way in September: ""Getting rid of the caliphate doesn't mean you then blindly say, 'Okay, we got rid of it,' march out, and then wonder why the caliphate comes back.""

Mr. Trump has justified some of his most controversial decisions, including his continued support for Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, as needed to contain Iran's threat to the United States and its allies. But the Syrian withdrawal hands Tehran and its ally Russia a windfall. Iran has deployed thousands of fighters and allied militiamen to Syria and aspires to create a corridor to Lebanon and the Mediterranean, as well as a new front against Israel along the Golan Heights. In reaction to that threat, Mr. Trump's national security adviser, John Bolton, announced Sept. 24 that ""We're not going to leave (Syria) as long as Iranian troops are outside Iranian borders, and that includes Iranian proxies and militias.""

U.S. ambitions in Syria have never been backed by adequate resources, and a case could be made that neither Congress nor the American public were prepared to support the mission suggested by Mr. Bolton. But Mr. Trump's decision appears to have been precipitated by the bellicose rhetoric of Turkey's Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who last week threatened -- not for the first time -- a military operation against Syrian Kurds, even though U.S. troops are positioned around them. The autocratic Turkish ruler appears to have extracted multiple favors from Mr. Trump in recent days, including the sale of U.S. Patriot missiles and a promise to reexamine the possible extradition of his rival, Fethullah Gulen, from Pennsylvania. If Mr. Trump received anything in return, he hasn't disclosed it.

The Syrian Kurdish forces, which have fought alongside the United States and played a crucial role in liberating most of eastern Syria from the jihadists, will be perhaps the foremost victims of Mr. Trump's decision. Betrayed by Washington, they will now be subject to a military offensive by Turkey. The stab in the back will send an unforgettable message to all who are asked to cooperate with the United States in the fight against terrorism: Washington is an unreliable and dangerous partner.

The Orange County (California) Register on Mick Mulvaney as Trump's choice for chief of staff:

President Trump has found a new chief of staff, albeit an interim one, in his director of the Office of Management and Budget, Mick Mulvaney.

That of chief is a terribly important post, perhaps government's most consequential aside from that of his boss. In theory, at least, the chief of staff is the gatekeeper for everything the president does, everyone he sees, everyone he talks to on the phone.

Perhaps, though few would expect this to be the case, the arbiter of every time he sends out a tweet, and of what it should say.

A Washington insider, a former congressman, Mulvaney is in many ways ideal for the job. He wants it, badly, whereas others with similarly impressive resumes touted for the job have indicated a strong desire to spend more time with their families, from Vice President Pence's staff chief Nick Ayers of Georgia to former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie.

Mulvaney shares the conservative values currently espoused by the president and was a founder of the House Freedom Caucus in 2013, the group that always taunted the Republican leadership, opposing much government funding, including debt limit increases and budget agreements made with the Democrats.

But he also, after Trump secured the Republican nomination in 2016, called the candidate ""a terrible human being"" who he only was voting for out of an even greater dislike of Hillary Clinton.

It's not as if other presidential allies of today haven't said bad things about him in the past. On the campaign trail, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz called his rival ""a narcissist at a level I don't think this country's ever seen,"" for instance.

But if you were the nation's chief executive -- or the CEO of a much smaller entity, for that matter -- could you hire as your top aide and work with a person who had once dubbed you ""terrible""?

Or does this kind of talk come with the territory in politics, where many strange bedfellows are made because of having to run in elections against once and perhaps future allies? Should Trump indeed elevate this practical choice for staff chief to permanent status immediately?

Los Angeles Times on banning bump stocks, which allow semi-automatic weapons to fire like machine guns:

The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives said Tuesday that it had finalized a rule reclassifying so-called bump stocks -- the devices that can make a semiautomatic rifle fire nearly as quickly a fully automatic weapon -- as machine guns, which makes it illegal to manufacture, sell or possess them. The agency said a year ago it had the authority to reclassify the devices, and President Trump -- in the wake of the Parkland, Fla., school shooting -- directed the ATF to speed up the process. Tuesday's announcement -- a rare bit of welcome news from the Trump administration -- makes it official; White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters that owners of the conversion devices will have until March 21 to destroy them or turn them in to the ATF.

This is a good step. Unfortunately, it's all but certain to be challenged in the courts, and it's on shaky legal ground because of the way the new rule evolved. The Obama administration determined that because bump stocks have ""no automatically functioning mechanical parts and (perform) no automated mechanical functions when installed,"" they did not fit the definition of a machine gun in federal law, which meant the ATF lacked the authority to regulate them. Tuesday's announcement, by contrast, hinges not on the technical specifications, but on the functionality. In essence, if it fires like a machine gun, it's a machine gun. Cue the lawyers.

We hope the administration prevails in whatever challenges emerge, but the sure-fire way to resolve this would be for Congress to legislate bump stocks and related gadgets out of existence. Such devices serve no function other than to evade the strict congressional limit on machine guns by, as the ATF said, harnessing ""the recoil energy of the semiautomatic firearm in a manner that allows the trigger to reset and continue firing"" without the shooter having to pull the trigger for each shot.

A mass shooter in Las Vegas used bump stocks affixed to semiautomatic rifles to fire more than 1,000 rounds in a matter of minutes from a 32nd-floor suite of the Mandalay Bay Hotel into a crowd of some 20,000 people, killing 58 concertgoers and injuring hundreds of others. It was the largest single mass shooting in the modern era, drawing attention to bump stocks and sparking outraged demands by many -- the Los Angeles Times included -- that the devices be banned.

As welcome as this new rule is, it will do little to corral our national problem with gun violence. The vast majority of gun deaths come in ones and twos, led by suicides. ...

But it is progress. And the president deserves credit for sticking with his promise to find a way to ban bump stocks. ...

China Daily says telecommunications giant Huawei is a victim of U.S. panic attacks:

This year has not been an annus mirabilis for China's Huawei Technologies Ltd, the world's largest supplier of telecommunications network equipment and second-biggest maker of smartphones.

Although it has been constantly in the news and it is said there is no such thing as bad publicity, it has been making headlines because of the spurious claims it somehow poses a threat to the West, even world peace. It has never been explained exactly how.

In fact it is not because of anything it has done, but because its success has brought it into the crosshairs of the United States' anxiety attacks against China.

Huawei is at the forefront of 5G technology. This latest generation mobile network technology promises to bring the much anticipated and heralded internet of things to life and the US is determined to be the 5G leader.

Not only because whichever country develops the technology that is adopted as standard will have a huge commercial advantage. But also because by setting the standard it will have a knowledge advantage.

As a result, first the US and then one after another its most obedient allies have blocked Huawei from entering their 5G markets on security grounds.

None of them have offered any specific justification for blocking Huawei. They just repeat their claim that the company poses a security risk. That is why objective observers have concluded that those countries are politicizing a commercial issue.

It sets a harmful precedent. What if other countries used the same excuse to block US companies (not confined to the telecom sector)? The US companies are very competitive in many fields, including those that could pose huge security risks, such as finance.

While Huawei will not go unscathed from being prevented from entering key markets, as a competitive player, it still has a vast market to access in other parts of the world. It has signed contracts to supply 5G equipment to 25 telecom carriers, and more than 10,000 5G base stations have been shipped.

In stark contrast to the US and its allies, India for instance, has invited Huawei to conduct 5G trials in the country and complimented it on the role it has played in helping to develop its telecom industry.

The efforts of the US and its allies to try to shield their companies against a Chinese competitor are politically motivated, not the result of a fact-based or transparent decision-making process. And they are counterproductive to the concerted efforts that are needed to ensure the security of 5G networks."
304,sun herald,https://www.sunherald.com/news/nation-world/national/article223310670.html,"Don't answer that question ""No"" without visiting the fundraiser site first.

As President Donald Trump is said to be mulling ""other options"" for funding his border wall between the U.S. and Mexico, according to the Associated Press, a dark horse arises on the internet.

A GoFundMe campaign popped up Sunday, hoping to raise funds for Trump's proposed wall between the U.S. and Mexico, which isn't news in and of itself. There are plenty of those around.

But the organizers of this campaign are so encouraged that they've raised more-than $700,000 in just three days that they've bumped their original goal of $200 million up to a cool billion.

The GoFundMe organizer is listed as triple-amputee Air Force veteran Brian Kolfage, who lost both legs and his right arm in a blast at Balad Air Force Base in Iraq in 2004, according to the Arizona Daily Star. The fundraiser is titled, ""We the people will fund the wall.""

The contact listing for the organizer says ""The Wall Funding Team"" is located in Miramar, Fla.

""As a veteran who has given so much, 3 limbs, I feel deeply invested to this nation to ensure future generations have everything we have today,"" Kolfage wrote in the GoFundMe campaign description. ""Too many Americans have been murdered by illegal aliens and too many illegals are taking advantage of the United States taxpayers with no means of ever contributing to our society.

""I have grandparents who immigrated to America legally, they did it the correct way and it's time we uphold our laws, and get this wall BUILT! It's up to Americans to help out and pitch in to get this project rolling.""

Multiple studies and reports have shown, though, that illegal immigrants commit crime, violent or nonviolent, at lesser rates than do native-born Americans.

Kolfage's GoFundMe campaign was listed as the ""Top fundraiser"" on the front page of the crowd-sourced social fundraising website as of Wednesday afternoon, despite Kolfage's claims that the platform was trying to hide his fundraiser from potential donors.

Kolfage's Facebook page, where he posts content relevant to his conservative political beliefs, has more than 90,000 followers.

""We have contacted the Trump Administration to secure a point of contact where all funds will go upon completion,"" the campaign says. ""When get this information secured we will update. We have many very high level contacts already helping."""
305,sun herald,https://www.sunherald.com/news/politics-government/national-politics/article224069750.html,"With illegal immigration at its lowest level in a decade, it's nothing short of stunning that the federal government is shut down over funding for a border wall.

Yet here we are, entering a third week of the shutdown because President Donald Trump has inexplicably chosen to dig his heels in on getting $5 billion to build a wall along stretches of the U.S. border with Mexico that do not already have such a barrier in place.

""As long as it takes,"" Trump said last week when asked how long he was willing to let the shutdown last. ""I mean, look, I'm prepared. I think the people of the country think I'm right. I think the people of this country think I'm right.""

Except, polling shows the opposite. Major polls conducted last month by Quinnipiac, Harvard, NPR and others all showed that a majority of Americans do not support the wall. And the number of wall supporters shrinks even more when asked if it is worth shutting down the government over.

The reality is that immigration from Mexico has been decreasing since 2007, and the number of unauthorized immigrants living in the U.S. is at its lowest level since 2004, according to the Pew Research Center.

Further, the majority of illegal immigration to the United States from Mexico occurs in and around heavily secured ports of entry like San Diego, El Paso and Brownsville, Texas, where 654 miles of wall, fencing and other barriers already exist. Spending billions to build a structure along vast, rural stretches of the border doesn't help with security at the sections of the border that most need help.

No one is arguing for unsecure borders. The newly installed Democratic Congress voted Thursday to approve a stopgap funding bill that would reopen the federal government and provide $1.3 billion for border security in the form of manpower and equipment but not a wall. Trump has said he won't sign it, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell refuses to let a bill come to the Senate floor that the president won't sign.

It's hard to know what the president's end game is. He couldn't get the border wall approved when Republicans controlled both the House and the Senate, so it seems odd to take this stance on the heels of a midterm election in which Democrats made their biggest gains in 40 years and took control of the House.

Trump may feel he is being true to his base of ardent supporters, among whom the border wall ranked high on their list of priorities. But his focus is sorely misplaced. Rather, his attention should be focused on the independent voters who took a chance on him in 2016 believing his style could prove effective at getting things done in Washington. Shutting down the federal government in an effort to get $5 billion for a wall that most Americans don't feel the country needs is the opposite of getting things done.

Laura Kelly is already on the case for Kansas kids with decision to name new DCF leader ' The Kansas City Star

This is why voters elected incoming Gov. Laura Kelly: Because we need to do so much better for Kansas children, because we badly need transparency in state government and because there is zero time to waste in recovering all that was lost under Governors Sam Brownback and Jeff Colyer.

So good for her for marching so briskly into 2019. On Thursday, Kelly announced that she will replace Gina Meier-Hummel as head of the state's child welfare system. The Kansas Department for Children and Families was on what seemed like permanent crisis footing long before Meier-Hummel got there in fall of 2017. But it has remained troubled under her sometimes questionable leadership, and a change was in order.

Meier-Hummel had a difficult job and did make some improvements, which began with a top-to-bottom audit.

But she talked about transparency and didn't show enough of it. She decided to hire inexperienced and unlicensed social workers to fill jobs investigating reports of abuse and neglect. And she replaced contracts for foster care, family preservation and other services with grants that got around rules on no-bid arrangements.

Kelly asked the Colyer administration that she'll soon supplant -- in 11 days, her announcement noted, and we're glad she's counting -- not to implement those grants at this point. Meier-Hummel immediately said she'd honor that request.

The governor-elect also said outright that the state's procurement process wasn't followed and that agency officials had tried to keep her from learning more about how the grantees were chosen.

We wanted Kelly to clean house and name names, for the sake of the state's struggling families, and she's already doing that.

As The Star has reported, the agency gave a major grant to a Florida nonprofit already facing heavy criticism for its foster care. An agency spokeswoman argued that they'd been hired to provide family preservation services, not foster care, but it's still the same nonprofit group.

Meier-Hummel will be succeeded on an interim basis by Laura Howard, who for now will head both the DCF and the Kansas Department for Aging and Disability Services. A former regional administrator in a federal agency overseeing substance abuse and mental health services, Howard is currently director of the Public Management Center in the School of Public Affairs and Administration at the University of Kansas.

Meier-Hummel responded to Kelly's no-nonsense announcement with a news release of her own. It listed her achievements, including starting a new Wichita abuse and neglect reporting line, ""changing key policies and procedures and implementing further mandated training"" and reducing the number of missing and runaway kids by just over a quarter. The suspended grants are in the ""absolute best interest"" of Kansas children and families, the DCF's announcement said.

That's a matter of opinion, but ours is that Kelly has done the right thing and is off to a promising start even before being sworn in as governor."

The pound has hit its highest level in seven months, which has not done many favours to the Footsie's many multinational companies.

The FTSE 100 was down 73 at 6,845 ahead of a US open that is expected to see the Dow Jones open with a 200 point fall.

""The pound has moved up to its highest level in seven weeks against the US dollar as the PM [prime minister] speaks, and is now not far from the US$1.29 handle; however, the markets remain highly sceptical as to whether May can get the required support in the Commons tomorrow evening and a heavy defeat would likely see her deal dead in the water,"" commented David Cheetham at XTB online trading.

""Recent developments have seen the consensus make a marked shift away from the probability of a no-deal but there remains a nagging doubt that this is being dismissed out of hand all too readily. If traders start to fear that it could realistically happen once more then the pound is vulnerable to a swift swoon lower,"" Cheetham opined.

For what it is worth, the bookmakers do not give prime minister Theresa May much chance of pulling a rabbit out of the hat.

On the subject of bookmakers, Paddy Power Betfair plc (LON:PPB) was the top blue-chip faller after Barclays downgraded the stock to 'equal weight' from 'overweight' and slashed its target price to 6,700p from 7,600p.

Goldman Sachs also cut its price target for Paddy Power, to 7,100p from 7,400p.

Paddy Power shares trade at 6,260p, down 270p on the day.

Sector peer GVC Holdings PLC (LON:GVC) also got the treatment from Barclays and Goldman, with the former cutting its price target for the bookmaker to 1,083p from 1,180p and the latter moving to 1,100p from 1,150p.

GVC shares were down 16p at 703.5p.

11.00am: Losses lengthen

The top-shares index's losses have lengthened as traders took a sneaky early look at how US indices are set to perform today.

Futures contracts point to the Dow Jones industrial average and the S&P 500 both kicking off about 1% lower.

On this side of the pond, the FTSE 100 was down 60 points (0.9%) at 6,858.

""US futures are lower ahead of the start of the week on Wall Street, with stocks further paring last week's gains following the post-Christmas bounce,"" said Craig Erlam at Oanda.

""We're now seeing a real test of this improved risk appetite, which has been evident over the last few weeks. US stock markets have rebounded back towards levels that were very well supported during the second half of 2018. A break of these levels in mid-December saw the sell-off pick up significant momentum, so it's natural that we're seeing some profit taking when approaching them again from below,"" he suggested.

Having held up reasonably well in early trading, sterling has started to drift lower on foreign exchange markets, which Josh Mahony at IG Group reckons is because traders are increasingly uncertain about what the future has in store for the UK economy.

""Brexit has rarely felt so up in the air, with a likely rejection of May's Brexit plan leading us into a period of great unknown. It is difficult to see how Theresa May is going to shift from adamantly stating that this is the only deal possible, to proposing a new direction within three days,"" Mahony stated.

""As a no-deal Brexit becomes less likely, the likelihood for a 'people's vote' is growing which is part of what is helping drive the bullishness seen throughout the start of 2019,"" he added.

On the corporate news front, most of the excitement is taking place among the small caps.

Verona Pharma PLC (LON:VRP) plunged 18p to 86p despite publishing what it said were encouraging top-line results from a three-day phase 2 trial evaluating of nebulized ensifentrine, a treatment for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

Results from the trial showed that ensifentrine did not improve breathing by a ""statistically significant"" amount, although it was better than a placebo.

The attempt to put a spin on the results and claim they were encouraging cut no ice with the market, which slashed the share price to 85p from 104p.

Going the other way was Pantheon Resources Plc (LON:PANR), which rose 12.2% to 26.65p on the back of the acquisition of a controlling interest in Vision Gas Limited and Vision Resources LLC.

Jay Cheatham, the chief executive officer of Pantheon, said the acquisition ""paves the way for Pantheon to assume operatorship and decision-making responsibility for our East Texas assets into the future.""

9.45am: Oils weigh on Footsie

London's leading shares remain in the doldrums, weighed down by concerns over the Chinese economy and fearful of yet another own goal on Brexit.

The FTSE 100 was down 28 at 6,890, with index heavyweights Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSB) and BP PLC (LON:BP.) - both down 1.1% - contributing to the fall on the back of a softer oil price.

On the futures market, Brent crude for March delivery has fallen below the US$60 a barrel market, down 70 cents (1.2%) at US$59.80.

""It's time for May's endgame,"" suggests Neil Wilson at markets.com.

""Sterling remains supported ahead of the key Brexit vote this week albeit within the broad range of the recent downtrend,"" Wilson noted.

A strong sterling is not necessarily good news for the Footsie as a large number of its constituents earn the bulk of their income overseas.

""The pound has found some bid with investors looking at a potential extension of Article 50. It's not so much the fact of the extension but the apparent coalescence of opinion around no-deal being a no-no. There are also reports that Jean Claude Juncker is readying a letter on backstop assurances - MPs are not content with assurances so it would make sense to discount this unless we see something truly radical,"" Wilson suggested.

There is not much new flow from FTSE 100 companies leaving the field open to the mid-caps.

JD Sports Fashion PLC (LON:JD.) extended early gains, rising 40p to 436.2p after its well-received Christmas trading update but Premier Oil PLC (LON:PMO) tumbled on market speculation that it is about to make a UK acquisition.

The company neither confirmed nor denied the speculation, saying it would ""continue to look at opportunities to acquire UK North Sea assets in line with the group's stated strategy"".

Specifically, the group said, no firm decision has been taken to bid for any of the assets currently being marketed by US major Chevron.

Were it to acquire large chunks of Chevron's assets it is possible that the company might have to go to the market to raise funds, which might explain why the shares were off 9.7% at 71.75p.

Premier's fall at least meant white-collar recruitment specialist PageGroup PLC (LON:PAGE) avoided the FTSE 250 wooden spoon.

Its shares were down 6.2% after the group reported a slowdown in the UK jobs market due to Brexit uncertainty.

READ PageGroup achieves record 2018 after strong end to the year despite Brexit uncertainty

According to Liberum Capital Markets, the fourth quarter profit of £211.1mln was 3% ahead of consensus expectations of £205.3ml.

8.35am: Weak start for Footsie

As expected, the FTSE 100 started the week in the doldrums, losing 35 points to trade at 6,883.38 in the first half hour.

Disappointing Chinese trade data pushed Asia's main markets into negative territory, which had a knock-on impact in London, which is braced for more Brexit wrangling ahead of Tuesday's crunch vote.

In the US, the government shut-down has moved into week-four with President Trump ready to declare a state of emergency.

Wall Street is also braced for earnings season, which is being viewed with trepidation given the recent and unexpected warning by Apple.

""As ever, but more so than normal, it's less about the actual earnings than the guidance and the kind of outlook the CFOs are giving on the calls,"" said Neil Wilson of Markets.com.

""In light of the Apple warning, of critical importance will be the expected impact on earnings from the trade war with China.

""That could offset any beats - three months ago the high volume of companies beating guidance wasn't enough to assuage concerns raised by the forecasts and guidance.""

In a repeat of Friday, the building stocks were well bid with Berkeley Group (LON:BKG) heading the Footsie with a 1.5% gain, followed by Taylor Wimpey (LON:TW.), which last week provided a reasonably confident assessment of prospects.

The current week sees the bulk of the quoted housebuilding sector update on trading.

Despite being one of the retail sector's festive winners, Next (LON:NXT) found itself on the 'sell' list of Credit Suisse as the London arm of the influential Swiss bank downgraded its recommendation.

JD Sports Fashion (LON:JD.) was in demand early doors after its Christmas figures more than passed muster.

The stock rose 7% early on, valuing it at £4.1bn, which puts it neck and neck with Marks & Spencer (LON:MKS).

6.30am: FTSE 100 set to drop

The FTSE 100 looks set to drop after China weighed in with worse than expected December export figures.

Clearly impacted by the trade spat with America, additional worries emanated from the fact the country also conducted less business with the rest of the world.

The major stock indices in the region were dragged lower - with the exception of Japan, which was closed for a public holiday.

In London, the index of blue-chip stocks looks likely to open 33 points lower at 6885.18, according to the spread betting firms.

More negatives than positives

Moving into the new trading week, there certainly appear to be more negatives than positives to ponder.

On this side of the Atlantic, MPs vote on Tuesday on the Brexit withdrawal bill - though this is highly unlikely to place a lid on the turmoil.

According to a tweet from president Trump, trade talks with China are ""going very well"".

Investors do not always put a lot of stock in what politicians say but markets seem to be willing to take him at his word, with the result the Footsie, after a subdued start, is now sitting on a 76 point gain at 6,887.

US indices, meanwhile, have opened more than 1% higher.

The Dow Jones industrial average was up 287 points at 23,818 and the S&P 500 was up 26 at 2,576.

In the UK, packaging companies DS Smith PLC (LON:SMDS) and Smurfit Kappa Group PLC (LON:SKG) were in the box seat, steering the Footsie higher with gains of around 6.6%.

With the market apparently in risk-on mood again, there as little enthusiasm for defensive standbys such as drugs stalwarts AstraZeneca PLC (LON:AZN) and GlaxoSmithKline PLC (LON:GSK), water company Severn Trent PLC (LON:SVT) and consumer goods leviathan Unilever plc (LON:ULVR).

The latter was down 0.9% at 4,067.5p after UBS downgraded the stock to 'neutral' from 'buy', with a target price of 4,400p.

12.30pm: Fed rate hikes thrown into doubt

The Footsie was close to its intra-day high, even though hopes of a firmer start on Wall Street were fading.

The FTSE 100 was up 60 points (0.9%) at 6,871, about six points below its high point for the day.

Across the pond, spread betting quotes suggest the S&P 500 will open around 3 points lower at 2,569, while the Dow Jones industrial average was tipped to open at around 23,716, little changed.

""Mounting expectation that the Federal Reserve may not be in a position to hike interest rates at all during 2019 owing to the deteriorating global economic outlook has lent fresh support to US index futures overnight,"" said James Hughes at Axi Trader.

""There's also optimism over progress being seen in the US-China trade talks which are ongoing in Beijing right now, with the involvement of President Xi's most senior aide helping lend a degree of support, too. That said, the US arguably remains on the back foot here with stock market volatility and domestic political issues having the potential to give China the upper hand. Any resolution would have the ability to bolster US equities, but the accompanying concessions need to be closely monitored,"" he added.

Back in Blighty, tool hire firm Ashtead Group PLC (LON:AHT) was up 3.6% at 1,817p after UBS abandoned its 'sell' recommendation and moved to a neutral stance. The Swiss bank has a price target of 1,800p, up from 1,700p previously.

Cruises operator Carnival PLC (LON:CCL) - like Ashtead, a company heavily exposed to the US dollar - was buoyed by a broker note from Shore Capital.

The broker upgraded the stock to 'buy' from 'hold'; the shares were up 98p at 4,020p.

11.30am: US stocks expected to open in the blue (or green, if you prefer)

US futures were pointing to a firm start, adding a bit of support to a UK top shares index that was starting to fade.

The FTSE 100 was up 44 at 6,855.

""The combination of healthy labour market data and doveish commentary from the Fed Chair has provided relief to stock markets that endured a rough fourth quarter, to put it mildly,"" said Craig Erlam at Oanda.

""It's too early to claim that the worst is behind us but the environment currently looks more favourable than it has for a few months. With the US and China in talks to de-escalate their trade conflict, the central bank showing a willingness to slow its tightening cycle and the economy still performing well, the markets may be looking a little more attractive,"" he added.

There was a smidgen of joy for housebuilders and estate agents in this morning's Halifax House Price Index.

House prices increased by 2.2% in December from a year earlier, recovering from a 1.2% decline in November.

The fourth quarter saw house prices up 1.3% on the corresponding period of 2017. According to the Halifax, house prices could rise anywhere between 2% and 4% this year.

""Despite December's surprise jump in the monthly pace of price rises, the annual rate of price growth was less than half what it had been a year before,"" noted Jonathan Hopper, the managing director of Garrington Property Finders.

""Some of those who had no choice but to sell in 2018 will be licking their wounds, especially in formerly overheated markets such as London and part of the South-east where average prices fell,"" he added.

Sam Mitchell, the chief executive officer of online estate agents Housesimple.com, said buyers and sellers alike are ""sitting on their hands"" and this is likely to continue during the first three months of the year until there is more clarity on the outcome of Brexit.

""The downward drag on prices caused by London and the South East is being countered by regions primarily in the North, particular Yorkshire and the North West, where property is realistically priced and transaction levels fluid.

""Many of the regions seeing growth and activity levels are also not in Brexit line of fire to the extent that London and the South East are.

""The chances of an interest rate rise in 2019, a year of such radical uncertainty due to Brexit, are slim at best,"" he opined.

Estate agent Foxtons Group PLC (LON:FOXT) was down 1.2% at 51.4p while sector peer Countrywide PLC (LON:CWD) was off 4.9%. Property listings web site operator Rightmove PLC (LON:RMV) was up 1.9%.

9.30am: Trade deal hopes buoy stocks

The prospect of a trade deal being thrashed out between the USA and China continues to sweeten sentiment in global markets.

The FTSE 100 was up 41 at 6,852, with around four out of every five Footsie constituents on the up.

""The main driver of this optimism appears to be the ongoing trade talks between the US and China in Beijing. Not that there is anything too sUBStantial to justify such positivity, but rather a lack of mood-dampening comments has green-lit an early European rebound,"" said Connor Campbell at Spreadex.

""Also potentially playing a part in the gains are reports that the UK is sidling up to the EU to try to see whether it could get an Article 50 extension. If that is the case, it suggests that a) the government remains doubtful Theresa May's agreement stands any chance of getting through parliament, and b) there really isn't any appetite for a 'no deal' exit,"" he added.

One blue-chip that was not on the rise in early deals was Wm Morrison Supermarkets PLC (LON:MRW) after its trading statement. The shares were occupying the Footsie's cellar, down 3.4%.

Richard Hunter, head of markets at interactive investor, said the update was decent enough and ""it hands the baton over to its larger rivals in good shape, although numbers from Tesco and Sainsbury are likely to eclipse this update"".

""However, pressure remains on all sides. A resurgent Tesco, the proposed ASDA/Sainsbury alliance and the continuing advance of Aldi and Lidl (the former of which just announced its best ever Christmas) all add to a challenging environment. Meanwhile, whilst improved, Morrisons still lags in comparison to its larger rivals in the increasingly important channels of online and convenience stores. In addition, the figures overall are shy both of analyst expectations as well as the same period last year.

""On the whole, however, Morrisons has a plan and is beginning to deliver it. The shares have fallen foul of the wider and weaker market environment, having dipped 14% over the last six months, although over the last year the 2.5% decline in the price compares favourably with the FTSE100, which has dropped 11.5% in the corresponding period. With the bar expected to be high in terms of forthcoming updates from the other supermarkets, the general market consensus of the shares as a hold tends to suggest that investors consider there to be better value elsewhere,"" Hunter said.

The mid-cap FTSE 250 was up 127 points (0.7%) at 18,103, helped in part by a positive response to the trading statement from pUBS and brewing giant, Greene King PLC (LON:GNK) - known in real ale circles as Greedy King.

Like-for-like sales in the last two weeks, covering Christmas and the New Year, were up 10.9% year-on-year and the achieved record Christmas day sales of £7.7mln.

Greene King shares were up 3.7%.

Also on the up was self-storage outfit Safestore Holdings PLC (LON:SAFE) on the back of its full-year trading statement.

The shares were up 3.2% after the company posted its fifth consecutive year of double-digit earnings per share and dividend growth in percentage terms.

8.40am: Footsie finds gains

The FTSE 100 nudged 30 points higher to 6,840.64, with sentiment buoyed by the prospect of a trade deal between the US and China.

The outbreak of optimism followed comments by American Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, who predicted Beijing and Washington could reach a trade deal that ""we can live with"".

Morrisons (LON:MRW), the first of the grocers to report, was off 3% in the wake of what looked to be a reasonably robust post-Christmas trading update but with cautious comment on consumer behaviour.

""Morrisons continues good progress with like for like sales growth still at a healthy clip but it's being punished for another relatively weak performance from the core retail arm, although Wholesale continues to do very well,"" said Neil Wilson, an analyst at Markets.com.

Vodafone fell 1.1% after RBC Capital downgraded stock in the telco to 'underperform' from 'outperform'.

Kingswood Holdings Limited (LON:KWG) has announced the appointment of Patrick Goulding as group finance director. The wealth management group, which trades as KW Wealth, said Goulding will lead the finance function as well as overseeing the group's operations.

APQ Global Limited (LON:APQ) said it has issued a total of 26,578 ordinary shares to employees as part of a management share-based compensation scheme, including to Bart Turtelboom, its chief executive officer, who has received 23,366 Ordinary Shares. The group added that, following this issue, Turtelboom is interested in 22,098,463 ordinary shares representing 28.27% of APQ's issued share capital.

Thor Mining PLC (LON:THR) (ASX:THR) has advised that an updated presentation for shareholders has been uploaded to the company's website.

6.45am: FTSE 100 set to push higher

The FTSE 100 index is expected to push higher on Tuesday, rallying after Monday's falls following advances overnight by US and Asian markets on continuing hopes for an end to the US/China trade war and amid dovish comments from US Federal Reserve officials.

Spread betting firm IG expects the blue-chip index to open around 15 points higher at 6,830, having shed 26.54 points on Monday.

Overnight on Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrials Average ended 98 points, or 0.4% higher at 23,531 helped by hints that the US Federal Reserve could halt its tightening in monetary policy if economic growth slows further.

Gains in battered tech stocks led the way in New York, with Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Netflix Corp. (NASDAQ:N) in the vanguard boosted by interest from the key CES technology showcase in Las Vegas even though Korean rival Samsung said weak chip demand in the fourth quarter dragged its profits below market expectations.

Meanwhile today in Asia, Japan's Nikkei 225 index added 1.4%, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng index gained a more modest 0.2% propped up by hopes the US and China may be inching towards a trade deal to end the tariff wars.

On currency markets, the pound remained cautiously higher against both the US dollar and the euro amid ongoing Brexit uncertainty, with a parliamentary vote on prime minister Teresa May's agreed deal due in a week.

Supermarkets eyed

On the corporate front, the first Christmas trading update from a listed UK supermarket group will be released on Tuesday, with Wm Morrison Supermarkets PLC (LON:MRW) set to beat bigger peers J Sainsbury plc (LON:SBRY), Tesco PLC (LON:TSCO) to the punch.

The update comes after Bradford-based Morrisons on Monday said it would cut an average of 20% from the prices of 900 products as the 'Big Four' food retailers continue the battle against German discounters Aldi and Lidl.

Aldi revealed on Monday that it made almost £1bn of sales last month, marking its best-ever performance over the all-important Christmas trading period.

In a recent sector preview, UBS said it expects Morrisons - the UK's fourth-largest grocer - to report sales growth of 0.5% in the final quarter of 2018, having chopped that back from its previous estimate of 1.8%.

It pointed out that Morrisons has the ""toughest comparatives"" of any of the 'Big Four', with the focus likely to be on the performance of its Makes It and The Best own brands.

Negative trend still an issue for SIG

On the second line, insulation specialist SIG PLC will also issue trading news on Tuesday, just six weeks after its last update and covering one of the quieter periods of the year for the FTSE 250-listed group.

In a preview, analysts at Peel Hunt said: ""The negative trend seen in the UK during H2 is unlikely to have abated although mild weather in the last few weeks may have helped slightly. French market conditions are the main concern on the Continent given the weaker economic situation.""

Significant events expected on Tuesday, January 8:

Trading updates: Wm Morrison Supermarkets PLC (LON:MRW), SIG PLC (LON:SHI), Greene King PLC (LON:GNK), Carr's Group Plc (AGM) (LON:CARR), Ferrexpo PLC (LON:FXPO), Abcam PLC (LON:ABC)

Having received a leg-up from Wall Street's strong opening, London's top shares index looks to be in the mood to mark time until the close.

The FTSE 100 was up 76 at 6,887, with the lack of willingness to kick on perhaps partly explained by US indices failing to sustain early momentum. The Dow was up 140 points (0.6%) at 23,671 and the S&P was 10 points better (0.4%) at 2,560.

Back in the UK, terrestrial broadcaster ITV plc (LON:ITV) was a ratings hit with Liberum Capital, which suggested that a five year partnership signed on Monday by STV Group PLC (LON:STV) with Sky is a pointer to a deal between the satellite TV firm and the bigger commercial broadcaster on retransmission fees.

The City broker's analysts said they believe such a deal would lead to a material - around 15% plus - uplift to ITV's consensus earnings.

Shares in ITV were up 4.9% at 132.3p.

In other broker action, Merrill Lynch and Goldman Sachs both trimmed 10p off their price targets for Melrose Industries PLC (LON:MRS) - the former to 240p and the latter to 230p - but the stock still rose 10.25p to 1276.55p today.

Low-cost airline easyJet PLC (LON:EZJ) was also in contrary mood, rising 59.5p to 1,159.5p, despite Berenberg cutting its target price to 1,110p from 1,160p and reiterating its 'sell' recommendation.

2.35pm: US indices open more than 1% higher

According to a tweet from president Trump, trade talks with China are ""going very well"".

Investors do not always put a lot of stock in what politicians say but markets seem to be willing to take him at his word, with the result the Footsie, after a subdued start, is now sitting on a 76 point gain at 6,887.

US indices, meanwhile, have opened more than 1% higher.

The Dow Jones industrial average was up 287 points at 23,818 and the S&P 500 was up 26 at 2,576.

In the UK, packaging companies DS Smith PLC (LON:SMDS) and Smurfit Kappa Group PLC (LON:SKG) were in the box seat, steering the Footsie higher with gains of around 6.6%.

With the market apparently in risk-on mood again, there as little enthusiasm for defensive standbys such as drugs stalwarts AstraZeneca PLC (LON:AZN) and GlaxoSmithKline PLC (LON:GSK), water company Severn Trent PLC (LON:SVT) and consumer goods leviathan Unilever plc (LON:ULVR).

The latter was down 0.9% at 4,067.5p after UBS downgraded the stock to 'neutral' from 'buy', with a target price of 4,400p.

12.30pm: Fed rate hikes thrown into doubt

The Footsie was close to its intra-day high, even though hopes of a firmer start on Wall Street were fading.

The FTSE 100 was up 60 points (0.9%) at 6,871, about six points below its high point for the day.

Across the pond, spread betting quotes suggest the S&P 500 will open around 3 points lower at 2,569, while the Dow Jones industrial average was tipped to open at around 23,716, little changed.

""Mounting expectation that the Federal Reserve may not be in a position to hike interest rates at all during 2019 owing to the deteriorating global economic outlook has lent fresh support to US index futures overnight,"" said James Hughes at Axi Trader.

""There's also optimism over progress being seen in the US-China trade talks which are ongoing in Beijing right now, with the involvement of President Xi's most senior aide helping lend a degree of support, too. That said, the US arguably remains on the back foot here with stock market volatility and domestic political issues having the potential to give China the upper hand. Any resolution would have the ability to bolster US equities, but the accompanying concessions need to be closely monitored,"" he added.

Back in Blighty, tool hire firm Ashtead Group PLC (LON:AHT) was up 3.6% at 1,817p after UBS abandoned its 'sell' recommendation and moved to a neutral stance. The Swiss bank has a price target of 1,800p, up from 1,700p previously.

Cruises operator Carnival PLC (LON:CCL) - like Ashtead, a company heavily exposed to the US dollar - was buoyed by a broker note from Shore Capital.

The broker upgraded the stock to 'buy' from 'hold'; the shares were up 98p at 4,020p.

11.30am: US stocks expected to open in the blue (or green, if you prefer)

US futures were pointing to a firm start, adding a bit of support to a UK top shares index that was starting to fade.

The FTSE 100 was up 44 at 6,855.

""The combination of healthy labour market data and doveish commentary from the Fed Chair has provided relief to stock markets that endured a rough fourth quarter, to put it mildly,"" said Craig Erlam at Oanda.

""It's too early to claim that the worst is behind us but the environment currently looks more favourable than it has for a few months. With the US and China in talks to de-escalate their trade conflict, the central bank showing a willingness to slow its tightening cycle and the economy still performing well, the markets may be looking a little more attractive,"" he added.

There was a smidgen of joy for housebuilders and estate agents in this morning's Halifax House Price Index.

House prices increased by 2.2% in December from a year earlier, recovering from a 1.2% decline in November.

The fourth quarter saw house prices up 1.3% on the corresponding period of 2017. According to the Halifax, house prices could rise anywhere between 2% and 4% this year.

""Despite December's surprise jump in the monthly pace of price rises, the annual rate of price growth was less than half what it had been a year before,"" noted Jonathan Hopper, the managing director of Garrington Property Finders.

""Some of those who had no choice but to sell in 2018 will be licking their wounds, especially in formerly overheated markets such as London and part of the South-east where average prices fell,"" he added.

Sam Mitchell, the chief executive officer of online estate agents Housesimple.com, said buyers and sellers alike are ""sitting on their hands"" and this is likely to continue during the first three months of the year until there is more clarity on the outcome of Brexit.

""The downward drag on prices caused by London and the South East is being countered by regions primarily in the North, particular Yorkshire and the North West, where property is realistically priced and transaction levels fluid.

""Many of the regions seeing growth and activity levels are also not in Brexit line of fire to the extent that London and the South East are.

""The chances of an interest rate rise in 2019, a year of such radical uncertainty due to Brexit, are slim at best,"" he opined.

Estate agent Foxtons Group PLC (LON:FOXT) was down 1.2% at 51.4p while sector peer Countrywide PLC (LON:CWD) was off 4.9%. Property listings web site operator Rightmove PLC (LON:RMV) was up 1.9%.

9.30am: Trade deal hopes buoy stocks

The prospect of a trade deal being thrashed out between the USA and China continues to sweeten sentiment in global markets.

The FTSE 100 was up 41 at 6,852, with around four out of every five Footsie constituents on the up.

""The main driver of this optimism appears to be the ongoing trade talks between the US and China in Beijing. Not that there is anything too sUBStantial to justify such positivity, but rather a lack of mood-dampening comments has green-lit an early European rebound,"" said Connor Campbell at Spreadex.

""Also potentially playing a part in the gains are reports that the UK is sidling up to the EU to try to see whether it could get an Article 50 extension. If that is the case, it suggests that a) the government remains doubtful Theresa May's agreement stands any chance of getting through parliament, and b) there really isn't any appetite for a 'no deal' exit,"" he added.

One blue-chip that was not on the rise in early deals was Wm Morrison Supermarkets PLC (LON:MRW) after its trading statement. The shares were occupying the Footsie's cellar, down 3.4%.

Richard Hunter, head of markets at interactive investor, said the update was decent enough and ""it hands the baton over to its larger rivals in good shape, although numbers from Tesco and Sainsbury are likely to eclipse this update"".

""However, pressure remains on all sides. A resurgent Tesco, the proposed ASDA/Sainsbury alliance and the continuing advance of Aldi and Lidl (the former of which just announced its best ever Christmas) all add to a challenging environment. Meanwhile, whilst improved, Morrisons still lags in comparison to its larger rivals in the increasingly important channels of online and convenience stores. In addition, the figures overall are shy both of analyst expectations as well as the same period last year.

""On the whole, however, Morrisons has a plan and is beginning to deliver it. The shares have fallen foul of the wider and weaker market environment, having dipped 14% over the last six months, although over the last year the 2.5% decline in the price compares favourably with the FTSE100, which has dropped 11.5% in the corresponding period. With the bar expected to be high in terms of forthcoming updates from the other supermarkets, the general market consensus of the shares as a hold tends to suggest that investors consider there to be better value elsewhere,"" Hunter said.

The mid-cap FTSE 250 was up 127 points (0.7%) at 18,103, helped in part by a positive response to the trading statement from pUBS and brewing giant, Greene King PLC (LON:GNK) - known in real ale circles as Greedy King.

Like-for-like sales in the last two weeks, covering Christmas and the New Year, were up 10.9% year-on-year and the achieved record Christmas day sales of £7.7mln.

Greene King shares were up 3.7%.

Also on the up was self-storage outfit Safestore Holdings PLC (LON:SAFE) on the back of its full-year trading statement.

The shares were up 3.2% after the company posted its fifth consecutive year of double-digit earnings per share and dividend growth in percentage terms.

8.40am: Footsie finds gains

The FTSE 100 nudged 30 points higher to 6,840.64, with sentiment buoyed by the prospect of a trade deal between the US and China.

The outbreak of optimism followed comments by American Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, who predicted Beijing and Washington could reach a trade deal that ""we can live with"".

Morrisons (LON:MRW), the first of the grocers to report, was off 3% in the wake of what looked to be a reasonably robust post-Christmas trading update but with cautious comment on consumer behaviour.

""Morrisons continues good progress with like for like sales growth still at a healthy clip but it's being punished for another relatively weak performance from the core retail arm, although Wholesale continues to do very well,"" said Neil Wilson, an analyst at Markets.com.

Vodafone fell 1.1% after RBC Capital downgraded stock in the telco to 'underperform' from 'outperform'.

Sticking with the broker changes, Electrocomponents (LON:ECM) benefited from an upgrade to 'buy' from US broker Jefferies', which pushed the stock 4% higher.

Capital & Counties (LON:CAPC) rose 2.5% after Peel Hunt moved its recommendation on the property group to 'add'.

6.45am: FTSE 100 set to push higher

The FTSE 100 index is expected to push higher on Tuesday, rallying after Monday's falls following advances overnight by US and Asian markets on continuing hopes for an end to the US/China trade war and amid dovish comments from US Federal Reserve officials.

3.25pm: The Footsie moves into consolidation mode

Having received a leg-up from Wall Street's strong opening, London's top shares index looks to be in the mood to mark time until the close.

The FTSE 100 was up 76 at 6,887, with the lack of willingness to kick on perhaps partly explained by US indices failing to sustain early momentum. The Dow was up 140 points (0.6%) at 23,671 and the S&P was 10 points better (0.4%) at 2,560.

The City broker's analysts said they believe such a deal would lead to a material - around 15% plus - uplift to ITV's consensus earnings.

Shares in ITV were up 4.9% at 132.3p.

In other broker action, Merrill Lynch and Goldman Sachs both trimmed 10p off their price targets for Melrose Industries PLC (LON:MRS) - the former to 240p and the latter to 230p - but the stock still rose 10.25p to 1276.55p today.

Low-cost airline easyJet PLC (LON:EZJ) was also in contrary mood, rising 59.5p to 1,159.5p, despite Berenberg cutting its target price to 1,110p from 1,160p and reiterating its 'sell' recommendation.

2.35pm: US indices open more than 1% higher

According to a tweet from president Trump, trade talks with China are ""going very well"".

Investors do not always put a lot of stock in what politicians say but markets seem to be willing to take him at his word, with the result the Footsie, after a subdued start, is now sitting on a 76 point gain at 6,887.

US indices, meanwhile, have opened more than 1% higher.

The Dow Jones industrial average was up 287 points at 23,818 and the S&P 500 was up 26 at 2,576.

In the UK, packaging companies DS Smith PLC (LON:SMDS) and Smurfit Kappa Group PLC (LON:SKG) were in the box seat, steering the Footsie higher with gains of around 6.6%.

With the market apparently in risk-on mood again, there as little enthusiasm for defensive standbys such as drugs stalwarts AstraZeneca PLC (LON:AZN) and GlaxoSmithKline PLC (LON:GSK), water company Severn Trent PLC (LON:SVT) and consumer goods leviathan Unilever plc (LON:ULVR).

The latter was down 0.9% at 4,067.5p after UBS downgraded the stock to 'neutral' from 'buy', with a target price of 4,400p.

12.30pm: Fed rate hikes thrown into doubt

The Footsie was close to its intra-day high, even though hopes of a firmer start on Wall Street were fading.

The FTSE 100 was up 60 points (0.9%) at 6,871, about six points below its high point for the day.

Across the pond, spread betting quotes suggest the S&P 500 will open around 3 points lower at 2,569, while the Dow Jones industrial average was tipped to open at around 23,716, little changed.

""Mounting expectation that the Federal Reserve may not be in a position to hike interest rates at all during 2019 owing to the deteriorating global economic outlook has lent fresh support to US index futures overnight,"" said James Hughes at Axi Trader.

The broker upgraded the stock to 'buy' from 'hold'; the shares were up 98p at 4,020p.

11.30am: US stocks expected to open in the blue (or green, if you prefer)

US futures were pointing to a firm start, adding a bit of support to a UK top shares index that was starting to fade.

The fourth quarter saw house prices up 1.3% on the corresponding period of 2017. According to the Halifax, house prices could rise anywhere between 2% and 4% this year.

""Despite December's surprise jump in the monthly pace of price rises, the annual rate of price growth was less than half what it had been a year before,"" noted Jonathan Hopper, the managing director of Garrington Property Finders.

""Some of those who had no choice but to sell in 2018 will be licking their wounds, especially in formerly overheated markets such as London and part of the South-east where average prices fell,"" he added.

Sam Mitchell, the chief executive officer of online estate agents Housesimple.com, said buyers and sellers alike are ""sitting on their hands"" and this is likely to continue during the first three months of the year until there is more clarity on the outcome of Brexit.

""The downward drag on prices caused by London and the South East is being countered by regions primarily in the North, particular Yorkshire and the North West, where property is realistically priced and transaction levels fluid.

""Many of the regions seeing growth and activity levels are also not in Brexit line of fire to the extent that London and the South East are.

""The chances of an interest rate rise in 2019, a year of such radical uncertainty due to Brexit, are slim at best,"" he opined.

Estate agent Foxtons Group PLC (LON:FOXT) was down 1.2% at 51.4p while sector peer Countrywide PLC (LON:CWD) was off 4.9%. Property listings web site operator Rightmove PLC (LON:RMV) was up 1.9%.

9.30am: Trade deal hopes buoy stocks

The prospect of a trade deal being thrashed out between the USA and China continues to sweeten sentiment in global markets.

The FTSE 100 was up 41 at 6,852, with around four out of every five Footsie constituents on the up.

""The main driver of this optimism appears to be the ongoing trade talks between the US and China in Beijing. Not that there is anything too sUBStantial to justify such positivity, but rather a lack of mood-dampening comments has green-lit an early European rebound,"" said Connor Campbell at Spreadex.

""Also potentially playing a part in the gains are reports that the UK is sidling up to the EU to try to see whether it could get an Article 50 extension. If that is the case, it suggests that a) the government remains doubtful Theresa May's agreement stands any chance of getting through parliament, and b) there really isn't any appetite for a 'no deal' exit,"" he added.

One blue-chip that was not on the rise in early deals was Wm Morrison Supermarkets PLC (LON:MRW) after its trading statement. The shares were occupying the Footsie's cellar, down 3.4%.

Richard Hunter, head of markets at interactive investor, said the update was decent enough and ""it hands the baton over to its larger rivals in good shape, although numbers from Tesco and Sainsbury are likely to eclipse this update"".

""However, pressure remains on all sides. A resurgent Tesco, the proposed ASDA/Sainsbury alliance and the continuing advance of Aldi and Lidl (the former of which just announced its best ever Christmas) all add to a challenging environment. Meanwhile, whilst improved, Morrisons still lags in comparison to its larger rivals in the increasingly important channels of online and convenience stores. In addition, the figures overall are shy both of analyst expectations as well as the same period last year.

""On the whole, however, Morrisons has a plan and is beginning to deliver it. The shares have fallen foul of the wider and weaker market environment, having dipped 14% over the last six months, although over the last year the 2.5% decline in the price compares favourably with the FTSE100, which has dropped 11.5% in the corresponding period. With the bar expected to be high in terms of forthcoming updates from the other supermarkets, the general market consensus of the shares as a hold tends to suggest that investors consider there to be better value elsewhere,"" Hunter said.

The mid-cap FTSE 250 was up 127 points (0.7%) at 18,103, helped in part by a positive response to the trading statement from pUBS and brewing giant, Greene King PLC (LON:GNK) - known in real ale circles as Greedy King.

Like-for-like sales in the last two weeks, covering Christmas and the New Year, were up 10.9% year-on-year and the achieved record Christmas day sales of £7.7mln.

Greene King shares were up 3.7%.

Also on the up was self-storage outfit Safestore Holdings PLC (LON:SAFE) on the back of its full-year trading statement.

The shares were up 3.2% after the company posted its fifth consecutive year of double-digit earnings per share and dividend growth in percentage terms.

8.40am: Footsie finds gains

The FTSE 100 nudged 30 points higher to 6,840.64, with sentiment buoyed by the prospect of a trade deal between the US and China.

The outbreak of optimism followed comments by American Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, who predicted Beijing and Washington could reach a trade deal that ""we can live with"".

Morrisons (LON:MRW), the first of the grocers to report, was off 3% in the wake of what looked to be a reasonably robust post-Christmas trading update but with cautious comment on consumer behaviour.

""Morrisons continues good progress with like for like sales growth still at a healthy clip but it's being punished for another relatively weak performance from the core retail arm, although Wholesale continues to do very well,"" said Neil Wilson, an analyst at Markets.com.

Vodafone fell 1.1% after RBC Capital downgraded stock in the telco to 'underperform' from 'outperform'.

Sticking with the broker changes, Electrocomponents (LON:ECM) benefited from an upgrade to 'buy' from US broker Jefferies', which pushed the stock 4% higher.

Capital & Counties (LON:CAPC) rose 2.5% after Peel Hunt moved its recommendation on the property group to 'add'.

Proactive news headlines:

Landore Resources LTD (LON:LND) has boosted the gold resource at the BAM East deposit on its Junior Lake property in Ontario by 51% to 951,000 ounces. The average grade is 1.03 grams per tonne.

StatPro Group PLC (LON:SOG) has secured a deal with a large UK investment manager to provide its Revolution Data service. The software firm said the three-year contract, carrying a minimum value of £2.35mln, will involve the investment manager using the service to manage multi-asset risk and fixed income investments.

Energy storage and clean fuel company, ITM Power PLC (LON:ITM) has significantly strengthened its capability to deliver larger industrial scale projects. In its results statement for the six months to the end of October, the company said the period was one of major transition as it continued its evolution from a research-focused company to one capable of manufacturing the equipment its expanding list of industrial partners require.

Sativa Investments PLC (LON:SATI), the NEX-based medical cannabis investor, has unveiled plans to become a first-mover seed-to-consumer business in the UK. Its blue-print will require at least £12mln of funding - which would cover the cost of a glasshouse operation in Wiltshire - and probably more if it is to fully bankroll its ambitious blueprint.

Kingswood Holdings Limited (LON:KWG) has announced the appointment of Patrick Goulding as group finance director. The wealth management group, which trades as KW Wealth, said Goulding will lead the finance function as well as overseeing the group's operations.

APQ Global Limited (LON:APQ) said it has issued a total of 26,578 ordinary shares to employees as part of a management share-based compensation scheme, including to Bart Turtelboom, its chief executive officer, who has received 23,366 Ordinary Shares. The group added that, following this issue, Turtelboom is interested in 22,098,463 ordinary shares representing 28.27% of APQ's issued share capital.

Thor Mining PLC (LON:THR) (ASX:THR) has advised that an updated presentation for shareholders has been uploaded to the company's website.

6.45am: FTSE 100 set to push higher

The FTSE 100 index is expected to push higher on Tuesday, rallying after Monday's falls following advances overnight by US and Asian markets on continuing hopes for an end to the US/China trade war and amid dovish comments from US Federal Reserve officials.

Spread betting firm IG expects the blue-chip index to open around 15 points higher at 6,830, having shed 26.54 points on Monday.

Overnight on Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrials Average ended 98 points, or 0.4% higher at 23,531 helped by hints that the US Federal Reserve could halt its tightening in monetary policy if economic growth slows further.

Gains in battered tech stocks led the way in New York, with Amazon.com Inc. (NASDAQ:AMZN) and Netflix Corp. (NASDAQ:N) in the vanguard boosted by interest from the key CES technology showcase in Las Vegas even though Korean rival Samsung said weak chip demand in the fourth quarter dragged its profits below market expectations.

Meanwhile today in Asia, Japan's Nikkei 225 index added 1.4%, while Hong Kong's Hang Seng index gained a more modest 0.2% propped up by hopes the US and China may be inching towards a trade deal to end the tariff wars.

On currency markets, the pound remained cautiously higher against both the US dollar and the euro amid ongoing Brexit uncertainty, with a parliamentary vote on prime minister Teresa May's agreed deal due in a week.

Supermarkets eyed

On the corporate front, the first Christmas trading update from a listed UK supermarket group will be released on Tuesday, with Wm Morrison Supermarkets PLC (LON:MRW) set to beat bigger peers J Sainsbury plc (LON:SBRY), Tesco PLC (LON:TSCO) to the punch.

The update comes after Bradford-based Morrisons on Monday said it would cut an average of 20% from the prices of 900 products as the 'Big Four' food retailers continue the battle against German discounters Aldi and Lidl.

Aldi revealed on Monday that it made almost £1bn of sales last month, marking its best-ever performance over the all-important Christmas trading period.

In a recent sector preview, UBS said it expects Morrisons - the UK's fourth-largest grocer - to report sales growth of 0.5% in the final quarter of 2018, having chopped that back from its previous estimate of 1.8%.

It pointed out that Morrisons has the ""toughest comparatives"" of any of the 'Big Four', with the focus likely to be on the performance of its Makes It and The Best own brands.

Negative trend still an issue for SIG

On the second line, insulation specialist SIG PLC will also issue trading news on Tuesday, just six weeks after its last update and covering one of the quieter periods of the year for the FTSE 250-listed group.

In a preview, analysts at Peel Hunt said: ""The negative trend seen in the UK during H2 is unlikely to have abated although mild weather in the last few weeks may have helped slightly. French market conditions are the main concern on the Continent given the weaker economic situation.""

Significant events expected on Tuesday, January 8:

Trading updates: Wm Morrison Supermarkets PLC (LON:MRW), SIG PLC (LON:SHI), Greene King PLC (LON:GNK), Carr's Group Plc (AGM) (LON:CARR), Ferrexpo PLC (LON:FXPO), Abcam PLC (LON:ABC)

Economics

US - Fed Chairman comments that the central bank had the ability to be patient regarding monetary policy helped the sentiment in the market yesterday with US equities closing higher for a fifth consecutive session.

Chinese Vice Premier Liu He is scheduled to visit Washington on January 30 and 31 for further trade talks, according to people familiar with the plans.

Liu is expected to meet with US Trade Representative Robert Lightizer and Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin.

Separately, Chinese Ministry of Commerce reassured the US that two nations are going to continue with trade talks as scheduled during a regular weekly briefing yesterday.

On a different note, President Trump reminded everyone that he has ""absolute right"" to declare a national emergency in order to source funding for the wall project as the impasse between the White House and congressional Democrats continued for its third week now.

One of Republican senators Lindsey Graham said that a ""congressional path"" to funding the border was now virtually closed and that Trump needs to use emergency powers to bypass the Congress.

Among those affected by the shutdown, the FBI reported that the situation affects national security as the bureau's capacity to conduct investigations and run operations are being undermined.

""The failure to fund the FBI is harmful to special agents and our operations.... This is not about politics for special agents... for special agents, financial security is national security,"" the FBI Agents Association representing around 13,000 FBI special agents told reporters.

UK - Industrial production reported the steepest annual decline since 2013 in November, echoing weakness across Europe.

GDP has also slowed during the month in November.

""Growth in the UK economy continued to slow in the three months to November 2018 after performing more strongly through the middle of the year... manufacturing saw a steep decline, with car production and the often-erratic pharmaceutical industry both performing poorly,"" ONS commented on numbers.

Auto production was particularly badly hit with output down 4.3%yoy challenged by a slowdown in China, new EU-wide emissions tests and the decline of diesel engines as well as uncertainty over future trading arrangements.

Industrial Production (%mom/yoy): -0.4/-1.5 v -0.5/-0.9 (revised from -0.6/-0.8) in October and 0.2/-0.7 forecast.

GDP (3m/3m change): 0.3 v 0.4 in October and 0.3 forecast.

Italy - Industrial production dropped 1.6%mom and 2.6%yoy in November underperforming expectations and joining a disappointing series of economic data in other parts of the Eurozone.

The annual decline marks the sharpest drop since October 2014.

It is feared the economy entered a technical recession in H2/18 as GDP contracted 0.1%qoq in Q3/18.

Spain - Industrial production surprisingly dropped in November as well

Industrial Production (%mom/yoy): -1.5/-2.6 v 1.1/0.7 (revised from 1.2/0.8) in October and 0.4/0.3 forecast.

DRC - An opposition leader Felix Tshisekedi has been announced an unexpected winner in presidential elections yesterday.

While Tshisekedi is reported to have secured 38.6% of the more than 18m votes many observers questioned results and suggested President Kabila may have struck a deal with the winner as hoeps faded for a win for ruling party candidate Emmanuel Shadary who secured 4.4m votes.

The influential Catholic Church has also doubted results saying that its findings from 40,000 election observers did not match the official count.

Three dimplomats speaking anonymously to Reuters said the church tallies had showed Mr Fayulu winning.

Martin Fayulu, another opposition candidate, who earned 6.4m votes called the result ""a coup and not the truth from the ballot"".

BlueRock Diamonds* (LON:BRD) 0.335p, Mkt Cap £1.5m - 2018 review highlights increased diamond sales

BlueRock Diamonds reports that, following sales of 1,533 carats during q4 2018 it sold a total of 5,805 carats of diamonds during FY 2018, representing a 71% increase on the 3,385 carats sold during 2017.

The result reflects production improvements in both the annual tonnage, which increased by 24% to 189,990 tonnes, and grade, which rose 34% to 3.28 carats per hundred tonnes (cpht) and surpassed the company's revised 3.0cpht guidance.

The average value of US$332 per carat during 2018 was, however, approximately 8% lower than the US$362/carat received during 2017 with an average of US$316/ct received on Q4 sales.

Commenting on the results, CEO, Adam Waugh, said that ""The results from our second kimberlite pipe, KV1, which came on stream in June last year, and from the undiluted levels of our first kimberlite pipe, KV2, have shown a marked increase in grade, which we expect to continue into 2019"".

Mr. Waugh went on to express the view that the plans to move to 365 day operations in February, in conjunction with an increasing grade profile ""makes the outlook for 2019 very encouraging"".

Conclusion: A broadly improving trend of grade during 2018, and plans to increase throughput by implementing 365 day working provide the company with encouragement of a sustainable operational improvement. We hope to see an improvement in values per carat as mining accesses the higher grades at depth in the KV2 pipe and in the KV1 kimberlite.

Georgian Mining* (LON:GEO) 6.05p, Mkt Cap £6.8m - Exploration permit

(Georgian's assets in Georgia are held in a 50:50 joint venture)

Georgian Mining reports that its pending exploration permit was considered at a meeting of the Georgian cabinet held at the end of December 2018 ahead of the recess.

Expressing satisfaction that the Georgian Government was addressing the issue, Mike Struthers, CEO explained that ""During the meeting there were minor points for clarification raised with the Mining Agency, which were satisfactorily addressed and we are now awaiting the final approval. It is our understanding that all of the Ministries have responded positively and there continues to be strong support for the application"".

Conclusion: The resolution of the delayed pending permits has evidently progressed as a result of the issue being considered at cabinet level. We await the outcome of the cabinet's deliberations.

Trans-Siberian Gold (LON:TSG) 37.5p, Mkt Cap £41.3m - Asacha expected to exceed production guidance

Trans-Siberian Gold reports that, as a result of improved grades, it expects the Asacha gold mine to ""slightly exceed the upper end of the full year total gold production guidance of 36,000 - 40,000 oz for 2018"". More detail is expected to be released later this month.

In addition, the company has disclosed that it has concluded ""a new electricity supply agreement with Kamchatskenergo which will supply power to the Asacha Gold Mine at a reduced price of RUR 4.69/kWh (US$0.07/kWh) following the implementation of incentive measures to support the development of the Far East of Russia introduced by the government"". The revised agreement will initially cover a twelve month period.

Commenting on the power supply agreement, CEO, Alexander Dorogov, said that ""Power is a significant production cost and we are pleased to have secured a substantial cost saving with the support of the regional Government of Kamchatka. We are grateful for this which affirms the Far East of Russia as an attractive place for gold mining'.""

The top-shares index's losses have lengthened as traders took a sneaky early look at how US indices are set to perform today.

Futures contracts point to the Dow Jones industrial average and the S&P 500 both kicking off about 1% lower.

On this side of the pond, the FTSE 100 was down 60 points (0.9%) at 6,858.

""US futures are lower ahead of the start of the week on Wall Street, with stocks further paring last week's gains following the post-Christmas bounce,"" said Craig Erlam at Oanda.

""We're now seeing a real test of this improved risk appetite, which has been evident over the last few weeks. US stock markets have rebounded back towards levels that were very well supported during the second half of 2018. A break of these levels in mid-December saw the sell-off pick up significant momentum, so it's natural that we're seeing some profit taking when approaching them again from below,"" he suggested.

Having held up reasonably well in early trading, sterling has started to drift lower on foreign exchange markets, which Josh Mahony at IG Group reckons is because traders are increasingly uncertain about what the future has in store for the UK economy.

""Brexit has rarely felt so up in the air, with a likely rejection of May's Brexit plan leading us into a period of great unknown. It is difficult to see how Theresa May is going to shift from adamantly stating that this is the only deal possible, to proposing a new direction within three days,"" Mahony stated.

""As a no-deal Brexit becomes less likely, the likelihood for a 'people's vote' is growing which is part of what is helping drive the bullishness seen throughout the start of 2019,"" he added.

On the corporate news front, most of the excitement is taking place among the small caps.

Verona Pharma PLC (LON:VRP) plunged 18p to 86p despite publishing what it said were encouraging top-line results from a three-day phase 2 trial evaluating of nebulized ensifentrine, a treatment for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

Results from the trial showed that ensifentrine did not improve breathing by a ""statistically significant"" amount, although it was better than a placebo.

The attempt to put a spin on the results and claim they were encouraging cut no ice with the market, which slashed the share price to 85p from 104p.

Going the other way was Pantheon Resources Plc (LON:PANR), which rose 12.2% to 26.65p on the back of the acquisition of a controlling interest in Vision Gas Limited and Vision Resources LLC.

Jay Cheatham, the chief executive officer of Pantheon, said the acquisition ""paves the way for Pantheon to assume operatorship and decision-making responsibility for our East Texas assets into the future.""

9.45am: Oils weigh on Footsie

London's leading shares remain in the doldrums, weighed down by concerns over the Chinese economy and fearful of yet another own goal on Brexit.

The FTSE 100 was down 28 at 6,890, with index heavyweights Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSB) and BP PLC (LON:BP.) - both down 1.1% - contributing to the fall on the back of a softer oil price.

On the futures market, Brent crude for March delivery has fallen below the US$60 a barrel market, down 70 cents (1.2%) at US$59.80.

""It's time for May's endgame,"" suggests Neil Wilson at markets.com.

""Sterling remains supported ahead of the key Brexit vote this week albeit within the broad range of the recent downtrend,"" Wilson noted.

A strong sterling is not necessarily good news for the Footsie as a large number of its constituents earn the bulk of their income overseas.

""The pound has found some bid with investors looking at a potential extension of Article 50. It's not so much the fact of the extension but the apparent coalescence of opinion around no-deal being a no-no. There are also reports that Jean Claude Juncker is readying a letter on backstop assurances - MPs are not content with assurances so it would make sense to discount this unless we see something truly radical,"" Wilson suggested.

There is not much new flow from FTSE 100 companies leaving the field open to the mid-caps.

JD Sports Fashion PLC (LON:JD.) extended early gains, rising 40p to 436.2p after its well-received Christmas trading update but Premier Oil PLC (LON:PMO) tumbled on market speculation that it is about to make a UK acquisition.

The company neither confirmed nor denied the speculation, saying it would ""continue to look at opportunities to acquire UK North Sea assets in line with the group's stated strategy"".

Specifically, the group said, no firm decision has been taken to bid for any of the assets currently being marketed by US major Chevron.

Were it to acquire large chunks of Chevron's assets it is possible that the company might have to go to the market to raise funds, which might explain why the shares were off 9.7% at 71.75p.

Premier's fall at least meant white-collar recruitment specialist PageGroup PLC (LON:PAGE) avoided the FTSE 250 wooden spoon.

Its shares were down 6.2% after the group reported a slowdown in the UK jobs market due to Brexit uncertainty.

READ PageGroup achieves record 2018 after strong end to the year despite Brexit uncertainty

According to Liberum Capital Markets, the fourth quarter profit of £211.1mln was 3% ahead of consensus expectations of £205.3ml.

8.35am: Weak start for Footsie

As expected, the FTSE 100 started the week in the doldrums, losing 35 points to trade at 6,883.38 in the first half hour.

Disappointing Chinese trade data pushed Asia's main markets into negative territory, which had a knock-on impact in London, which is braced for more Brexit wrangling ahead of Tuesday's crunch vote.

In the US, the government shut-down has moved into week-four with President Trump ready to declare a state of emergency.

Wall Street is also braced for earnings season, which is being viewed with trepidation given the recent and unexpected warning by Apple.

""As ever, but more so than normal, it's less about the actual earnings than the guidance and the kind of outlook the CFOs are giving on the calls,"" said Neil Wilson of Markets.com.

""In light of the Apple warning, of critical importance will be the expected impact on earnings from the trade war with China.

""That could offset any beats - three months ago the high volume of companies beating guidance wasn't enough to assuage concerns raised by the forecasts and guidance.""

6.30am: FTSE 100 set to drop

The FTSE 100 looks set to drop after China weighed in with worse than expected December export figures.

In London, the index of blue-chip stocks looks likely to open 33 points lower at 6885.18, according to the spread betting firms.

More negatives than positives

Moving into the new trading week, there certainly appear to be more negatives than positives to ponder.

On this side of the Atlantic, MPs vote on Tuesday on the Brexit withdrawal bill - though this is highly unlikely to place a lid on the turmoil.

Going by weekend speculation on the matter, political chaos could ensue if the pro-remain wing of the Tory party enacts what has been described in the Sunday press as a ""very British coup"".

312,shropshire star,https://www.shropshirestar.com/news/world-news/2019/01/13/trump-ally-urges-president-to-reopen-us-government/,"Senator Lindsey Graham is urging Donald Trump to end the government shutdown for several weeks.

A Republican senator advising Donald Trump has said he is encouraging the president to reopen the government for several weeks to continue negotiating with Democrats over funding for a US-Mexico border wall.

But Lindsey Graham admitted Mr Trump still wants to reach a deal for the wall before agreeing to reopen closed government departments.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a leading Democratic negotiator, insists that Mr Trump reopen the government first.

The weeks-old stand-off over funding led to the partial government shutdown that hit day 23 on Sunday without an end in sight.

""Before he pulls the plug on the legislative option, and I think we're almost there, I would urge him to open up the government for a short period of time, like three weeks, before he pulls the plug, see if we can get a deal,"" said Mr Graham, a South Carolina Republican. ""If we can't at the end of three weeks, all bets are off.""

Mr Graham, who has publicly pushed Mr Trump to use his authority to declare a national emergency to build the wall, continued: ""See if he can do it by himself through the emergency powers. That's my recommendation.""

Such a step would allow Mr Trump to bypass Congress and tap various pots of unspent federal money, including for military construction and disaster relief and from assets seized by law enforcement, to pay for the wall.

Mr Trump has kept Washington on edge over whether he would resort to such a declaration, citing what he says is a ""crisis"" of drug smuggling and the trafficking of women and children at the border.

The president initially sounded as though such a move was imminent, but then pulled back. He has said several times since he first mentioned the idea in public earlier this month that he prefers to try to reach a deal with Congress.

A key question is how much more time is Mr Trump willing to give Congress. Mr Graham, who said he and Mr Trump talked by telephone on Sunday morning, said the legislative path ""is just about shut off"" and blamed Ms Pelosi.

Democrats oppose an emergency declaration but may be powerless to block it. Some Republicans are wary, too, fearing how a future Democratic president might use that authority. Such a move, should Mr Trump ultimately go down that route, would almost certainly be challenged in the courts.

Senator Chris Coons, called Mr Graham's idea to reopen the government a ""great place to start"".

""I do think if we reopen the government, if the president ends this shutdown crisis, we have folks who can negotiate a responsible, modern investment in technology that will actually make us safer,"" Mr Coons said.

Mr Trump has maintained that the border cannot be secured without a wall."
313,west hawaii today,http://www.westhawaiitoday.com/2019/01/14/nation-world-news/graham-urging-trump-to-reopen-government-for-a-few-weeks/,"WASHINGTON -- A Republican lawmaker advising President Donald Trump said he is encouraging the president to reopen the government for several weeks to continue negotiating with Democrats over funding for a U.S.-Mexico border wall before the president takes the more drastic step of declaring a national emergency.

But that may be wishful thinking, given that Sen. Lindsey Graham also says Trump still wants to reach a deal for the wall before agreeing to reopen shuttered government departments. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a leading Democratic negotiator, insists that Trump reopen the government first.

The weeks-old standoff over funding led to the partial government shutdown that hit day 23 on Sunday without an end in sight.

""Before he pulls the plug on the legislative option, and I think we're almost there, I would urge him to open up the government for a short period of time, like three weeks, before he pulls the plug, see if we can get a deal,"" said Graham, a South Carolina Republican. ""If we can't at the end of three weeks, all bets are off.""

""See if he can do it by himself through the emergency powers. That's my recommendation,"" added Graham, who has publicly pushed Trump to use his authority to declare a national emergency to build the wall. Such a step would allow Trump to bypass Congress and tap various pots of unspent federal money, including for military construction and disaster relief and from asset seized by law enforcement, to pay for the wall.

Trump has kept Washington on edge over whether he would resort to such a declaration, citing what he says is a ""crisis"" of drug smuggling and the trafficking of women and children at the border. The president initially sounded as though such a move was imminent, but then pulled back. He has said several times since he first mentioned the idea in public earlier this month that he prefers to try to reach a deal with Congress.

A key question is how much more time is Trump willing to give lawmakers. Graham, who said he and Trump talked by telephone on Sunday morning, said the legislative path ""is just about shut off"" and blamed Pelosi.

The speaker's office had no immediate comment.

Democrats oppose an emergency declaration but may be powerless to block it. Some Republicans are wary, too, fearing how a future Democratic president might use that authority. Such a move, should Trump ultimately go that route, would almost certainly be challenged in the courts.

Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., called Graham's idea to reopen the government a ""great place to start.""

""I do think if we reopen the government, if the president ends this shutdown crisis, we have folks who can negotiate a responsible, modern investment in technology that will actually make us safer,"" Coons said.

Trump has maintained that the border cannot be secured without a wall.

Graham said he thinks Trump is willing to accept the $5.7 billion he has insisted on for the wall, along with some immigration measures Democrats might find acceptable, such as helping immigrants who were illegally brought to the U.S. as children.

Trump has expressed interest in a broader immigration overhaul, but says he first wants the Supreme Court to address the class of immigrants known as ""Dreamers."" Pelosi also has shown no interest in accepting a wall -- she has called it an ""immorality"" -- in exchange for immigration fixes.

And, Trump, who was holed up in the White House as snow blanketed Washington on Sunday, appeared to shoot down Graham's suggestion of a ""wall plus"" deal, saying on Twitter that even Democrats don't want to make ""Dreamers"" part of the negotiations.

""The damage done to our Country from a badly broken Border - Drugs, Crime and so much that is bad - is far greater than a Shutdown, which the Dems can easily fix as soon as they come back to Washington!"" Trump said in a separate tweet.

The White House has been laying the groundwork for an emergency declaration, feared by members of both parties.

Senate Homeland Security Committee Chairman Ron Johnson, R-Wis., said he would ""hate to see"" a declaration because then the wall wouldn't get built, presumably because of legal challenges. Democrats voted in the past for border security and should again, he said.

""I actually want to see this wall get built,"" Johnson said. ""I want to keep pressure on Democrats to actually come to the negotiating table in good faith and fund what they have supported in the past.""

But Graham, who favors a presidential declaration, said the time for talk is running out.

""It's the last option, not the first option, but we're pretty close to that being the only option,"" he said.

Graham and Coons spoke on ""Fox News Sunday."" Johnson appeared on CNN's ""State of the Union.""

London's leading shares remain in the doldrums, weighed down by concerns over the Chinese economy and fearful of yet another own goal on Brexit.

The FTSE 100 was down 28 at 6,890, with index heavyweights Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSB) and BP PLC (LON:BP.) - both down 1.1% - contributing to the fall on the back of a softer oil price.

On the futures market, Brent crude for March delivery has fallen below the US$60 a barrel market, down 70 cents (1.2%) at US$59.80.

""It's time for May's endgame,"" suggests Neil Wilson at markets.com.

""Sterling remains supported ahead of the key Brexit vote this week albeit within the broad range of the recent downtrend,"" Wilson noted.

A strong sterling is not necessarily good news for the Footsie as a large number of its constituents earn the bulk of their income overseas.

""The pound has found some bid with investors looking at a potential extension of Article 50. It's not so much the fact of the extension but the apparent coalescence of opinion around no-deal being a no-no. There are also reports that Jean Claude Juncker is readying a letter on backstop assurances - MPs are not content with assurances so it would make sense to discount this unless we see something truly radical,"" Wilson suggested.

There is not much new flow from FTSE 100 companies leaving the field open to the mid-caps.

JD Sports Fashion PLC (LON:JD.) extended early gains, rising 40p to 436.2p after its well-received Christmas trading update but Premier Oil PLC (LON:PMO) tumbled on market speculation that it is about to make a UK acquisition.

The company neither confirmed nor denied the speculation, saying it would ""continue to look at opportunities to acquire UK North Sea assets in line with the group's stated strategy"".

Specifically, the group said, no firm decision has been taken to bid for any of the assets currently being marketed by US major Chevron.

Were it to acquire large chunks of Chevron's assets it is possible that the company might have to go to the market to raise funds, which might explain why the shares were off 9.7% at 71.75p.

Premier's fall at least meant white-collar recruitment specialist PageGroup PLC (LON:PAGE) avoided the FTSE 250 wooden spoon.

Its shares were down 6.2% after the group reported a slowdown in the UK jobs market due to Brexit uncertainty.

8.35am: Weak start for Footsie

As expected, the FTSE 100 started the week in the doldrums, losing 35 points to trade at 6,883.38 in the first half hour.

Disappointing Chinese trade data pushed Asia's main markets into negative territory, which had a knock-on impact in London, which is braced for more Brexit wrangling ahead of Tuesday's crunch vote.

In the US, the government shut-down has moved into week-four with President Trump ready to declare a state of emergency.

Wall Street is also braced for earnings season, which is being viewed with trepidation given the recent and unexpected warning by Apple.

""As ever, but more so than normal, it's less about the actual earnings than the guidance and the kind of outlook the CFOs are giving on the calls,"" said Neil Wilson of Markets.com.

315,baytoday.ca,https://www.baytoday.ca/world-news/federal-work-at-superfund-sites-suspended-during-shutdown-1193142,"BIRMINGHAM, Ala. -- The government shutdown has suspended federal cleanups at Superfund sites around the nation and forced the cancellation of public hearings, deepening the mistrust and resentment of surrounding residents who feel people in power long ago abandoned them to live among the toxic residue of the country's factories and mines.

""We are already hurting, and it's just adding more fuel to the fire,"" says 40-year-old Keisha Brown. Her home is in a community nestled among plants that turn coal into carbon-rich fuel and other factories on Birmingham's north side.

The mostly African-American community has been forced to cope with high levels of arsenic, lead and other contaminants in the soil that the Environmental Protection Agency has been scraping up and carting away, house by house.

As President Donald Trump and Congress battle over Trump's demand for a wall on the southern U.S. border, the 3-week-old partial government shutdown has stopped federal work on Superfund sites except for cases where the administration deems ""there is an imminent threat to the safety of human life or to the protection of property.""

EPA's shutdown plans said the agency would evaluate about 800 Superfund sites to see how many could pose an immediate threat. As an example of that kind of threat, it cited an acid leak from a mine that could threaten the public water supply. That's the hazard at Northern California's Iron Mountain mine, where EPA workers help prevent an unending flow of lethally acidic runoff off the Superfund site from spilling into rivers downstream.

Practically speaking, said Bonnie Bellow, a former EPA official who worked on Superfund public outreach at the agency, the impact of the stoppage of work at sites across the nation ""wholly depends"" on the length of the shutdown.

""Unless there is immediate risk like a storm, a flood, a week or two of slowdowns is not going to very likely affect the cleanup at the site,"" Bellow said.

In north Birmingham, Brown said it's been a couple of weeks since she's spotted any EPA crews at people's houses. It was unclear if state workers or contractors were continuing work.

But long before the shutdown began, Brown harboured doubts the cleanup was working anyway.

""My main concern is the health of the people out here,"" said Brown, who has asthma. ""All of us are sick, and we've got to function on medicine every day.""

In terms of time, the federal government shutdown is a chronological blip in the long history of the site -- which includes ethics charges in a local bribery scandal to block federal cleanup efforts -- but adds to the uncertainty in an area where residents feel forgotten and betrayed.

At the EPA, the shutdown has furloughed the bulk of the agency's roughly 14,000 employees. It also means the EPA isn't getting most of the daily stream of environmental questions and tips from the public. Routine inspections aren't happening. State, local and private emails to EPA officials often get automated messages back promising a response when the shutdown ends.

In Montana, for instance, state officials this month found themselves fielding calls from a tribal member worried about drinking water with a funny look to it, said Kristi Ponozzo, public-policy director at that state's Department of Environmental Quality. The EPA normally provides tribes with technical assistance on water supplies.

With most EPA colleagues idled, Ponozzo said, her agency also had to call off an environmental review meeting for a mining project, potentially delaying the project.

But it's the agency's work at Superfund sites -- lessening the threat from old nuclear-weapons plants, chemical factories, mines and other entities -- that gets much of the attention.

Absent imminent peril, it would be up to state governments or contractors to continue any cleanup during the shutdown ""up to the point that additional EPA direction or funding is needed,"" the EPA said in a statement.

""Sites where cleanup activities have been stopped or shut down will be secured until cleanup activities are able to commence when the federal government reopens,"" the agency said.

For federal Superfund sites in Michigan, the shutdown means there are no EPA colleagues to consult, said Scott Dean, a spokesman for that state's Department of Environmental Quality.

At Michigan Superfund sites, day-to-day field operations were continuing since private contractors do most of the on-the-ground work, Dean said.

Bellow, the former EPA official, said the cancellation of hearings about Superfund sites posed immediate concerns.

In East Chicago, Indiana, for example, the EPA called off a planned public hearing set for last Wednesday to outline how the agency planned to clean up high levels of lead and arsenic in the soil.

The EPA has proposed a seven-month, $26.5 million cleanup that includes treating and removing tainted soil from the area, where a lead smelter was located.

During a public meeting Nov. 29, some residents complained that the EPA's approach would leave too much pollution in place. Others didn't get a chance to speak and were hoping to do so at the meeting this week, said Debbie Chizewer, a Northwestern University environmental attorney who represents community groups in the low-income area.

The EPA announced the cancellation in an online notice and gave no indication that it would be rescheduled.

Leaders of the East Chicago Calumet Community Advisory Group asked for a new hearing date and an extension of a Jan. 14 public comment deadline in a letter to the EPA's regional Superfund division.

Calls by The Associated Press to the agency's regional office in Chicago this week were not answered.

Local critics fear the EPA will use the delay caused by the shutdown as justification for pushing ahead with a cleanup strategy they consider flawed, Chizewer said, even though the agency has designated the affected area as an ""environmental justice community,"" a low-income community of colour that has been disproportionately harmed by pollution.

The EPA has a ""special obligation"" when dealing with such communities, Chizewer said. ""This would be an example of shutting them out for no good reason.""

In North Birmingham, former longtime neighbourhood resident Charlie Powell said most of the people living in and around the Superfund site had already ""just got tired and fed up.""

Powell left the area but started a group called PANIC, People Against Neighborhood Industrial Contamination. He said he believes money would be better spent helping residents move away from the pollution.

""Can I say hell?"" Powell said when asked what residents have been through.

Immigration and U.S. borders lie at the center of this fight over the government shutdown and we wanted to look at where our congresswoman, Elise Stefanik, stands on all this. Brian Mann joined Martha Foley for a conversation during the Eight O'clock Hour.

Martha Foley: Congresswoman Stefanik, she's a Republican. She voted in December 2018 on a temporary spending bill that included money to build part of President Trump's wall. She has also voted with Democrats now twice to reopen the government, backing spending bills that didn't include money for the project. So what's the takeaway here?

Brian Mann: Well, let me start by saying we really wanted to ask the Congresswoman about this, about how the shutdown is affecting her district, government workers, people who rely on federal services. She declined to talk with us. She did send us a prepared statement.

Rep. Elise Stefanik: I believe strongly that our government should stay open, and our border should be secured. These two policies should not be mutually exclusive. As we speak, there are Northern border patrol agents in my district working without pay due to the shutdown. Under no circumstance should working people in our country lose out on a paycheck because Congress can't work together, which is why I have been a consistent vote to keep the government open throughout my career.

Martha: Okay, she says pretty clearly that she doesn't like this tactic, the President using a government shutdown to negotiate. What does she think of the border wall idea itself? It's really popular with a lot of her Republican voters.

Brian: Right, but Stefanik has in the past spoken pretty passionately against this idea. I found this exchange back in 2017 between Stefanik and a constituent, recorded at a forum held by Mountain Lake PBS. It's kind of a long exchange, but I think it's important to hear her full thinking.

Rep. Elise Stefanik: ""I've always said that when I disagree with the President, I would say so. I think it's not going to happen that Mexico is going to pay for the wall. I don't think that's realistic... You have mountain ranges, you have water... I don't think a wall is the best model... We live in a government that has separation of powers. Congress has the power of the purse. We control the appropriations process. So I do think you'll hear independent voices.""

Mountain Lake PBSStatement by Rep. Elise Stefank at forum

Brian: Again Stefanik did vote last month to pay for part of the border wall, but she sounds pretty skeptical there in 2017. And she's voted with Democrats to end the shutdown, without funding the wall. Hopefully as this shutdown grinds on we'll have a chance to talk with her and get a sense for where she's at on all this now.

Martha: One last question, Brian. Last week, the Congresswoman tweeted kind of out of the blue talking about her opposition white supremacy and white nationalism. What's that about? Is it connected to this debate over immigration and the border?

Brian: It is in a way, we think. It appears that she was tweeting about comments made by one of her Republican colleagues, Iowa Congressman Steve King, who spoke in an interview with the New York Times defending the concepts of white nationalism and white supremacy. King was one of the early supporters of a border wall, an early opponent of illegal immigration but also someone who wants to curb a lot of legal immigration. Many of President Trump's ideas have mirrored those of Congressman King. In her tweet, Stefanik pushed back against this idea that has some currency in the conservative movement now. Here's what she said:

Rep. Elise Stefanik: ""We must unequivocally condemn the ideology of white supremacy and white nationalism. It is abhorrent and heinous and has no place in our discourse.""

Brian: I should say, Martha, that this issue again is something we tried to ask the Congresswoman questions about and got no response.

Martha: Okay, we'll keep working to sort through where North Country Congresswoman Elise Stefanik stands on the border wall and immigration and the government shutdown as this continues."
317,west hawaii today,http://www.westhawaiitoday.com/2018/12/17/nation-world-news/ap-news-in-brief-12-17-18/,"White House digs in on border wall demand, risking shutdown

WASHINGTON -- The White House on Sunday pushed the federal government closer to the brink of a partial shutdown later this week, digging in on its demand for $5 billion to build a border wall as congressional Democrats stood firm against it.

""We will do whatever is necessary to build the border wall to stop this ongoing crisis of immigration,"" said White House senior adviser Stephen Miller.

Asked if that meant having a government shutdown, he said: ""If it comes to it, absolutely.""

Trump said last week he would be ""proud"" to have a shutdown to get Congress to approve a $5 billion down payment to fulfill his campaign promise to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. But the president doesn't have the votes from the Republican-controlled Congress to support funding for the wall at that level.

Democratic congressional leaders, Sen. Chuck Schumer and Rep. Nancy Pelosi, have proposed no more than $1.6 billion, as outlined in a bipartisan Senate bill. The money would not go for the wall but for fencing upgrades and other border security. Democrats also offered to simply keep funding at its current level, $1.3 billion.

Giuliani: 'Over my dead body' will Mueller interview Trump

WASHINGTON -- With a number of probes moving closer to the Oval Office, President Donald Trump and his attorney unleased a fresh series of attacks Sunday on the investigators, questioning their integrity while categorically ruling out the possibility of a presidential interview with the special counsel.

Trump and Rudy Giuliani used Twitter and television interviews to deliver a series of broadsides against special counsel Robert Mueller and federal prosecutors in New York. Giuliani said he was ""disgusted"" by the tactics used by Mueller in his probe into Russian election interference, including in securing guilty pleas from the president's former national security adviser Michael Flynn on a charge of lying to federal investigators.

Trump, Giuliani said, would not submit to an interview by Mueller's team.

""They're a joke,"" Giuliani told ""Fox News Sunday."" ""Over my dead body, but, you know, I could be dead.""

The special counsel, who is investigating possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russia, has continued to request an interview with the president. Last month, the White House sent written answers in response to the special counsel's questions about possible collusion. The White House has resisted answering questions on possible obstruction of justice.

Talks adopt 'rulebook' to put Paris climate deal into action

KATOWICE, Poland -- Almost 200 nations, including the world's top greenhouse gas producers, China and the United States, have adopted a set of rules meant to breathe life into the 2015 Paris climate accord by setting out how countries should report their emissions and efforts to reduce them.

But negotiators delayed other key decisions until next year -- a move that frustrated environmentalists and countries that wanted more ambitious goals in light of scientists' warnings that the world must shift sharply away from fossil fuels in the coming decade.

""The majority of the rulebook for the Paris agreement has been created, which is something to be thankful for,"" said Mohamed Adow, a climate policy expert at Christian Aid. ""But the fact countries had to be dragged kicking and screaming to the finish line shows that some nations have not woken up"" to the dire consequences of global warming as outlined in a report by the U.N Panel on Climate Change, or IPCC.

Officials at the talks, which ended late Saturday in the Polish city of Katowice, agreed upon universal rules on how nations can cut emissions. Poor countries secured assurances on financial support to help them reduce emissions, adapt to changes such as rising sea levels and pay for damage that has already happened.

""Through this package, you have made a thousand little steps forward together,"" said Michal Kurtyka, a senior Polish official who led the talks.

French city honors victims of Christmas market attack

PARIS -- People filled a square in the French city of Strasbourg on Sunday to show respect and sympathy for the victims of last week's shooting attack near a famous Christmas market as the death toll rose to five.

French authorities said a Polish man died in a Strasbourg hospital Sunday, one of a dozen people wounded in last Tuesday's attack. Poland's Foreign Ministry extended condolences Sunday on Twitter to his family.

According to the newspaper DNA, more than 1,000 people attended the memorial, which ended with a minute of applause and a rendition of France's national anthem, ""La Marseillaise.""

The hour-long ceremony took place in Kleber Square, not far from where a gunman opened fire on Tuesday evening. Strasbourg Mayor Roland Ries praised the city's resilience in the face of hardship.

The ""extremely large crowd in the Christmas market"" on Saturday ""was an illustration of our commitment to these values on which our living together is based, which we will continue to defend against all those who want to attack it,"" Ries said.

Not into bingo, 84-year-old Texas woman gets college degree

RICHARDSON, Texas -- After raising five kids and retiring at age 77 from her secretarial job, Janet Fein couldn't be blamed for finally relaxing, but that's not her.

Fein, now 84, went to back to school and will accomplish a long-held goal this week when she graduates from the University of Texas at Dallas with a bachelor's degree.

""I didn't have anything to do in retirement and I didn't think that playing bingo was up to my speed,"" said Fein, who majored in sociology because she felt it was ""substantial.""

She said she enjoyed all the reading and writing papers. ""With each class I already knew a lot, but then I also learned a lot. And that made me happy,"" she said.

People 65 and older make up less than 1 percent of U.S. college students. In 2015, they accounted for about 67,000 of about 20 million college students, according to the National Center for Education Statistics.

Next-generation of GPS satellites are headed to space

DENVER -- After months of delays, the U.S. Air Force is about to launch the first of a new generation of GPS satellites, designed to be more accurate, secure and versatile.

But some of their most highly touted features will not be fully available until 2022 or later because of problems in a companion program to develop a new ground control system for the satellites, government auditors said.

The satellite is scheduled to lift off Tuesday from Cape Canaveral, Florida, aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. It's the first of 32 planned GPS III satellites that will replace older ones now in orbit. Lockheed Martin is building the new satellites outside Denver.

GPS is best-known for its widespread civilian applications, from navigation to time-stamping bank transactions. The Air Force estimates 4 billion people worldwide use the system.

But it was developed by the U.S. military, which still designs, launches and operates the system. The Air Force controls a constellation of 31 GPS satellites from a high-security complex at Schriever Air Force Base outside Colorado Springs.

After fraud probe, new primary may replace GOP candidate

RALEIGH, N.C. -- Legislation quickly passed by North Carolina's lawmakers this week would prepare a path for Republicans to dump their nominee in a still-undecided U.S. House race marred with ballot fraud allegations.

""I think (legislators are) worried that Mark Harris might be damaged goods and they want to have the opportunity to have a different Republican nominee,"" said Carter Wrenn, a Republican operative and consultant to former U.S. Sen. Jesse Helms and others for more than 40 years. ""That's how I read those tea leaves.""

If the state elections board decides ballot irregularities or other problems cast the true outcome into doubt and force a redo, the legislation -- if allowed to go into law by Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper -- would require new primary elections in the 9th Congressional District race, in addition to a new general election.

That would allow Republicans another look at Mark Harris, the Republican who led Democrat Dan McCready by 905 votes in unofficial results. Harris hasn't been certified the winner, and an investigation is looking into missing absentee ballots in rural Bladen County and whether unsealed ballots illegally handled by collection teams there could have been altered.

Bladen was the only county among the eight within the 9th District where Harris won a majority of mail-in absentee ballots over McCready.

'Spider-Verse' swings to the top; 'Mortal Engines' tanks

LOS ANGELES -- ""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse"" swung to the top of the domestic box office in its first weekend in theaters, proving that there is widespread audience interest in big screen animated versions of Marvel's marquee superheroes.

The film led a host of newcomers that debuted to varying success on this pre-Christmas holiday weekend, including Clint Eastwood's drug smuggling drama ""The Mule"" and the Peter Jackson-produced epic ""Mortal Engines"" which bombed in North American theaters.

""Into the Spider-Verse"" earned an estimated $35.4 million from 3,813 theaters against a $90 million production budget according to Sony Pictures on Sunday, which is a record for animated movies in December (although the hybrid ""Alvin and the Chipmunks"" movies were higher). The film features an innovative animation style -- both CGI and hand-drawn -- and focuses on the Miles Morales character as he learns to become the famed web-slinger. It's another financial win for the studio's latest ""expanded Spider-Man universe"" strategy following ""Venom"" and ""Spider-Man: Homecoming.""

And ""Spider-Verse"" has been very well-received among critics, and audiences in exit surveys gave it a rare A+ CinemaScore -- a first for a Spider-Man film. It's also been nominated for a Golden Globe award for best animated feature and picked up a few honors from critics' groups as well, including the New York Film Critics Circle.

""We are playing to both families and fanboys. We're an all-audience film,"" said Adrian Smith, Sony's president of domestic distribution."

The FTSE 100 index ended its half-day Christmas Eve session off lows but still posted an unseasonal decline as investors shunned the market ahead of the festive break amid concern about the trifecta of worries over global growth, US/China trade wars and Brexit.

At the 12.30pm close, the UK blue chip index was down 35 points at 6,685, just bouncing off the late session low of 6,661.04, with Friday's 9 point Santa rally proving a false dawn.

Wall Street is expected to extend its pre-weekend plunge when its final half-day session before the holidays starts in two hours but some commentators were still hoping Santa Claus might still make a late appearance across the pond.

Investors, however, remained nervous after reports that US Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin held calls with top US bankers over the weekend following the recent sell-off in equity markets and convened a ""Plunge Protection Team"".

Rumours suggesting that President Donald Trump had asked officials whether he could fire Jerome Powell as chair of the Federal Reserve were also swirling over the weekend.

Chris Beauchamp, chief market analyst at IG, commented: ""The Christmas rally has not arrived for European markets, who have, it must be said, been on the naughty list for investors for almost two years now, having lagged far behind the US.""

""But,"" he added, ""Wall Street has done its best to catch up these past few months, and the reports of Steve Mnuchin meeting with decision-makers will not provide much Christmas cheer.

""Mr Mnuchin is most likely worried about his job, but everyone else will draw the conclusion that there is perhaps much more to worry about.""

Beauchamp concluded: ""US markets might bounce a bit today, in a feeble attempt to revive the spirit of Christmas, but investors head to the feast in a very different mood to a year ago.""

10.30am: Grinch holds sway

The FTSE 100 index remained unseasonally gloomy as the half-day Christmas Eve session progressed, with little to provide any relief as investors could only look ahead of more worries over global growth, US/China trade wars and Brexit once the turkey has been eaten.

Around 10.30am, the UK's leading stock index was 39 points lower at 6,682 barely shifting from its opening position in a market set to close at 12.30pm before the Wall Street restart, although no relief is likely across the pound following Friday's plunge.

Naeem Aslam, chief market analyst at Think Markets UK Ltd noted: ""US futures are trading lower as investors focus on the US partial government shutdown. The disappointing fact is that there is no immediate end in sight for this resolution.

""Trading volume is going to remain very thin today as most of the traders are out for the holiday season. We do not expect any major moves in the market. The ongoing downtrend would continue to dominate today and markets are likely to close lower again.""

There was, however, some positive corporate news further down the market in London, with Premier African Minerals Limited (LON:PREM) shares shooting 15% higher mid-morning to 0.115p after the group said it has been informed that the Zimbabwean Government is willing to inject the funds required to resuscitate the RHA tungsten mine.

In a statement, the AIM-listed firm said the indication was made in a letter received on the afternoon of 21 December 2018 from the Zimbabwean Minister of Industry, Commerce and Enterprise Development which asked for some further clarification on the history of Premier's involvement and the restructuring of RHA Tungsten Pvt Limited.

Westminster Group PLC (LON:WSG) was also a good gainer, up 7.3% to 9.5p after it revealed that the majority of issues and challenges created by the US sanctions renewal against Iran have now been addressed and the security contract for one of 60 airports in the country, which was signed in May 2018, remains a key focus for the company.

Dukemount Capital PLC (LON:DKE) saw its shares rise on Christmas Eve after it announced that it has forward-funded and pre-sold the first project in West Derby to a segregated mandate limited partnership managed by Alpha Real Capital.

The first stage of the process will result in a payment to Dukemount of £570,000 for the enhanced value of the site and the preliminary costs, with the total funding package from Alpha for the complete development being £3mln.

8.40am: Glum start on Christmas Eve

The FTSE 100 index took a tumble in early trading on Christmas Eve with the half-day session looking to be unseasonally glum following a sharp sell-off last week on Wall Street amid global growth, trade war, and US government shutdown worries

Around 8.40am, the blue-chip index was 38 points, or 0.6% lower at 6,682, reversing after having posted a 9.34 point gain on Friday which had raised some hopes for a very late Santa rally.

But those hopes were dashed after New York stocks posted further hefty falls pre-weekend, with the Nasdaq Composite index entering bear market territory after a 3% drop and the other two US indexes not far behind.

Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets, commented: ""Markets still under pressure from last week's more hawkish Fed update, exacerbating fears about slowing growth and more expensive refinancing following years of stimulus.

""This is on top of pre-existing trade war fears with the US Trade Secretary saying ""All auto tariff options still on the table"". That said, China says it will remove some import and export tariffs on 1 Jan which has helped improve sentiment overnight.""

He added: Countering this nugget of positivity, however, we have; 1) a US government shutdown (Senate Democrats refusing the President's demands for border wall funds); 2) US Defence Chief leaving even earlier than expected, and; 3) Treasury Secretary awkwardly calling Bank executives about market stability after a) market sell-off, b) government shutdown and c) rumours the President asked if he could fire Fed Chair Powell. Mixed signals aplenty into Christmas!""

There was little corporate news to counter the glum pre-Christmas mood, and what there was proved mostly negative.

Playtech PLC (LON:PTEC) shares dropped 4.7% to 379p after the FTSE 250-listed gaming technology company said it expects a new Italian tax on gambling to reduce its 2019 adjusted underlying earnings (EBITDA) by approximately €20mln-€25mln before any mitigating actions.

Under pressure department stores operator Debenhams PLC (LON:DEB) was even worse off, shedding 10.4% to 3.5p as investors worried that 'Super Saturday' Christmas trading on the high street won't prove strong enough.

But among the minority gainers, AIM-listed Victoria Oil & Gas PLC (LON:VOG) leapt 19% higher to 18.90p after it revealed that its wholly-owned subsidiary Gaz du Cameroun SA is to resume gas supply to the Logbaba 30 megawatt (MW) power station after signed a binding term sheet with grid power provider, Eneo Cameroon SA.

Eland Oil & Gas PLC (LON:ELA) said that drilling on the third appraisal well on the Gbetiokun field in Nigeria has successfully encountered hydrocarbon-bearing sands and added that operations will continue down to the remaining target reservoir.

Savannah Resources PLC (LON:SAV) has appointed SP Angel Corporate Finance as its nominated adviser with immediate effect. The group said the appointment comes as a result of the proposed merger between SP Angel and Savannah's previous Nomad, Northland Capital.

Eight Peaks Group PLC (LON:8PG) announced that, further to its previous announcement of 20 December 2018, Zafar Karim, its executive chairman, and Lord Nicholas Monson, a non-executive director of the company, have now subscribed for a total of 1,000,000 and 700,000 new ordinary shares, respectively, at a price of 10p each. Following the subscription, the group added, Karim and Monson, will have beneficial interests representing approximately 7.9% and 4.0%, respectively, of the company's enlarged ordinary share capital.

Chaarat Gold Holdings Limited (LON:CGH) announced on Friday that it has raised US$350,000 after entering into an agreement with an unnamed investor for the subscription and issue of secured convertible loan notes exercisable in 2021.

6.30am: Unseasonal greetings

The FTSE 100 index is expected to post an unseasonal plunge on Christmas Eve as more weakness pre-weekend on Wall Street curtails Friday's late modest Santa rally, pulling London back to the Grinch-like performance during the rest of Advent.

Spread betting firm IG expects the blue-chip index to open around 46 points lower at 6,675 on the final half-day trading session before the festive break.

The Footsie had managed to finish 9.24 points higher at 6,721.17 on Friday, the last full trading session before the holidays providing some hope that the fabled Santa rally might finally arrive.

However, on Wall Street, after starting modestly higher, the Dow Jones Industrials Average swiftly reversed, shedding 414 points at the close, or 1.8% to reach 22,445 its lowest level since October 2017.

The falls were worse for the broader S&P 500 index which lost 2%, while the tech-laden Nasdaq Composite tumbled 3% to become the first of the three major indexes to enter official 'bear' market territory - down nearly 22% from its 29 August record closing high, to exceeding the 20% drop considered the threshold for that nomenclature.

Growth, shut-down and trade worries

The fresh falls came two days after the Federal Reserve raised interest rates for a fourth time this year despite concerns over slowing economic growth which has led investors to flee stocks in high-valuation sectors such as technology.

The wrangling between President Trump and Congress over the inclusion of the Mexican border wall costs in the Federal budget which has led to a temporary shutdown of government services also caused concern.

And US markets were also spooked by comments from White House trade adviser Peter Navarro who said the United States and China might not reach a trade deal at the close of a 90-day negotiating window unless Beijing can agree to a profound overhaul of its economic policies.

Those comments kept the mood equally glum today in Asia, with Hong Kong's Hang Seng index shedding 0.4% and the Shanghai Composite off 0.02%, while Japan's Nikkei 225 index was closed for a public holiday.

On currency markets, the pound managed to edge 0.3% higher against the US dollar but stayed flat versus the euro on that heady mix of global growth worries, ongoing trade war fears, plus Brexit deal uncertainty.

Empty presents

There is nothing scheduled on the corporate diary for Christmas Eve and just a UK CBI growth indicator survey due on the macro front.

Investors will therefore likely fixate on the traditional Christmas fare of presents and the turkey dinner, whilst also thinking ahead to January's splurge of trading updates from the general and food retail sectors, kicking off with Next PLC's (LON:NXT) pronouncements on 3 January.

However, the half-day London session - which will see markets close at 12.30pm - can often spring some surprises, so investors will also keep a watch out for any unseasonal early warnings.

Mike van Dulken, head of research at Accendo Markets, commented: ""Markets still under pressure from last week's more hawkish Fed update, exacerbating fears about slowing growth and more expensive refinancing following years of stimulus.

""This is on top of pre-existing trade war fears with the US Trade Secretary saying ""All auto tariff options still on the table"". That said, China says it will remove some import and export tariffs on 1 Jan which has helped improve sentiment overnight.""

He added: Countering this nugget of positivity, however, we have; 1) a US government shutdown (Senate Democrats refusing the President's demands for border wall funds); 2) US Defence Chief leaving even earlier than expected, and; 3) Treasury Secretary awkwardly calling Bank executives about market stability after a) market sell-off, b) government shutdown, and c) rumours the President asked if he could fire Fed Chair Powell. Mixed signals a plenty into Christmas!""

There was little corporate news to counter the glum pre-Christmas mood, and what there was proved mostly negative.

Playtech PLC (LON:PTEC) shares dropped 4.7% to 379p after the FTSE 250-listed gaming technology company said it expects a new Italian tax on gambling to reduce its 2019 adjusted underlying earnings (EBITDA) by approximately €20mln-€25mln before any mitigating actions.

Under pressure department stores operator Debenhams PLC (LON:DEB) was even worse off, shedding 10.4% to 3.5p as investors worried that 'Super Saturday' Christmas trading on the high street won't prove strong enough.

But among the minority gainers, AIM-listed Victoria Oil & Gas PLC (LON:VOG) leapt 19% higher to 18.90p after it revealed that its wholly-owned subsidiary Gaz du Cameroun SA is to resume gas supply to the Logbaba 30 megawatt (MW) power station after signed a binding term sheet with grid power provider, Eneo Cameroon SA.

Proactive news headlines:

Westminster Group PLC (LON:WSG) has revealed that the majority of issues and challenges created by the US sanctions renewal against Iran have now been addressed and the security contract for one of 60 airports in the country, which was signed in May 2018, remains a key focus for the company.

Victoria Oil & Gas PLC (LON:VOG) has announced that its wholly-owned subsidiary Gaz du Cameroun SA (GDC) is to resume gas supply to the Logbaba 30 megawatt (MW) power station after signed a binding term sheet with grid power provider, Eneo Cameroon SA (ENEO).

Eland Oil & Gas PLC (LON:ELA) said that drilling on the third appraisal well on the Gbetiokun field in Nigeria has successfully encountered hydrocarbon bearing sands and added that operations will continue down to the remaining target reservoir.

Savannah Resources PLC (LON:SAV) has appointed SP Angel Corporate Finance as its nominated adviser with immediate effect. The group said the appointment comes as a result of the proposed merger between SP Angel and Savannah's previous Nomad, Northland Capital.

Eight Peaks Group PLC (LON:8PG) announced that, further to its previous announcement of 20 December 2018, Zafar Karim, its executive chairman, and Lord Nicholas Monson, a non-executive director of the company, have now subscribed for a total of 1,000,000 and 700,000 new ordinary shares, respectively, at a price of 10p each. Following the subscription, the group added, Karim and Monson, will have beneficial interests representing approximately 7.9% and 4.0%, respectively, of the company's enlarged ordinary share capital.

Chaarat Gold Holdings Limited (LON:CGH) announced on Friday that it has raised US$350,000 after entering into an agreement with an unnamed investor for the subscription and issue of secured convertible loan notes exercisable in 2021.

6.30am: Unseasonal greetings

The FTSE 100 index is expected to post an unseasonal plunge on Christmas Eve as more weakness pre-weekend on Wall Street curtails Friday's late modest Santa rally, pulling London back to the Grinch-like performance during the rest of Advent.

Spread betting firm IG expects the blue-chip index to open around 46 points lower at 6,675 on the final half-day trading session before the festive break.

The Footsie had managed to finish 9.24 points higher at 6,721.17 on Friday, the last full trading session before the holidays providing some hope that the fabled Santa rally might finally arrive.

However, on Wall Street, after starting modestly higher, the Dow Jones Industrials Average swiftly reversed, shedding 414 points at the close, or 1.8% to reach 22,445 its lowest level since October 2017.

The falls were worse for the broader S&P 500 index which lost 2%, while the tech-laden Nasdaq Composite tumbled 3% to become the first of the three major indexes to enter official 'bear' market territory - down nearly 22% from its 29 August record closing high, to exceeding the 20% drop considered the threshold for that nomenclature.

Growth, shut-down and trade worries

The fresh falls came two days after the Federal Reserve raised interest rates for a fourth time this year despite concerns over slowing economic growth which has led investors to flee stocks in high-valuation sectors such as technology.

The wrangling between President Trump and Congress over inclusion of the Mexican border wall costs in the Federal budget which has led to a temporary shutdown of government services also caused concern.

And US markets were also spooked by comments from White House trade adviser Peter Navarro who said the United States and China might not reach a trade deal at the close of a 90-day negotiating window unless Beijing can agree to a profound overhaul of its economic policies.

Those comments kept the mood equally glum today in Asia, with Hong Kong's Hang Seng index shedding 0.4% and the Shanghai Composite off 0.02%, while Japan's Nikkei 225 index was closed for a public holiday.

On currency markets, the pound managed to edge 0.3% higher against the US dollar but stayed flat versus the euro on that heady mix of global growth worries, ongoing trade war fears, plus Brexit deal uncertainty.

Empty presents

There is nothing scheduled on the corporate diary for Christmas Eve and just a UK CBI growth indicator survey due on the macro front.

Investors will therefore likely fixate on the traditional Christmas fare of presents and the turkey dinner, whilst also thinking ahead to January's splurge of trading updates from the general and food retail sectors, kicking off with Next PLC's (LON:NXT) pronouncements on 3 January.

However, the half-day London session - which will see markets close at 12.30pm - can often spring some surprises, so investors will also keep a watch out for any unseasonal early warnings.

Significant announcements expected on Dec 24:

320,baytoday.ca,https://www.baytoday.ca/world-news/congress-to-face-same-question-when-will-shutdown-end-1194760,"WASHINGTON -- Congress returns to Washington for its first full week of legislative business since control of the House reverted to Democrats, but lawmakers will be confronted with the same lingering question: When will the partial government shutdown end?

One Republican senator says he's offered President Donald Trump a possible solution, though it may just be wishful thinking.

Sen. Lindsey Graham is encouraging Trump to reopen government for several weeks to continue negotiating with Democrats over the border wall Trump wants to build on the U.S.-Mexico border. If there's no deal at the end of that time, Graham says Trump would be free to take the more dramatic step of declaring a national emergency to build it.

But the South Carolina Republican says Trump still wants a deal on funding for the wall before agreeing to reopen shuttered government departments. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat, insists Trump reopen the government first.

Their weeks-old standoff led to the partial government shutdown, now on day 24 without a clear end in sight.

Trump insisted on Twitter Monday that he wanted to deal, declaring: ""I've been waiting all weekend. Democrats must get to work now. Border must be secured!""

Targeting Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, Trump also argued that the shutdown ""has become their, and the Democrats, fault!"" Trump weeks ago asserted that he would ""own"" the shutdown and polls show that he is taking most of the blame.

Graham, who has publicly pushed Trump to use his authority to declare a national emergency to build the wall, is suggesting a short-term fix.

""Before he pulls the plug on the legislative option, and I think we're almost there, I would urge him to open up the government for a short period of time, like three weeks, before he pulls the plug, see if we can get a deal,"" Graham said. ""If we can't at the end of three weeks, all bets are off.

""See if he can do it by himself through the emergency powers. That's my recommendation,"" added Graham, who has publicly pushed Trump to use his authority to declare a national emergency to build the wall. Such a step would allow Trump to bypass Congress and tap various pots of unspent federal money, including for military construction and disaster relief as well as from assets seized by law enforcement, to pay for the wall.

Trump has kept Washington on edge over whether he would resort to such a declaration, citing what he says is a ""crisis"" of drug smuggling and the trafficking of women and children at the border. The president initially sounded as though such a move was imminent, but then pulled back. He has said several times since he first mentioned the idea in public this month that he prefers a legislative solution.

A key question is how much more time is Trump willing to give lawmakers. Graham, who spoke with Trump by telephone on Sunday morning, said the legislative path ""is just about shut off"" and blamed intransigence by Pelosi.

The speaker's office had no immediate comment.

Democrats oppose an emergency declaration but may be powerless to block it. Some Republicans are wary, too, fearing how a future Democratic president might use that authority. Such a move, should Trump ultimately go that route, would almost certainly be challenged in the courts.

Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., called Graham's idea to reopen the government a ""great place to start.""

""I do think if we reopen the government, if the president ends this shutdown crisis, we have folks who can negotiate a responsible, modern investment in technology that will actually make us safer,"" Coons said.

Trump says technology is nice, but that the border can't be secured without a wall.

The White House has been laying the groundwork for an emergency declaration, which is feared by lawmakers in both parties.

Senate Homeland Security Committee Chairman Ron Johnson, R-Wis., said he'd ""hate to see"" a declaration issued because the wall wouldn't get built, presumably because of legal challenges. Democrats voted in the past for border security and should again, he said.

""I actually want to see this wall get built,"" Johnson said. ""I want to keep pressure on Democrats to actually come to the negotiating table in good faith and fund what they have supported in the past.""

Graham favours a declaration and said the time for talk is running out.

""It's the last option, not the first option, but we're pretty close to that being the only option,"" he said.

Graham and Coons spoke on ""Fox News Sunday"" and Johnson appeared on CNN's ""State of the Union.""

321,proactiveinvestors uk,https://www.proactiveinvestors.co.uk/companies/market_reports/212460/ftse-100-trading-sideways-at-lower-levels-as-us-benchmarks-open-09-lower-212460.html,"Pundits in the City have been running through the various Brexit scenarios FTSE 100 index sheds 73 points Sterling holding steady at around US$1.2850 US benchmarks open 0.9% lower

Just over a dozen Footsie constituents are clinging on to gains as investors move into ""risk off"" mode.

They have any number of reasons for battening down the hatches: weak Chinese trade data; the likelihood of political mayhem following the Brexit vote in parliament, sterling's strength, the US government shut-down and a weak start today on Wall Street.

The FTSE 100 was down 67 points (1.0%) at 6,851. Across the pond, the Dow Jones was off 218 points (0.9%) at 23,778 and the S&P 500 was down 24.4 points (0.9%) at 2,571.8.

""If, as seems likely, the House of Commons rejects Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit deal (voting begins at c19:00 on 15 January), all hell could break loose as the various factions of parliament struggle to gain control of the Brexit process. In the end, we expect the UK to secure a semi-soft or soft Brexit (55% probability) or completely reverse Brexit and remain in the EU - probably after a second referendum (25% chance),"" said Berenberg.

The German bank thinks it unlikely that May will come back to parliament with a second solution should the first one fail, if only because of time constraints (just three working days).

""This would give her the rest of this week and the weekend to negotiate with Brussels and the various factions of UK parliament from which she needs to win support. Even if the EU was willing, because of the time constraints, Mrs May will not be able to renegotiate her deal. The best she can hope for is that further clarity from the EU on the backstop will be enough to bring the DUP on board. If Mrs May can get the DUP on side, there is a good chance that the Brexiteers and the rest of her party would follow. If Mrs May loses a second vote, or concedes defeat early, it will then likely fall to parliament to come up with a solution,"" Berenberg continued, adding that it does not expect May to resign, even if she loses badly, while it sees only a small chance of a snap election.

Jasper Lawler of LCG reckons that if parliament somehow passes a bill calling for a second referendum, sterling would move above US$1.30 within minutes of it being announced.

""Anecdotally, the Brexit-voting public seem very comfortable with exiting the EU without a deal but there is very little taste for it in parliament. We think a Brexit delay by revoking or extending Article 50 is ultimately what we are facing,"" Lawler said.

12.30pm: Pound's strength adds to the Footsie's weakness

The pound has hit its highest level in seven months, which has not done many favours to the Footsie's many multinational companies.

The FTSE 100 was down 73 at 6,845 ahead of a US open that is expected to see the Dow Jones open with a 200 point fall.

""The pound has moved up to its highest level in seven weeks against the US dollar as the PM [prime minister] speaks, and is now not far from the US$1.29 handle; however, the markets remain highly sceptical as to whether May can get the required support in the Commons tomorrow evening and a heavy defeat would likely see her deal dead in the water,"" commented David Cheetham at XTB online trading.

""Recent developments have seen the consensus make a marked shift away from the probability of a no-deal but there remains a nagging doubt that this is being dismissed out of hand all too readily. If traders start to fear that it could realistically happen once more then the pound is vulnerable to a swift swoon lower,"" Cheetham opined.

For what it is worth, the bookmakers do not give prime minister Theresa May much chance of pulling a rabbit out of the hat.

On the subject of bookmakers, Paddy Power Betfair plc (LON:PPB) was the top blue-chip faller after Barclays downgraded the stock to 'equal weight' from 'overweight' and slashed its target price to 6,700p from 7,600p.

Goldman Sachs also cut its price target for Paddy Power, to 7,100p from 7,400p.

Paddy Power shares trade at 6,260p, down 270p on the day.

Sector peer GVC Holdings PLC (LON:GVC) also got the treatment from Barclays and Goldman, with the former cutting its price target for the bookmaker to 1,083p from 1,180p and the latter moving to 1,100p from 1,150p.

GVC shares were down 16p at 703.5p.

11.00am: Losses lengthen

The top-shares index's losses have lengthened as traders took a sneaky early look at how US indices are set to perform today.

Futures contracts point to the Dow Jones industrial average and the S&P 500 both kicking off about 1% lower.

On this side of the pond, the FTSE 100 was down 60 points (0.9%) at 6,858.

""US futures are lower ahead of the start of the week on Wall Street, with stocks further paring last week's gains following the post-Christmas bounce,"" said Craig Erlam at Oanda.

""We're now seeing a real test of this improved risk appetite, which has been evident over the last few weeks. US stock markets have rebounded back towards levels that were very well supported during the second half of 2018. A break of these levels in mid-December saw the sell-off pick up significant momentum, so it's natural that we're seeing some profit taking when approaching them again from below,"" he suggested.

Having held up reasonably well in early trading, sterling has started to drift lower on foreign exchange markets, which Josh Mahony at IG Group reckons is because traders are increasingly uncertain about what the future has in store for the UK economy.

""Brexit has rarely felt so up in the air, with a likely rejection of May's Brexit plan leading us into a period of great unknown. It is difficult to see how Theresa May is going to shift from adamantly stating that this is the only deal possible, to proposing a new direction within three days,"" Mahony stated.

""As a no-deal Brexit becomes less likely, the likelihood for a 'people's vote' is growing which is part of what is helping drive the bullishness seen throughout the start of 2019,"" he added.

On the corporate news front, most of the excitement is taking place among the small caps.

Verona Pharma PLC (LON:VRP) plunged 18p to 86p despite publishing what it said were encouraging top-line results from a three-day phase 2 trial evaluating of nebulized ensifentrine, a treatment for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

Results from the trial showed that ensifentrine did not improve breathing by a ""statistically significant"" amount, although it was better than a placebo.

The attempt to put a spin on the results and claim they were encouraging cut no ice with the market, which slashed the share price to 85p from 104p.

Going the other way was Pantheon Resources Plc (LON:PANR), which rose 12.2% to 26.65p on the back of the acquisition of a controlling interest in Vision Gas Limited and Vision Resources LLC.

Jay Cheatham, the chief executive officer of Pantheon, said the acquisition ""paves the way for Pantheon to assume operatorship and decision-making responsibility for our East Texas assets into the future.""

9.45am: Oils weigh on Footsie

London's leading shares remain in the doldrums, weighed down by concerns over the Chinese economy and fearful of yet another own goal on Brexit.

The FTSE 100 was down 28 at 6,890, with index heavyweights Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSB) and BP PLC (LON:BP.) - both down 1.1% - contributing to the fall on the back of a softer oil price.

On the futures market, Brent crude for March delivery has fallen below the US$60 a barrel market, down 70 cents (1.2%) at US$59.80.

""It's time for May's endgame,"" suggests Neil Wilson at markets.com.

""Sterling remains supported ahead of the key Brexit vote this week albeit within the broad range of the recent downtrend,"" Wilson noted.

A strong sterling is not necessarily good news for the Footsie as a large number of its constituents earn the bulk of their income overseas.

""The pound has found some bid with investors looking at a potential extension of Article 50. It's not so much the fact of the extension but the apparent coalescence of opinion around no-deal being a no-no. There are also reports that Jean Claude Juncker is readying a letter on backstop assurances - MPs are not content with assurances so it would make sense to discount this unless we see something truly radical,"" Wilson suggested.

There is not much new flow from FTSE 100 companies leaving the field open to the mid-caps.

JD Sports Fashion PLC (LON:JD.) extended early gains, rising 40p to 436.2p after its well-received Christmas trading update but Premier Oil PLC (LON:PMO) tumbled on market speculation that it is about to make a UK acquisition.

The company neither confirmed nor denied the speculation, saying it would ""continue to look at opportunities to acquire UK North Sea assets in line with the group's stated strategy"".

Specifically, the group said, no firm decision has been taken to bid for any of the assets currently being marketed by US major Chevron.

Were it to acquire large chunks of Chevron's assets it is possible that the company might have to go to the market to raise funds, which might explain why the shares were off 9.7% at 71.75p.

Premier's fall at least meant white-collar recruitment specialist PageGroup PLC (LON:PAGE) avoided the FTSE 250 wooden spoon.

Its shares were down 6.2% after the group reported a slowdown in the UK jobs market due to Brexit uncertainty.

According to Liberum Capital Markets, the fourth quarter profit of £211.1mln was 3% ahead of consensus expectations of £205.3ml.

8.35am: Weak start for Footsie

As expected, the FTSE 100 started the week in the doldrums, losing 35 points to trade at 6,883.38 in the first half hour.

Disappointing Chinese trade data pushed Asia's main markets into negative territory, which had a knock-on impact in London, which is braced for more Brexit wrangling ahead of Tuesday's crunch vote.

In the US, the government shut-down has moved into week-four with President Trump ready to declare a state of emergency.

Wall Street is also braced for earnings season, which is being viewed with trepidation given the recent and unexpected warning by Apple.

""As ever, but more so than normal, it's less about the actual earnings than the guidance and the kind of outlook the CFOs are giving on the calls,"" said Neil Wilson of Markets.com.

""In light of the Apple warning, of critical importance will be the expected impact on earnings from the trade war with China.

""That could offset any beats - three months ago the high volume of companies beating guidance wasn't enough to assuage concerns raised by the forecasts and guidance.""

In a repeat of Friday, the building stocks were well bid with Berkeley Group (LON:BKG) heading the Footsie with a 1.5% gain, followed by Taylor Wimpey (LON:TW.), which last week provided a reasonably confident assessment of prospects.

The current week sees the bulk of the quoted housebuilding sector update on trading.

Despite being one of the retail sector's festive winners, Next (LON:NXT) found itself on the 'sell' list of Credit Suisse as the London arm of the influential Swiss bank downgraded its recommendation.

JD Sports Fashion (LON:JD.) was in demand early doors after its Christmas figures more than passed muster.

The stock rose 7% early on, valuing it at £4.1bn, which puts it neck and neck with Marks & Spencer (LON:MKS).

6.30am: FTSE 100 set to drop

The FTSE 100 looks set to drop after China weighed in with worse than expected December export figures.

Clearly impacted by the trade spat with America, additional worries emanated from the fact the country also conducted less business with the rest of the world.

The major stock indices in the region were dragged lower - with the exception of Japan, which was closed for a public holiday.

In London, the index of blue-chip stocks looks likely to open 33 points lower at 6885.18, according to the spread betting firms.

More negatives than positives

Moving into the new trading week, there certainly appear to be more negatives than positives to ponder.

On this side of the Atlantic, MPs vote on Tuesday on the Brexit withdrawal bill - though this is highly unlikely to place a lid on the turmoil.

Going by weekend speculation on the matter, political chaos could ensue if the pro-remain wing of the Tory party enacts what has been described in the Sunday press as a ""very British coup"".

In the US, the government shutdown is heading into its fourth week with President Trump ready to declare a state of emergency.

The Footsie made a half-hearted effort at a rally as it entered the last hour of trading.

The FTSE 100 was down 56 at 6,862.

The FTSE 250 was also making a comeback, trimming its loss to 185 points at 18,358.

JD Sports ended the day as the FTSE 350's best performer, rising 31p to 427.2p after a sparkling trading update covering the Christmas period.

Stobart Group Ltd (LON:STOB) was the next best performer after its former boss, Andrew Tinkler, confirmed he had taken a 12.2% stake in Flybe Group PLC (LON:FLYB) - the struggling airline that Stobart is looking to take over in conjunction with Virgin Atlantic and US hedge fund Cyrus Capital.

Stobart shares rose 3.9% while Flybe's rose 6.7%.

2.30pm: US indices open 0.9% lower

Just over a dozen Footsie constituents are clinging on to gains as investors move into ""risk off"" mode.

They have any number of reasons for battening down the hatches: weak Chinese trade data; the likelihood of political mayhem following the Brexit vote in parliament, sterling's strength, the US government shut-down and a weak start today on Wall Street.

The FTSE 100 was down 67 points (1.0%) at 6,851. Across the pond, the Dow Jones was off 218 points (0.9%) at 23,778 and the S&P 500 was down 24.4 points (0.9%) at 2,571.8.

""If, as seems likely, the House of Commons rejects Prime Minister Theresa May's Brexit deal (voting begins at c19:00 on 15 January), all hell could break loose as the various factions of parliament struggle to gain control of the Brexit process. In the end, we expect the UK to secure a semi-soft or soft Brexit (55% probability) or completely reverse Brexit and remain in the EU - probably after a second referendum (25% chance),"" said Berenberg.

The German bank thinks it unlikely that May will come back to parliament with a second solution should the first one fail, if only because of time constraints (just three working days).

""This would give her the rest of this week and the weekend to negotiate with Brussels and the various factions of UK parliament from which she needs to win support. Even if the EU was willing, because of the time constraints, Mrs May will not be able to renegotiate her deal. The best she can hope for is that further clarity from the EU on the backstop will be enough to bring the DUP on board. If Mrs May can get the DUP on side, there is a good chance that the Brexiteers and the rest of her party would follow. If Mrs May loses a second vote, or concedes defeat early, it will then likely fall to parliament to come up with a solution,"" Berenberg continued, adding that it does not expect May to resign, even if she loses badly, while it sees only a small chance of a snap election.

Jasper Lawler of LCG reckons that if parliament somehow passes a bill calling for a second referendum, sterling would move above US$1.30 within minutes of it being announced.

""Anecdotally, the Brexit-voting public seem very comfortable with exiting the EU without a deal but there is very little taste for it in parliament. We think a Brexit delay by revoking or extending Article 50 is ultimately what we are facing,"" Lawler said.

12.30pm: Pound's strength adds to the Footsie's weakness

The pound has hit its highest level in seven months, which has not done many favours to the Footsie's many multinational companies.

The FTSE 100 was down 73 at 6,845 ahead of a US open that is expected to see the Dow Jones open with a 200 point fall.

""The pound has moved up to its highest level in seven weeks against the US dollar as the PM [prime minister] speaks, and is now not far from the US$1.29 handle; however, the markets remain highly sceptical as to whether May can get the required support in the Commons tomorrow evening and a heavy defeat would likely see her deal dead in the water,"" commented David Cheetham at XTB online trading.

""Recent developments have seen the consensus make a marked shift away from the probability of a no-deal but there remains a nagging doubt that this is being dismissed out of hand all too readily. If traders start to fear that it could realistically happen once more then the pound is vulnerable to a swift swoon lower,"" Cheetham opined.

For what it is worth, the bookmakers do not give prime minister Theresa May much chance of pulling a rabbit out of the hat.

On the subject of bookmakers, Paddy Power Betfair plc (LON:PPB) was the top blue-chip faller after Barclays downgraded the stock to 'equal weight' from 'overweight' and slashed its target price to 6,700p from 7,600p.

Goldman Sachs also cut its price target for Paddy Power, to 7,100p from 7,400p.

Paddy Power shares trade at 6,260p, down 270p on the day.

Sector peer GVC Holdings PLC (LON:GVC) also got the treatment from Barclays and Goldman, with the former cutting its price target for the bookmaker to 1,083p from 1,180p and the latter moving to 1,100p from 1,150p.

GVC shares were down 16p at 703.5p.

11.00am: Losses lengthen

The top-shares index's losses have lengthened as traders took a sneaky early look at how US indices are set to perform today.

Futures contracts point to the Dow Jones industrial average and the S&P 500 both kicking off about 1% lower.

On this side of the pond, the FTSE 100 was down 60 points (0.9%) at 6,858.

""US futures are lower ahead of the start of the week on Wall Street, with stocks further paring last week's gains following the post-Christmas bounce,"" said Craig Erlam at Oanda.

""We're now seeing a real test of this improved risk appetite, which has been evident over the last few weeks. US stock markets have rebounded back towards levels that were very well supported during the second half of 2018. A break of these levels in mid-December saw the sell-off pick up significant momentum, so it's natural that we're seeing some profit taking when approaching them again from below,"" he suggested.

Having held up reasonably well in early trading, sterling has started to drift lower on foreign exchange markets, which Josh Mahony at IG Group reckons is because traders are increasingly uncertain about what the future has in store for the UK economy.

""Brexit has rarely felt so up in the air, with a likely rejection of May's Brexit plan leading us into a period of great unknown. It is difficult to see how Theresa May is going to shift from adamantly stating that this is the only deal possible, to proposing a new direction within three days,"" Mahony stated.

""As a no-deal Brexit becomes less likely, the likelihood for a 'people's vote' is growing which is part of what is helping drive the bullishness seen throughout the start of 2019,"" he added.

On the corporate news front, most of the excitement is taking place among the small caps.

Verona Pharma PLC (LON:VRP) plunged 18p to 86p despite publishing what it said were encouraging top-line results from a three-day phase 2 trial evaluating of nebulized ensifentrine, a treatment for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD).

Results from the trial showed that ensifentrine did not improve breathing by a ""statistically significant"" amount, although it was better than a placebo.

The attempt to put a spin on the results and claim they were encouraging cut no ice with the market, which slashed the share price to 85p from 104p.

Going the other way was Pantheon Resources Plc (LON:PANR), which rose 12.2% to 26.65p on the back of the acquisition of a controlling interest in Vision Gas Limited and Vision Resources LLC.

Jay Cheatham, the chief executive officer of Pantheon, said the acquisition ""paves the way for Pantheon to assume operatorship and decision-making responsibility for our East Texas assets into the future.""

9.45am: Oils weigh on Footsie

London's leading shares remain in the doldrums, weighed down by concerns over the Chinese economy and fearful of yet another own goal on Brexit.

The FTSE 100 was down 28 at 6,890, with index heavyweights Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSB) and BP PLC (LON:BP.) - both down 1.1% - contributing to the fall on the back of a softer oil price.

On the futures market, Brent crude for March delivery has fallen below the US$60 a barrel market, down 70 cents (1.2%) at US$59.80.

""It's time for May's endgame,"" suggests Neil Wilson at markets.com.

""Sterling remains supported ahead of the key Brexit vote this week albeit within the broad range of the recent downtrend,"" Wilson noted.

A strong sterling is not necessarily good news for the Footsie as a large number of its constituents earn the bulk of their income overseas.

""The pound has found some bid with investors looking at a potential extension of Article 50. It's not so much the fact of the extension but the apparent coalescence of opinion around no-deal being a no-no. There are also reports that Jean Claude Juncker is readying a letter on backstop assurances - MPs are not content with assurances so it would make sense to discount this unless we see something truly radical,"" Wilson suggested.

There is not much new flow from FTSE 100 companies leaving the field open to the mid-caps.

JD Sports Fashion PLC (LON:JD.) extended early gains, rising 40p to 436.2p after its well-received Christmas trading update but Premier Oil PLC (LON:PMO) tumbled on market speculation that it is about to make a UK acquisition.

The company neither confirmed nor denied the speculation, saying it would ""continue to look at opportunities to acquire UK North Sea assets in line with the group's stated strategy"".

Specifically, the group said, no firm decision has been taken to bid for any of the assets currently being marketed by US major Chevron.

Were it to acquire large chunks of Chevron's assets it is possible that the company might have to go to the market to raise funds, which might explain why the shares were off 9.7% at 71.75p.

Premier's fall at least meant white-collar recruitment specialist PageGroup PLC (LON:PAGE) avoided the FTSE 250 wooden spoon.

Its shares were down 6.2% after the group reported a slowdown in the UK jobs market due to Brexit uncertainty.

According to Liberum Capital Markets, the fourth quarter profit of £211.1mln was 3% ahead of consensus expectations of £205.3ml.

8.35am: Weak start for Footsie

As expected, the FTSE 100 started the week in the doldrums, losing 35 points to trade at 6,883.38 in the first half hour.

Disappointing Chinese trade data pushed Asia's main markets into negative territory, which had a knock-on impact in London, which is braced for more Brexit wrangling ahead of Tuesday's crunch vote.

In the US, the government shut-down has moved into week-four with President Trump ready to declare a state of emergency.

Wall Street is also braced for earnings season, which is being viewed with trepidation given the recent and unexpected warning by Apple.

""As ever, but more so than normal, it's less about the actual earnings than the guidance and the kind of outlook the CFOs are giving on the calls,"" said Neil Wilson of Markets.com.

""In light of the Apple warning, of critical importance will be the expected impact on earnings from the trade war with China.

""That could offset any beats - three months ago the high volume of companies beating guidance wasn't enough to assuage concerns raised by the forecasts and guidance.""

In a repeat of Friday, the building stocks were well bid with Berkeley Group (LON:BKG) heading the Footsie with a 1.5% gain, followed by Taylor Wimpey (LON:TW.), which last week provided a reasonably confident assessment of prospects.

The current week sees the bulk of the quoted housebuilding sector update on trading.

Despite being one of the retail sector's festive winners, Next (LON:NXT) found itself on the 'sell' list of Credit Suisse as the London arm of the influential Swiss bank downgraded its recommendation.

JD Sports Fashion (LON:JD.) was in demand early doors after its Christmas figures more than passed muster.

The stock rose 7% early on, valuing it at £4.1bn, which puts it neck and neck with Marks & Spencer (LON:MKS).

6.30am: FTSE 100 set to drop

The FTSE 100 looks set to drop after China weighed in with worse than expected December export figures.

Clearly impacted by the trade spat with America, additional worries emanated from the fact the country also conducted less business with the rest of the world.

The major stock indices in the region were dragged lower - with the exception of Japan, which was closed for a public holiday.

In London, the index of blue-chip stocks looks likely to open 33 points lower at 6885.18, according to the spread betting firms.

More negatives than positives

Moving into the new trading week, there certainly appear to be more negatives than positives to ponder.

On this side of the Atlantic, MPs vote on Tuesday on the Brexit withdrawal bill - though this is highly unlikely to place a lid on the turmoil.

Going by weekend speculation on the matter, political chaos could ensue if the pro-remain wing of the Tory party enacts what has been described in the Sunday press as a ""very British coup"".

FTSE 100 joined the global equity sell-off on Monday to close lower as traders fret about the Chinese economy and a stronger pound weighed on the UK's premier index.

It came as the prospect of no Brexit at all came in a warning from UK Prime Minister Theresa May ahead of the crunch vote tomorrow.

Footsie closed down over 63 points at 6,855.

FTSE 250, its midcap cousin - closed even lower - off over 124 points at 18,417.

Earlier, export data showed that the value of goods shipped from China to the rest of the world fell by more than 4% last month (December) versus a year ago - the worst monthly performance for the sector in more than two years.

But for the second year in a row, in 2018, the People's Republic posted a record trade surplus with the US, with which it is locked in a trade war.

""Overnight, Beijing confirmed that imports dropped by 7.6%, and exports declined by 4.4%,"" said David Madden, market analyst at CMC Markets.

""The poor import figure underlines weak domestic demand, and that feeds into a wider viewpoint that China's economy has been cooling for a number of years.

""The drop in exports adds weight to the argument that Trump's tariffs tactics are working,"" he added.

Banks were the big gainers on Footsie, with Royal Bank of Scotland (LON:RBS) up 3.01% to 232.50p, while Lloyds Group plc (LON:LLOY) added 1.52% to 55.54p.

On Wall Street, the Dow Jones Industrial Average is down nearly 65 points and the S&P 500 is down around ten.

4pm: Footsie down 56 points

The Footsie made a half-hearted effort at a rally as it entered the last hour of trading.

The FTSE 100 was down 56 at 6,862.

The FTSE 250 was also making a comeback, trimming its loss to 185 points at 18,358.

JD Sports ended the day as the FTSE 350's best performer, rising 31p to 427.2p after a sparkling trading update covering the Christmas period.

London's leading shares remain in the doldrums, weighed down by concerns over the Chinese economy and fearful of yet another own goal on Brexit.

The FTSE 100 was down 28 at 6,890, with index heavyweights Royal Dutch Shell (LON:RDSB) and BP PLC (LON:BP.) - both down 1.1% - contributing to the fall on the back of a softer oil price.

On the futures market, Brent crude for March delivery has fallen below the US$60 a barrel market, down 70 cents (1.2%) at US$59.80.

""It's time for May's endgame,"" suggests Neil Wilson at markets.com.

""Sterling remains supported ahead of the key Brexit vote this week albeit within the broad range of the recent downtrend,"" Wilson noted.

A strong sterling is not necessarily good news for the Footsie as a large number of its constituents earn the bulk of their income overseas.

""The pound has found some bid with investors looking at a potential extension of Article 50. It's not so much the fact of the extension but the apparent coalescence of opinion around no-deal being a no-no. There are also reports that Jean Claude Juncker is readying a letter on backstop assurances - MPs are not content with assurances so it would make sense to discount this unless we see something truly radical,"" Wilson suggested.

There is not much new flow from FTSE 100 companies leaving the field open to the mid-caps.

JD Sports Fashion PLC (LON:JD.) extended early gains, rising 40p to 436.2p after its well-received Christmas trading update but Premier Oil PLC (LON:PMO) tumbled on market speculation that it is about to make a UK acquisition.

The company neither confirmed nor denied the speculation, saying it would ""continue to look at opportunities to acquire UK North Sea assets in line with the group's stated strategy"".

Specifically, the group said, no firm decision has been taken to bid for any of the assets currently being marketed by US major Chevron.

Were it to acquire large chunks of Chevron's assets it is possible that the company might have to go to the market to raise funds, which might explain why the shares were off 9.7% at 71.75p.

Premier's fall at least meant white-collar recruitment specialist PageGroup PLC (LON:PAGE) avoided the FTSE 250 wooden spoon.

Its shares were down 6.2% after the group reported a slowdown in the UK jobs market due to Brexit uncertainty.

8.35am: Weak start for Footsie

As expected, the FTSE 100 started the week in the doldrums, losing 35 points to trade at 6,883.38 in the first half hour.

Disappointing Chinese trade data pushed Asia's main markets into negative territory, which had a knock-on impact in London, which is braced for more Brexit wrangling ahead of Tuesday's crunch vote.

In the US, the government shut-down has moved into week-four with President Trump ready to declare a state of emergency.

Wall Street is also braced for earnings season, which is being viewed with trepidation given the recent and unexpected warning by Apple.

""As ever, but more so than normal, it's less about the actual earnings than the guidance and the kind of outlook the CFOs are giving on the calls,"" said Neil Wilson of Markets.com.

""In light of the Apple warning, of critical importance will be the expected impact on earnings from the trade war with China.

""That could offset any beats - three months ago the high volume of companies beating guidance wasn't enough to assuage concerns raised by the forecasts and guidance.""

In a repeat of Friday, the building stocks were well bid with Berkeley Group (LON:BKG) heading the Footsie with a 1.5% gain, followed by Taylor Wimpey (LON:TW.), which last week provided a reasonably confident assessment of prospects.

The current week sees the bulk of the quoted housebuilding sector update on trading.

Despite being one of the retail sector's festive winners, Next (LON:NXT) found itself on the 'sell' list of Credit Suisse as the London arm of the influential Swiss bank downgraded its recommendation.

JD Sports Fashion (LON:JD.) was in demand early doors after its Christmas figures more than passed muster.

The stock rose 7% early on, valuing it at £4.1bn, which puts it neck and neck with Marks & Spencer (LON:MKS).

324,650 ckom,http://www.ckom.com/rss/federal-work-at-superfund-sites-suspended-during-shutdown/,"BIRMINGHAM, Ala. -- The government shutdown has suspended federal cleanups at Superfund sites around the nation and forced the cancellation of public hearings, deepening the mistrust and resentment of surrounding residents who feel people in power long ago abandoned them to live among the toxic residue of the country's factories and mines.

""We are already hurting, and it's just adding more fuel to the fire,"" says 40-year-old Keisha Brown. Her home is in a community nestled among plants that turn coal into carbon-rich fuel and other factories on Birmingham's north side.

The mostly African-American community has been forced to cope with high levels of arsenic, lead and other contaminants in the soil that the Environmental Protection Agency has been scraping up and carting away, house by house.

As President Donald Trump and Congress battle over Trump's demand for a wall on the southern U.S. border, the 3-week-old partial government shutdown has stopped federal work on Superfund sites except for cases where the administration deems ""there is an imminent threat to the safety of human life or to the protection of property.""

EPA's shutdown plans said the agency would evaluate about 800 Superfund sites to see how many could pose an immediate threat. As an example of that kind of threat, it cited an acid leak from a mine that could threaten the public water supply. That's the hazard at Northern California's Iron Mountain mine, where EPA workers help prevent an unending flow of lethally acidic runoff off the Superfund site from spilling into rivers downstream.

Practically speaking, said Bonnie Bellow, a former EPA official who worked on Superfund public outreach at the agency, the impact of the stoppage of work at sites across the nation ""wholly depends"" on the length of the shutdown.

""Unless there is immediate risk like a storm, a flood, a week or two of slowdowns is not going to very likely affect the cleanup at the site,"" Bellow said.

In north Birmingham, Brown said it's been a couple of weeks since she's spotted any EPA crews at people's houses. It was unclear if state workers or contractors were continuing work.

But long before the shutdown began, Brown harboured doubts the cleanup was working anyway.

""My main concern is the health of the people out here,"" said Brown, who has asthma. ""All of us are sick, and we've got to function on medicine every day.""

In terms of time, the federal government shutdown is a chronological blip in the long history of the site -- which includes ethics charges in a local bribery scandal to block federal cleanup efforts -- but adds to the uncertainty in an area where residents feel forgotten and betrayed.

At the EPA, the shutdown has furloughed the bulk of the agency's roughly 14,000 employees. It also means the EPA isn't getting most of the daily stream of environmental questions and tips from the public. Routine inspections aren't happening. State, local and private emails to EPA officials often get automated messages back promising a response when the shutdown ends.

In Montana, for instance, state officials this month found themselves fielding calls from a tribal member worried about drinking water with a funny look to it, said Kristi Ponozzo, public-policy director at that state's Department of Environmental Quality. The EPA normally provides tribes with technical assistance on water supplies.

With most EPA colleagues idled, Ponozzo said, her agency also had to call off an environmental review meeting for a mining project, potentially delaying the project.

But it's the agency's work at Superfund sites -- lessening the threat from old nuclear-weapons plants, chemical factories, mines and other entities -- that gets much of the attention.

Absent imminent peril, it would be up to state governments or contractors to continue any cleanup during the shutdown ""up to the point that additional EPA direction or funding is needed,"" the EPA said in a statement.

""Sites where cleanup activities have been stopped or shut down will be secured until cleanup activities are able to commence when the federal government reopens,"" the agency said.

For federal Superfund sites in Michigan, the shutdown means there are no EPA colleagues to consult, said Scott Dean, a spokesman for that state's Department of Environmental Quality.

At Michigan Superfund sites, day-to-day field operations were continuing since private contractors do most of the on-the-ground work, Dean said.

Bellow, the former EPA official, said the cancellation of hearings about Superfund sites posed immediate concerns.

In East Chicago, Indiana, for example, the EPA called off a planned public hearing set for last Wednesday to outline how the agency planned to clean up high levels of lead and arsenic in the soil.

The EPA has proposed a seven-month, $26.5 million cleanup that includes treating and removing tainted soil from the area, where a lead smelter was located.

During a public meeting Nov. 29, some residents complained that the EPA's approach would leave too much pollution in place. Others didn't get a chance to speak and were hoping to do so at the meeting this week, said Debbie Chizewer, a Northwestern University environmental attorney who represents community groups in the low-income area.

The EPA announced the cancellation in an online notice and gave no indication that it would be rescheduled.

Leaders of the East Chicago Calumet Community Advisory Group asked for a new hearing date and an extension of a Jan. 14 public comment deadline in a letter to the EPA's regional Superfund division.

Calls by The Associated Press to the agency's regional office in Chicago this week were not answered.

Local critics fear the EPA will use the delay caused by the shutdown as justification for pushing ahead with a cleanup strategy they consider flawed, Chizewer said, even though the agency has designated the affected area as an ""environmental justice community,"" a low-income community of colour that has been disproportionately harmed by pollution.

The EPA has a ""special obligation"" when dealing with such communities, Chizewer said. ""This would be an example of shutting them out for no good reason.""

In North Birmingham, former longtime neighbourhood resident Charlie Powell said most of the people living in and around the Superfund site had already ""just got tired and fed up.""

Powell left the area but started a group called PANIC, People Against Neighborhood Industrial Contamination. He said he believes money would be better spent helping residents move away from the pollution.

""Can I say hell?"" Powell said when asked what residents have been through.

""Not much headway made today,"" Trump tweeted Saturday afternoon. ""Second meeting set for tomorrow. After so many decades, must finally and permanently fix the problems on the Southern Border!""

Before the meeting began Saturday morning, Trump took a combative tone in several Twitter messages and claimed that news coverage documenting cracks in Republican support for his hard-line position were inaccurate.

""Great support coming from all sides for Border Security (including Wall) on our very dangerous Southern Border,"" Trump tweeted. ""Teams negotiating this weekend! Washington Post and NBC reporting of events, including Fake sources, has been very inaccurate (to put it mildly)!""

A number of Republicans, including Sen. Cory Gardner (R-Colo.), who is up for reelection in 2020, have said in recent days that the government should be reopened and that a shutdown is not the ""right answer,"" worrying GOP leaders about the depth of support for Trump's position.

Trump spent much of Saturday on the phone with allies, talking through his positioning on the shutdown and hearing their reviews of his Friday news conference in the Rose Garden, according to a person close to him. Two people regularly on his call list -- Rep. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) and Sen. Lindsey O. Graham (R-S.C.) -- have encouraged Trump to hold fast and refuse to agree to reopen the government unless wall funding is secured, the person said.

""I've never seen the president as resolved on any issue as he is on this,"" Meadows said Saturday. ""But he is open to new ideas about how to end the impasse.""

Trump told reporters Friday that he wants to reopen government but is prepared to maintain the shutdown for weeks or even years. He also told congressional leaders at the White House on Friday that he preferred the term ""strike"" over ""shutdown,"" people briefed on the meeting said.

In conversations with top aides on Friday and Saturday, House Democratic leaders said Trump and GOP leaders seem eager to be seen as making progress even if the talks remained stalled, allowing Republican lawmakers back home over the weekend to reassure nervous constituents, according to two Democratic officials briefed on those discussions who were not authorized to speak publicly.

""There is the reality of what the White House is doing, which is very little, and the image they're trying to send, which is, 'Look at us, we're busy, and the vice president is rolling up his sleeves,' "" one Democratic official said. ""They're worried about defections.""

During Saturday's meeting, Democratic staffers asked the White House to lay out in formal detail the administration's funding request for the border -- including its specific security requests, what the money would be used for, and what in the Homeland Security budget the administration would cut to make the numbers work, people familiar with the meeting said.

Democrats ""emphasized that it's important for us to have an updated budget request from the White House because they have been all over the map,"" said another official briefed on the discussion. The White House plans to provide those figures before the group meets again Sunday afternoon.

Some centrist Republicans on Saturday urged Trump and congressional leaders to reopen the government, reflecting growing unease in their ranks about the prolonged shutdown and the political cost the GOP might pay.

""With Nancy Pelosi as speaker, it's going to have to be a compromise solution,"" Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick (R-Pa.), a moderate and former FBI agent who represents the Philadelphia suburbs, said in an interview. ""It's our most basic function as members of Congress to fund the government, and we need to have these battles on immigration and other issues on their own turf, separately.""

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) said in a statement Saturday that the House will begin passing separate bills to reopen the government in the coming week, starting with the funding bill that covers the Treasury Department ""so that the American people can receive their tax refunds on schedule.""

""The senseless uncertainty and chaos of the Trump Shutdown must end, now,"" Pelosi said.

Mulvaney said in an interview to air Sunday on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" that Trump would ""take a concrete wall off the table"" in negotiations with Democratic leaders if that would help end the shutdown.

""If he has to give up a concrete wall, replace it with a steel fence to do that so that Democrats can say, 'See? He's not building a wall anymore,' that should help us move in the right direction,"" Mulvaney said.

But Trump is annoyed by news reports about the negotiations that make it seem that he is backing away from his demands and wants to avoid stories about new numbers for wall funding being discussed, Trump aides said. The president instead encouraged Pence and senior aides to focus on the $5.6 billion for border security that was the focal point of legislation passed last month by House Republicans, the aides said.

Trump exasperated members of both parties with his comments Friday, but Trump spent that evening boasting to friends that he was in a strong negotiating position because he was able to capture attention and make a flurry of points that he feels his core voters appreciate, White House officials said.

On Saturday evening, Trump tweeted that he would travel to Camp David on Sunday for ""meetings on Border Security and many other topics"" with aides attending a White House staff retreat. He then followed up with a tweet of his ""Game of Thrones""-style poster saying, ""The Wall is Coming.""

Mulvaney is spearheading the Camp David gathering as a way of connecting with his new deputies and colleagues, according to officials.

The president is asking advisers about further ways to battle for wall funding in the coming days, whether it is meeting with family members of people killed by undocumented immigrants, huddling with sheriffs or visiting the border, the officials said.

As Saturday's meeting unfolded, Trump was eyeing his own options for trying to force the Democrats' hand, including declaring a national emergency to begin wall construction without congressional approval, a possible course he mentioned at his Friday news conference.

According to two confidants of Trump's, who have spoken to him in recent days but were not authorized to speak publicly, Trump is looking at how such a move would play out and has told his aides that such a drastic turn could rattle the Democrats and compel them to offer him wall funding. The legality of such a move is unclear, however, and Trump would almost certainly face immediate legal challenges in the courts.

Still, there are signs within the White House that more-comprehensive deals are at least being discussed, more likely for after the shutdown concludes and the government reopens.

Kushner, the president's son-in-law, continues to tell his allies that he thinks there could eventually be a deal for border wall funding in exchange for immigration protections for undocumented immigrants who were brought to the United States as children, according to two people who were briefed on those discussions. Another person familiar with the discussions emphasized, however, that Kushner was not pushing for a deal on Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, at this time.

Chatter about an agreement involving protections for young immigrant beneficiaries of the DACA program have risen a bit in recent days, although the administration has rejected previous wall-for-DACA deals and Democratic leadership is in no mood for one now.

After his work on a bipartisan criminal justice reform bill, Kushner is as engaged as ever with Capitol Hill, the people said. Still, Kushner's interest in brokering a possible deal on immigration has caused some anxiety among conservatives close to Trump, several of whom said Saturday they feared the president could eventually be intrigued by Kushner's position as the shutdown drags on and Trump searches for a way out."
326,santa rosa press democrat,https://www.pressdemocrat.com/news/9168944-181/sen-lindsey-graham-to-trump,"WASHINGTON -- Congress returns to Washington for its first full week of legislative business since control of the House reverted to Democrats, but lawmakers will be confronted with the same lingering question: When will the partial government shutdown end?

One Republican senator says he's offered President Donald Trump a possible solution, though it may just be wishful thinking.

Sen. Lindsey Graham is encouraging Trump to reopen government for several weeks to continue negotiating with Democrats over the border wall Trump wants to build on the U.S.-Mexico border. If there's no deal at the end of that time, Graham says Trump would be free to take the more dramatic step of declaring a national emergency to build it.

But the South Carolina Republican says Trump still wants a deal on funding for the wall before agreeing to reopen shuttered government departments. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat, insists Trump reopen the government first.

Their weeks-old standoff led to the partial government shutdown, now on day 24 without a clear end in sight.

""Before he pulls the plug on the legislative option, and I think we're almost there, I would urge him to open up the government for a short period of time, like three weeks, before he pulls the plug, see if we can get a deal,"" Graham said. ""If we can't at the end of three weeks, all bets are off.

""See if he can do it by himself through the emergency powers. That's my recommendation,"" added Graham, who has publicly pushed Trump to use his authority to declare a national emergency to build the wall. Such a step would allow Trump to bypass Congress and tap various pots of unspent federal money, including for military construction and disaster relief as well as from assets seized by law enforcement, to pay for the wall.

Trump has kept Washington on edge over whether he would resort to such a declaration, citing what he says is a ""crisis"" of drug smuggling and the trafficking of women and children at the border. The president initially sounded as though such a move was imminent, but then pulled back. He has said several times since he first mentioned the idea in public this month that he prefers a legislative solution.

A key question is how much more time is Trump willing to give lawmakers. Graham, who spoke with Trump by telephone on Sunday morning, said the legislative path ""is just about shut off"" and blamed intransigence by Pelosi.

The speaker's office had no immediate comment.

Democrats oppose an emergency declaration but may be powerless to block it. Some Republicans are wary, too, fearing how a future Democratic president might use that authority. Such a move, should Trump ultimately go that route, would almost certainly be challenged in the courts.

Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., called Graham's idea to reopen the government a ""great place to start.""

""I do think if we reopen the government, if the president ends this shutdown crisis, we have folks who can negotiate a responsible, modern investment in technology that will actually make us safer,"" Coons said.

Trump says technology is nice, but that the border can't be secured without a wall.

The White House has been laying the groundwork for an emergency declaration, which is feared by lawmakers in both parties."
327,daily republic,https://www.dailyrepublic.com/all-dr-news/wires/state-nation-world/pence-white-house-officials-meet-with-congressional-aides-in-effort-to-end-shutdown/,"WASHINGTON -- The government shutdown that has halted paychecks for hundreds of thousands of federal workers began its third week Saturday with no end in sight, as Vice President Mike Pence, top White House officials and senior congressional aides met for more than two hours without reaching a deal to reopen the government.

Inside the meeting at the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, Pence refused to budge from the more than $5 billion President Donald Trump has demanded from Congress to pay for a portion of his promised wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, according to two Democratic officials briefed on the negotiations.

The standoff - which has heavily affected national parks and other operations and threatens to halt payments as varied as food stamps and tax refunds - has made Trump's unrealized border wall the linchpin of his presidency as he seeks to make good on a signature campaign promise.

Administration officials have acknowledged that they were not prepared for the potential consequences of an extended shutdown and Trump's decision to demand wall funding. Democrats, meanwhile, are standing firm on offering no taxpayer money for the project, which Trump had long asserted would be funded by Mexico.

Pence was deputized by Trump to oversee Saturday's talks, but he did not have the president's blessing to float new or specific numbers as he did last month in a meeting with Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., according to two Trump aides who were not authorized to speak publicly. That meant few specifics were actually discussed Saturday, as Democratic staffers repeatedly pushed the administration to reopen the federal government and negotiate differences over the border after the shutdown ends.

But the administration - represented by Pence, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney and senior adviser Jared Kushner - refused, according to multiple officials.

Some centrist Republicans on Saturday urged Trump and congressional leaders to reopen the government, reflecting growing unease in their ranks about the prolonged shutdown and the political cost the GOP might pay.

""With Nancy Pelosi as speaker, it's going to have to be a compromise solution,"" Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick, R-Pa., a moderate and former FBI agent who represents the Philadelphia suburbs, said in an interview. ""It's our most basic function as members of Congress to fund the government, and we need to have these battles on immigration and other issues on their own turf, separately.""

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said in a statement Saturday that the House will begin passing separate bills to reopen the government next week, starting with the funding bill that covers the Treasury Department ""so that the American people can receive their tax refunds on schedule.""

""The senseless uncertainty and chaos of the Trump Shutdown must end, now,"" Pelosi said.

Mulvaney said in an interview to air Sunday on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" that Trump would ""take a concrete wall off the table"" in negotiations with Democratic leaders if that would help end the shutdown.

""If he has to give up a concrete wall, replace it with a steel fence to do that so that Democrats can say, 'See? He's not building a wall anymore,' that should help us move in the right direction.' "" Mulvaney said.

But Trump is annoyed by news reports about the negotiations that make it seem that he is backing away from his demands and wants to avoid stories about new numbers for wall funding being discussed, Trump aides said. The president instead encouraged Pence and senior aides to focus on the $5.6 billion for border security that was the focal point of legislation passed last month by House Republicans, the aides said.

Trump exasperated members of both parties with his comments Friday, but Trump spent that evening boasting to friends that he was in a strong negotiating position because he was able to capture attention and make a flurry of points that he feels his core voters appreciate, White House officials said.

On Saturday evening, Trump tweeted that he would travel to Camp David on Sunday for ""meetings on Border Security and other topics"" with aides attending a White House staff retreat. He then followed up with a tweet of his ""Game of Thrones""-style poster saying, ""The Wall is Coming.""

Mulvaney is spearheading the gathering as a way of connecting with his new deputies and colleagues, according to officials.

The president is asking advisers about further ways to battle for wall funding in the coming days, whether it is meeting with family members of people killed by undocumented immigrants, huddling with sheriffs or visiting the border, the officials said.

As Saturday's meeting unfolded, Trump was eyeing his own options for trying to force the Democrats' hand, including declaring a national emergency to begin wall construction without congressional approval, a possible course he mentioned at his Friday news conference.

According to two confidants of Trump's, who have spoken to him in recent days but were not authorized to speak publicly, Trump is looking at how such a move would play out and has told his aides that such a drastic turn could rattle the Democrats and compel them to offer him wall funding. The legality of such a move is unclear, however, and Trump would almost certainly face immediate legal challenges in the courts.

Still, there are signs within the White House that more-comprehensive deals are at least being discussed, more likely for after the shutdown concludes and the government reopens.

Kushner, the president's son-in-law, continues to tell his allies that he thinks there could eventually be a deal for border wall funding in exchange for immigration protections for undocumented immigrants who were brought to the United States as children, according to two people who were briefed on those discussions. Another person familiar with the discussions emphasized, however, that Kushner was not pushing for a deal on Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, at this time.

Chatter about an agreement involving protections for young immigrant beneficiaries of the DACA program have risen a bit in recent days, although the administration has rejected previous wall-for-DACA deals and Democratic leadership is in no mood for one now.

After his work on a bipartisan criminal justice reform bill, Kushner is as engaged as ever with Capitol Hill, the people said. Still, Kushner's interest in brokering a possible deal on immigration has caused some anxiety among conservatives close to Trump, several of whom said Saturday they feared the president could eventually be intrigued by Kushner's position as the shutdown drags on and Trump searches for a way out."
328,ya libnan,http://yalibnan.com/2019/01/04/newly-elected-house-speaker-pelosi-doesnt-rule-out-the-prospect-of-a-trump-impeachment/,"WASHINGTON -- Rep. Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., was elected speaker of the House on Thursday for a second time, as Democrats took control of the lower chamber.

Pelosi -- who retook the speaker's gavel after a formal floor vote that lasted about an hour -- reclaimed the House's top leadership post amid a congressional face-off with President Donald Trump over border wall funding that has left parts of the federal government shuttered for the third time in a year.

Pelosi, 78, won with 220 votes, with 12 Democrats voting for someone other than Pelosi and three Democrats voting present. As Pelosi cast a vote for herself, her granddaughter held her hand, jumped excitedly and yelled across the chamber. A number of House Democrats wore blue ""Madame Speaker"" buttons during the vote.

""Two months ago, the American people spoke, and demanded a new dawn,"" Pelosi said in remarks in the House chamber after the vote. ""They called upon the beauty of our Constitution: our system of checks and balances that protects our democracy, remembering that the legislative branch is Article I: the first branch of government, co-equal to the presidency and judiciary.""

The California Democrat -- who previously served as House speaker from 2007 until 2011, spanning the administrations of Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama, and led Democrats under the eight-year Republican majority in the House that followed -- secured enough support to win the leadership post late last year, despite a brief insurrection among a small group of Democrats.

The new Democratic Caucus chairman, Rep. Hakeem Jeffries of New York, formally nominated Pelosi on the House floor to rousing applause."

(AP Photo/Kimberly Chandler)

BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) _ The government shutdown has suspended federal cleanups at Superfund sites around the nation and forced the cancellation of public hearings, deepening the mistrust and resentment of surrounding residents who feel people in power long ago abandoned them to live among the toxic residue of the country's factories and mines.

""We are already hurting, and it's just adding more fuel to the fire,"" says 40-year-old Keisha Brown. Her home is in a community nestled among plants that turn coal into carbon-rich fuel and other factories on Birmingham's north side.

The mostly African-American community has been forced to cope with high levels of arsenic, lead and other contaminants in the soil that the Environmental Protection Agency has been scraping up and carting away, house by house.

As President Donald Trump and Congress battle over Trump's demand for a wall on the southern U.S. border, the 3-week-old partial government shutdown has stopped federal work on Superfund sites except for cases where the administration deems ""there is an imminent threat to the safety of human life or to the protection of property.""

EPA's shutdown plans said the agency would evaluate about 800 Superfund sites to see how many could pose an immediate threat. As an example of that kind of threat, it cited an acid leak from a mine that could threaten the public water supply. That's the hazard at Northern California's Iron Mountain mine, where EPA workers help prevent an unending flow of lethally acidic runoff off the Superfund site from spilling into rivers downstream.

Practically speaking, said Bonnie Bellow, a former EPA official who worked on Superfund public outreach at the agency, the impact of the stoppage of work at sites across the nation ""wholly depends"" on the length of the shutdown.

""Unless there is immediate risk like a storm, a flood, a week or two of slowdowns is not going to very likely affect the cleanup at the site,"" Bellow said.

In north Birmingham, Brown said it's been a couple of weeks since she's spotted any EPA crews at people's houses. It was unclear if state workers or contractors were continuing work.

But long before the shutdown began, Brown harbored doubts the cleanup was working anyway.

""My main concern is the health of the people out here,"" said Brown, who has asthma. ""All of us are sick, and we've got to function on medicine every day.""

In terms of time, the federal government shutdown is a chronological blip in the long history of the site _ which includes ethics charges in a local bribery scandal to block federal cleanup efforts _ but adds to the uncertainty in an area where residents feel forgotten and betrayed.

At the EPA, the shutdown has furloughed the bulk of the agency's roughly 14,000 employees. It also means the EPA isn't getting most of the daily stream of environmental questions and tips from the public. Routine inspections aren't happening. State, local and private emails to EPA officials often get automated messages back promising a response when the shutdown ends.

In Montana, for instance, state officials this month found themselves fielding calls from a tribal member worried about drinking water with a funny look to it, said Kristi Ponozzo, public-policy director at that state's Department of Environmental Quality. The EPA normally provides tribes with technical assistance on water supplies.

With most EPA colleagues idled, Ponozzo said, her agency also had to call off an environmental review meeting for a mining project, potentially delaying the project.

But it's the agency's work at Superfund sites _ lessening the threat from old nuclear-weapons plants, chemical factories, mines and other entities _ that gets much of the attention.

Absent imminent peril, it would be up to state governments or contractors to continue any cleanup during the shutdown ""up to the point that additional EPA direction or funding is needed,"" the EPA said in a statement.

""Sites where cleanup activities have been stopped or shut down will be secured until cleanup activities are able to commence when the federal government reopens,"" the agency said.

For federal Superfund sites in Michigan, the shutdown means there are no EPA colleagues to consult, said Scott Dean, a spokesman for that state's Department of Environmental Quality.

At Michigan Superfund sites, day-to-day field operations were continuing since private contractors do most of the on-the-ground work, Dean said.

Bellow, the former EPA official, said the cancellation of hearings about Superfund sites posed immediate concerns.

In East Chicago, Indiana, for example, the EPA called off a planned public hearing set for last Wednesday to outline how the agency planned to clean up high levels of lead and arsenic in the soil.

The EPA has proposed a seven-month, $26.5 million cleanup that includes treating and removing tainted soil from the area, where a lead smelter was located.

During a public meeting Nov. 29, some residents complained that the EPA's approach would leave too much pollution in place. Others didn't get a chance to speak and were hoping to do so at the meeting this week, said Debbie Chizewer, a Northwestern University environmental attorney who represents community groups in the low-income area.

The EPA announced the cancellation in an online notice and gave no indication that it would be rescheduled.

Leaders of the East Chicago Calumet Community Advisory Group asked for a new hearing date and an extension of a Jan. 14 public comment deadline in a letter to the EPA's regional Superfund division.

Calls by The Associated Press to the agency's regional office in Chicago this week were not answered.

Local critics fear the EPA will use the delay caused by the shutdown as justification for pushing ahead with a cleanup strategy they consider flawed, Chizewer said, even though the agency has designated the affected area as an ""environmental justice community,"" a low-income community of color that has been disproportionately harmed by pollution.

The EPA has a ""special obligation"" when dealing with such communities, Chizewer said. ""This would be an example of shutting them out for no good reason.""

In North Birmingham, former longtime neighborhood resident Charlie Powell said most of the people living in and around the Superfund site had already ""just got tired and fed up.""

Powell left the area but started a group called PANIC, People Against Neighborhood Industrial Contamination. He said he believes money would be better spent helping residents move away from the pollution.

""Can I say hell?"" Powell said when asked what residents have been through.

330,the fiscal times,http://www.thefiscaltimes.com/2018/12/23/How-Long-Will-Shutdown-Mess-Last,"There was no deal. There is no deal. And there isn't likely to be a deal anytime soon.

Large portions of the federal government shut down early Saturday and are likely to remain closed until at least Thursday after President Trump earlier scuttled a bipartisan short-term spending bill and insisted on additional money to build a wall -- or fence-like structure of some sort -- along the border with Mexico.

A late scramble by White House and congressional negotiators Friday evening failed to break the impasse over the president's demand for $5 billion in wall funding, and there were no signs of significant progress on Saturday, even as Vice President Mike Pence returned to the Capitol for talks with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY). As a result, nine of 15 Cabinet-level departments and dozens of agencies will be closed well into next week, and possibly much longer, after their funding expired Friday at midnight. It is the third government shutdown of the year.

On Saturday, Trump delayed plans for a 16-day trip to his Mar-A-Lago resort in Florida. He had lunch at the White House with a group of conservative lawmakers, many of whom reportedly pushed Trump to continue fighting for border wall funding.

The House and Senate opened at noon Saturday, but both chambers quickly adjourned for the weekend without any votes. Many lawmakers left the capital Friday night to return home, having been assured that they would get 24 hours notice before any vote to reopen to government (though if a deal does come together, it could be put up for a voice vote that wouldn't require senators to return to Capitol Hill). Senate Chaplain Barry Black, in his Saturday morning prayer, reportedly asked that the Senate be saved ""from the pitfalls of partisan brinkmanship."" That prayer is unlikely to be answered for days, or even weeks.

One senior Republican aide told Politico that there may be no significant movement until after Christmas. Another told the site that if negotiators don't reach a quick compromise over the weekend, the shutdown is likely to drag on until January, when Democrats take control of the House. Trump tweeted Saturday: ""We are negotiating with the Democrats on desperately needed Border Security ... but it could be a long stay.""

Trump also continues to make it more difficult to reach a deal by refusing to specify or signal what kind of compromise he would accept. Lawmakers are reticent to support any compromise without assurances that the president will sign off on it.

As the standoff continues, most Americans likely won't notice any immediate effects of the shutdown, especially given the upcoming holiday, but some 800,000 of the 2.1 million federal workers nationwide will be affected, with 420,000 ""essential"" employees, including Border Patrol agents and Transportation Security Administration officials, required to work without pay and another 380,000 forced to take unpaid leave until a deal is reached. The next paycheck for furloughed federal workers isn't due to be processed until January 11, a Republican source told Politico -- timing that lessens the urgency of reaching a deal. A number of other federal agencies, including the military, won't be affected by the shutdown because Congress already passed bills funding them through September.

For more on the effects of the partial shutdown, see our piece from Friday.

Here's what you need to know as the shutdown fight continues:

Trump probably can't win this fight: The president's best hope may be to ratchet up pressure on Democrats and try to pin the blame for the shutdown on them, as he has over the past couple of days. The House vote Thursday night passing $5.7 billion in wall funding helps a bit in that regard by positioning Senate Democrats as blocking a measure that would have kept the government open. But Trump's comment last week that he'd be ""proud"" to shut down the government over border security makes it nearly impossible to lay blame elsewhere.

Democrats have little incentive to give in: Democrats will take control of the House when a new Congress convenes on January 3, and they plan to pass legislation to re-open the government and provide $1.3 billion in border security funding as one of their first acts, giving them additional leverage in the current battle. ""President Trump, you will not get your wall,"" Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) said Friday. ""You're not getting your wall today, next week or on Jan. 3 when Democrats take control of the House.""

And Trump is likely to get the public blame: A recent Quinnipiac University poll showed that 51 percent of voters would primarily blame Trump and congressional Republicans in Congress for the shutdown, while 37 percent would blame congressional Democrats more. And Quinnipiac polling also finds that most Americans still oppose Trump's wall.

But winning may not be the point: Even if the shutdown won't result in money for a wall, Trump's willingness to push for one was about pleasing his conservative base, especially after he faced withering criticism from Fox News and right-wing firebrands Ann Coulter and Rush Limbaugh when, earlier in the week, he signaled he'd sign off on a bipartisan stopgap measure to keep the government open without funding a wall. ""Trump's advisers acknowledged that the funding may not be secured in the end but boasted that the spectacle would be remembered favorably by his base voters as proof of his mettle,"" The Washington Post reported Thursday. And the Post's editorial board added: ""Any doubt that it is politics -- not principle -- driving Mr. Trump was erased when he flip-flopped this week on the stopgap spending bill."" That's bound to affect his standing with moderate voters, but this standoff may not matter much to them by 2020. Trump also has other, more immediate concerns: As The New York Times Editorial Board noted, ""revving up the wall fight allows Mr. Trump to divert attention from so much of the other drama threatening to swallow him up.""

Trump may be undermining his support among congressional Republicans: Combined with the president's sudden decisions to withdraw American troops from Syria and Afghanistan, and the resignation of Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, the shutdown over border wall funding has some Republican lawmakers angry or nervous about the path of the Trump presidency -- and its impact on their own political prospects. ""By placating the far right on immigration, embracing his instincts on foreign policy and unnerving investors with his trade wars and policy gyrations, Mr. Trump is elevating the nativist and noninterventionist elements of his party,"" The New York Times reported. ""In doing so, he is deeply straining his most important links to mainstream Republican governance, and the national security hawks and conservative business executives who have long been pillars of the right.""

And the shutdown may heighten Wall Street's fears: While the partial shutdown isn't likely to cause a sizable economic hit -- credit rating analysts at Standard & Poor's estimate that it could trim $1.2 billion a week from U.S. gross domestic product, according to the Times -- it once again raises concerns about the country's dysfunctional governance. ""The shutdown could also contribute to the growing sense of worry on Wall Street, in part by raising fears about the ability of Congress to manage a more consequential deadline: the need to authorize an increase in government borrowing before the federal debt reaches the current limit, most likely in March,"" the Times' Alan Rappeport and Binyamin Appelbaum noted."
331,scroll.in,https://scroll.in/latest/907504/us-donald-trump-threatens-to-close-mexico-border-entirely-if-funding-for-wall-is-not-secured,"The president said he considered closing the southern border with Mexico a 'profit-making operation'.

United States President Donald Trump on Friday threatened to close the southern border with Mexico ""entirely"" if Democrats did not agree to his demand for funds to build a wall.

""We will be forced to close the Southern Border entirely if the Obstructionist Democrats do not give us the money to finish the Wall [and] also change the ridiculous immigration laws that our country is saddled with,"" the president said in a tweet. ""Hard to believe there was a Congress [and] President who would approve!""

Trump's warning comes as the partial government shutdown is likely to drag into the new year after legislators failed to reach a deal over Trump's demand for a wall on the Mexico border. The government shut down on December 22.

In a series of tweets, Trump said that closing the southern border will impact trade and people living on the border and he considered it a ""profit making operation"". ""Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador are doing nothing for the United States but taking our money,"" he said. ""Word is that a new Caravan is forming in Honduras and they are doing nothing about it. We will be cutting off all aid to these 3 countries - taking advantage of US for years!""

Incoming acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney said Trump was is threatening to shut down the border because ""it's the only way we can get the Democrats' attention"", reported ABC News.

The Democrats have refused to provide $5.7 billion for the border wall, even as Trump insisted that the shutdown will continue till funding is secured for the wall, a promise made during his campaign days that he has pushed since assuming office. Around 8 lakh employees of the government have been affected due to the shutdown."

333,sott.net,https://www.sott.net/article/403258-Vet-raises-5M-in-3-days-on-GoFundMe-for-border-wall,"A supporter of President Trump's border wall proposal has started a GoFundMe to help pay for the project - and the fund skyrocketed to more than $2 million Wednesday night after being live for just three days.

Brian Kolfage, a Trump voter and disabled Iraq War veteran with no connection to the administration, wrote that he set up the page because ""President Trump's main campaign promise was to BUILD THE WALL. And as he's followed through on just about every promise so far, this wall project needs to be completed still.""

Trump campaigned on building a ""great wall"" on the southern border during the 2016 presidential election.

As the end of Trump's second year in office comes to a close, his administration has not built the wall or secured funds for it - and a budget proposal passed Wednesday by the Senate did not fulfill Trump's call to provide funds for it.

Kolfage wrote on his fundraising page that if every Trump voter donates $80 to his wall-building campaign, they will raise the $5 billion that Trump says is needed to build the border wall.

""Even if we get half, that's half the wall. We can do this,"" Kolfage wrote on the GoFundMe page.

As of Wednesday night, the campaign had raised nearly $2 million, with large and small donations pouring in nearly every minute.

Kolfage assured donors that he has contacted the Trump administration and every penny of their donations would go to funding the ""Trump wall.""

""We have many very high level contacts already helping,"" he wrote."
334,scroll.in,https://scroll.in/latest/907079/us-government-shutdown-will-not-end-till-border-wall-funding-is-secured-says-donald-trump,"Trump reiterated his claim that he had approved 185 km of a new section of the wall bordering Mexico.

United States President Donald Trump on Tuesday said the government will not reopen until funding is secured for a wall he had promised along the US-Mexico border, CNN reported.

""I can't tell you when the government is going to be open,"" Trump said in the Oval Office on Christmas Day. ""I can tell you it's not going to be open until we have a wall, a fence, whatever they would like to call it.""

The federal government had shut down partially early on Saturday after Congress and the White House failed to agree on a spending bill that included Trump's demands for $5.7 billion for a wall along the Mexico border.

When asked about the thousands of government employees working without pay or sent on forced leave during the shutdown, the president said workers want the construction of a wall along the US-Mexico border. ""I think they understand what's happening,"" CBS News quoted Trump as saying. ""They want border security. The people of this country want border security. The only ones who don't are Democrats.""

He also reiterated that he had approved 185 km of a border wall, which he first announced on Twitter earlier on Tuesday. ""It's going to be built, hopefully rapidly,"" he said. ""I'm going there at the end of January for the start of construction...We're almost having a groundbreaking, it's such a big section. It's probably the biggest section we'll get out."" The White House has not yet provided further information on this new section of the wall.

He also accused the Democrats of not supporting his demand for funds for a border wall because he had focussed on it during his presidential campaign and pushed for it in the White House."
335,saukvalley.com,http://www.saukvalley.com/2019/01/13/senator-urging-trump-to-reopen-government/ax2vxt9/,"But that may be wishful thinking, given that Sen. Lindsey Graham also says Trump still wants to reach a deal for the wall before agreeing to reopen shuttered government departments. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a leading Democratic negotiator, insists that Trump reopen the government first.

The weeks-old standoff over funding led to the partial government shutdown that hit day 23 on Sunday without an end in sight.

""Before he pulls the plug on the legislative option, and I think we're almost there, I would urge him to open up the government for a short period of time, like 3 weeks, before he pulls the plug, see if we can get a deal,"" Graham, a South Carolina Republican said. ""If we can't at the end of 3 weeks, all bets are off.""

""See if he can do it by himself through the emergency powers. That's my recommendation,"" added Graham, who has publicly pushed Trump to use his authority to declare a national emergency to build the wall. Such a step would allow Trump to bypass Congress and tap various pots of unspent federal money, including for military construction and disaster relief and from asset seized by law enforcement, to pay for the wall.

Trump has kept Washington on edge over whether he would resort to such a declaration, citing what he says is a ""crisis"" of drug smuggling and the trafficking of women and children at the border. The president initially sounded as though such a move was imminent, but then pulled back. He has said several times since he first mentioned the idea in public earlier this month that he prefers to try to reach a deal with Congress.

A key question is how much more time is Trump willing to give lawmakers. Graham, who said he and Trump talked by telephone on Sunday morning, said the legislative path ""is just about shut off"" and blamed Pelosi.

The speaker's office had no immediate comment.

Democrats oppose an emergency declaration but may be powerless to block it. Some Republicans are wary, too, fearing how a future Democratic president might use that authority. Such a move, should Trump ultimately go that route, would almost certainly be challenged in the courts.

Sen. Chris Coons, D-Delaware, called Graham's idea to reopen the government a ""great place to start.""

""I do think if we reopen the government, if the president ends this shutdown crisis, we have folks who can negotiate a responsible, modern investment in technology that will actually make us safer,"" Coons said.

Trump has maintained that the border cannot be secured without a wall.

Graham said he thinks Trump is willing to accept the $5.7 billion he has insisted on for the wall, along with some immigration measures Democrats might find acceptable, such as helping immigrants who were illegally brought to the U.S. as children.

Trump has expressed interest in a broader immigration overhaul, but says he first wants the Supreme Court to address the class of immigrants known as ""Dreamers."" Pelosi also has shown no interest in accepting a wall - she has called it an ""immorality"" - in exchange for immigration fixes.

And, Trump, who was holed up in the White House as snow blanketed Washington on Sunday, appeared to shoot down Graham's suggestion of a ""wall plus"" deal, saying on Twitter that even Democrats don't want to make ""Dreamers"" part of the negotiations.

""The damage done to our Country from a badly broken Border - Drugs, Crime and so much that is bad - is far greater than a Shutdown, which the Dems can easily fix as soon as they come back to Washington!"" Trump said in a separate tweet.

The White House has been laying the groundwork for an emergency declaration, feared by members of both parties.

Senate Homeland Security Committee Chairman Ron Johnson, R-Wisconsin, said he would ""hate to see"" a declaration because then the wall wouldn't get built, presumably because of legal challenges. Democrats voted in the past for border security and should again, he said.

""I actually want to see this wall get built,"" Johnson said. ""I want to keep pressure on Democrats to actually come to the negotiating table in good faith and fund what they have supported in the past.""

But Graham, who favors a presidential declaration, said the time for talk is running out.

""It's the last option, not the first option, but we're pretty close to that being the only option,"" he said.

Graham and Coons spoke on ""Fox News Sunday."" Johnson appeared on CNN's ""State of the Union.""

336,scoop,http://www.scoop.co.nz/stories/HL1901/S00012/gordon-campbell-on-the-reactionary-politics-of-fear.htm,"Fear has become such a routine part of the political toolkit that it hardly gets noticed anymore, for what it is. For 15 years or so for instance, the prospect of the Greens being in government was portrayed as a sure path to ruin - those crazy Greens! And yet here we are a year on, and New Zealand seems to have come through relatively unscathed from this first experience of the Greens holding down major ministerial portfolios. At this rate, voters may even start to query the One True Faith that only the National Party knows how to run a modern economy...

What do you call a situation where the state tries to create panic among its own people for party political gain? As practiced by Theresa May and her faction of the Conservative Party, this has become a well-honed form of state terrorism. Currently, British politics are being driven so thoroughly by the fear principle that you have to wonder whether this can really be the same nation that pluckily survived The Blitz. Fear of migrants gave us Brexit. Since then, ending the free flow of people has been the one red line that May has refused to surrender, no matter what harm this does to the hopes and opportunities of generations of Britain's youth, the majority of whom embrace Europe without the fear and loathing being displayed by their parents. Similarly, only young fogeys and old Tories fear Jeremy Corbyn, the British right's current boogey man.

Essentially, Corbyn has been cast in the same scary role in which May's predecessor David Cameron had cast Corbyn's own predecessor Ed Milliband, just before the 2015 election:

Britain faces a simple and inescapable choice - stability and strong Government with me, or chaos with Ed Miliband

So it goes. Certainly, May has been working overtime at weaving Corbyn into the fear scenarios she's been peddling in the run- up to the parliamentary Brexit vote on January 14. If you believe May (the same politician who once claimed that a 'no deal' Brexit was preferable to a 'bad deal' Brexit) pressure now needs to be brought on every MP in Westminster to vote for her wretched Brexit deal next week lest (a) a dreaded 'no deal' eventuate which would (b) cause catastrophic chaos across Britain and (c) render a dreaded second Brexit vote more likely and perhaps even (d) trigger a general election that would hand power to Corbyn and his slavering socialist hordes.

Meaning: if the Tories want to stay in power, they need to thoroughly terrify the British public about every single alternative to May's terrible, no good, very bad deal. Over Christmas and New Year, the fear machine was working overtime to that end, pumping out any number of "" no deal"" nightmare scenarios. The ministerial planning for which - eg hiring a ferry company with no ferries that seems to have copied its contractual terms and conditions from a pizza delivery service - has been less than stellar.

Corbyn, With Care

To his credit, Corbyn has (so far) refused to be baited into making Labour the media story in the run up to the parliamentary vote, which is due on either January 14 or 15. In his recent statements on Brexit, Corbyn has adroitly kept the focus on what May can and should be doing, not on what Labour might do, or should do, sometime in future. The time for Labour to show its hand will come later, after May has finally run out of options. A controversial statement on Brexit by Corbyn at this point would be the answer to May's prayers. What we do know is that if Corbyn backed May and her deal in the mid January parliamentary vote, Labour would be finished. The young who have flocked to Corbyn would desert him in droves.

[The poll] indicates Labour's share of the vote would slump another eight points - from 34 per cent to 26 per cent - if its MPs join with the Tories to support the prime minister's Brexit deal. This would be even worse than the 28 per cent share secured by Labour under Michael Foot, when the party slumped to defeat against Margaret Thatcher's Tories in 1983.

Despite his own personal animosity to the EU as a neo-liberal project, Corbyn is smart enough to see that it would be politically suicidal to endorse or enable May's Brexit deal. The reality is that Brexit in the form that was promised to the British public at the 2016 referendum, has proved to be undeliverable. Over the next fortnight in particular, Corbyn will need to ignore his less patient critics inside Labour, and ensure that it is Theresa May and her wretched government who wears the consequences.

Footnote : For any party in Opposition it is a tactical necessity to avoid being painted as the feared alternative that stampedes the public back into the arms of a government that has consistently failed them. In 2014, New Zealand held an election fought almost entirely on the fear of a divided Opposition, rather than on any meaningful scrutiny of the government's (lack of) achievements. Well, after nine years of absentee government, we finally have a government willing to do its job. This is not something to be afraid of, no matter how timidly our business sector chooses to react to the very thought of change.

Footnote Two: Across the Atlantic, the entire Trump political project has been based on the tactics of fear and division. Over the past week Trump has suggested (a) that the current shutdown of the US government over funding for his border wall could extend for months or years and (b) that he might declare the funding for the wall comprises a 'national emergency' such that he can order it funded and built by presidential decree.

Actually, no. He really can't do that, as the New York Times usefully pointed out last week. For the past 150 years, US law has severely constrained presidential emergency powers, and generally forbidden the use of the military to achieve the agendas of civilian politicians.

Ultimately, any White House aides - or military personnel - could be committing a federal crime punishable by two years in jail if they obeyed or assisted any presidential order to get that border wall built. That's assuming any such presidential order wasn't immediately struck down by the courts. Meanwhile, the government shutdown rolls on. As a friend recently pointed out on Twitter, how did we get from ""Mexico will pay for the wall"" to "" We will refuse to pay US government employees until the US public pays for the wall....""

As President Donald Trump is said to be mulling ""other options"" for funding his border wall between the U.S. and Mexico, according to the Associated Press, a dark horse arises on the internet.

A GoFundMe campaign popped up Sunday, hoping to raise funds for Trump's proposed wall between the U.S. and Mexico, which isn't news in and of itself. There are plenty of those around.

But the organizers of this campaign are so encouraged that they've raised more-than $700,000 in just three days that they've bumped their original goal of $200 million up to a cool billion.

The GoFundMe organizer is listed as triple-amputee Air Force veteran Brian Kolfage, who lost both legs and his right arm in a blast at Balad Air Force Base in Iraq in 2004, according to the Arizona Daily Star. The fundraiser is titled, ""We the people will fund the wall.""

The contact listing for the organizer says ""The Wall Funding Team"" is located in Miramar, Fla.

""As a veteran who has given so much, 3 limbs, I feel deeply invested to this nation to ensure future generations have everything we have today,"" Kolfage wrote in the GoFundMe campaign description. ""Too many Americans have been murdered by illegal aliens and too many illegals are taking advantage of the United States taxpayers with no means of ever contributing to our society.

""I have grandparents who immigrated to America legally, they did it the correct way and it's time we uphold our laws, and get this wall BUILT! It's up to Americans to help out and pitch in to get this project rolling.""

Multiple studies and reports have shown, though, that illegal immigrants commit crime, violent or nonviolent, at lesser rates than do native-born Americans.

Kolfage's GoFundMe campaign was listed as the ""Top fundraiser"" on the front page of the crowd-sourced social fundraising website as of Wednesday afternoon, despite Kolfage's claims that the platform was trying to hide his fundraiser from potential donors.

Kolfage's Facebook page, where he posts content relevant to his conservative political beliefs, has more than 90,000 followers.

""We have contacted the Trump Administration to secure a point of contact where all funds will go upon completion,"" the campaign says. ""When get this information secured we will update. We have many very high level contacts already helping."""
338,boise weekly,https://www.boiseweekly.com/boise/could-the-government-shutdown-harm-boise-breweries/Content?oid=16528620,"The headlines about the ongoing government shutdown, precipitated by a disagreement between Congress and the Trump administration over funding for a wall at the U.S.-Mexico border, are dire: ""Shutdown Leaves Food, Medicine and Pay in Doubt in Indian Country"" (The New York Times), ""The government shutdown and overflowing toilets force Joshua Tree to close"" (CNN).

The shutdown has restricted access to public spaces, yanked the drawstrings on healthcare for Native Americans and kept essential government employees at work without pay, but there's another, smaller way it will affect Americans generally (and local brewers specifically): It has slammed on the brakes at the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau, which approves beer and wine labels for beverages crossing state lines, and approves labels for new breweries.

On Dec. 21, the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau (TTB for short) announced on its website that it had suspended processing applications for new labels for alcoholic beverages, writing it had delayed ""all non-excepted TTB operations, and no personnel will be available to respond to any inquiries, including emails, telephone calls, facsimiles or other communications."" According to Food & Wine, that could mean breweries' releases of new beers will be delayed, as well.

There are scores of breweries big and small in Idaho, and if the shutdown is prolonged, it will likely have a dramatic impact on larger operations that send their beers to neighboring states. For now, the closure of TTB will chiefly affect new, smaller breweries.

""The current state of a government shutdown should not have a significant impact on operating Idaho breweries. However, breweries in planning are affected if they are still waiting for their federal licensing,"" wrote Sheila Francis, executive director of Idaho Brewers United, in an email (emphasis her own).

One of those planned breweries is Bench House Brewing Company, which secured a conditional use permit in December and expects to have a lease by the end of January. Relatively new and with a modest projected operating size, Bench House has a pedigree: Its head brewer, Derek Brown, has brewed at Laughing Dog and Woodland Empire. But getting a taste of Brown's craft beers may be delayed if the shutdown continues to hinder the permitting process through TTB.

""It hasn't affected us yet,"" wrote Bench House Marketing Manager Christy Brown in a direct message over social media. ""It definitely will once we get our lease because it'll take longer for us to get our permits."""
339,the state,https://www.thestate.com/news/business/national-business/article223342450.html,"Excerpts from recent editorials in the United States and abroad:

The New York Times on a judge's rebuke of Michael Flynn and President Donald Trump's charitable foundation:

A bit of common sense and common decency intruded on Tuesday into the crazy world of Donald Trump.

In New York, the state attorney general announced that the president had agreed that the ""charity"" he used as a piggy bank has no reason to exist.

In Washington, a federal judge let a former top presidential aide know that you can parrot political spin or you can tell the truth, but you can't do both to someone who can send you to prison.

Michael Flynn, Mr. Trump's former national security adviser, appeared before Judge Emmet Sullivan to be sentenced to what he expected would be a term of probation, after pleading guilty to lying to federal investigators about conversations with the Russian ambassador. The office of the special counsel, Robert Mueller, had earlier filed a memo that said it would be right for Mr. Flynn to avoid prison after his extensive cooperation in the investigation of Trump ties to Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential campaign and after.

Then last week, in a memo about their client's sentencing, Mr. Flynn's lawyers implied that he had been tricked into lying and that the F.B.I. acted improperly in interviewing him -- points raised by pro-Trump commentators elaborating on the president's claims of being victimized by a witch hunt.

Judge Sullivan was having none of it.

""I cannot recall an instance of a court ever accepting a guilty plea from someone who did not maintain he was guilty,"" Judge Sullivan said, ""and I do not intend to start today.""

Chastened, Mr. Flynn told the judge that nobody tricked him, that he lied and that he knew he shouldn't have.

The judge was not upset only about Mr. Flynn's sneaky prevarication. He said he felt ""disgust"" at Mr. Flynn's offenses, that a retired three-star general would lie to the F.B.I. ""while on the physical premises of the White House,"" and, acting as an unregistered agent of a foreign country, Turkey, while he was an adviser to Mr. Trump (to which he admitted but was not charged). It was a bracing reminder of the brazenness of his misdeeds and of the standards the public should be able to expect of those who serve them.

Realizing that Judge Sullivan was considering a term of up to six months in prison, Mr. Flynn accepted his offer to delay the sentencing for 90 days until he has completed his cooperation with the special counsel.

""Good luck today in court to General Michael Flynn,"" Mr. Trump had tweeted first thing Tuesday morning.

""Thanks for nothing, Mr. President,"" Mr. Flynn might have thought as he left court.

Mr. Flynn should be grateful the judge offered him the chance to come clean. By contrast, the Donald J. Trump Foundation, a charity that provided no charity, quite properly received none from the New York attorney general's office.

Attorney General Barbara Underwood accused it of ""a shocking pattern of illegality"" that ""amounted to the Trump Foundation functioning as little more than a checkbook to serve Mr. Trump's business and political interests.""

Whatever money that remains will be disbursed under the supervision of Ms. Underwood's office and the judge overseeing the continuing lawsuit her office filed in June, seeking $2.8 million in restitution and a ban on Mr. Trump and his three oldest children serving on the boards of other nonprofit organizations.

In a series of stories exposing the foundation's true nature, The Washington Post found that its largest donation was to fix a fountain in front of the Plaza Hotel in Manhattan, which Mr. Trump owned at the time, that its funds were used to buy a portrait of Mr. Trump, and that it illegally provided political donations and paid for personal legal settlements.

All this comes just days after prosecutors announced that they believed that Mr. Trump had conspired with the owner of The National Enquirer and his fixer Michael Cohen to violate campaign finance laws by paying hush money to two women who said they had affairs with him. It's also just been reported that prosecutors are investigating spending by the Trump inaugural committee. The president still faces lawsuits on the constitutionality of his enriching himself while in office. Meanwhile, the special counsel's inquiry may be expanding rather than winding down.

It's fitting that despite all his bluster and threats, a president who's demonstrated such contempt for the rule of law is finding it so formidable.

That this goes to the essence of American governance was best summed up by Paula Duncan, the Trump enthusiast who was among the jurors who found Mr. Trump's former campaign chief Paul Manafort guilty of fraud, even though she had hoped he wouldn't be convicted.

Explaining her decision after the verdict, she told Fox News, ""No one's above the law.""

The Wall Street Journal on a judge's ruling on the Affordable Care Act's individual mandate:

No one opposes ObamaCare more than we do, and Democrats are now confirming that it was designed as a way-station to government-run health care. But a federal judge's ruling that the law is unconstitutional is likely to be overturned on appeal and may boomerang politically on Republicans.

Judge Reed O'Connor ruled for some 20 state plaintiffs that the Affordable Care Act's individual mandate is no longer legal because Republicans repealed its financial penalty as part of the 2017 tax reform. Recall that Chief Justice John Roberts joined four Justices to say ObamaCare's mandate was illegal as a command to individuals to buy insurance under the Commerce Clause. ""The Framers gave Congress the power to regulate commerce, not to compel it,"" he wrote.

Yet the Chief famously salvaged ObamaCare by unilaterally rewriting the mandate to be a ""tax"" that was within Congress's power. Never mind that Democrats had expressly said the penalty was not a tax. Majority Leader Roberts declared it to be so.

Enter Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, who argues in Texas v. U.S. that since Congress has repealed the mandate, the tax is no longer a tax, and ObamaCare is thus illegal. Judge O'Connor agreed with that logic, and he went further in ruling that since Congress said the mandate is crucial to the structure of ObamaCare, then all of ObamaCare must fall along with the mandate.

We'll admit to a certain satisfaction in seeing the Chief Justice hoist on his own logic. But his ruling in NFIB v. Sebelius was in 2012 and there is more at issue legally now than the ""tax"" issue in that opinion. One legal complication is that Congress in 2017 repealed the financial part of the individual mandate, not the structure of the mandate itself. Republicans used budget rules to pass tax reform so they couldn't repeal the mandate's express language.

The Affordable Care Act has also been up and running since 2014, which means so-called reliance interests come into play when considering a precedent. Millions of people now rely on ObamaCare's subsidies and rules, which argues against judges repealing the law by fiat.

Judge O'Connor breezes past this like a liberal Ninth Circuit appeals judge handling a Donald Trump appeal. He's right that Democrats claimed the individual mandate was essential to the Affordable Care Act. But when Congress killed the financial penalty in 2017 it left the rest of ObamaCare intact. When judging congressional intent, a judge must account for the amending Congress as well as the original Congress.

In any case, the Supreme Court's ""severability"" doctrine calls for restraint in declaring an entire law illegal merely because one part of it is. Our guess is that even the right-leaning Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals judges will overturn Judge O'Connor on this point.

As for the politics, Democrats claim to be alarmed by the ruling but the truth is they're elated. They want to use it to further pound Republicans for denying health insurance for pre-existing conditions if the law is overturned. Democrats campaigned across the country against Mr. Paxton's lawsuit to gain House and Senate seats in November, and they will now press votes in Congress so they can compound the gains in 2020.

President Trump hailed the ruling in a tweet, but he has never understood the Affordable Care Act. His Administration has done good work revising regulations to reduce health-care costs and increase access, but the risk is that the lawsuit will cause Republicans in Congress to panic politically and strike a deal with Democrats that reinforces ObamaCare. This is what happens when conservatives fall into the liberal trap of thinking they can use the courts to achieve policy goals that need to be won in Congress.

The Washington Post on withdrawing all 2,000 U.S. troops out of Syria:

PRESIDENT TRUMP'S sudden move to yank U.S. troops out of Syria undermined at a stroke several foreign policy goals he has championed. The president promised to finish the job of destroying the Islamic State, but the withdrawal will leave thousands of its fighters still in place. He vowed to roll back Iran's aggression across the Middle East, but his decision will allow its forces to entrench in the country that is the keystone of Tehran's ambitions. He promised to protect Israel, but that nation will now be left to face alone the buildup by Iran and its proxies along its northern border.

The president's top national security advisers had carefully developed and articulated a strategy of maintaining a U.S. presence in Syria until the Islamic State was beyond revival and Iran withdrew its forces -- a plan they were defending up until this week. Mr. Trump has again demonstrated, to them and to the world, that no U.S. policy or foreign commitment is immune from his whims.

Mr. Trump claimed the Islamic State had been defeated, but that is not the view of the Defense and State Departments. Thousands of jihadist fighters are still in Syria and control splotches of territory in the Euphrates Valley. A U.S. withdrawal will give the extremists an opportunity to reconstitute, as they did in Iraq following the premature U.S. withdrawal ordered by President Barack Obama.

Until Wednesday, a prime talking point of senior national security officials was that, ""if we've learned one thing over the years, (the) enduring defeat of a group like this means you can't just defeat their physical space and then leave,"" as the State Department's special envoy for the global campaign against the Islamic State, Brett McGurk, put it last week. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said it another way in September: ""Getting rid of the caliphate doesn't mean you then blindly say, 'Okay, we got rid of it,' march out, and then wonder why the caliphate comes back.""

Mr. Trump has justified some of his most controversial decisions, including his continued support for Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, as needed to contain Iran's threat to the United States and its allies. But the Syrian withdrawal hands Tehran and its ally Russia a windfall. Iran has deployed thousands of fighters and allied militiamen to Syria and aspires to create a corridor to Lebanon and the Mediterranean, as well as a new front against Israel along the Golan Heights. In reaction to that threat, Mr. Trump's national security adviser, John Bolton, announced Sept. 24 that ""We're not going to leave (Syria) as long as Iranian troops are outside Iranian borders, and that includes Iranian proxies and militias.""

U.S. ambitions in Syria have never been backed by adequate resources, and a case could be made that neither Congress nor the American public were prepared to support the mission suggested by Mr. Bolton. But Mr. Trump's decision appears to have been precipitated by the bellicose rhetoric of Turkey's Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who last week threatened -- not for the first time -- a military operation against Syrian Kurds, even though U.S. troops are positioned around them. The autocratic Turkish ruler appears to have extracted multiple favors from Mr. Trump in recent days, including the sale of U.S. Patriot missiles and a promise to reexamine the possible extradition of his rival, Fethullah Gulen, from Pennsylvania. If Mr. Trump received anything in return, he hasn't disclosed it.

The Syrian Kurdish forces, which have fought alongside the United States and played a crucial role in liberating most of eastern Syria from the jihadists, will be perhaps the foremost victims of Mr. Trump's decision. Betrayed by Washington, they will now be subject to a military offensive by Turkey. The stab in the back will send an unforgettable message to all who are asked to cooperate with the United States in the fight against terrorism: Washington is an unreliable and dangerous partner.

The Orange County (California) Register on Mick Mulvaney as Trump's choice for chief of staff:

President Trump has found a new chief of staff, albeit an interim one, in his director of the Office of Management and Budget, Mick Mulvaney.

That of chief is a terribly important post, perhaps government's most consequential aside from that of his boss. In theory, at least, the chief of staff is the gatekeeper for everything the president does, everyone he sees, everyone he talks to on the phone.

Perhaps, though few would expect this to be the case, the arbiter of every time he sends out a tweet, and of what it should say.

A Washington insider, a former congressman, Mulvaney is in many ways ideal for the job. He wants it, badly, whereas others with similarly impressive resumes touted for the job have indicated a strong desire to spend more time with their families, from Vice President Pence's staff chief Nick Ayers of Georgia to former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie.

Mulvaney shares the conservative values currently espoused by the president and was a founder of the House Freedom Caucus in 2013, the group that always taunted the Republican leadership, opposing much government funding, including debt limit increases and budget agreements made with the Democrats.

But he also, after Trump secured the Republican nomination in 2016, called the candidate ""a terrible human being"" who he only was voting for out of an even greater dislike of Hillary Clinton.

It's not as if other presidential allies of today haven't said bad things about him in the past. On the campaign trail, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz called his rival ""a narcissist at a level I don't think this country's ever seen,"" for instance.

But if you were the nation's chief executive -- or the CEO of a much smaller entity, for that matter -- could you hire as your top aide and work with a person who had once dubbed you ""terrible""?

Or does this kind of talk come with the territory in politics, where many strange bedfellows are made because of having to run in elections against once and perhaps future allies? Should Trump indeed elevate this practical choice for staff chief to permanent status immediately?

Los Angeles Times on banning bump stocks, which allow semi-automatic weapons to fire like machine guns:

The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives said Tuesday that it had finalized a rule reclassifying so-called bump stocks -- the devices that can make a semiautomatic rifle fire nearly as quickly a fully automatic weapon -- as machine guns, which makes it illegal to manufacture, sell or possess them. The agency said a year ago it had the authority to reclassify the devices, and President Trump -- in the wake of the Parkland, Fla., school shooting -- directed the ATF to speed up the process. Tuesday's announcement -- a rare bit of welcome news from the Trump administration -- makes it official; White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters that owners of the conversion devices will have until March 21 to destroy them or turn them in to the ATF.

This is a good step. Unfortunately, it's all but certain to be challenged in the courts, and it's on shaky legal ground because of the way the new rule evolved. The Obama administration determined that because bump stocks have ""no automatically functioning mechanical parts and (perform) no automated mechanical functions when installed,"" they did not fit the definition of a machine gun in federal law, which meant the ATF lacked the authority to regulate them. Tuesday's announcement, by contrast, hinges not on the technical specifications, but on the functionality. In essence, if it fires like a machine gun, it's a machine gun. Cue the lawyers.

We hope the administration prevails in whatever challenges emerge, but the sure-fire way to resolve this would be for Congress to legislate bump stocks and related gadgets out of existence. Such devices serve no function other than to evade the strict congressional limit on machine guns by, as the ATF said, harnessing ""the recoil energy of the semiautomatic firearm in a manner that allows the trigger to reset and continue firing"" without the shooter having to pull the trigger for each shot.

A mass shooter in Las Vegas used bump stocks affixed to semiautomatic rifles to fire more than 1,000 rounds in a matter of minutes from a 32nd-floor suite of the Mandalay Bay Hotel into a crowd of some 20,000 people, killing 58 concertgoers and injuring hundreds of others. It was the largest single mass shooting in the modern era, drawing attention to bump stocks and sparking outraged demands by many -- the Los Angeles Times included -- that the devices be banned.

As welcome as this new rule is, it will do little to corral our national problem with gun violence. The vast majority of gun deaths come in ones and twos, led by suicides. ...

But it is progress. And the president deserves credit for sticking with his promise to find a way to ban bump stocks. ...

China Daily says telecommunications giant Huawei is a victim of U.S. panic attacks:

This year has not been an annus mirabilis for China's Huawei Technologies Ltd, the world's largest supplier of telecommunications network equipment and second-biggest maker of smartphones.

Although it has been constantly in the news and it is said there is no such thing as bad publicity, it has been making headlines because of the spurious claims it somehow poses a threat to the West, even world peace. It has never been explained exactly how.

In fact it is not because of anything it has done, but because its success has brought it into the crosshairs of the United States' anxiety attacks against China.

Huawei is at the forefront of 5G technology. This latest generation mobile network technology promises to bring the much anticipated and heralded internet of things to life and the US is determined to be the 5G leader.

Not only because whichever country develops the technology that is adopted as standard will have a huge commercial advantage. But also because by setting the standard it will have a knowledge advantage.

As a result, first the US and then one after another its most obedient allies have blocked Huawei from entering their 5G markets on security grounds.

None of them have offered any specific justification for blocking Huawei. They just repeat their claim that the company poses a security risk. That is why objective observers have concluded that those countries are politicizing a commercial issue.

It sets a harmful precedent. What if other countries used the same excuse to block US companies (not confined to the telecom sector)? The US companies are very competitive in many fields, including those that could pose huge security risks, such as finance.

While Huawei will not go unscathed from being prevented from entering key markets, as a competitive player, it still has a vast market to access in other parts of the world. It has signed contracts to supply 5G equipment to 25 telecom carriers, and more than 10,000 5G base stations have been shipped.

In stark contrast to the US and its allies, India for instance, has invited Huawei to conduct 5G trials in the country and complimented it on the role it has played in helping to develop its telecom industry.

The efforts of the US and its allies to try to shield their companies against a Chinese competitor are politically motivated, not the result of a fact-based or transparent decision-making process. And they are counterproductive to the concerted efforts that are needed to ensure the security of 5G networks."
340,the bulletin,http://www.norwichbulletin.com/news/20190109/latest-trump-says-he-thinks-deal-getting-closer?rssfeed=true,"WASHINGTON -- The Latest on President Donald Trump and the partial government shutdown (all times local):

12:40 p.m.

President Donald Trump says he thinks he and the Democrats are ""getting closer"" to a deal to end the budget stalemate that has partially shut down the government despite no evidence that any progress has been made.

And he's suggesting the partial government shutdown could be ""a blessing in disguise"" because, he suggests, it could lead to a broader immigration deal.

Trump spoke Wednesday during an Oval Office bill signing on anti-human trafficking legislation. It's a day after he delivered a prime-time address trying to make the case for his long-stalled U.S.-Mexico border wall.

Trump says that he would like to see ""real immigration reform in this country because we need it."" He says ""Everybody wants to see immigration reform,"" adding that perhaps the stalemate ""will turn out to be a blessing in disguise.""

Democrats have blamed Trump for the shutdown.

12:35 p.m.

Gone are the days when the U.S. and Mexican governments regularly exchanged statements over President Donald Trump's insistence on a border wall.

Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said Wednesday he won't be drawn into what he calls a U.S. internal dispute, an apparent reference to the 19-day-old partial U.S. government shutdown over a border barrier.

Lopez Obrador says, ""We are not going to respond to situations arising from internal affairs in the United States.""

Unlike his predecessor, the Mexican leader didn't have to respond to any specific aspersion about Mexico, because Trump didn't make any in his Tuesday night address to the American public. Relations between the two leaders have been surprisingly cordial, given their ideological differences.

Lopez Obrador said, ""Of course, there are those ... who want us to get into a confrontation. We always want a friendly relationship with the United States, a cooperative relationship.""

As a presidential candidate Trump promised Mexico would pay for a border wall, but Mexico refused.

12:25 p.m.

President Donald Trump is using a bill signing focused on curbing human trafficking to push his case for a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border.

Trump says a southern border that is not secured exacerbates the incidents of human trafficking. He says, ""As long as we have a border that is not secure, we're going to suffer the consequences of that.""

Wednesday's bill signing came a day after Trump's prime-time speech designed to persuade Americans that illegal immigration and trafficking at the border are a crisis.

Democrats have called Trump's promised wall costly, ineffective and ""immoral"" and say he's ""manufacturing a crisis.""

The bill Trump signed is designed to enhance an annual State Department report that measures global efforts to eliminate human trafficking.

The White House says it's the fourth bipartisan bill the Republican president has signed in the last few weeks to prevent human trafficking.

11:30 a.m.

Congressional Democrats say they'll head to the White House with the plan to reopen the government -- the same one they've been presenting. They're asking President Donald Trump to accept a bipartisan bill to fund border security without the wall.

Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Wednesday the president ""could end the Trump shutdown and re-open the government today, and he should.""

Pelosi and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer spoke at an event where they were flanked by federal workers going without pay during the shutdown, now in its 19th day.

Schumer called workers the ""collateral damage"" of Trump's ""temper tantrum."" He said the president failed to ""persuade a soul"" during his ""divisive"" prime-time address Tuesday night to the nation.

Trump meets with congressional leaders at the White House Wednesday afternoon. He rejected the Senate's bipartisan funding bill in December, sparking the shutdown.

__

10 a.m.

The White House is trying to keep jittery congressional Republicans from defecting over the toll the partial government shutdown is taking in their states.

President Donald Trump and Democrats have been at an impasse over funding for his proposed border wall, which has led to a partial government shutdown, now in its 19th day.

Trump meets with Senate Republicans Wednesday on Capitol Hill just hours after he argued on national television that a border wall was needed to resolve a security and humanitarian ""crisis.""

Senators say the shutdown has led to disruptions in agricultural payments for farmers, as well as for home buyers trying to secure government-backed home loans. Lawmakers also are worried about missed paychecks for government workers Friday.

As many as half a dozen GOP senators have said the government should reopen while border security negotiations with Democrats continue.

__

1:25 a.m.

President Donald Trump again linked illegal immigration along the southern border with drugs and violent crime as he urged Democratic lawmakers to fund his proposed border wall.

In his first national address from the Oval Office, the president gave no indication he was softening his stance that the partial government shutdown would continue without money for the wall.

Trump argued Tuesday night that the wall was needed to resolve what he called a security and humanitarian ""crisis.""

He addressed the nation as the shutdown stretched through its third week, with hundreds of thousands of federal workers going without pay and some congressional Republicans growing increasingly jittery about the impasse.

Trump plans to visit Senate Republicans at the Capitol on Wednesday before meeting with Democratic leaders at the White House."

The New York Times on a judge's rebuke of Michael Flynn and President Donald Trump's charitable foundation:

A bit of common sense and common decency intruded on Tuesday into the crazy world of Donald Trump.

In New York, the state attorney general announced that the president had agreed that the ""charity"" he used as a piggy bank has no reason to exist.

In Washington, a federal judge let a former top presidential aide know that you can parrot political spin or you can tell the truth, but you can't do both to someone who can send you to prison.

Michael Flynn, Mr. Trump's former national security adviser, appeared before Judge Emmet Sullivan to be sentenced to what he expected would be a term of probation, after pleading guilty to lying to federal investigators about conversations with the Russian ambassador. The office of the special counsel, Robert Mueller, had earlier filed a memo that said it would be right for Mr. Flynn to avoid prison after his extensive cooperation in the investigation of Trump ties to Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential campaign and after.

Then last week, in a memo about their client's sentencing, Mr. Flynn's lawyers implied that he had been tricked into lying and that the F.B.I. acted improperly in interviewing him -- points raised by pro-Trump commentators elaborating on the president's claims of being victimized by a witch hunt.

Judge Sullivan was having none of it.

""I cannot recall an instance of a court ever accepting a guilty plea from someone who did not maintain he was guilty,"" Judge Sullivan said, ""and I do not intend to start today.""

Chastened, Mr. Flynn told the judge that nobody tricked him, that he lied and that he knew he shouldn't have.

The judge was not upset only about Mr. Flynn's sneaky prevarication. He said he felt ""disgust"" at Mr. Flynn's offenses, that a retired three-star general would lie to the F.B.I. ""while on the physical premises of the White House,"" and, acting as an unregistered agent of a foreign country, Turkey, while he was an adviser to Mr. Trump (to which he admitted but was not charged). It was a bracing reminder of the brazenness of his misdeeds and of the standards the public should be able to expect of those who serve them.

Realizing that Judge Sullivan was considering a term of up to six months in prison, Mr. Flynn accepted his offer to delay the sentencing for 90 days until he has completed his cooperation with the special counsel.

""Good luck today in court to General Michael Flynn,"" Mr. Trump had tweeted first thing Tuesday morning.

""Thanks for nothing, Mr. President,"" Mr. Flynn might have thought as he left court.

Mr. Flynn should be grateful the judge offered him the chance to come clean. By contrast, the Donald J. Trump Foundation, a charity that provided no charity, quite properly received none from the New York attorney general's office.

Attorney General Barbara Underwood accused it of ""a shocking pattern of illegality"" that ""amounted to the Trump Foundation functioning as little more than a checkbook to serve Mr. Trump's business and political interests.""

Whatever money that remains will be disbursed under the supervision of Ms. Underwood's office and the judge overseeing the continuing lawsuit her office filed in June, seeking $2.8 million in restitution and a ban on Mr. Trump and his three oldest children serving on the boards of other nonprofit organizations.

In a series of stories exposing the foundation's true nature, The Washington Post found that its largest donation was to fix a fountain in front of the Plaza Hotel in Manhattan, which Mr. Trump owned at the time, that its funds were used to buy a portrait of Mr. Trump, and that it illegally provided political donations and paid for personal legal settlements.

All this comes just days after prosecutors announced that they believed that Mr. Trump had conspired with the owner of The National Enquirer and his fixer Michael Cohen to violate campaign finance laws by paying hush money to two women who said they had affairs with him. It's also just been reported that prosecutors are investigating spending by the Trump inaugural committee. The president still faces lawsuits on the constitutionality of his enriching himself while in office. Meanwhile, the special counsel's inquiry may be expanding rather than winding down.

It's fitting that despite all his bluster and threats, a president who's demonstrated such contempt for the rule of law is finding it so formidable.

That this goes to the essence of American governance was best summed up by Paula Duncan, the Trump enthusiast who was among the jurors who found Mr. Trump's former campaign chief Paul Manafort guilty of fraud, even though she had hoped he wouldn't be convicted.

Explaining her decision after the verdict, she told Fox News, ""No one's above the law.""

The Wall Street Journal on a judge's ruling on the Affordable Care Act's individual mandate:

No one opposes ObamaCare more than we do, and Democrats are now confirming that it was designed as a way-station to government-run health care. But a federal judge's ruling that the law is unconstitutional is likely to be overturned on appeal and may boomerang politically on Republicans.

Judge Reed O'Connor ruled for some 20 state plaintiffs that the Affordable Care Act's individual mandate is no longer legal because Republicans repealed its financial penalty as part of the 2017 tax reform. Recall that Chief Justice John Roberts joined four Justices to say ObamaCare's mandate was illegal as a command to individuals to buy insurance under the Commerce Clause. ""The Framers gave Congress the power to regulate commerce, not to compel it,"" he wrote.

Yet the Chief famously salvaged ObamaCare by unilaterally rewriting the mandate to be a ""tax"" that was within Congress's power. Never mind that Democrats had expressly said the penalty was not a tax. Majority Leader Roberts declared it to be so.

Enter Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, who argues in Texas v. U.S. that since Congress has repealed the mandate, the tax is no longer a tax, and ObamaCare is thus illegal. Judge O'Connor agreed with that logic, and he went further in ruling that since Congress said the mandate is crucial to the structure of ObamaCare, then all of ObamaCare must fall along with the mandate.

We'll admit to a certain satisfaction in seeing the Chief Justice hoist on his own logic. But his ruling in NFIB v. Sebelius was in 2012 and there is more at issue legally now than the ""tax"" issue in that opinion. One legal complication is that Congress in 2017 repealed the financial part of the individual mandate, not the structure of the mandate itself. Republicans used budget rules to pass tax reform so they couldn't repeal the mandate's express language.

The Affordable Care Act has also been up and running since 2014, which means so-called reliance interests come into play when considering a precedent. Millions of people now rely on ObamaCare's subsidies and rules, which argues against judges repealing the law by fiat.

Judge O'Connor breezes past this like a liberal Ninth Circuit appeals judge handling a Donald Trump appeal. He's right that Democrats claimed the individual mandate was essential to the Affordable Care Act. But when Congress killed the financial penalty in 2017 it left the rest of ObamaCare intact. When judging congressional intent, a judge must account for the amending Congress as well as the original Congress.

In any case, the Supreme Court's ""severability"" doctrine calls for restraint in declaring an entire law illegal merely because one part of it is. Our guess is that even the right-leaning Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals judges will overturn Judge O'Connor on this point.

As for the politics, Democrats claim to be alarmed by the ruling but the truth is they're elated. They want to use it to further pound Republicans for denying health insurance for pre-existing conditions if the law is overturned. Democrats campaigned across the country against Mr. Paxton's lawsuit to gain House and Senate seats in November, and they will now press votes in Congress so they can compound the gains in 2020.

President Trump hailed the ruling in a tweet, but he has never understood the Affordable Care Act. His Administration has done good work revising regulations to reduce health-care costs and increase access, but the risk is that the lawsuit will cause Republicans in Congress to panic politically and strike a deal with Democrats that reinforces ObamaCare. This is what happens when conservatives fall into the liberal trap of thinking they can use the courts to achieve policy goals that need to be won in Congress.

The Washington Post on withdrawing all 2,000 U.S. troops out of Syria:

PRESIDENT TRUMP'S sudden move to yank U.S. troops out of Syria undermined at a stroke several foreign policy goals he has championed. The president promised to finish the job of destroying the Islamic State, but the withdrawal will leave thousands of its fighters still in place. He vowed to roll back Iran's aggression across the Middle East, but his decision will allow its forces to entrench in the country that is the keystone of Tehran's ambitions. He promised to protect Israel, but that nation will now be left to face alone the buildup by Iran and its proxies along its northern border.

The president's top national security advisers had carefully developed and articulated a strategy of maintaining a U.S. presence in Syria until the Islamic State was beyond revival and Iran withdrew its forces -- a plan they were defending up until this week. Mr. Trump has again demonstrated, to them and to the world, that no U.S. policy or foreign commitment is immune from his whims.

Mr. Trump claimed the Islamic State had been defeated, but that is not the view of the Defense and State Departments. Thousands of jihadist fighters are still in Syria and control splotches of territory in the Euphrates Valley. A U.S. withdrawal will give the extremists an opportunity to reconstitute, as they did in Iraq following the premature U.S. withdrawal ordered by President Barack Obama.

Until Wednesday, a prime talking point of senior national security officials was that, ""if we've learned one thing over the years, (the) enduring defeat of a group like this means you can't just defeat their physical space and then leave,"" as the State Department's special envoy for the global campaign against the Islamic State, Brett McGurk, put it last week. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said it another way in September: ""Getting rid of the caliphate doesn't mean you then blindly say, 'Okay, we got rid of it,' march out, and then wonder why the caliphate comes back.""

Mr. Trump has justified some of his most controversial decisions, including his continued support for Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, as needed to contain Iran's threat to the United States and its allies. But the Syrian withdrawal hands Tehran and its ally Russia a windfall. Iran has deployed thousands of fighters and allied militiamen to Syria and aspires to create a corridor to Lebanon and the Mediterranean, as well as a new front against Israel along the Golan Heights. In reaction to that threat, Mr. Trump's national security adviser, John Bolton, announced Sept. 24 that ""We're not going to leave (Syria) as long as Iranian troops are outside Iranian borders, and that includes Iranian proxies and militias.""

U.S. ambitions in Syria have never been backed by adequate resources, and a case could be made that neither Congress nor the American public were prepared to support the mission suggested by Mr. Bolton. But Mr. Trump's decision appears to have been precipitated by the bellicose rhetoric of Turkey's Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who last week threatened -- not for the first time -- a military operation against Syrian Kurds, even though U.S. troops are positioned around them. The autocratic Turkish ruler appears to have extracted multiple favors from Mr. Trump in recent days, including the sale of U.S. Patriot missiles and a promise to reexamine the possible extradition of his rival, Fethullah Gulen, from Pennsylvania. If Mr. Trump received anything in return, he hasn't disclosed it.

The Syrian Kurdish forces, which have fought alongside the United States and played a crucial role in liberating most of eastern Syria from the jihadists, will be perhaps the foremost victims of Mr. Trump's decision. Betrayed by Washington, they will now be subject to a military offensive by Turkey. The stab in the back will send an unforgettable message to all who are asked to cooperate with the United States in the fight against terrorism: Washington is an unreliable and dangerous partner.

The Orange County (California) Register on Mick Mulvaney as Trump's choice for chief of staff:

President Trump has found a new chief of staff, albeit an interim one, in his director of the Office of Management and Budget, Mick Mulvaney.

That of chief is a terribly important post, perhaps government's most consequential aside from that of his boss. In theory, at least, the chief of staff is the gatekeeper for everything the president does, everyone he sees, everyone he talks to on the phone.

Perhaps, though few would expect this to be the case, the arbiter of every time he sends out a tweet, and of what it should say.

A Washington insider, a former congressman, Mulvaney is in many ways ideal for the job. He wants it, badly, whereas others with similarly impressive resumes touted for the job have indicated a strong desire to spend more time with their families, from Vice President Pence's staff chief Nick Ayers of Georgia to former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie.

Mulvaney shares the conservative values currently espoused by the president and was a founder of the House Freedom Caucus in 2013, the group that always taunted the Republican leadership, opposing much government funding, including debt limit increases and budget agreements made with the Democrats.

But he also, after Trump secured the Republican nomination in 2016, called the candidate ""a terrible human being"" who he only was voting for out of an even greater dislike of Hillary Clinton.

It's not as if other presidential allies of today haven't said bad things about him in the past. On the campaign trail, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz called his rival ""a narcissist at a level I don't think this country's ever seen,"" for instance.

But if you were the nation's chief executive -- or the CEO of a much smaller entity, for that matter -- could you hire as your top aide and work with a person who had once dubbed you ""terrible""?

Or does this kind of talk come with the territory in politics, where many strange bedfellows are made because of having to run in elections against once and perhaps future allies? Should Trump indeed elevate this practical choice for staff chief to permanent status immediately?

Los Angeles Times on banning bump stocks, which allow semi-automatic weapons to fire like machine guns:

The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives said Tuesday that it had finalized a rule reclassifying so-called bump stocks -- the devices that can make a semiautomatic rifle fire nearly as quickly a fully automatic weapon -- as machine guns, which makes it illegal to manufacture, sell or possess them. The agency said a year ago it had the authority to reclassify the devices, and President Trump -- in the wake of the Parkland, Fla., school shooting -- directed the ATF to speed up the process. Tuesday's announcement -- a rare bit of welcome news from the Trump administration -- makes it official; White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters that owners of the conversion devices will have until March 21 to destroy them or turn them in to the ATF.

This is a good step. Unfortunately, it's all but certain to be challenged in the courts, and it's on shaky legal ground because of the way the new rule evolved. The Obama administration determined that because bump stocks have ""no automatically functioning mechanical parts and (perform) no automated mechanical functions when installed,"" they did not fit the definition of a machine gun in federal law, which meant the ATF lacked the authority to regulate them. Tuesday's announcement, by contrast, hinges not on the technical specifications, but on the functionality. In essence, if it fires like a machine gun, it's a machine gun. Cue the lawyers.

We hope the administration prevails in whatever challenges emerge, but the sure-fire way to resolve this would be for Congress to legislate bump stocks and related gadgets out of existence. Such devices serve no function other than to evade the strict congressional limit on machine guns by, as the ATF said, harnessing ""the recoil energy of the semiautomatic firearm in a manner that allows the trigger to reset and continue firing"" without the shooter having to pull the trigger for each shot.

A mass shooter in Las Vegas used bump stocks affixed to semiautomatic rifles to fire more than 1,000 rounds in a matter of minutes from a 32nd-floor suite of the Mandalay Bay Hotel into a crowd of some 20,000 people, killing 58 concertgoers and injuring hundreds of others. It was the largest single mass shooting in the modern era, drawing attention to bump stocks and sparking outraged demands by many -- the Los Angeles Times included -- that the devices be banned.

As welcome as this new rule is, it will do little to corral our national problem with gun violence. The vast majority of gun deaths come in ones and twos, led by suicides. ...

But it is progress. And the president deserves credit for sticking with his promise to find a way to ban bump stocks. ...

China Daily says telecommunications giant Huawei is a victim of U.S. panic attacks:

This year has not been an annus mirabilis for China's Huawei Technologies Ltd, the world's largest supplier of telecommunications network equipment and second-biggest maker of smartphones.

Although it has been constantly in the news and it is said there is no such thing as bad publicity, it has been making headlines because of the spurious claims it somehow poses a threat to the West, even world peace. It has never been explained exactly how.

In fact it is not because of anything it has done, but because its success has brought it into the crosshairs of the United States' anxiety attacks against China.

Huawei is at the forefront of 5G technology. This latest generation mobile network technology promises to bring the much anticipated and heralded internet of things to life and the US is determined to be the 5G leader.

Not only because whichever country develops the technology that is adopted as standard will have a huge commercial advantage. But also because by setting the standard it will have a knowledge advantage.

As a result, first the US and then one after another its most obedient allies have blocked Huawei from entering their 5G markets on security grounds.

None of them have offered any specific justification for blocking Huawei. They just repeat their claim that the company poses a security risk. That is why objective observers have concluded that those countries are politicizing a commercial issue.

It sets a harmful precedent. What if other countries used the same excuse to block US companies (not confined to the telecom sector)? The US companies are very competitive in many fields, including those that could pose huge security risks, such as finance.

While Huawei will not go unscathed from being prevented from entering key markets, as a competitive player, it still has a vast market to access in other parts of the world. It has signed contracts to supply 5G equipment to 25 telecom carriers, and more than 10,000 5G base stations have been shipped.

In stark contrast to the US and its allies, India for instance, has invited Huawei to conduct 5G trials in the country and complimented it on the role it has played in helping to develop its telecom industry.

The efforts of the US and its allies to try to shield their companies against a Chinese competitor are politically motivated, not the result of a fact-based or transparent decision-making process. And they are counterproductive to the concerted efforts that are needed to ensure the security of 5G networks."

President Trump has found a new chief of staff, albeit an interim one, in his director of the Office of Management and Budget, Mick Mulvaney.

That of chief is a terribly important post, perhaps government's most consequential aside from that of his boss. In theory, at least, the chief of staff is the gatekeeper for everything the president does, everyone he sees, everyone he talks to on the phone.

Perhaps, though few would expect this to be the case, the arbiter of every time he sends out a tweet, and of what it should say.

A Washington insider, a former congressman, Mulvaney is in many ways ideal for the job. He wants it, badly, whereas others with similarly impressive resumes touted for the job have indicated a strong desire to spend more time with their families, from Vice President Pence's staff chief Nick Ayers of Georgia to former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie.

Mulvaney shares the conservative values currently espoused by the president and was a founder of the House Freedom Caucus in 2013, the group that always taunted the Republican leadership, opposing much government funding, including debt limit increases and budget agreements made with the Democrats.

But he also, after Trump secured the Republican nomination in 2016, called the candidate ""a terrible human being"" who he only was voting for out of an even greater dislike of Hillary Clinton.

It's not as if other presidential allies of today haven't said bad things about him in the past. On the campaign trail, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz called his rival ""a narcissist at a level I don't think this country's ever seen,"" for instance.

But if you were the nation's chief executive -- or the CEO of a much smaller entity, for that matter -- could you hire as your top aide and work with a person who had once dubbed you ""terrible""?

Or does this kind of talk come with the territory in politics, where many strange bedfellows are made because of having to run in elections against once and perhaps future allies? Should Trump indeed elevate this practical choice for staff chief to permanent status immediately?

Los Angeles Times on banning bump stocks, which allow semi-automatic weapons to fire like machine guns:

The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives said Tuesday that it had finalized a rule reclassifying so-called bump stocks -- the devices that can make a semiautomatic rifle fire nearly as quickly a fully automatic weapon -- as machine guns, which makes it illegal to manufacture, sell or possess them. The agency said a year ago it had the authority to reclassify the devices, and President Trump -- in the wake of the Parkland, Fla., school shooting -- directed the ATF to speed up the process. Tuesday's announcement -- a rare bit of welcome news from the Trump administration -- makes it official; White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters that owners of the conversion devices will have until March 21 to destroy them or turn them in to the ATF.

This is a good step. Unfortunately, it's all but certain to be challenged in the courts, and it's on shaky legal ground because of the way the new rule evolved. The Obama administration determined that because bump stocks have ""no automatically functioning mechanical parts and (perform) no automated mechanical functions when installed,"" they did not fit the definition of a machine gun in federal law, which meant the ATF lacked the authority to regulate them. Tuesday's announcement, by contrast, hinges not on the technical specifications, but on the functionality. In essence, if it fires like a machine gun, it's a machine gun. Cue the lawyers.

We hope the administration prevails in whatever challenges emerge, but the sure-fire way to resolve this would be for Congress to legislate bump stocks and related gadgets out of existence. Such devices serve no function other than to evade the strict congressional limit on machine guns by, as the ATF said, harnessing ""the recoil energy of the semiautomatic firearm in a manner that allows the trigger to reset and continue firing"" without the shooter having to pull the trigger for each shot.

A mass shooter in Las Vegas used bump stocks affixed to semiautomatic rifles to fire more than 1,000 rounds in a matter of minutes from a 32nd-floor suite of the Mandalay Bay Hotel into a crowd of some 20,000 people, killing 58 concertgoers and injuring hundreds of others. It was the largest single mass shooting in the modern era, drawing attention to bump stocks and sparking outraged demands by many -- the Los Angeles Times included -- that the devices be banned.

As welcome as this new rule is, it will do little to corral our national problem with gun violence. The vast majority of gun deaths come in ones and twos, led by suicides. ...

But it is progress. And the president deserves credit for sticking with his promise to find a way to ban bump stocks. ...

China Daily says telecommunications giant Huawei is a victim of U.S. panic attacks:

This year has not been an annus mirabilis for China's Huawei Technologies Ltd, the world's largest supplier of telecommunications network equipment and second-biggest maker of smartphones.

Although it has been constantly in the news and it is said there is no such thing as bad publicity, it has been making headlines because of the spurious claims it somehow poses a threat to the West, even world peace. It has never been explained exactly how.

In fact it is not because of anything it has done, but because its success has brought it into the crosshairs of the United States' anxiety attacks against China.

Huawei is at the forefront of 5G technology. This latest generation mobile network technology promises to bring the much anticipated and heralded internet of things to life and the US is determined to be the 5G leader.

Not only because whichever country develops the technology that is adopted as standard will have a huge commercial advantage. But also because by setting the standard it will have a knowledge advantage.

As a result, first the US and then one after another its most obedient allies have blocked Huawei from entering their 5G markets on security grounds.

None of them have offered any specific justification for blocking Huawei. They just repeat their claim that the company poses a security risk. That is why objective observers have concluded that those countries are politicizing a commercial issue.

It sets a harmful precedent. What if other countries used the same excuse to block US companies (not confined to the telecom sector)? The US companies are very competitive in many fields, including those that could pose huge security risks, such as finance.

While Huawei will not go unscathed from being prevented from entering key markets, as a competitive player, it still has a vast market to access in other parts of the world. It has signed contracts to supply 5G equipment to 25 telecom carriers, and more than 10,000 5G base stations have been shipped.

In stark contrast to the US and its allies, India for instance, has invited Huawei to conduct 5G trials in the country and complimented it on the role it has played in helping to develop its telecom industry.

The efforts of the US and its allies to try to shield their companies against a Chinese competitor are politically motivated, not the result of a fact-based or transparent decision-making process. And they are counterproductive to the concerted efforts that are needed to ensure the security of 5G networks."
343,the state,https://www.thestate.com/news/politics-government/national-politics/article224499960.html,"Congress returns to Washington for its first full week of legislative business since control of the House reverted to Democrats, but lawmakers will be confronted with the same lingering question: When will the partial government shutdown end?

One Republican senator says he's offered President Donald Trump a possible solution, though it may just be wishful thinking.

Sen. Lindsey Graham is encouraging Trump to reopen government for several weeks to continue negotiating with Democrats over the border wall Trump wants to build on the U.S.-Mexico border. If there's no deal at the end of that time, Graham says Trump would be free to take the more dramatic step of declaring a national emergency to build it.

But the South Carolina Republican says Trump still wants a deal on funding for the wall before agreeing to reopen shuttered government departments. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat, insists Trump reopen the government first.

Their weeks-old standoff led to the partial government shutdown, now on day 24 without a clear end in sight.

""Before he pulls the plug on the legislative option, and I think we're almost there, I would urge him to open up the government for a short period of time, like three weeks, before he pulls the plug, see if we can get a deal,"" Graham said. ""If we can't at the end of three weeks, all bets are off.

""See if he can do it by himself through the emergency powers. That's my recommendation,"" added Graham, who has publicly pushed Trump to use his authority to declare a national emergency to build the wall. Such a step would allow Trump to bypass Congress and tap various pots of unspent federal money, including for military construction and disaster relief as well as from assets seized by law enforcement, to pay for the wall.

Trump has kept Washington on edge over whether he would resort to such a declaration, citing what he says is a ""crisis"" of drug smuggling and the trafficking of women and children at the border. The president initially sounded as though such a move was imminent, but then pulled back. He has said several times since he first mentioned the idea in public this month that he prefers a legislative solution.

A key question is how much more time is Trump willing to give lawmakers. Graham, who spoke with Trump by telephone on Sunday morning, said the legislative path ""is just about shut off"" and blamed intransigence by Pelosi.

The speaker's office had no immediate comment.

Democrats oppose an emergency declaration but may be powerless to block it. Some Republicans are wary, too, fearing how a future Democratic president might use that authority. Such a move, should Trump ultimately go that route, would almost certainly be challenged in the courts.

Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., called Graham's idea to reopen the government a ""great place to start.""

""I do think if we reopen the government, if the president ends this shutdown crisis, we have folks who can negotiate a responsible, modern investment in technology that will actually make us safer,"" Coons said.

Trump says technology is nice, but that the border can't be secured without a wall.

The White House has been laying the groundwork for an emergency declaration, which is feared by lawmakers in both parties.

Senate Homeland Security Committee Chairman Ron Johnson, R-Wis., said he'd ""hate to see"" a declaration issued because the wall wouldn't get built, presumably because of legal challenges. Democrats voted in the past for border security and should again, he said.

""I actually want to see this wall get built,"" Johnson said. ""I want to keep pressure on Democrats to actually come to the negotiating table in good faith and fund what they have supported in the past.""

Graham favors a declaration and said the time for talk is running out.

""It's the last option, not the first option, but we're pretty close to that being the only option,"" he said.

Graham and Coons spoke on ""Fox News Sunday"" and Johnson appeared on CNN's ""State of the Union."""
344,lexington herald leader,https://www.kentucky.com/news/business/article224277975.html,"The government shutdown has suspended federal cleanups at Superfund sites around the nation and forced the cancellation of public hearings, deepening the mistrust and resentment of surrounding residents who feel people in power long ago abandoned them to live among the toxic residue of the country's factories and mines.

""We are already hurting, and it's just adding more fuel to the fire,"" says 40-year-old Keisha Brown, whose wood-frame home is in a community nestled among coking plants and other factories on Birmingham's north side.

The mostly African-American community has been forced to cope with high levels of arsenic, lead and other contaminants in the soil that the Environmental Protection Agency has been scraping up and carting away, house by house.

As President Donald Trump and Congress battle over Trump's demand for a wall on the southern U.S. border, the nearly 3-week-old partial government shutdown has stopped federal work on Superfund sites except for cases where the administration deems ""there is an imminent threat to the safety of human life or to the protection of property.""

EPA's shutdown plans said the agency would evaluate about 800 Superfund sites to see how many could pose an immediate threat. As an example of that kind of threat, it cited an acid leak from a mine that could threaten the public water supply. That's the hazard at Northern California's Iron Mountain mine, where EPA workers help prevent an unending flow of lethally acidic runoff off the Superfund site from spilling into rivers downstream.

Practically speaking, said Bonnie Bellow, a former EPA official who worked on Superfund public outreach at the agency, the impact of the stoppage of work at sites across the nation ""wholly depends"" on the length of the shutdown.

""Unless there is immediate risk like a storm, a flood, a week or two of slowdowns is not going to very likely affect the cleanup at the site,"" Bellow said.

In north Birmingham, Brown said it's been a couple of weeks since she's spotted any EPA crews at people's houses. It wasn't clear if state workers or contractors were continuing work.

But long before the shutdown began, Brown harbored doubts the cleanup was working anyway. ""My main concern is the health of the people out here,"" said Brown, who has asthma. ""All of us are sick, and we've got to function on medicine every day.""

In terms of time, the federal government shutdown is a chronological blip in the long history of the site -- which includes ethics charges in a local bribery scandal to block federal cleanup efforts -- but adds to the uncertainty in an area where residents feel forgotten and betrayed.

At the EPA, the shutdown has furloughed the bulk of the agency's roughly 14,000 employees. It also means the EPA isn't getting most of the daily stream of environmental questions and tips from the public. Routine inspections aren't happening. State, local and private emails to EPA officials often get automated messages back promising a response when the shutdown ends.

In Montana, for instance, state officials this month found themselves fielding calls from a tribal member worried about drinking water with a funny look to it, said Kristi Ponozzo, public-policy director at that state's Department of Environmental Quality. The EPA normally provides tribes with technical assistance on water supplies.

With most EPA colleagues idled, Ponozzo said, her agency also had to call off an environmental review meeting for a mining project, potentially delaying the project.

But it's the agency's work at Superfund sites -- lessening the threat from old nuclear-weapons plants, chemical factories, mines and other entities -- that gets much of the attention.

Absent imminent peril, it would be up to state governments or contractors to continue any cleanup during the shutdown ""up to the point that additional EPA direction or funding is needed,"" the EPA said in a statement.

""Sites where cleanup activities have been stopped or shut down will be secured until cleanup activities are able to commence when the federal government reopens,"" the agency said.

For federal Superfund sites in Michigan, the shutdown means there are no EPA colleagues to consult, said Scott Dean, a spokesman for that state's Department of Environmental Quality.

At Michigan Superfund sites, day-to-day field operations were continuing since private contractors do most of the on-the-ground work, Dean said.

Bellow, the former EPA official, said the cancellation of hearings about Superfund sites posed immediate concerns.

In East Chicago, Indiana, for example, the EPA called off a planned public hearing set for last Wednesday to outline how the agency planned to clean up high levels of lead and arsenic in the soil.

The EPA has proposed a seven-month, $26.5 million cleanup that includes treating and removing tainted soil from the area, where a lead smelter previously was located.

During a public meeting Nov. 29, some residents complained that the EPA's approach would leave too much pollution in place. But others didn't get a chance to speak and were hoping to do so at the meeting this week, said Debbie Chizewer, a Northwestern University environmental attorney who represents community groups in the low-income area.

The EPA announced the cancellation in an online notice and gave no indication that it would be rescheduled.

Leaders of the East Chicago Calumet Community Advisory Group asked for a new hearing date and an extension of a Jan. 14 public comment deadline in a letter to the EPA's regional Superfund division.

Calls by The Associated Press to the agency's regional office in Chicago this week were not answered.

Local critics fear the EPA will use the delay caused by the shutdown as justification for pushing ahead with a cleanup strategy they consider flawed, Chizewer said, even though the agency has designated the affected area as an ""environmental justice community"" -- a low-income community of color that has been disproportionately harmed by pollution.

The EPA has a ""special obligation"" when dealing with such communities, Chizewer said. ""This would be an example of shutting them out for no good reason.""

In North Birmingham, former longtime neighborhood resident Charlie Powell said most of the people living in and around the Superfund site had already ""just got tired and fed up.""

Powell left the area but started a group called PANIC, People Against Neighborhood Industrial Contamination. He believes money would be better spent helping residents move away from the pollution.

""Can I say hell?"" Powell said when asked what residents have been through.

346,business insider australia,https://www.businessinsider.com.au/coast-guard-families-feel-strain-with-1st-missed-paycheck-of-shutdown-2019-1,"""It's hard to focus on search and rescue if you don't know whether your kids and family are going to have a roof over their head and food on the table,"" a Coast Guard spouse said.

Twenty-four days into the longest government shutdown in US history, the strain is being felt acutely by the US Coast Guard, as some 42,000 active-duty members are preparing to miss their first paycheck on January 15.

In a January 10 letter, Vice Commandant Adm. Charles Ray said that without an appropriation or funding measure, ""the Coast Guard will not be able to meet the next payroll,"" an extreme disruption that officials averted in late December by moving funds around.

""Let me assure you your leadership continues to do everything possible, both internal and external to the Service, to ensure we can process your pay as soon as we receive an appropriation,"" Ray added. ""However, I do not know when that will occur.""

The Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps are funded through the Defence Department, which got it its fiscal year 2019 budget in the fall, and none of their troops are missing a paycheck.

But the Coast Guard, while technically a military branch, is funded through the Homeland Security Department, funding for which has been held up amid a dispute between President Donald Trump and Congress over $US5.7 billion Trump wants to start construction of a wall on the US-Mexico border.

A work-around secured funding for Coast Guard payroll on December 31, paying the service's active-duty members and reservists who drilled before funding lapsed, but service leaders have said it cannot be repeated. Civilian employees are unpaid since December 21.

Active-duty members deemed essential have continued working, as have about 1,300 civilian workers. Most of the service's 8,500 civilian employees have been furloughed, and pay and benefits for some 50,000 retired members and employees could be affected.

The service continues to operate, however.

In the Coast Guard's 14th district, which covers 12.2 million square miles of the Pacific Ocean, 835 active-duty personnel and some civilians are still working from bases in Hawaii and Guam and detachments in Japan and Singapore, carrying out ""essential operations"" such as search-and-rescue and law enforcement, 14th district spokeswoman Chief Sara Muir told Stars and Stripes.

Between December 21 and January 7, the district handled 46 cases, including two major ones, Muir said. On January 13, Coast Guard personnel medevaced a crew member off a fishing vessel 80 miles north of Kauai.

Other operations, like recreational-vessel safety checks and issuing or renewing licenses and other administrative work, has been curtailed. The service has said vendors who provide fuel and other services also won't be paid until funding resumes.

As the shutdown drags on, communities around the country have mustered to support Coast Guard members and families, particularly junior members, many of whom lack savings.

On January 12, dozens of northern Michigan residents gathered for a silent auction and donation event, with funds raised going toward expenses like rent, medical bills, and heating for service members and their families.

""Whenever you cannot predict when you're gonna get your next paycheck, but you know exactly when the bills are due, it causes a lot of stress,"" Kenneth Arbogast, a retired Coast Guard chief petty officer, told UpNorthLive.com. ""And for younger members, young families, that's really a challenge.""

Read more: The Coast Guard turned down a request for an Arctic exercise out of concern the US's only heavy icebreaker would break down and Russia would have to rescue it

On January 13, more than 600 service members, including 168 families, gathered in Alameda, California, for a giveaway organised by the East Bay Coast Guard Spouses Club, providing them with everything from fresh fruit to diapers.

""It's worrisome. I have to put food in my family's belly,""said Coast Guard mechanic Kyle Turcott, who is working without pay. ""Ain't no telling, we may not get paid until the first of next month,"" added Nathan Knight, another service member.

The organisers said they were working on another food drive and could host another distribution event this week.

On January 14, Thomas Edison State University in New Jersey announced that Coast Guard students affected by the shutdown would be able todefer=""defer""payments until tuition assistance was available again. The school has 135 active-duty students - 27 of whom are registered for February.

In Rhode Island, Roger Williams University said that on January 15 it would offer free dining-hall meals to active-duty Coast Guard members and their families from Rhode Island and southeastern Massachusetts.

Navy Federal Credit Union, which serves military members, veterans, and civilian Defence Department employees, has said it would offer no-interest loans up to $US6,000 to workers affected by the shutdown, with repayment automatically deducted from paychecks once direct-deposit resumes.

In his January 10 letter, Ray also said that the Coast Guard Mutual Assistance Board had increased the interest-free loans it was offering, focusing on junior members, allowing those with dependents to get up to $US1,000.

In Texas, Coast Guard noncommissioned officers have raised money through local chapters of the Coast Guard Petty Officers Association. Last week, they brought in food to cook at Ellington Field Joint Reserve Base, encouraging younger service members to take food home.

Erin Picou, whose husband is a chief petty officer with 17 years experience, said her family could cover the most important bills, but the mortgage for their house, on which they spent their savings six months ago, is less certain.

""It's pretty scary. I don't want the bank to take my new house,"" Picou told The San Antonio Express-News.

""I can't speak for them, but I myself think my husband has worked his arse off. He needs to get a paycheck,"" Picou added. ""It's hard to focus on search and rescue if you don't know whether your kids and family are going to have a roof over their head and food on the table.""

Measures have been introduced to Congress to ensure pay for Coast Guard members. However, Ray said, ""I cannot predict what course that legislation may take.""

In a Facebook post on Sunday, Coast Guard commandant Adm. Karl Schultz told service members the branch was continuing ""228 years of military service around the globe,"" including preparations for yearly ice-clearing in Antarctica, maritime-security operations in the Middle East, and drug interdictions in Central and South America.

""Please know that we are doing everything we can to support and advocate for you while your loved one stands the watch,"" he added. ""You have not, and will not, be forgotten."""

As President Donald Trump is said to be mulling ""other options"" for funding his border wall between the U.S. and Mexico, according to the Associated Press, a dark horse arises on the internet.

A GoFundMe campaign popped up Sunday, hoping to raise funds for Trump's proposed wall between the U.S. and Mexico, which isn't news in and of itself. There are plenty of those around.

But the organizers of this campaign are so encouraged that they've raised more-than $700,000 in just three days that they've bumped their original goal of $200 million up to a cool billion.

The GoFundMe organizer is listed as triple-amputee Air Force veteran Brian Kolfage, who lost both legs and his right arm in a blast at Balad Air Force Base in Iraq in 2004, according to the Arizona Daily Star. The fundraiser is titled, ""We the people will fund the wall.""

The contact listing for the organizer says ""The Wall Funding Team"" is located in Miramar, Fla.

""As a veteran who has given so much, 3 limbs, I feel deeply invested to this nation to ensure future generations have everything we have today,"" Kolfage wrote in the GoFundMe campaign description. ""Too many Americans have been murdered by illegal aliens and too many illegals are taking advantage of the United States taxpayers with no means of ever contributing to our society.

""I have grandparents who immigrated to America legally, they did it the correct way and it's time we uphold our laws, and get this wall BUILT! It's up to Americans to help out and pitch in to get this project rolling.""

Multiple studies and reports have shown, though, that illegal immigrants commit crime, violent or nonviolent, at lesser rates than do native-born Americans.

Kolfage's GoFundMe campaign was listed as the ""Top fundraiser"" on the front page of the crowd-sourced social fundraising website as of Wednesday afternoon, despite Kolfage's claims that the platform was trying to hide his fundraiser from potential donors.

Kolfage's Facebook page, where he posts content relevant to his conservative political beliefs, has more than 90,000 followers.

""We have contacted the Trump Administration to secure a point of contact where all funds will go upon completion,"" the campaign says. ""When get this information secured we will update. We have many very high level contacts already helping."""
348,the bulletin,http://www.norwichbulletin.com/opinion/20190116/another-view-send-deal-to-trump?rssfeed=true,"The following editorial appeared in The Washington Post:

Forget Donald Trump. The president does not have the dealmaking chops to break the current deadlock with Democrats and reopen the government. That's no excuse for Congress to sit on its hands. Instead of digging themselves deeper into their own trench of irreconciliation, why don't lawmakers put a tough-minded deal on the president's desk and force his hand?

That deal, as many in Washington know and have advocated for months, involves a swap: Shield hundreds of thousands of ""Dreamers"" from the threat of deportation, ensuring them the safe and secure lives they deserve in the country they've known since they were brought to this nation as children. On top of that, grant a reprieve to tens of thousands of Hondurans, Haitians and Salvadorans who have lived legally for years in the United States but now face the threat of removal as the administration rescinds their existing protections under the temporary protected status (TPS) program. In return, offer Trump some money to build his wall.

Everyone gnashes their teeth over that tradeoff, proof that it contains the elements of a plausible compromise. There's no shortage of House Democrats, reveling in their new majority, who say they will ""never"" fund Trump's wall, nor even a portion of it. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., largely AWOL since the president flipped on a stopgap funding measure to keep the government running last month, remains in his sullen funk, refusing to bring legislation to a vote without Trump's say-so. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., frames the debate, specifically the wall, in terms of morality - a surefire kiss of death.

It may feel comfortable to wallow in the moral certainties of a No Deal, but why stoop to the president's level? Newly elected Democrats who flipped previously GOP-held seats might take account of their swing-voting constituents who might be fine with a measure of creative conciliation that restarts the government. Democrats from Trump-hating districts can sell the deal as a rescue package for well more than 1 million dreamers and TPS recipients who face imminent and drastic threats to their futures. Republicans who want to build a wall can crow that they secured funding, at last, for a down payment on one.

In a political age that has become solution-averse, these are the building blocks of an honorable way out from the current dead end. Of course, Trump will snarl, threaten a veto and maybe make good on that threat. If he does, the ball will be in his court, his hand forced to produce an alternative or Congress can override, as the Constitution allows.

Congress is a separate branch of government; it needn't be paralyzed by a tantrum-prone president. The legislative branch is empowered to send legislation to the White House. Has it forgotten it has that prerogative?"

It's an open secret that Apple cofounder Steve Jobs was not only a visionary but an exceptionally difficult man.

A memoir published this year by his daughter, Lisa Brennan-Jobs, lends further nuanced depth to that image and examines their often frosty relationship.

In one heartbreaking extract, told for the first time, Brennan-Jobs recalled that her father would replace every Porsche as soon as it got a scratch. She asked whether she could have one once he replaced it.

""You're not getting anything,"" she recalls him responding. ""You understand? Nothing. You're getting nothing.""

Elon Musk's Twitter activity prompted great scrutiny of the Tesla CEO this year, but the tweet that bit back hardest was his infamous claim that he had ""funding secured"" to take Tesla private.

The full tweet appeared to contain a marijuana reference. ""Am considering taking Tesla private at $US420,"" he wrote. ""Funding secured.""

Ultimately, the tweet led to Musk being slapped with a $US20 million fine from the SEC after it became apparent that funding had not in fact been secured. Under the terms of the settlement, Musk also had to step down as chairman of Tesla.

A surprising twist in the tale of Elon Musk's ""funding secured"" debacle was when rapper Azealia Banks weighed in with her account of events.

Banks claimed that after being invited to Musk's LA home to collaborate with Grimes, who was in a relationship with Musk at the time (it is unclear whether they are still a couple), she saw him scrambling for investors.

""They bring me out there on the premise that we would hang and make music,"" Banks told Business Insider in a DM. ""But his dumbass kept tweeting and tucked his dick in between his arse cheeks once shit hit the fan.

""I saw him in the kitchen tucking his tail in between his legs scrounging for investors to cover his arse after that tweet. He was stressed and red in the face.""

Banks later wrote an apology letter to Musk, saying ""I feel terrible about everything.""

In December, President Trump tweeted that he knows tech better than anyone else in response to criticism about his plans for a border wall with Mexico.

In two tweets Trump declared: ""The Democrats are trying to belittle the concept of a Wall, calling it old fashioned. The fact is there is nothing else's that will work, and that has been true for thousands of years. It's like the wheel, there is nothing better.

""I know tech better than anyone, & technology .....on a Border is only effective in conjunction with a Wall. Properly designed and built Walls work, and the Democrats are lying when they say they don't. In Israel the Wall is 99.9% successful. Will not be any different on our Southern Border! Hundreds of $Billions saved!""

There is considerable evidence to suggest Trump is not the foremost expert on technology, such as the fact he refers to an iPad as ""the flat one.""

Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg was hauled before US lawmakers in April to explain the role the social network played in spreading misinformation.

Lawmakers used the session as an excuse to grill Facebook about privacy too, with Democratic senator Dick Durbin asking: ""Mr. Zuckerberg, would you be comfortable sharing with us the name of the hotel you stayed in last night?""

The point was to illustrate Facebook's uncanny ability to show people ads and friend recommendations based on their whereabouts.

Unsurprisingly, Zuckerberg said no.

When Mark Zuckerberg testified before Congress in April, many were surprised at the senators' lack of tech-savvy. Perhaps the best example of this was when 84-year-old Utah senator Orrin Hatch asked how Facebook can be a profitable business and yet remain a free service.

Zuckerberg responded, ""Senator, we run ads.""

Feeling, perhaps, that two Congressional appearances were enough, Zuckerberg snubbed similar grillings from other countries. He declined to appear in November before a group of representatives from nine countries hosted in Westminster.

Instead, Facebook sent VP and British peer Richard Allen in his place, and Belgian lawmaker Nele Lijnen flummoxed him with an unexpected question: ""Do you know the expression 'sending your cat'?""

Allen admitted he did not, and she explained it was a Flemish idiom meaning to not show up.

""I hope I am able to assist as a cat,"" Allen responded.

""No, no, you are sitting next to the cat,"" Lijnen explained.

SpaceX CEO Elon Musk revealed in September that Japanese billionaire and art collector Yusaku Maezawa would be the first person to fly to the moon as a private passenger aboard the Big Falcon Rocket.

Maezawa in turn announced he would be taking six to eight artists along for the ride.

This year the rise and fall of disgraced blood-analysis startup Theranos was deliciously chronicled in the book ""Bad Blood.""

But despite the fact that the SEC went on to charge Theranos and its founder Elizabeth Holmes with fraud, some of its supporters remained loyal to the end.

Venture capital investor Tim Draper defended Holmes in an interview with CNBC. He also wore a Bitcoin-patterned tie.

""I feel that we have taken down another great icon,"" he said. ""This woman came to me when she was 19 years old and she said I'm going to transform health care as we know it and she got bullied into submission. And this is not what America is made of.""

Holmes stepped down as CEO a month later.

In a recording of an internal Amazon all-hands meeting heard by CNBC in November, CEO Jeff Bezos said in response to a question from a staffer: ""Amazon is not too big to fail ... In fact, I predict one day Amazon will fail.""

""Amazon will go bankrupt. If you look at large companies, their lifespans tend to be 30-plus years, not a hundred-plus years,"" he added.

The quote was eye-catching because Amazon has made Bezos is the richest man in the world.

This isn't the first time Bezos has alluded to Amazon's inevitable demise either.

Google CEO Sundar Pichai was, like Zuckerberg, hauled before US Congress this year.

Pichai was questioned about alleged anti-conservative bias at the company, and Democratic Rep. Zoe Lofgren gave Pichai the chance to explain how Google search works.

""Right now, if you Google the word 'idiot,' under images, a picture of Donald Trump comes up. I just did that. How would that happen? How does search work so that that would occur?""

Pichai responded that Google employees cannot manually interfere in any search results.

Facebook employee Mark S. Luckie published a scathing goodbye note criticising racial discrimination at the company in November, asserting that Facebook has a ""black people problem.""

""Facebook's disenfranchisement of black people on the platform mirrors the marginalization of its black employees,"" he wrote.

Numerous business leaders have spoken out about Trump's trade war with China, but perhaps none so bluntly as Jack Ma.

China's richest man and founder of ecommerce giant Alibaba simply said in November it was ""the most stupidest thing in this world.""

This was the quote that reignited global outrage at conditions in Amazon's warehouses.

Reporter James Bloodworth went undercover as a worker in an Amazon warehouse (or ""fulfillment centre"") as research for a book on low-wage jobs in Britain.

He claims to have found a bottle of urine while working there, and told The Sun that people urinated in bottles so as not to be disciplined for taking the time to walk to the toilet.

Amazon has categorically denied this, and dismissed Bloodworth's reporting.

In March of this year, Buzzfeed obtained a 2016 memo from Facebook executive Andrew ""Boz"" Bosworth, seemingly justifying growth at all costs.

""So we connect more people,"" Boz wrote. ""That can be bad if they make it negative. Maybe it costs a life by exposing someone to bullies. Maybe someone dies in a terrorist attack coordinated on our tools. And still we connect people.""

Mark Zuckerberg subsequently condemned the memo, saying Facebook has, ""never believed the ends justified the means.""

Bosworth himself claimed in a statement that he didn't agree with the memo when he wrote, but rather he wanted to ""surface issues"" he felt warranted more discussion.

Facebook's head of news partnerships, Campbell Brown, detonated a media bomb after reportedly telling news organisations that they'd end up ""in a hospice"" if they didn't work with the social and ads giant.

Brown met with Australian news organisations and plugged the benefits of working with Facebook, but then shocked executives by saying: ""We will help you revitalise journalism ... in a few years the ­reverse looks like I'll be holding your hands with your dying ­business like in a hospice.""

Musk got in hot water after he accused British rescue diver Vernon Unsworth of being a pedophile, after Unsworth criticised Musk's idea of rescuing the 12 boys who became stranded in a Thai cave using a miniature submarine.

Even more surprising was when Musk doubled down on the claim in an email to a Buzzfeed reporter.

Unsworth did file a lawsuit against Musk in the US, and is planning legal action in the UK."
350,vindy.com,http://www.vindy.com/news/2019/jan/14/open-us-government-temporarily-trump-all/,"A Republican lawmaker advising President Donald Trump said he is encouraging the president to reopen the government for several weeks to continue negotiating with Democrats over funding for a U.S.-Mexico border wall before the president takes the more drastic step of declaring a national emergency.

But that may be wishful thinking, given that Sen. Lindsey Graham also says Trump still wants to reach a deal for the wall before agreeing to reopen shuttered government departments. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a leading Democratic negotiator, insists that Trump reopen the government first.

The weeks-old standoff over funding led to the partial government shutdown that hits day 24 today without an end in sight.

""Before he pulls the plug on the legislative option, and I think we're almost there, I would urge him to open up the government for a short period of time, like three weeks, before he pulls the plug, see if we can get a deal,"" said Graham, a South Carolina Republican. ""If we can't at the end of three weeks, all bets are off.""

""See if he can do it by himself through the emergency powers. That's my recommendation,"" added Graham, who has publicly pushed Trump to use his authority to declare a national emergency to build the wall. Such a step would allow Trump to bypass Congress and tap various pots of unspent federal money, including for military construction and disaster relief and from asset seized by law enforcement, to pay for the wall.

Trump has kept Washington on edge over whether he would resort to such a declaration, citing what he says is a ""crisis"" of drug smuggling and the trafficking of women and children at the border. The president initially sounded as though such a move was imminent, but then pulled back. He has said several times since he first mentioned the idea in public earlier this month that he prefers to try to reach a deal with Congress.

A key question is how much more time is Trump willing to give lawmakers. Graham, who said he and Trump talked by telephone on Sunday morning, said the legislative path ""is just about shut off"" and blamed Pelosi.

The speaker's office had no immediate comment.

Democrats oppose an emergency declaration but may be powerless to block it. Some Republicans are wary, too, fearing how a future Democratic president might use that authority. Such a move, should Trump ultimately go that route, would almost certainly be challenged in the courts.

Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., called Graham's idea to reopen the government a ""great place to start.""

""I do think if we reopen the government, if the president ends this shutdown crisis, we have folks who can negotiate a responsible, modern investment in technology that will actually make us safer,"" Coons said.

Trump has maintained that the border cannot be secured without a wall.

Graham said he thinks Trump is willing to accept the $5.7 billion he has insisted on for the wall, along with some immigration measures Democrats might find acceptable, such as helping immigrants who were illegally brought to the U.S. as children.

Trump has expressed interest in a broader immigration overhaul, but says he first wants the Supreme Court to address the class of immigrants known as ""Dreamers."" Pelosi also has shown no interest in accepting a wall -- she has called it an ""immorality"" -- in exchange for immigration fixes.

And, Trump, who was holed up in the White House as snow blanketed Washington on Sunday, appeared to shoot down Graham's suggestion of a ""wall plus"" deal, saying on Twitter that even Democrats don't want to make ""Dreamers"" part of the negotiations.

""The damage done to our Country from a badly broken Border - Drugs, Crime and so much that is bad - is far greater than a Shutdown, which the Dems can easily fix as soon as they come back to Washington!"" Trump said in a separate tweet.

The White House has been laying the groundwork for an emergency declaration, feared by members of both parties.

Senate Homeland Security Committee Chairman Ron Johnson, R-Wis., said he would ""hate to see"" a declaration because then the wall wouldn't get built, presumably because of legal challenges. Democrats voted in the past for border security and should again, he said.

""I actually want to see this wall get built,"" Johnson said. ""I want to keep pressure on Democrats to actually come to the negotiating table in good faith and fund what they have supported in the past.""

But Graham, who favors a presidential declaration, said the time for talk is running out.

""It's the last option, not the first option, but we're pretty close to that being the only option,"" he said.

Graham and Coons spoke on ""Fox News Sunday."" Johnson appeared on CNN's ""State of the Union.""

For AP's complete coverage of the U.S. government shutdown: https://apnews.com/GovernmentShutdown"
351,idaho statesman,https://www.idahostatesman.com/news/business/article224277975.html,"The government shutdown has suspended federal cleanups at Superfund sites around the nation and forced the cancellation of public hearings, deepening the mistrust and resentment of surrounding residents who feel people in power long ago abandoned them to live among the toxic residue of the country's factories and mines.

""We are already hurting, and it's just adding more fuel to the fire,"" says 40-year-old Keisha Brown, whose wood-frame home is in a community nestled among coking plants and other factories on Birmingham's north side.

The mostly African-American community has been forced to cope with high levels of arsenic, lead and other contaminants in the soil that the Environmental Protection Agency has been scraping up and carting away, house by house.

As President Donald Trump and Congress battle over Trump's demand for a wall on the southern U.S. border, the nearly 3-week-old partial government shutdown has stopped federal work on Superfund sites except for cases where the administration deems ""there is an imminent threat to the safety of human life or to the protection of property.""

EPA's shutdown plans said the agency would evaluate about 800 Superfund sites to see how many could pose an immediate threat. As an example of that kind of threat, it cited an acid leak from a mine that could threaten the public water supply. That's the hazard at Northern California's Iron Mountain mine, where EPA workers help prevent an unending flow of lethally acidic runoff off the Superfund site from spilling into rivers downstream.

Practically speaking, said Bonnie Bellow, a former EPA official who worked on Superfund public outreach at the agency, the impact of the stoppage of work at sites across the nation ""wholly depends"" on the length of the shutdown.

""Unless there is immediate risk like a storm, a flood, a week or two of slowdowns is not going to very likely affect the cleanup at the site,"" Bellow said.

In north Birmingham, Brown said it's been a couple of weeks since she's spotted any EPA crews at people's houses. It wasn't clear if state workers or contractors were continuing work.

But long before the shutdown began, Brown harbored doubts the cleanup was working anyway. ""My main concern is the health of the people out here,"" said Brown, who has asthma. ""All of us are sick, and we've got to function on medicine every day.""

In terms of time, the federal government shutdown is a chronological blip in the long history of the site -- which includes ethics charges in a local bribery scandal to block federal cleanup efforts -- but adds to the uncertainty in an area where residents feel forgotten and betrayed.

At the EPA, the shutdown has furloughed the bulk of the agency's roughly 14,000 employees. It also means the EPA isn't getting most of the daily stream of environmental questions and tips from the public. Routine inspections aren't happening. State, local and private emails to EPA officials often get automated messages back promising a response when the shutdown ends.

In Montana, for instance, state officials this month found themselves fielding calls from a tribal member worried about drinking water with a funny look to it, said Kristi Ponozzo, public-policy director at that state's Department of Environmental Quality. The EPA normally provides tribes with technical assistance on water supplies.

With most EPA colleagues idled, Ponozzo said, her agency also had to call off an environmental review meeting for a mining project, potentially delaying the project.

But it's the agency's work at Superfund sites -- lessening the threat from old nuclear-weapons plants, chemical factories, mines and other entities -- that gets much of the attention.

Absent imminent peril, it would be up to state governments or contractors to continue any cleanup during the shutdown ""up to the point that additional EPA direction or funding is needed,"" the EPA said in a statement.

""Sites where cleanup activities have been stopped or shut down will be secured until cleanup activities are able to commence when the federal government reopens,"" the agency said.

For federal Superfund sites in Michigan, the shutdown means there are no EPA colleagues to consult, said Scott Dean, a spokesman for that state's Department of Environmental Quality.

At Michigan Superfund sites, day-to-day field operations were continuing since private contractors do most of the on-the-ground work, Dean said.

Bellow, the former EPA official, said the cancellation of hearings about Superfund sites posed immediate concerns.

In East Chicago, Indiana, for example, the EPA called off a planned public hearing set for last Wednesday to outline how the agency planned to clean up high levels of lead and arsenic in the soil.

The EPA has proposed a seven-month, $26.5 million cleanup that includes treating and removing tainted soil from the area, where a lead smelter previously was located.

During a public meeting Nov. 29, some residents complained that the EPA's approach would leave too much pollution in place. But others didn't get a chance to speak and were hoping to do so at the meeting this week, said Debbie Chizewer, a Northwestern University environmental attorney who represents community groups in the low-income area.

The EPA announced the cancellation in an online notice and gave no indication that it would be rescheduled.

Leaders of the East Chicago Calumet Community Advisory Group asked for a new hearing date and an extension of a Jan. 14 public comment deadline in a letter to the EPA's regional Superfund division.

Calls by The Associated Press to the agency's regional office in Chicago this week were not answered.

Local critics fear the EPA will use the delay caused by the shutdown as justification for pushing ahead with a cleanup strategy they consider flawed, Chizewer said, even though the agency has designated the affected area as an ""environmental justice community"" -- a low-income community of color that has been disproportionately harmed by pollution.

The EPA has a ""special obligation"" when dealing with such communities, Chizewer said. ""This would be an example of shutting them out for no good reason.""

In North Birmingham, former longtime neighborhood resident Charlie Powell said most of the people living in and around the Superfund site had already ""just got tired and fed up.""

Powell left the area but started a group called PANIC, People Against Neighborhood Industrial Contamination. He believes money would be better spent helping residents move away from the pollution.

""Can I say hell?"" Powell said when asked what residents have been through.

352,the state,https://www.thestate.com/news/business/national-business/article224126560.html,"The Latest on President Donald Trump and the partial government shutdown (all times local):

3:16 p.m.

Congressional leaders from both parties have returned to the White House for another round of negotiations with President Donald Trump on the ongoing partial government shutdown.

The two sides have made no apparent progress in the past week, with Trump sticking to his demand of $5.7 billion for a border barrier and Democrats insisting they won't give him the money.

Trump has been making a public case that there is a ""crisis"" at the southern border. And he's still threatening to declare a national emergency to circumvent Congress if he can't get the wall money from them.

He told reporters during a visit to the Capitol earlier Wednesday that he may turn to a declaration ""at some point"" if top Democrats Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi ""don't agree"" with his assessment about the problems at the border.

President Donald Trump says Republicans are ""totally unified"" in the shutdown standoff over his long-promised southern border wall, though some GOP lawmakers have been expressing concern about the 19-day partial government closure.

Trump traveled to Capitol Hill on Wednesday to meet with Senate Republicans. He says there was ""no discussion about anything other than solidarity.""

Trump has been considering a national emergency declaration to bypass Congress to build the wall. He says he ""may do that at some point"" if he can't get a deal with Democrats.

Trump also plans to meet with top congressional Democrats and Republicans at the White House on Wednesday.

President Donald Trump arrived on Capitol Hill claiming he has ""tremendous"" support as he headed into a meeting with Republican senators uneasy with the government shutdown over his border wall.

Asked how long the shutdown would last, Trump told reporters Wednesday ""whatever it takes.""

The partial shutdown is now in its 19th day, the second longest ever.

Trump and Vice President Mike Pence arrived for the private lunch meeting with the Senate GOP caucus to shore up support.

Several Republican senators have said the government should be re-opened while talks continue over border security and Trump's demand for money to build the wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.

President Donald Trump says he thinks he and the Democrats are ""getting closer"" to a deal to end the budget stalemate that has partially shut down the government despite no evidence that any progress has been made.

And he's suggesting the partial government shutdown could be ""a blessing in disguise"" because, he suggests, it could lead to a broader immigration deal.

Trump spoke Wednesday during an Oval Office bill signing on anti-human trafficking legislation. It's a day after he delivered a prime-time address trying to make the case for his long-stalled U.S.-Mexico border wall.

Trump says that he would like to see ""real immigration reform in this country because we need it."" He says, ""Everybody wants to see immigration reform,"" adding that perhaps the stalemate ""will turn out to be a blessing in disguise.""

Gone are the days when the U.S. and Mexican governments regularly exchanged statements over President Donald Trump's insistence on a border wall.

Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said Wednesday he won't be drawn into what he calls a U.S. internal dispute, an apparent reference to the 19-day-old partial U.S. government shutdown over a border barrier.

Lopez Obrador says, ""We are not going to respond to situations arising from internal affairs in the United States.""

Unlike his predecessor, the Mexican leader didn't have to respond to any specific aspersion about Mexico, because Trump didn't make any in his Tuesday night address to the American public. Relations between the two leaders have been surprisingly cordial, given their ideological differences.

Lopez Obrador said, ""Of course, there are those ... who want us to get into a confrontation. We always want a friendly relationship with the United States, a cooperative relationship.""

As a presidential candidate Trump promised Mexico would pay for a border wall, but Mexico refused.

President Donald Trump is using a bill signing focused on curbing human trafficking to push his case for a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border.

Trump says a southern border that is not secured exacerbates the incidents of human trafficking. He says, ""As long as we have a border that is not secure, we're going to suffer the consequences of that.""

Wednesday's bill signing came a day after Trump's prime-time speech designed to persuade Americans that illegal immigration and trafficking at the border are a crisis.

Democrats have called Trump's promised wall costly, ineffective and ""immoral"" and say he's ""manufacturing a crisis.""

The bill Trump signed is designed to enhance an annual State Department report that measures global efforts to eliminate human trafficking.

The White House says it's the fourth bipartisan bill the Republican president has signed in the last few weeks to prevent human trafficking.

Congressional Democrats say they'll head to the White House with the plan to reopen the government -- the same one they've been presenting. They're asking President Donald Trump to accept a bipartisan bill to fund border security without the wall.

Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Wednesday the president ""could end the Trump shutdown and re-open the government today, and he should.""

Pelosi and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer spoke at an event where they were flanked by federal workers going without pay during the shutdown, now in its 19th day.

Schumer called workers the ""collateral damage"" of Trump's ""temper tantrum."" He said the president failed to ""persuade a soul"" during his ""divisive"" prime-time address Tuesday night to the nation.

Trump meets with congressional leaders at the White House Wednesday afternoon. He rejected the Senate's bipartisan funding bill in December, sparking the shutdown.

The White House is trying to keep jittery congressional Republicans from defecting over the toll the partial government shutdown is taking in their states.

President Donald Trump and Democrats have been at an impasse over funding for his proposed border wall, which has led to a partial government shutdown, now in its 19th day.

Trump meets with Senate Republicans Wednesday on Capitol Hill just hours after he argued on national television that a border wall was needed to resolve a security and humanitarian ""crisis.""

Senators say the shutdown has led to disruptions in agricultural payments for farmers, as well as for home buyers trying to secure government-backed home loans. Lawmakers also are worried about missed paychecks for government workers Friday.

As many as half a dozen GOP senators have said the government should reopen while border security negotiations with Democrats continue.

President Donald Trump again linked illegal immigration along the southern border with drugs and violent crime as he urged Democratic lawmakers to fund his proposed border wall.

In his first national address from the Oval Office, the president gave no indication he was softening his stance that the partial government shutdown would continue without money for the wall.

Trump argued Tuesday night that the wall was needed to resolve what he called a security and humanitarian ""crisis.""

He addressed the nation as the shutdown stretched through its third week, with hundreds of thousands of federal workers going without pay and some congressional Republicans growing increasingly jittery about the impasse.

Trump plans to visit Senate Republicans at the Capitol on Wednesday before meeting with Democratic leaders at the White House."
353,lexington herald leader,https://www.kentucky.com/news/politics-government/national-politics/article224499960.html,"Congress returns to Washington for its first full week of legislative business since control of the House reverted to Democrats, but lawmakers will be confronted with the same lingering question: When will the partial government shutdown end?

One Republican senator says he's offered President Donald Trump a possible solution, though it may just be wishful thinking.

Sen. Lindsey Graham is encouraging Trump to reopen government for several weeks to continue negotiating with Democrats over the border wall Trump wants to build on the U.S.-Mexico border.

At Michigan Superfund sites, day-to-day field operations were continuing since private contractors do most of the on-the-ground work, Dean said.

Bellow, the former EPA official, said the cancellation of hearings about Superfund sites posed immediate concerns.

In East Chicago, Indiana, for example, the EPA called off a planned public hearing set for last Wednesday to outline how the agency planned to clean up high levels of lead and arsenic in the soil.

The EPA has proposed a seven-month, $26.5 million cleanup that includes treating and removing tainted soil from the area, where a lead smelter previously was located.

During a public meeting Nov. 29, some residents complained that the EPA's approach would leave too much pollution in place. But others didn't get a chance to speak and were hoping to do so at the meeting this week, said Debbie Chizewer, a Northwestern University environmental attorney who represents community groups in the low-income area.

The EPA announced the cancellation in an online notice and gave no indication that it would be rescheduled.

Leaders of the East Chicago Calumet Community Advisory Group asked for a new hearing date and an extension of a Jan. 14 public comment deadline in a letter to the EPA's regional Superfund division.

Calls by The Associated Press to the agency's regional office in Chicago this week were not answered.

Local critics fear the EPA will use the delay caused by the shutdown as justification for pushing ahead with a cleanup strategy they consider flawed, Chizewer said, even though the agency has designated the affected area as an ""environmental justice community"" -- a low-income community of color that has been disproportionately harmed by pollution.

The EPA has a ""special obligation"" when dealing with such communities, Chizewer said. ""This would be an example of shutting them out for no good reason.""

In North Birmingham, former longtime neighborhood resident Charlie Powell said most of the people living in and around the Superfund site had already ""just got tired and fed up.""

Powell left the area but started a group called PANIC, People Against Neighborhood Industrial Contamination. He believes money would be better spent helping residents move away from the pollution.

""Can I say hell?"" Powell said when asked what residents have been through.

WASHINGTON (AP) -- The White House on Sunday pushed the federal government closer to the brink of a partial shutdown later this week, digging in on its demand for $5 billion to build a border wall as congressional Democrats stood firm against it.

""We're going to do whatever is necessary to build the border wall to stop this ongoing crisis of illegal immigration,"" said White House senior adviser Stephen Miller.

Asked if that meant having a government shutdown, he said: ""If it comes to it, absolutely.""

Trump said last week he would be ""proud"" to have a shutdown to get Congress to approve a $5 billion down payment to fulfill his campaign promise to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. But the president doesn't have the votes from the Republican-controlled Congress to support funding for the wall at that level.

Democratic congressional leaders, Sen. Chuck Schumer and Rep. Nancy Pelosi, have proposed no more than $1.6 billion, as outlined in a bipartisan Senate bill. The money would not go for the wall but for fencing upgrades and other border security. Democrats also offered to simply keep funding at its current level, $1.3 billion.

Trump lawyer Giuliani rules out Mueller interview with Trump

WASHINGTON (AP) -- With a number of probes moving closer to the Oval Office, President Donald Trump and his attorney unleashed a fresh series of attacks on the investigators, questioning their integrity while categorically ruling out the possibility of a presidential interview with the special counsel.

Trump and Rudy Giuliani used Twitter and television interviews Sunday to deliver a series of broadsides against special counsel Robert Mueller and federal prosecutors in New York. Giuliani said he was ""disgusted"" by the tactics used by Mueller in his probe into Russian election interference, including in securing guilty pleas from the president's former national security adviser Michael Flynn on a charge of lying to federal investigators.

Trump, Giuliani said, would not submit to an interview by Mueller's team.

""They're a joke,"" Giuliani told ""Fox News Sunday."" ''Over my dead body, but, you know, I could be dead.""

The special counsel, who is investigating possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russia, has continued to request an interview with the president. Last month, the White House sent written answers in response to the special counsel's questions about possible collusion. The White House has resisted answering questions on possible obstruction of justice.

Child's death highlights communication barriers on border

Shortly before a 7-year-old Guatemalan girl died in U.S. custody, her father signed a form stating that his daughter was in good health. But it's unclear how much the man understood on the form, which was written in English and read to him in Spanish by Border Patrol agents.

The death of Jakelin Caal highlights the communication challenges along the U.S.-Mexico border as agents come in contact with an increasing number of migrants who speak neither English nor Spanish.

Her father's native language is the Mayan tongue known as Q'eqchi'. His second language is Spanish. It's unclear whether something was lost in translation or whether it would have made a difference in saving Jakelin after the two were detained and underwent a health screening along a remote stretch of U.S.-Mexico border. But the case raises questions about the Border Patrol's use of English-only forms.

All agents are required to speak Spanish, and they receive formal Spanish training. Reading forms in Spanish is often enough to pose basic questions. But some other Spanish-speaking migrants reported signing paperwork that they later said they did not understand.

Scores of immigrant parents who were separated from their children after crossing the border in the spring said they signed forms agreeing to be deported with the understanding that their kids would be returning with them, only to find themselves deported without them. Many had to wait months before being reunited with them in their homelands.

Talks adopt 'rulebook' to put Paris climate deal into action

KATOWICE, Poland (AP) -- Almost 200 nations, including the world's top greenhouse gas producers, China and the United States, have adopted a set of rules meant to breathe life into the 2015 Paris climate accord by setting out how countries should report their emissions and efforts to reduce them.

But negotiators delayed other key decisions until next year -- a move that frustrated environmentalists and countries that wanted more ambitious goals in light of scientists' warnings that the world must shift sharply away from fossil fuels in the coming decade.

""The majority of the rulebook for the Paris agreement has been created, which is something to be thankful for,"" said Mohamed Adow, a climate policy expert at Christian Aid. ""But the fact countries had to be dragged kicking and screaming to the finish line shows that some nations have not woken up"" to the dire consequences of global warming as outlined in a report by the U.N Panel on Climate Change, or IPCC.

Officials at the talks, which ended late Saturday in the Polish city of Katowice, agreed upon universal rules on how nations can cut emissions. Poor countries secured assurances on financial support to help them reduce emissions, adapt to changes such as rising sea levels and pay for damage that has already happened.

""Through this package, you have made a thousand little steps forward together,"" said Michal Kurtyka, a senior Polish official who led the talks.

French city honors victims of Christmas market attack

PARIS (AP) -- People filled a square in the French city of Strasbourg on Sunday to show respect and sympathy for the victims of last week's shooting attack near a famous Christmas market as the death toll rose to five.

French authorities said a Polish man died in a Strasbourg hospital Sunday, one of a dozen people wounded in last Tuesday's attack. Poland's Foreign Ministry extended condolences Sunday on Twitter to his family.

According to the newspaper DNA, more than 1,000 people attended the memorial, which ended with a minute of applause and a rendition of France's national anthem, ""La Marseillaise.""

The hour-long ceremony took place in Kleber Square, not far from where a gunman opened fire on Tuesday evening. Strasbourg Mayor Roland Ries praised the city's resilience in the face of hardship.

The ""extremely large crowd in the Christmas market"" on Saturday ""was an illustration of our commitment to these values ??on which our living together is based, which we will continue to defend against all those who want to attack it,"" Ries said.

Not into bingo, 84-year-old Texas woman gets college degree

RICHARDSON, Texas (AP) -- After raising five kids and retiring at age 77 from her secretarial job, Janet Fein couldn't be blamed for finally relaxing, but that's not her.

Fein, now 84, went to back to school and will accomplish a long-held goal this week when she graduates from the University of Texas at Dallas with a bachelor's degree.

""I didn't have anything to do in retirement and I didn't think that playing bingo was up to my speed,"" said Fein, who majored in sociology because she felt it was ""substantial.""

She said she enjoyed all the reading and writing papers. ""With each class I already knew a lot, but then I also learned a lot. And that made me happy,"" she said.

People 65 and older make up less than one percent of U.S. college students. In 2015, they accounted for about 67,000 of about 20 million college students, according to the National Center for Education Statistics.

Next-generation of GPS satellites are headed to space

DENVER (AP) -- After months of delays, the U.S. Air Force is about to launch the first of a new generation of GPS satellites, designed to be more accurate, secure and versatile.

But some of their most highly touted features will not be fully available until 2022 or later because of problems in a companion program to develop a new ground control system for the satellites, government auditors said.

The satellite is scheduled to lift off Tuesday from Cape Canaveral, Florida, aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. It's the first of 32 planned GPS III satellites that will replace older ones now in orbit. Lockheed Martin is building the new satellites outside Denver.

GPS is best-known for its widespread civilian applications, from navigation to time-stamping bank transactions. The Air Force estimates that 4 billion people worldwide use the system.

But it was developed by the U.S. military, which still designs, launches and operates the system. The Air Force controls a constellation of 31 GPS satellites from a high-security complex at Schriever Air Force Base outside Colorado Springs.

After fraud probe, new primary may replace GOP candidate

RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- Legislation quickly passed by North Carolina's lawmakers this week would prepare a path for Republicans to dump their nominee in a still-undecided U.S. House race marred with ballot fraud allegations.

""I think (legislators are) worried that Mark Harris might be damaged goods and they want to have the opportunity to have a different Republican nominee,"" said Carter Wrenn, a Republican operative and consultant to former U.S. Sen. Jesse Helms and others for more than 40 years. ""That's how I read those tea leaves.""

If the state elections board decides ballot irregularities or other problems cast the true outcome into doubt and force a redo, the legislation -- if allowed to go into law by Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper -- would require new primary elections in the 9th Congressional District race, in addition to a new general election.

That would allow Republicans another look at Mark Harris, the Republican who led Democrat Dan McCready by 905 votes in unofficial results. Harris hasn't been certified the winner, and an investigation is looking into missing absentee ballots in rural Bladen County and whether unsealed ballots illegally handled by collection teams there could have been altered.

Bladen was the only county among the eight within the 9th District where Harris won a majority of mail-in absentee ballots over McCready.

Top of mind: 'Justice' is Merriam-Webster's word of the year

NEW YORK (AP) -- Racial justice. Obstruction of justice. Social justice. The Justice Department. Merriam-Webster has chosen ""justice"" as its 2018 word of the year, driven by the churning news cycle over months and months.

The word follows ""toxic,"" picked by Oxford Dictionaries, and ""misinformation,"" plucked by Dictonary.com.

Peter Sokolowski, Merriam-Webster's editor at large, told The Associated Press ahead of Monday's announcement that ""justice"" consistently bubbled into the top 20 or 30 lookups on the company's website, spiking at times due to specific events but also skating close to the surface for much of the year.

While it's one of those common words people likely know how to spell and use correctly in a sentence, Sokolowski pointed to other reasons that drive search traffic. Among them is an attempt to focus a train of thought around a philosophical problem, or to seek aspirational motivation. Such well-known words are often among the most looked up every year, including those that are slightly abstract, including ""love,"" he said.

The designation for ""justice"" came soon after President Trump's one-time fixer, Michael Cohen, was sentenced to three years in prison for crimes that included arranging the payment of hush money to conceal his boss' alleged sexual affairs. He told a judge he agreed time and again to cover up Trump's ""dirty deeds"" out of ""blind loyalty.""

'Spider-Verse' swings to the top; 'Mortal Engines' tanks

LOS ANGELES (AP) -- ""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse"" swung to the top of the domestic box office in its first weekend in theaters, proving that there is widespread audience interest in big screen animated versions of Marvel's marquee superheroes.

The film led a host of newcomers that debuted to varying success on this pre-Christmas holiday weekend, including Clint Eastwood's drug smuggling drama ""The Mule"" and the Peter Jackson-produced epic ""Mortal Engines"" which bombed in North American theaters.

""Into the Spider-Verse"" earned an estimated $35.4 million from 3,813 theaters against a $90 million production budget according to Sony Pictures on Sunday, which is a record for animated movies in December (although the hybrid ""Alvin and the Chipmunks"" movies were higher). The film features an innovative animation style -- both CGI and hand-drawn -- and focuses on the Miles Morales character as he learns to become the famed web-slinger. It's another financial win for the studio's latest ""expanded Spider-Man universe"" strategy following ""Venom"" and ""Spider-Man: Homecoming.""

And ""Spider-Verse"" has been very well-received among critics, and audiences in exit surveys gave it a rare A+ CinemaScore -- a first for a Spider-Man film. It's also been nominated for a Golden Globe award for best animated feature and picked up a few honors from critics' groups as well, including the New York Film Critics Circle.

""We are playing to both families and fanboys. We're an all-audience film,"" said Adrian Smith, Sony's president of domestic distribution."

As President Donald Trump is said to be mulling ""other options"" for funding his border wall between the U.S. and Mexico, according to the Associated Press, a dark horse arises on the internet.

A GoFundMe campaign popped up Sunday, hoping to raise funds for Trump's proposed wall between the U.S. and Mexico, which isn't news in and of itself. There are plenty of those around.

But the organizers of this campaign are so encouraged that they've raised more-than $700,000 in just three days that they've bumped their original goal of $200 million up to a cool billion.

The GoFundMe organizer is listed as triple-amputee Air Force veteran Brian Kolfage, who lost both legs and his right arm in a blast at Balad Air Force Base in Iraq in 2004, according to the Arizona Daily Star.

The contact listing for the organizer says ""The Wall Funding Team"" is located in Miramar, Fla.

""As a veteran who has given so much, 3 limbs, I feel deeply invested to this nation to ensure future generations have everything we have today,"" Kolfage wrote in the GoFundMe campaign description. ""Too many Americans have been murdered by illegal aliens and too many illegals are taking advantage of the United States taxpayers with no means of ever contributing to our society.

""I have grandparents who immigrated to America legally, they did it the correct way and it's time we uphold our laws, and get this wall BUILT! It's up to Americans to help out and pitch in to get this project rolling.""

Multiple studies and reports have shown, though, that illegal immigrants commit crime, violent or nonviolent, at lesser rates than do native-born Americans.

Kolfage's GoFundMe campaign was listed as the ""Top fundraiser"" on the front page of the crowd-sourced social fundraising website as of Wednesday afternoon, despite Kolfage's claims that the platform was trying to hide his fundraiser from potential donors.

Kolfage's Facebook page, where he posts content relevant to his conservative political beliefs, has more than 90,000 followers.

""We have contacted the Trump Administration to secure a point of contact where all funds will go upon completion,"" the campaign says. ""When get this information secured we will update. We have many very high level contacts already helping."""
358,idaho statesman,https://www.idahostatesman.com/news/politics-government/national-politics/article224069750.html,"With illegal immigration at its lowest level in a decade, it's nothing short of stunning that the federal government is shut down over funding for a border wall.

Yet here we are, entering a third week of the shutdown because President Donald Trump has inexplicably chosen to dig his heels in on getting $5 billion to build a wall along stretches of the U.S. border with Mexico that do not already have such a barrier in place.

""As long as it takes,"" Trump said last week when asked how long he was willing to let the shutdown last. ""I mean, look, I'm prepared. I think the people of the country think I'm right. I think the people of this country think I'm right.""

Except, polling shows the opposite. Major polls conducted last month by Quinnipiac, Harvard, NPR and others all showed that a majority of Americans do not support the wall. And the number of wall supporters shrinks even more when asked if it is worth shutting down the government over.

The reality is that immigration from Mexico has been decreasing since 2007, and the number of unauthorized immigrants living in the U.S. is at its lowest level since 2004, according to the Pew Research Center.

Further, the majority of illegal immigration to the United States from Mexico occurs in and around heavily secured ports of entry like San Diego, El Paso and Brownsville, Texas, where 654 miles of wall, fencing and other barriers already exist. Spending billions to build a structure along vast, rural stretches of the border doesn't help with security at the sections of the border that most need help.

No one is arguing for unsecure borders. The newly installed Democratic Congress voted Thursday to approve a stopgap funding bill that would reopen the federal government and provide $1.3 billion for border security in the form of manpower and equipment but not a wall. Trump has said he won't sign it, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell refuses to let a bill come to the Senate floor that the president won't sign.

It's hard to know what the president's end game is. He couldn't get the border wall approved when Republicans controlled both the House and the Senate, so it seems odd to take this stance on the heels of a midterm election in which Democrats made their biggest gains in 40 years and took control of the House.

Trump may feel he is being true to his base of ardent supporters, among whom the border wall ranked high on their list of priorities. But his focus is sorely misplaced. Rather, his attention should be focused on the independent voters who took a chance on him in 2016 believing his style could prove effective at getting things done in Washington. Shutting down the federal government in an effort to get $5 billion for a wall that most Americans don't feel the country needs is the opposite of getting things done.

Laura Kelly is already on the case for Kansas kids with decision to name new DCF leader ' The Kansas City Star

This is why voters elected incoming Gov. Laura Kelly: Because we need to do so much better for Kansas children, because we badly need transparency in state government and because there is zero time to waste in recovering all that was lost under Governors Sam Brownback and Jeff Colyer.

So good for her for marching so briskly into 2019. On Thursday, Kelly announced that she will replace Gina Meier-Hummel as head of the state's child welfare system. The Kansas Department for Children and Families was on what seemed like permanent crisis footing long before Meier-Hummel got there in fall of 2017. But it has remained troubled under her sometimes questionable leadership, and a change was in order.

Meier-Hummel had a difficult job and did make some improvements, which began with a top-to-bottom audit.

But she talked about transparency and didn't show enough of it. She decided to hire inexperienced and unlicensed social workers to fill jobs investigating reports of abuse and neglect. And she replaced contracts for foster care, family preservation and other services with grants that got around rules on no-bid arrangements.

Kelly asked the Colyer administration that she'll soon supplant -- in 11 days, her announcement noted, and we're glad she's counting -- not to implement those grants at this point. Meier-Hummel immediately said she'd honor that request.

The governor-elect also said outright that the state's procurement process wasn't followed and that agency officials had tried to keep her from learning more about how the grantees were chosen.

We wanted Kelly to clean house and name names, for the sake of the state's struggling families, and she's already doing that.

As The Star has reported, the agency gave a major grant to a Florida nonprofit already facing heavy criticism for its foster care. An agency spokeswoman argued that they'd been hired to provide family preservation services, not foster care, but it's still the same nonprofit group.

Meier-Hummel will be succeeded on an interim basis by Laura Howard, who for now will head both the DCF and the Kansas Department for Aging and Disability Services. A former regional administrator in a federal agency overseeing substance abuse and mental health services, Howard is currently director of the Public Management Center in the School of Public Affairs and Administration at the University of Kansas.

Meier-Hummel responded to Kelly's no-nonsense announcement with a news release of her own. It listed her achievements, including starting a new Wichita abuse and neglect reporting line, ""changing key policies and procedures and implementing further mandated training"" and reducing the number of missing and runaway kids by just over a quarter. The suspended grants are in the ""absolute best interest"" of Kansas children and families, the DCF's announcement said.

That's a matter of opinion, but ours is that Kelly has done the right thing and is off to a promising start even before being sworn in as governor."
359,the state,https://www.thestate.com/news/nation-world/national/article223193915.html,"White House digs in on border wall demand, risking shutdown

WASHINGTON (AP) -- The White House on Sunday pushed the federal government closer to the brink of a partial shutdown later this week, digging in on its demand for $5 billion to build a border wall as congressional Democrats stood firm against it.

""We're going to do whatever is necessary to build the border wall to stop this ongoing crisis of illegal immigration,"" said White House senior adviser Stephen Miller.

Asked if that meant having a government shutdown, he said: ""If it comes to it, absolutely.""

Trump said last week he would be ""proud"" to have a shutdown to get Congress to approve a $5 billion down payment to fulfill his campaign promise to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. But the president doesn't have the votes from the Republican-controlled Congress to support funding for the wall at that level.

Democratic congressional leaders, Sen. Chuck Schumer and Rep. Nancy Pelosi, have proposed no more than $1.6 billion, as outlined in a bipartisan Senate bill. The money would not go for the wall but for fencing upgrades and other border security. Democrats also offered to simply keep funding at its current level, $1.3 billion.

Trump lawyer Giuliani rules out Mueller interview with Trump

WASHINGTON (AP) -- With a number of probes moving closer to the Oval Office, President Donald Trump and his attorney unleashed a fresh series of attacks on the investigators, questioning their integrity while categorically ruling out the possibility of a presidential interview with the special counsel.

Trump and Rudy Giuliani used Twitter and television interviews Sunday to deliver a series of broadsides against special counsel Robert Mueller and federal prosecutors in New York. Giuliani said he was ""disgusted"" by the tactics used by Mueller in his probe into Russian election interference, including in securing guilty pleas from the president's former national security adviser Michael Flynn on a charge of lying to federal investigators.

Trump, Giuliani said, would not submit to an interview by Mueller's team.

""They're a joke,"" Giuliani told ""Fox News Sunday."" ''Over my dead body, but, you know, I could be dead.""

The special counsel, who is investigating possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russia, has continued to request an interview with the president. Last month, the White House sent written answers in response to the special counsel's questions about possible collusion. The White House has resisted answering questions on possible obstruction of justice.

Child's death highlights communication barriers on border

Shortly before a 7-year-old Guatemalan girl died in U.S. custody, her father signed a form stating that his daughter was in good health. But it's unclear how much the man understood on the form, which was written in English and read to him in Spanish by Border Patrol agents.

The death of Jakelin Caal highlights the communication challenges along the U.S.-Mexico border as agents come in contact with an increasing number of migrants who speak neither English nor Spanish.

Her father's native language is the Mayan tongue known as Q'eqchi'. His second language is Spanish. It's unclear whether something was lost in translation or whether it would have made a difference in saving Jakelin after the two were detained and underwent a health screening along a remote stretch of U.S.-Mexico border. But the case raises questions about the Border Patrol's use of English-only forms.

All agents are required to speak Spanish, and they receive formal Spanish training. Reading forms in Spanish is often enough to pose basic questions. But some other Spanish-speaking migrants reported signing paperwork that they later said they did not understand.

Scores of immigrant parents who were separated from their children after crossing the border in the spring said they signed forms agreeing to be deported with the understanding that their kids would be returning with them, only to find themselves deported without them. Many had to wait months before being reunited with them in their homelands.

Talks adopt 'rulebook' to put Paris climate deal into action

KATOWICE, Poland (AP) -- Almost 200 nations, including the world's top greenhouse gas producers, China and the United States, have adopted a set of rules meant to breathe life into the 2015 Paris climate accord by setting out how countries should report their emissions and efforts to reduce them.

But negotiators delayed other key decisions until next year -- a move that frustrated environmentalists and countries that wanted more ambitious goals in light of scientists' warnings that the world must shift sharply away from fossil fuels in the coming decade.

""The majority of the rulebook for the Paris agreement has been created, which is something to be thankful for,"" said Mohamed Adow, a climate policy expert at Christian Aid. ""But the fact countries had to be dragged kicking and screaming to the finish line shows that some nations have not woken up"" to the dire consequences of global warming as outlined in a report by the U.N Panel on Climate Change, or IPCC.

Officials at the talks, which ended late Saturday in the Polish city of Katowice, agreed upon universal rules on how nations can cut emissions. Poor countries secured assurances on financial support to help them reduce emissions, adapt to changes such as rising sea levels and pay for damage that has already happened.

""Through this package, you have made a thousand little steps forward together,"" said Michal Kurtyka, a senior Polish official who led the talks.

French city honors victims of Christmas market attack

PARIS (AP) -- People filled a square in the French city of Strasbourg on Sunday to show respect and sympathy for the victims of last week's shooting attack near a famous Christmas market as the death toll rose to five.

French authorities said a Polish man died in a Strasbourg hospital Sunday, one of a dozen people wounded in last Tuesday's attack. Poland's Foreign Ministry extended condolences Sunday on Twitter to his family.

According to the newspaper DNA, more than 1,000 people attended the memorial, which ended with a minute of applause and a rendition of France's national anthem, ""La Marseillaise.""

The hour-long ceremony took place in Kleber Square, not far from where a gunman opened fire on Tuesday evening. Strasbourg Mayor Roland Ries praised the city's resilience in the face of hardship.

The ""extremely large crowd in the Christmas market"" on Saturday ""was an illustration of our commitment to these values ??on which our living together is based, which we will continue to defend against all those who want to attack it,"" Ries said.

Not into bingo, 84-year-old Texas woman gets college degree

RICHARDSON, Texas (AP) -- After raising five kids and retiring at age 77 from her secretarial job, Janet Fein couldn't be blamed for finally relaxing, but that's not her.

Fein, now 84, went to back to school and will accomplish a long-held goal this week when she graduates from the University of Texas at Dallas with a bachelor's degree.

""I didn't have anything to do in retirement and I didn't think that playing bingo was up to my speed,"" said Fein, who majored in sociology because she felt it was ""substantial.""

She said she enjoyed all the reading and writing papers. ""With each class I already knew a lot, but then I also learned a lot. And that made me happy,"" she said.

People 65 and older make up less than one percent of U.S. college students. In 2015, they accounted for about 67,000 of about 20 million college students, according to the National Center for Education Statistics.

Next-generation of GPS satellites are headed to space

DENVER (AP) -- After months of delays, the U.S. Air Force is about to launch the first of a new generation of GPS satellites, designed to be more accurate, secure and versatile.

But some of their most highly touted features will not be fully available until 2022 or later because of problems in a companion program to develop a new ground control system for the satellites, government auditors said.

The satellite is scheduled to lift off Tuesday from Cape Canaveral, Florida, aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. It's the first of 32 planned GPS III satellites that will replace older ones now in orbit. Lockheed Martin is building the new satellites outside Denver.

GPS is best-known for its widespread civilian applications, from navigation to time-stamping bank transactions. The Air Force estimates that 4 billion people worldwide use the system.

But it was developed by the U.S. military, which still designs, launches and operates the system. The Air Force controls a constellation of 31 GPS satellites from a high-security complex at Schriever Air Force Base outside Colorado Springs.

After fraud probe, new primary may replace GOP candidate

RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- Legislation quickly passed by North Carolina's lawmakers this week would prepare a path for Republicans to dump their nominee in a still-undecided U.S. House race marred with ballot fraud allegations.

""I think (legislators are) worried that Mark Harris might be damaged goods and they want to have the opportunity to have a different Republican nominee,"" said Carter Wrenn, a Republican operative and consultant to former U.S. Sen. Jesse Helms and others for more than 40 years. ""That's how I read those tea leaves.""

If the state elections board decides ballot irregularities or other problems cast the true outcome into doubt and force a redo, the legislation -- if allowed to go into law by Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper -- would require new primary elections in the 9th Congressional District race, in addition to a new general election.

That would allow Republicans another look at Mark Harris, the Republican who led Democrat Dan McCready by 905 votes in unofficial results. Harris hasn't been certified the winner, and an investigation is looking into missing absentee ballots in rural Bladen County and whether unsealed ballots illegally handled by collection teams there could have been altered.

Bladen was the only county among the eight within the 9th District where Harris won a majority of mail-in absentee ballots over McCready.

Top of mind: 'Justice' is Merriam-Webster's word of the year

NEW YORK (AP) -- Racial justice. Obstruction of justice. Social justice. The Justice Department. Merriam-Webster has chosen ""justice"" as its 2018 word of the year, driven by the churning news cycle over months and months.

The word follows ""toxic,"" picked by Oxford Dictionaries, and ""misinformation,"" plucked by Dictonary.com.

Peter Sokolowski, Merriam-Webster's editor at large, told The Associated Press ahead of Monday's announcement that ""justice"" consistently bubbled into the top 20 or 30 lookups on the company's website, spiking at times due to specific events but also skating close to the surface for much of the year.

While it's one of those common words people likely know how to spell and use correctly in a sentence, Sokolowski pointed to other reasons that drive search traffic. Among them is an attempt to focus a train of thought around a philosophical problem, or to seek aspirational motivation. Such well-known words are often among the most looked up every year, including those that are slightly abstract, including ""love,"" he said.

The designation for ""justice"" came soon after President Trump's one-time fixer, Michael Cohen, was sentenced to three years in prison for crimes that included arranging the payment of hush money to conceal his boss' alleged sexual affairs. He told a judge he agreed time and again to cover up Trump's ""dirty deeds"" out of ""blind loyalty.""

'Spider-Verse' swings to the top; 'Mortal Engines' tanks

LOS ANGELES (AP) -- ""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse"" swung to the top of the domestic box office in its first weekend in theaters, proving that there is widespread audience interest in big screen animated versions of Marvel's marquee superheroes.

The film led a host of newcomers that debuted to varying success on this pre-Christmas holiday weekend, including Clint Eastwood's drug smuggling drama ""The Mule"" and the Peter Jackson-produced epic ""Mortal Engines"" which bombed in North American theaters.

""Into the Spider-Verse"" earned an estimated $35.4 million from 3,813 theaters against a $90 million production budget according to Sony Pictures on Sunday, which is a record for animated movies in December (although the hybrid ""Alvin and the Chipmunks"" movies were higher). The film features an innovative animation style -- both CGI and hand-drawn -- and focuses on the Miles Morales character as he learns to become the famed web-slinger. It's another financial win for the studio's latest ""expanded Spider-Man universe"" strategy following ""Venom"" and ""Spider-Man: Homecoming.""

And ""Spider-Verse"" has been very well-received among critics, and audiences in exit surveys gave it a rare A+ CinemaScore -- a first for a Spider-Man film. It's also been nominated for a Golden Globe award for best animated feature and picked up a few honors from critics' groups as well, including the New York Film Critics Circle.

""We are playing to both families and fanboys. We're an all-audience film,"" said Adrian Smith, Sony's president of domestic distribution."
360,lexington herald leader,https://www.kentucky.com/news/business/article224126560.html,"The Latest on President Donald Trump and the partial government shutdown (all times local):

3:16 p.m.

Congressional leaders from both parties have returned to the White House for another round of negotiations with President Donald Trump on the ongoing partial government shutdown.

The two sides have made no apparent progress in the past week, with Trump sticking to his demand of $5.7 billion for a border barrier and Democrats insisting they won't give him the money.

Trump has been making a public case that there is a ""crisis"" at the southern border. And he's still threatening to declare a national emergency to circumvent Congress if he can't get the wall money from them.

He told reporters during a visit to the Capitol earlier Wednesday that he may turn to a declaration ""at some point"" if top Democrats Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi ""don't agree"" with his assessment about the problems at the border.

President Donald Trump says Republicans are ""totally unified"" in the shutdown standoff over his long-promised southern border wall, though some GOP lawmakers have been expressing concern about the 19-day partial government closure.

Trump traveled to Capitol Hill on Wednesday to meet with Senate Republicans. He says there was ""no discussion about anything other than solidarity.""

Trump has been considering a national emergency declaration to bypass Congress to build the wall. He says he ""may do that at some point"" if he can't get a deal with Democrats.

Trump also plans to meet with top congressional Democrats and Republicans at the White House on Wednesday.

President Donald Trump arrived on Capitol Hill claiming he has ""tremendous"" support as he headed into a meeting with Republican senators uneasy with the government shutdown over his border wall.

Asked how long the shutdown would last, Trump told reporters Wednesday ""whatever it takes.""

The partial shutdown is now in its 19th day, the second longest ever.

Trump and Vice President Mike Pence arrived for the private lunch meeting with the Senate GOP caucus to shore up support.

Several Republican senators have said the government should be re-opened while talks continue over border security and Trump's demand for money to build the wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.

President Donald Trump says he thinks he and the Democrats are ""getting closer"" to a deal to end the budget stalemate that has partially shut down the government despite no evidence that any progress has been made.

And he's suggesting the partial government shutdown could be ""a blessing in disguise"" because, he suggests, it could lead to a broader immigration deal.

Trump spoke Wednesday during an Oval Office bill signing on anti-human trafficking legislation. It's a day after he delivered a prime-time address trying to make the case for his long-stalled U.S.-Mexico border wall.

Trump says that he would like to see ""real immigration reform in this country because we need it."" He says, ""Everybody wants to see immigration reform,"" adding that perhaps the stalemate ""will turn out to be a blessing in disguise.""

Gone are the days when the U.S. and Mexican governments regularly exchanged statements over President Donald Trump's insistence on a border wall.

Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said Wednesday he won't be drawn into what he calls a U.S. internal dispute, an apparent reference to the 19-day-old partial U.S. government shutdown over a border barrier.

Lopez Obrador says, ""We are not going to respond to situations arising from internal affairs in the United States.""

Unlike his predecessor, the Mexican leader didn't have to respond to any specific aspersion about Mexico, because Trump didn't make any in his Tuesday night address to the American public. Relations between the two leaders have been surprisingly cordial, given their ideological differences.

Lopez Obrador said, ""Of course, there are those ... who want us to get into a confrontation. We always want a friendly relationship with the United States, a cooperative relationship.""

As a presidential candidate Trump promised Mexico would pay for a border wall, but Mexico refused.

President Donald Trump is using a bill signing focused on curbing human trafficking to push his case for a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border.

Trump says a southern border that is not secured exacerbates the incidents of human trafficking. He says, ""As long as we have a border that is not secure, we're going to suffer the consequences of that.""

Wednesday's bill signing came a day after Trump's prime-time speech designed to persuade Americans that illegal immigration and trafficking at the border are a crisis.

Democrats have called Trump's promised wall costly, ineffective and ""immoral"" and say he's ""manufacturing a crisis.""

The bill Trump signed is designed to enhance an annual State Department report that measures global efforts to eliminate human trafficking.

The White House says it's the fourth bipartisan bill the Republican president has signed in the last few weeks to prevent human trafficking.

Congressional Democrats say they'll head to the White House with the plan to reopen the government -- the same one they've been presenting. They're asking President Donald Trump to accept a bipartisan bill to fund border security without the wall.

Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Wednesday the president ""could end the Trump shutdown and re-open the government today, and he should.""

Pelosi and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer spoke at an event where they were flanked by federal workers going without pay during the shutdown, now in its 19th day.

Schumer called workers the ""collateral damage"" of Trump's ""temper tantrum."" He said the president failed to ""persuade a soul"" during his ""divisive"" prime-time address Tuesday night to the nation.

Trump meets with congressional leaders at the White House Wednesday afternoon. He rejected the Senate's bipartisan funding bill in December, sparking the shutdown.

The White House is trying to keep jittery congressional Republicans from defecting over the toll the partial government shutdown is taking in their states.

President Donald Trump and Democrats have been at an impasse over funding for his proposed border wall, which has led to a partial government shutdown, now in its 19th day.

Trump meets with Senate Republicans Wednesday on Capitol Hill just hours after he argued on national television that a border wall was needed to resolve a security and humanitarian ""crisis.""

Senators say the shutdown has led to disruptions in agricultural payments for farmers, as well as for home buyers trying to secure government-backed home loans. Lawmakers also are worried about missed paychecks for government workers Friday.

As many as half a dozen GOP senators have said the government should reopen while border security negotiations with Democrats continue.

President Donald Trump again linked illegal immigration along the southern border with drugs and violent crime as he urged Democratic lawmakers to fund his proposed border wall.

In his first national address from the Oval Office, the president gave no indication he was softening his stance that the partial government shutdown would continue without money for the wall.

Trump argued Tuesday night that the wall was needed to resolve what he called a security and humanitarian ""crisis.""

He addressed the nation as the shutdown stretched through its third week, with hundreds of thousands of federal workers going without pay and some congressional Republicans growing increasingly jittery about the impasse.

Trump plans to visit Senate Republicans at the Capitol on Wednesday before meeting with Democratic leaders at the White House."
361,lexington herald leader,https://www.kentucky.com/news/politics-government/national-politics/article224069750.html,"With illegal immigration at its lowest level in a decade, it's nothing short of stunning that the federal government is shut down over funding for a border wall.

Yet here we are, entering a third week of the shutdown because President Donald Trump has inexplicably chosen to dig his heels in on getting $5 billion to build a wall along stretches of the U.S. border with Mexico that do not already have such a barrier in place.

""As long as it takes,"" Trump said last week when asked how long he was willing to let the shutdown last. ""I mean, look, I'm prepared. I think the people of the country think I'm right. I think the people of this country think I'm right.""

Except, polling shows the opposite. Major polls conducted last month by Quinnipiac, Harvard, NPR and others all showed that a majority of Americans do not support the wall. And the number of wall supporters shrinks even more when asked if it is worth shutting down the government over.

The reality is that immigration from Mexico has been decreasing since 2007, and the number of unauthorized immigrants living in the U.S. is at its lowest level since 2004, according to the Pew Research Center.

Further, the majority of illegal immigration to the United States from Mexico occurs in and around heavily secured ports of entry like San Diego, El Paso and Brownsville, Texas, where 654 miles of wall, fencing and other barriers already exist. Spending billions to build a structure along vast, rural stretches of the border doesn't help with security at the sections of the border that most need help.

No one is arguing for unsecure borders. The newly installed Democratic Congress voted Thursday to approve a stopgap funding bill that would reopen the federal government and provide $1.3 billion for border security in the form of manpower and equipment but not a wall. Trump has said he won't sign it, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell refuses to let a bill come to the Senate floor that the president won't sign.

It's hard to know what the president's end game is. He couldn't get the border wall approved when Republicans controlled both the House and the Senate, so it seems odd to take this stance on the heels of a midterm election in which Democrats made their biggest gains in 40 years and took control of the House.

Trump may feel he is being true to his base of ardent supporters, among whom the border wall ranked high on their list of priorities. But his focus is sorely misplaced. Rather, his attention should be focused on the independent voters who took a chance on him in 2016 believing his style could prove effective at getting things done in Washington. Shutting down the federal government in an effort to get $5 billion for a wall that most Americans don't feel the country needs is the opposite of getting things done.

Laura Kelly is already on the case for Kansas kids with decision to name new DCF leader ' The Kansas City Star

This is why voters elected incoming Gov. Laura Kelly: Because we need to do so much better for Kansas children, because we badly need transparency in state government and because there is zero time to waste in recovering all that was lost under Governors Sam Brownback and Jeff Colyer.

So good for her for marching so briskly into 2019. On Thursday, Kelly announced that she will replace Gina Meier-Hummel as head of the state's child welfare system. The Kansas Department for Children and Families was on what seemed like permanent crisis footing long before Meier-Hummel got there in fall of 2017. But it has remained troubled under her sometimes questionable leadership, and a change was in order.

Meier-Hummel had a difficult job and did make some improvements, which began with a top-to-bottom audit.

But she talked about transparency and didn't show enough of it. She decided to hire inexperienced and unlicensed social workers to fill jobs investigating reports of abuse and neglect. And she replaced contracts for foster care, family preservation and other services with grants that got around rules on no-bid arrangements.

Kelly asked the Colyer administration that she'll soon supplant -- in 11 days, her announcement noted, and we're glad she's counting -- not to implement those grants at this point. Meier-Hummel immediately said she'd honor that request.

The governor-elect also said outright that the state's procurement process wasn't followed and that agency officials had tried to keep her from learning more about how the grantees were chosen.

We wanted Kelly to clean house and name names, for the sake of the state's struggling families, and she's already doing that.

As The Star has reported, the agency gave a major grant to a Florida nonprofit already facing heavy criticism for its foster care. An agency spokeswoman argued that they'd been hired to provide family preservation services, not foster care, but it's still the same nonprofit group.

Meier-Hummel will be succeeded on an interim basis by Laura Howard, who for now will head both the DCF and the Kansas Department for Aging and Disability Services. A former regional administrator in a federal agency overseeing substance abuse and mental health services, Howard is currently director of the Public Management Center in the School of Public Affairs and Administration at the University of Kansas.

Meier-Hummel responded to Kelly's no-nonsense announcement with a news release of her own.

362,the bulletin,http://www.norwichbulletin.com/news/20190111/shutdown-suspends-federal-cleanups-at-us-superfund-sites?rssfeed=true,"BIRMINGHAM, Ala. -- The government shutdown has suspended federal cleanups at Superfund sites around the nation and forced the cancellation of public hearings, deepening the mistrust and resentment of surrounding residents who feel people in power long ago abandoned them to live among the toxic residue of the country's factories and mines.

""We are already hurting, and it's just adding more fuel to the fire,"" says 40-year-old Keisha Brown, whose wood-frame home is in a community nestled among coking plants and other factories on Birmingham's north side.

The mostly African-American community has been forced to cope with high levels of arsenic, lead and other contaminants in the soil that the Environmental Protection Agency has been scraping up and carting away, house by house.

As President Donald Trump and Congress battle over Trump's demand for a wall on the southern U.S. border, the nearly 3-week-old partial government shutdown has stopped federal work on Superfund sites except for cases where the administration deems ""there is an imminent threat to the safety of human life or to the protection of property.""

EPA's shutdown plans said the agency would evaluate about 800 Superfund sites to see how many could pose an immediate threat. As an example of that kind of threat, it cited an acid leak from a mine that could threaten the public water supply. That's the hazard at Northern California's Iron Mountain mine, where EPA workers help prevent an unending flow of lethally acidic runoff off the Superfund site from spilling into rivers downstream.

Practically speaking, said Bonnie Bellow, a former EPA official who worked on Superfund public outreach at the agency, the impact of the stoppage of work at sites across the nation ""wholly depends"" on the length of the shutdown.

""Unless there is immediate risk like a storm, a flood, a week or two of slowdowns is not going to very likely affect the cleanup at the site,"" Bellow said.

In north Birmingham, Brown said it's been a couple of weeks since she's spotted any EPA crews at people's houses. It wasn't clear if state workers or contractors were continuing work.

But long before the shutdown began, Brown harbored doubts the cleanup was working anyway. ""My main concern is the health of the people out here,"" said Brown, who has asthma. ""All of us are sick, and we've got to function on medicine every day.""

In terms of time, the federal government shutdown is a chronological blip in the long history of the site -- which includes ethics charges in a local bribery scandal to block federal cleanup efforts -- but adds to the uncertainty in an area where residents feel forgotten and betrayed.

At the EPA, the shutdown has furloughed the bulk of the agency's roughly 14,000 employees. It also means the EPA isn't getting most of the daily stream of environmental questions and tips from the public. Routine inspections aren't happening. State, local and private emails to EPA officials often get automated messages back promising a response when the shutdown ends.

In Montana, for instance, state officials this month found themselves fielding calls from a tribal member worried about drinking water with a funny look to it, said Kristi Ponozzo, public-policy director at that state's Department of Environmental Quality. The EPA normally provides tribes with technical assistance on water supplies.

With most EPA colleagues idled, Ponozzo said, her agency also had to call off an environmental review meeting for a mining project, potentially delaying the project.

But it's the agency's work at Superfund sites -- lessening the threat from old nuclear-weapons plants, chemical factories, mines and other entities -- that gets much of the attention.

Absent imminent peril, it would be up to state governments or contractors to continue any cleanup during the shutdown ""up to the point that additional EPA direction or funding is needed,"" the EPA said in a statement.

""Sites where cleanup activities have been stopped or shut down will be secured until cleanup activities are able to commence when the federal government reopens,"" the agency said.

For federal Superfund sites in Michigan, the shutdown means there are no EPA colleagues to consult, said Scott Dean, a spokesman for that state's Department of Environmental Quality.

At Michigan Superfund sites, day-to-day field operations were continuing since private contractors do most of the on-the-ground work, Dean said.

Bellow, the former EPA official, said the cancellation of hearings about Superfund sites posed immediate concerns.

In East Chicago, Indiana, for example, the EPA called off a planned public hearing set for last Wednesday to outline how the agency planned to clean up high levels of lead and arsenic in the soil.

The EPA has proposed a seven-month, $26.5 million cleanup that includes treating and removing tainted soil from the area, where a lead smelter previously was located.

During a public meeting Nov. 29, some residents complained that the EPA's approach would leave too much pollution in place. But others didn't get a chance to speak and were hoping to do so at the meeting this week, said Debbie Chizewer, a Northwestern University environmental attorney who represents community groups in the low-income area.

The EPA announced the cancellation in an online notice and gave no indication that it would be rescheduled.

Leaders of the East Chicago Calumet Community Advisory Group asked for a new hearing date and an extension of a Jan. 14 public comment deadline in a letter to the EPA's regional Superfund division.

Calls by The Associated Press to the agency's regional office in Chicago this week were not answered.

Local critics fear the EPA will use the delay caused by the shutdown as justification for pushing ahead with a cleanup strategy they consider flawed, Chizewer said, even though the agency has designated the affected area as an ""environmental justice community"" -- a low-income community of color that has been disproportionately harmed by pollution.

The EPA has a ""special obligation"" when dealing with such communities, Chizewer said. ""This would be an example of shutting them out for no good reason.""

In North Birmingham, former longtime neighborhood resident Charlie Powell said most of people living in and around the Superfund site had already ""just got tired and fed up.""

Powell left the area but started a group called PANIC, People Against Neighborhood Industrial Contamination. He believes money would be better spent helping residents move away from the pollution.

""Can I say hell?"" Powell said when asked what residents have been through.

363,idaho statesman,https://www.idahostatesman.com/news/nation-world/article224499960.html,"Congress returns to Washington for its first full week of legislative business since control of the House reverted to Democrats, but lawmakers will be confronted with the same lingering question: When will the partial government shutdown end?

One Republican senator says he's offered President Donald Trump a possible solution, though it may just be wishful thinking.

Sen. Lindsey Graham is encouraging Trump to reopen government for several weeks to continue negotiating with Democrats over the border wall Trump wants to build on the U.S.-Mexico border. If there's no deal at the end of that time, Graham says Trump would be free to take the more dramatic step of declaring a national emergency to build it.

But the South Carolina Republican says Trump still wants a deal on funding for the wall before agreeing to reopen shuttered government departments. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat, insists Trump reopen the government first.

Their weeks-old standoff led to the partial government shutdown, now on day 24 without a clear end in sight.

""Before he pulls the plug on the legislative option, and I think we're almost there, I would urge him to open up the government for a short period of time, like three weeks, before he pulls the plug, see if we can get a deal,"" Graham said. ""If we can't at the end of three weeks, all bets are off.

""See if he can do it by himself through the emergency powers. That's my recommendation,"" added Graham, who has publicly pushed Trump to use his authority to declare a national emergency to build the wall. Such a step would allow Trump to bypass Congress and tap various pots of unspent federal money, including for military construction and disaster relief as well as from assets seized by law enforcement, to pay for the wall.

Trump has kept Washington on edge over whether he would resort to such a declaration, citing what he says is a ""crisis"" of drug smuggling and the trafficking of women and children at the border. The president initially sounded as though such a move was imminent, but then pulled back. He has said several times since he first mentioned the idea in public this month that he prefers a legislative solution.

A key question is how much more time is Trump willing to give lawmakers. Graham, who spoke with Trump by telephone on Sunday morning, said the legislative path ""is just about shut off"" and blamed intransigence by Pelosi.

The speaker's office had no immediate comment.

Democrats oppose an emergency declaration but may be powerless to block it. Some Republicans are wary, too, fearing how a future Democratic president might use that authority. Such a move, should Trump ultimately go that route, would almost certainly be challenged in the courts.

Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., called Graham's idea to reopen the government a ""great place to start.""

""I do think if we reopen the government, if the president ends this shutdown crisis, we have folks who can negotiate a responsible, modern investment in technology that will actually make us safer,"" Coons said.

Trump says technology is nice, but that the border can't be secured without a wall.

The White House has been laying the groundwork for an emergency declaration, which is feared by lawmakers in both parties.

Senate Homeland Security Committee Chairman Ron Johnson, R-Wis., said he'd ""hate to see"" a declaration issued because the wall wouldn't get built, presumably because of legal challenges. Democrats voted in the past for border security and should again, he said.

""I actually want to see this wall get built,"" Johnson said. ""I want to keep pressure on Democrats to actually come to the negotiating table in good faith and fund what they have supported in the past.""

Graham favors a declaration and said the time for talk is running out.

""It's the last option, not the first option, but we're pretty close to that being the only option,"" he said.

Graham and Coons spoke on ""Fox News Sunday"" and Johnson appeared on CNN's ""State of the Union."""

WASHINGTON (AP) -- The White House on Sunday pushed the federal government closer to the brink of a partial shutdown later this week, digging in on its demand for $5 billion to build a border wall as congressional Democrats stood firm against it.

""We're going to do whatever is necessary to build the border wall to stop this ongoing crisis of illegal immigration,"" said White House senior adviser Stephen Miller.

Asked if that meant having a government shutdown, he said: ""If it comes to it, absolutely.""

Trump said last week he would be ""proud"" to have a shutdown to get Congress to approve a $5 billion down payment to fulfill his campaign promise to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. But the president doesn't have the votes from the Republican-controlled Congress to support funding for the wall at that level.

Democratic congressional leaders, Sen. Chuck Schumer and Rep. Nancy Pelosi, have proposed no more than $1.6 billion, as outlined in a bipartisan Senate bill. The money would not go for the wall but for fencing upgrades and other border security. Democrats also offered to simply keep funding at its current level, $1.3 billion.

Trump lawyer Giuliani rules out Mueller interview with Trump

WASHINGTON (AP) -- With a number of probes moving closer to the Oval Office, President Donald Trump and his attorney unleashed a fresh series of attacks on the investigators, questioning their integrity while categorically ruling out the possibility of a presidential interview with the special counsel.

Trump and Rudy Giuliani used Twitter and television interviews Sunday to deliver a series of broadsides against special counsel Robert Mueller and federal prosecutors in New York. Giuliani said he was ""disgusted"" by the tactics used by Mueller in his probe into Russian election interference, including in securing guilty pleas from the president's former national security adviser Michael Flynn on a charge of lying to federal investigators.

Trump, Giuliani said, would not submit to an interview by Mueller's team.

""They're a joke,"" Giuliani told ""Fox News Sunday."" ''Over my dead body, but, you know, I could be dead.""

The special counsel, who is investigating possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russia, has continued to request an interview with the president. Last month, the White House sent written answers in response to the special counsel's questions about possible collusion. The White House has resisted answering questions on possible obstruction of justice.

Child's death highlights communication barriers on border

Shortly before a 7-year-old Guatemalan girl died in U.S. custody, her father signed a form stating that his daughter was in good health. But it's unclear how much the man understood on the form, which was written in English and read to him in Spanish by Border Patrol agents.

The death of Jakelin Caal highlights the communication challenges along the U.S.-Mexico border as agents come in contact with an increasing number of migrants who speak neither English nor Spanish.

Her father's native language is the Mayan tongue known as Q'eqchi'. His second language is Spanish. It's unclear whether something was lost in translation or whether it would have made a difference in saving Jakelin after the two were detained and underwent a health screening along a remote stretch of U.S.-Mexico border. But the case raises questions about the Border Patrol's use of English-only forms.

All agents are required to speak Spanish, and they receive formal Spanish training. Reading forms in Spanish is often enough to pose basic questions. But some other Spanish-speaking migrants reported signing paperwork that they later said they did not understand.

Scores of immigrant parents who were separated from their children after crossing the border in the spring said they signed forms agreeing to be deported with the understanding that their kids would be returning with them, only to find themselves deported without them. Many had to wait months before being reunited with them in their homelands.

Talks adopt 'rulebook' to put Paris climate deal into action

KATOWICE, Poland (AP) -- Almost 200 nations, including the world's top greenhouse gas producers, China and the United States, have adopted a set of rules meant to breathe life into the 2015 Paris climate accord by setting out how countries should report their emissions and efforts to reduce them.

But negotiators delayed other key decisions until next year -- a move that frustrated environmentalists and countries that wanted more ambitious goals in light of scientists' warnings that the world must shift sharply away from fossil fuels in the coming decade.

""The majority of the rulebook for the Paris agreement has been created, which is something to be thankful for,"" said Mohamed Adow, a climate policy expert at Christian Aid. ""But the fact countries had to be dragged kicking and screaming to the finish line shows that some nations have not woken up"" to the dire consequences of global warming as outlined in a report by the U.N Panel on Climate Change, or IPCC.

Officials at the talks, which ended late Saturday in the Polish city of Katowice, agreed upon universal rules on how nations can cut emissions. Poor countries secured assurances on financial support to help them reduce emissions, adapt to changes such as rising sea levels and pay for damage that has already happened.

""Through this package, you have made a thousand little steps forward together,"" said Michal Kurtyka, a senior Polish official who led the talks.

French city honors victims of Christmas market attack

PARIS (AP) -- People filled a square in the French city of Strasbourg on Sunday to show respect and sympathy for the victims of last week's shooting attack near a famous Christmas market as the death toll rose to five.

French authorities said a Polish man died in a Strasbourg hospital Sunday, one of a dozen people wounded in last Tuesday's attack. Poland's Foreign Ministry extended condolences Sunday on Twitter to his family.

According to the newspaper DNA, more than 1,000 people attended the memorial, which ended with a minute of applause and a rendition of France's national anthem, ""La Marseillaise.""

The hour-long ceremony took place in Kleber Square, not far from where a gunman opened fire on Tuesday evening. Strasbourg Mayor Roland Ries praised the city's resilience in the face of hardship.

The ""extremely large crowd in the Christmas market"" on Saturday ""was an illustration of our commitment to these values ??on which our living together is based, which we will continue to defend against all those who want to attack it,"" Ries said.

Not into bingo, 84-year-old Texas woman gets college degree

RICHARDSON, Texas (AP) -- After raising five kids and retiring at age 77 from her secretarial job, Janet Fein couldn't be blamed for finally relaxing, but that's not her.

Fein, now 84, went to back to school and will accomplish a long-held goal this week when she graduates from the University of Texas at Dallas with a bachelor's degree.

""I didn't have anything to do in retirement and I didn't think that playing bingo was up to my speed,"" said Fein, who majored in sociology because she felt it was ""substantial.""

She said she enjoyed all the reading and writing papers. ""With each class I already knew a lot, but then I also learned a lot. And that made me happy,"" she said.

People 65 and older make up less than one percent of U.S. college students. In 2015, they accounted for about 67,000 of about 20 million college students, according to the National Center for Education Statistics.

Next-generation of GPS satellites are headed to space

DENVER (AP) -- After months of delays, the U.S. Air Force is about to launch the first of a new generation of GPS satellites, designed to be more accurate, secure and versatile.

But some of their most highly touted features will not be fully available until 2022 or later because of problems in a companion program to develop a new ground control system for the satellites, government auditors said.

The satellite is scheduled to lift off Tuesday from Cape Canaveral, Florida, aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. It's the first of 32 planned GPS III satellites that will replace older ones now in orbit. Lockheed Martin is building the new satellites outside Denver.

GPS is best-known for its widespread civilian applications, from navigation to time-stamping bank transactions. The Air Force estimates that 4 billion people worldwide use the system.

But it was developed by the U.S. military, which still designs, launches and operates the system. The Air Force controls a constellation of 31 GPS satellites from a high-security complex at Schriever Air Force Base outside Colorado Springs.

After fraud probe, new primary may replace GOP candidate

RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- Legislation quickly passed by North Carolina's lawmakers this week would prepare a path for Republicans to dump their nominee in a still-undecided U.S. House race marred with ballot fraud allegations.

""I think (legislators are) worried that Mark Harris might be damaged goods and they want to have the opportunity to have a different Republican nominee,"" said Carter Wrenn, a Republican operative and consultant to former U.S. Sen. Jesse Helms and others for more than 40 years. ""That's how I read those tea leaves.""

If the state elections board decides ballot irregularities or other problems cast the true outcome into doubt and force a redo, the legislation -- if allowed to go into law by Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper -- would require new primary elections in the 9th Congressional District race, in addition to a new general election.

That would allow Republicans another look at Mark Harris, the Republican who led Democrat Dan McCready by 905 votes in unofficial results. Harris hasn't been certified the winner, and an investigation is looking into missing absentee ballots in rural Bladen County and whether unsealed ballots illegally handled by collection teams there could have been altered.

Bladen was the only county among the eight within the 9th District where Harris won a majority of mail-in absentee ballots over McCready.

Top of mind: 'Justice' is Merriam-Webster's word of the year

NEW YORK (AP) -- Racial justice. Obstruction of justice. Social justice. The Justice Department. Merriam-Webster has chosen ""justice"" as its 2018 word of the year, driven by the churning news cycle over months and months.

The word follows ""toxic,"" picked by Oxford Dictionaries, and ""misinformation,"" plucked by Dictonary.com.

Peter Sokolowski, Merriam-Webster's editor at large, told The Associated Press ahead of Monday's announcement that ""justice"" consistently bubbled into the top 20 or 30 lookups on the company's website, spiking at times due to specific events but also skating close to the surface for much of the year.

While it's one of those common words people likely know how to spell and use correctly in a sentence, Sokolowski pointed to other reasons that drive search traffic. Among them is an attempt to focus a train of thought around a philosophical problem, or to seek aspirational motivation. Such well-known words are often among the most looked up every year, including those that are slightly abstract, including ""love,"" he said.

The designation for ""justice"" came soon after President Trump's one-time fixer, Michael Cohen, was sentenced to three years in prison for crimes that included arranging the payment of hush money to conceal his boss' alleged sexual affairs. He told a judge he agreed time and again to cover up Trump's ""dirty deeds"" out of ""blind loyalty.""

'Spider-Verse' swings to the top; 'Mortal Engines' tanks

LOS ANGELES (AP) -- ""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse"" swung to the top of the domestic box office in its first weekend in theaters, proving that there is widespread audience interest in big screen animated versions of Marvel's marquee superheroes.

The film led a host of newcomers that debuted to varying success on this pre-Christmas holiday weekend, including Clint Eastwood's drug smuggling drama ""The Mule"" and the Peter Jackson-produced epic ""Mortal Engines"" which bombed in North American theaters.

""Into the Spider-Verse"" earned an estimated $35.4 million from 3,813 theaters against a $90 million production budget according to Sony Pictures on Sunday, which is a record for animated movies in December (although the hybrid ""Alvin and the Chipmunks"" movies were higher). The film features an innovative animation style -- both CGI and hand-drawn -- and focuses on the Miles Morales character as he learns to become the famed web-slinger. It's another financial win for the studio's latest ""expanded Spider-Man universe"" strategy following ""Venom"" and ""Spider-Man: Homecoming.""

And ""Spider-Verse"" has been very well-received among critics, and audiences in exit surveys gave it a rare A+ CinemaScore -- a first for a Spider-Man film. It's also been nominated for a Golden Globe award for best animated feature and picked up a few honors from critics' groups as well, including the New York Film Critics Circle.

""We are playing to both families and fanboys. We're an all-audience film,"" said Adrian Smith, Sony's president of domestic distribution."
365,medicine hat news,https://medicinehatnews.com/news/world-news/2019/01/11/federal-work-at-superfund-sites-suspended-during-shutdown/,"By Ellen Knickmeyer And Kim Chandler, The Associated Press on January 11, 2019.

BIRMINGHAM, Ala. - The government shutdown has suspended federal cleanups at Superfund sites around the nation and forced the cancellation of public hearings, deepening the mistrust and resentment of surrounding residents who feel people in power long ago abandoned them to live among the toxic residue of the country's factories and mines.

""We are already hurting, and it's just adding more fuel to the fire,"" says 40-year-old Keisha Brown. Her home is in a community nestled among plants that turn coal into carbon-rich fuel and other factories on Birmingham's north side.

The mostly African-American community has been forced to cope with high levels of arsenic, lead and other contaminants in the soil that the Environmental Protection Agency has been scraping up and carting away, house by house.

As President Donald Trump and Congress battle over Trump's demand for a wall on the southern U.S. border, the 3-week-old partial government shutdown has stopped federal work on Superfund sites except for cases where the administration deems ""there is an imminent threat to the safety of human life or to the protection of property.""

EPA's shutdown plans said the agency would evaluate about 800 Superfund sites to see how many could pose an immediate threat. As an example of that kind of threat, it cited an acid leak from a mine that could threaten the public water supply. That's the hazard at Northern California's Iron Mountain mine, where EPA workers help prevent an unending flow of lethally acidic runoff off the Superfund site from spilling into rivers downstream.

Practically speaking, said Bonnie Bellow, a former EPA official who worked on Superfund public outreach at the agency, the impact of the stoppage of work at sites across the nation ""wholly depends"" on the length of the shutdown.

""Unless there is immediate risk like a storm, a flood, a week or two of slowdowns is not going to very likely affect the cleanup at the site,"" Bellow said.

In north Birmingham, Brown said it's been a couple of weeks since she's spotted any EPA crews at people's houses. It was unclear if state workers or contractors were continuing work.

But long before the shutdown began, Brown harboured doubts the cleanup was working anyway.

""My main concern is the health of the people out here,"" said Brown, who has asthma. ""All of us are sick, and we've got to function on medicine every day.""

In terms of time, the federal government shutdown is a chronological blip in the long history of the site - which includes ethics charges in a local bribery scandal to block federal cleanup efforts - but adds to the uncertainty in an area where residents feel forgotten and betrayed.

At the EPA, the shutdown has furloughed the bulk of the agency's roughly 14,000 employees. It also means the EPA isn't getting most of the daily stream of environmental questions and tips from the public. Routine inspections aren't happening. State, local and private emails to EPA officials often get automated messages back promising a response when the shutdown ends.

In Montana, for instance, state officials this month found themselves fielding calls from a tribal member worried about drinking water with a funny look to it, said Kristi Ponozzo, public-policy director at that state's Department of Environmental Quality. The EPA normally provides tribes with technical assistance on water supplies.

With most EPA colleagues idled, Ponozzo said, her agency also had to call off an environmental review meeting for a mining project, potentially delaying the project.

But it's the agency's work at Superfund sites - lessening the threat from old nuclear-weapons plants, chemical factories, mines and other entities - that gets much of the attention.

Absent imminent peril, it would be up to state governments or contractors to continue any cleanup during the shutdown ""up to the point that additional EPA direction or funding is needed,"" the EPA said in a statement.

""Sites where cleanup activities have been stopped or shut down will be secured until cleanup activities are able to commence when the federal government reopens,"" the agency said.

For federal Superfund sites in Michigan, the shutdown means there are no EPA colleagues to consult, said Scott Dean, a spokesman for that state's Department of Environmental Quality.

At Michigan Superfund sites, day-to-day field operations were continuing since private contractors do most of the on-the-ground work, Dean said.

Bellow, the former EPA official, said the cancellation of hearings about Superfund sites posed immediate concerns.

In East Chicago, Indiana, for example, the EPA called off a planned public hearing set for last Wednesday to outline how the agency planned to clean up high levels of lead and arsenic in the soil.

The EPA has proposed a seven-month, $26.5 million cleanup that includes treating and removing tainted soil from the area, where a lead smelter was located.

During a public meeting Nov. 29, some residents complained that the EPA's approach would leave too much pollution in place. Others didn't get a chance to speak and were hoping to do so at the meeting this week, said Debbie Chizewer, a Northwestern University environmental attorney who represents community groups in the low-income area.

The EPA announced the cancellation in an online notice and gave no indication that it would be rescheduled.

Leaders of the East Chicago Calumet Community Advisory Group asked for a new hearing date and an extension of a Jan. 14 public comment deadline in a letter to the EPA's regional Superfund division.

Calls by The Associated Press to the agency's regional office in Chicago this week were not answered.

Local critics fear the EPA will use the delay caused by the shutdown as justification for pushing ahead with a cleanup strategy they consider flawed, Chizewer said, even though the agency has designated the affected area as an ""environmental justice community,"" a low-income community of colour that has been disproportionately harmed by pollution.

The EPA has a ""special obligation"" when dealing with such communities, Chizewer said. ""This would be an example of shutting them out for no good reason.""

In North Birmingham, former longtime neighbourhood resident Charlie Powell said most of the people living in and around the Superfund site had already ""just got tired and fed up.""

Powell left the area but started a group called PANIC, People Against Neighborhood Industrial Contamination. He said he believes money would be better spent helping residents move away from the pollution.

""Can I say hell?"" Powell said when asked what residents have been through.

This story has been corrected to reflect that Keisha Brown's home is not a wood-frame home.

Knickmeyer reported from Washington. Associated Press writers John Flesher in Traverse City, Michigan, and Matthew Brown in Helena, Montana, contributed to this report.

3:16 p.m.

Congressional leaders from both parties have returned to the White House for another round of negotiations with President Donald Trump on the ongoing partial government shutdown.

The two sides have made no apparent progress in the past week, with Trump sticking to his demand of $5.7 billion for a border barrier and Democrats insisting they won't give him the money.

Trump has been making a public case that there is a ""crisis"" at the southern border. And he's still threatening to declare a national emergency to circumvent Congress if he can't get the wall money from them.

He told reporters during a visit to the Capitol earlier Wednesday that he may turn to a declaration ""at some point"" if top Democrats Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi ""don't agree"" with his assessment about the problems at the border.

President Donald Trump says Republicans are ""totally unified"" in the shutdown standoff over his long-promised southern border wall, though some GOP lawmakers have been expressing concern about the 19-day partial government closure.

Trump traveled to Capitol Hill on Wednesday to meet with Senate Republicans. He says there was ""no discussion about anything other than solidarity.""

Trump has been considering a national emergency declaration to bypass Congress to build the wall. He says he ""may do that at some point"" if he can't get a deal with Democrats.

Trump also plans to meet with top congressional Democrats and Republicans at the White House on Wednesday.

President Donald Trump arrived on Capitol Hill claiming he has ""tremendous"" support as he headed into a meeting with Republican senators uneasy with the government shutdown over his border wall.

Asked how long the shutdown would last, Trump told reporters Wednesday ""whatever it takes.""

The partial shutdown is now in its 19th day, the second longest ever.

Trump and Vice President Mike Pence arrived for the private lunch meeting with the Senate GOP caucus to shore up support.

Several Republican senators have said the government should be re-opened while talks continue over border security and Trump's demand for money to build the wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.

President Donald Trump says he thinks he and the Democrats are ""getting closer"" to a deal to end the budget stalemate that has partially shut down the government despite no evidence that any progress has been made.

And he's suggesting the partial government shutdown could be ""a blessing in disguise"" because, he suggests, it could lead to a broader immigration deal.

Trump spoke Wednesday during an Oval Office bill signing on anti-human trafficking legislation. It's a day after he delivered a prime-time address trying to make the case for his long-stalled U.S.-Mexico border wall.

Trump says that he would like to see ""real immigration reform in this country because we need it."" He says, ""Everybody wants to see immigration reform,"" adding that perhaps the stalemate ""will turn out to be a blessing in disguise.""

Gone are the days when the U.S. and Mexican governments regularly exchanged statements over President Donald Trump's insistence on a border wall.

Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said Wednesday he won't be drawn into what he calls a U.S. internal dispute, an apparent reference to the 19-day-old partial U.S. government shutdown over a border barrier.

Lopez Obrador says, ""We are not going to respond to situations arising from internal affairs in the United States.""

Unlike his predecessor, the Mexican leader didn't have to respond to any specific aspersion about Mexico, because Trump didn't make any in his Tuesday night address to the American public. Relations between the two leaders have been surprisingly cordial, given their ideological differences.

Lopez Obrador said, ""Of course, there are those ... who want us to get into a confrontation. We always want a friendly relationship with the United States, a cooperative relationship.""

As a presidential candidate Trump promised Mexico would pay for a border wall, but Mexico refused.

President Donald Trump is using a bill signing focused on curbing human trafficking to push his case for a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border.

Trump says a southern border that is not secured exacerbates the incidents of human trafficking. He says, ""As long as we have a border that is not secure, we're going to suffer the consequences of that.""

Wednesday's bill signing came a day after Trump's prime-time speech designed to persuade Americans that illegal immigration and trafficking at the border are a crisis.

Democrats have called Trump's promised wall costly, ineffective and ""immoral"" and say he's ""manufacturing a crisis.""

The bill Trump signed is designed to enhance an annual State Department report that measures global efforts to eliminate human trafficking.

The White House says it's the fourth bipartisan bill the Republican president has signed in the last few weeks to prevent human trafficking.

Congressional Democrats say they'll head to the White House with the plan to reopen the government -- the same one they've been presenting. They're asking President Donald Trump to accept a bipartisan bill to fund border security without the wall.

Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Wednesday the president ""could end the Trump shutdown and re-open the government today, and he should.""

Pelosi and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer spoke at an event where they were flanked by federal workers going without pay during the shutdown, now in its 19th day.

Schumer called workers the ""collateral damage"" of Trump's ""temper tantrum."" He said the president failed to ""persuade a soul"" during his ""divisive"" prime-time address Tuesday night to the nation.

Trump meets with congressional leaders at the White House Wednesday afternoon. He rejected the Senate's bipartisan funding bill in December, sparking the shutdown.

The White House is trying to keep jittery congressional Republicans from defecting over the toll the partial government shutdown is taking in their states.

President Donald Trump and Democrats have been at an impasse over funding for his proposed border wall, which has led to a partial government shutdown, now in its 19th day.

Trump meets with Senate Republicans Wednesday on Capitol Hill just hours after he argued on national television that a border wall was needed to resolve a security and humanitarian ""crisis.""

Senators say the shutdown has led to disruptions in agricultural payments for farmers, as well as for home buyers trying to secure government-backed home loans. Lawmakers also are worried about missed paychecks for government workers Friday.

As many as half a dozen GOP senators have said the government should reopen while border security negotiations with Democrats continue.

President Donald Trump again linked illegal immigration along the southern border with drugs and violent crime as he urged Democratic lawmakers to fund his proposed border wall.

In his first national address from the Oval Office, the president gave no indication he was softening his stance that the partial government shutdown would continue without money for the wall.

Trump argued Tuesday night that the wall was needed to resolve what he called a security and humanitarian ""crisis.""

He addressed the nation as the shutdown stretched through its third week, with hundreds of thousands of federal workers going without pay and some congressional Republicans growing increasingly jittery about the impasse.

Trump plans to visit Senate Republicans at the Capitol on Wednesday before meeting with Democratic leaders at the White House."
367,the news&observer,https://www.newsobserver.com/news/business/article223342450.html,"Excerpts from recent editorials in the United States and abroad:

The New York Times on a judge's rebuke of Michael Flynn and President Donald Trump's charitable foundation:

A bit of common sense and common decency intruded on Tuesday into the crazy world of Donald Trump.

In New York, the state attorney general announced that the president had agreed that the ""charity"" he used as a piggy bank has no reason to exist.

In Washington, a federal judge let a former top presidential aide know that you can parrot political spin or you can tell the truth, but you can't do both to someone who can send you to prison.

Michael Flynn, Mr. Trump's former national security adviser, appeared before Judge Emmet Sullivan to be sentenced to what he expected would be a term of probation, after pleading guilty to lying to federal investigators about conversations with the Russian ambassador. The office of the special counsel, Robert Mueller, had earlier filed a memo that said it would be right for Mr. Flynn to avoid prison after his extensive cooperation in the investigation of Trump ties to Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential campaign and after.

Then last week, in a memo about their client's sentencing, Mr. Flynn's lawyers implied that he had been tricked into lying and that the F.B.I. acted improperly in interviewing him -- points raised by pro-Trump commentators elaborating on the president's claims of being victimized by a witch hunt.

Judge Sullivan was having none of it.

""I cannot recall an instance of a court ever accepting a guilty plea from someone who did not maintain he was guilty,"" Judge Sullivan said, ""and I do not intend to start today.""

Chastened, Mr. Flynn told the judge that nobody tricked him, that he lied and that he knew he shouldn't have.

The judge was not upset only about Mr. Flynn's sneaky prevarication. He said he felt ""disgust"" at Mr. Flynn's offenses, that a retired three-star general would lie to the F.B.I. ""while on the physical premises of the White House,"" and, acting as an unregistered agent of a foreign country, Turkey, while he was an adviser to Mr. Trump (to which he admitted but was not charged). It was a bracing reminder of the brazenness of his misdeeds and of the standards the public should be able to expect of those who serve them.

Realizing that Judge Sullivan was considering a term of up to six months in prison, Mr. Flynn accepted his offer to delay the sentencing for 90 days until he has completed his cooperation with the special counsel.

""Good luck today in court to General Michael Flynn,"" Mr. Trump had tweeted first thing Tuesday morning.

""Thanks for nothing, Mr. President,"" Mr. Flynn might have thought as he left court.

Mr. Flynn should be grateful the judge offered him the chance to come clean. By contrast, the Donald J. Trump Foundation, a charity that provided no charity, quite properly received none from the New York attorney general's office.

Attorney General Barbara Underwood accused it of ""a shocking pattern of illegality"" that ""amounted to the Trump Foundation functioning as little more than a checkbook to serve Mr. Trump's business and political interests.""

Whatever money that remains will be disbursed under the supervision of Ms. Underwood's office and the judge overseeing the continuing lawsuit her office filed in June, seeking $2.8 million in restitution and a ban on Mr. Trump and his three oldest children serving on the boards of other nonprofit organizations.

In a series of stories exposing the foundation's true nature, The Washington Post found that its largest donation was to fix a fountain in front of the Plaza Hotel in Manhattan, which Mr. Trump owned at the time, that its funds were used to buy a portrait of Mr. Trump, and that it illegally provided political donations and paid for personal legal settlements.

All this comes just days after prosecutors announced that they believed that Mr. Trump had conspired with the owner of The National Enquirer and his fixer Michael Cohen to violate campaign finance laws by paying hush money to two women who said they had affairs with him. It's also just been reported that prosecutors are investigating spending by the Trump inaugural committee. The president still faces lawsuits on the constitutionality of his enriching himself while in office. Meanwhile, the special counsel's inquiry may be expanding rather than winding down.

It's fitting that despite all his bluster and threats, a president who's demonstrated such contempt for the rule of law is finding it so formidable.

That this goes to the essence of American governance was best summed up by Paula Duncan, the Trump enthusiast who was among the jurors who found Mr. Trump's former campaign chief Paul Manafort guilty of fraud, even though she had hoped he wouldn't be convicted.

Explaining her decision after the verdict, she told Fox News, ""No one's above the law.""

The Wall Street Journal on a judge's ruling on the Affordable Care Act's individual mandate:

No one opposes ObamaCare more than we do, and Democrats are now confirming that it was designed as a way-station to government-run health care. But a federal judge's ruling that the law is unconstitutional is likely to be overturned on appeal and may boomerang politically on Republicans.

Judge Reed O'Connor ruled for some 20 state plaintiffs that the Affordable Care Act's individual mandate is no longer legal because Republicans repealed its financial penalty as part of the 2017 tax reform. Recall that Chief Justice John Roberts joined four Justices to say ObamaCare's mandate was illegal as a command to individuals to buy insurance under the Commerce Clause. ""The Framers gave Congress the power to regulate commerce, not to compel it,"" he wrote.

Yet the Chief famously salvaged ObamaCare by unilaterally rewriting the mandate to be a ""tax"" that was within Congress's power. Never mind that Democrats had expressly said the penalty was not a tax. Majority Leader Roberts declared it to be so.

Enter Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, who argues in Texas v. U.S. that since Congress has repealed the mandate, the tax is no longer a tax, and ObamaCare is thus illegal. Judge O'Connor agreed with that logic, and he went further in ruling that since Congress said the mandate is crucial to the structure of ObamaCare, then all of ObamaCare must fall along with the mandate.

We'll admit to a certain satisfaction in seeing the Chief Justice hoist on his own logic. But his ruling in NFIB v. Sebelius was in 2012 and there is more at issue legally now than the ""tax"" issue in that opinion. One legal complication is that Congress in 2017 repealed the financial part of the individual mandate, not the structure of the mandate itself. Republicans used budget rules to pass tax reform so they couldn't repeal the mandate's express language.

The Affordable Care Act has also been up and running since 2014, which means so-called reliance interests come into play when considering a precedent. Millions of people now rely on ObamaCare's subsidies and rules, which argues against judges repealing the law by fiat.

Judge O'Connor breezes past this like a liberal Ninth Circuit appeals judge handling a Donald Trump appeal. He's right that Democrats claimed the individual mandate was essential to the Affordable Care Act. But when Congress killed the financial penalty in 2017 it left the rest of ObamaCare intact. When judging congressional intent, a judge must account for the amending Congress as well as the original Congress.

In any case, the Supreme Court's ""severability"" doctrine calls for restraint in declaring an entire law illegal merely because one part of it is. Our guess is that even the right-leaning Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals judges will overturn Judge O'Connor on this point.

As for the politics, Democrats claim to be alarmed by the ruling but the truth is they're elated. They want to use it to further pound Republicans for denying health insurance for pre-existing conditions if the law is overturned. Democrats campaigned across the country against Mr. Paxton's lawsuit to gain House and Senate seats in November, and they will now press votes in Congress so they can compound the gains in 2020.

President Trump hailed the ruling in a tweet, but he has never understood the Affordable Care Act. His Administration has done good work revising regulations to reduce health-care costs and increase access, but the risk is that the lawsuit will cause Republicans in Congress to panic politically and strike a deal with Democrats that reinforces ObamaCare. This is what happens when conservatives fall into the liberal trap of thinking they can use the courts to achieve policy goals that need to be won in Congress.

The Washington Post on withdrawing all 2,000 U.S. troops out of Syria:

PRESIDENT TRUMP'S sudden move to yank U.S. troops out of Syria undermined at a stroke several foreign policy goals he has championed. The president promised to finish the job of destroying the Islamic State, but the withdrawal will leave thousands of its fighters still in place. He vowed to roll back Iran's aggression across the Middle East, but his decision will allow its forces to entrench in the country that is the keystone of Tehran's ambitions. He promised to protect Israel, but that nation will now be left to face alone the buildup by Iran and its proxies along its northern border.

The president's top national security advisers had carefully developed and articulated a strategy of maintaining a U.S. presence in Syria until the Islamic State was beyond revival and Iran withdrew its forces -- a plan they were defending up until this week. Mr. Trump has again demonstrated, to them and to the world, that no U.S. policy or foreign commitment is immune from his whims.

Mr. Trump claimed the Islamic State had been defeated, but that is not the view of the Defense and State Departments. Thousands of jihadist fighters are still in Syria and control splotches of territory in the Euphrates Valley. A U.S. withdrawal will give the extremists an opportunity to reconstitute, as they did in Iraq following the premature U.S. withdrawal ordered by President Barack Obama.

Until Wednesday, a prime talking point of senior national security officials was that, ""if we've learned one thing over the years, (the) enduring defeat of a group like this means you can't just defeat their physical space and then leave,"" as the State Department's special envoy for the global campaign against the Islamic State, Brett McGurk, put it last week. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said it another way in September: ""Getting rid of the caliphate doesn't mean you then blindly say, 'Okay, we got rid of it,' march out, and then wonder why the caliphate comes back.""

Mr. Trump has justified some of his most controversial decisions, including his continued support for Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, as needed to contain Iran's threat to the United States and its allies. But the Syrian withdrawal hands Tehran and its ally Russia a windfall. Iran has deployed thousands of fighters and allied militiamen to Syria and aspires to create a corridor to Lebanon and the Mediterranean, as well as a new front against Israel along the Golan Heights. In reaction to that threat, Mr. Trump's national security adviser, John Bolton, announced Sept. 24 that ""We're not going to leave (Syria) as long as Iranian troops are outside Iranian borders, and that includes Iranian proxies and militias.""

U.S. ambitions in Syria have never been backed by adequate resources, and a case could be made that neither Congress nor the American public were prepared to support the mission suggested by Mr. Bolton. But Mr. Trump's decision appears to have been precipitated by the bellicose rhetoric of Turkey's Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who last week threatened -- not for the first time -- a military operation against Syrian Kurds, even though U.S. troops are positioned around them. The autocratic Turkish ruler appears to have extracted multiple favors from Mr. Trump in recent days, including the sale of U.S. Patriot missiles and a promise to reexamine the possible extradition of his rival, Fethullah Gulen, from Pennsylvania. If Mr. Trump received anything in return, he hasn't disclosed it.

The Syrian Kurdish forces, which have fought alongside the United States and played a crucial role in liberating most of eastern Syria from the jihadists, will be perhaps the foremost victims of Mr. Trump's decision. Betrayed by Washington, they will now be subject to a military offensive by Turkey. The stab in the back will send an unforgettable message to all who are asked to cooperate with the United States in the fight against terrorism: Washington is an unreliable and dangerous partner.

The Orange County (California) Register on Mick Mulvaney as Trump's choice for chief of staff:

President Trump has found a new chief of staff, albeit an interim one, in his director of the Office of Management and Budget, Mick Mulvaney.

That of chief is a terribly important post, perhaps government's most consequential aside from that of his boss. In theory, at least, the chief of staff is the gatekeeper for everything the president does, everyone he sees, everyone he talks to on the phone.

Perhaps, though few would expect this to be the case, the arbiter of every time he sends out a tweet, and of what it should say.

A Washington insider, a former congressman, Mulvaney is in many ways ideal for the job. He wants it, badly, whereas others with similarly impressive resumes touted for the job have indicated a strong desire to spend more time with their families, from Vice President Pence's staff chief Nick Ayers of Georgia to former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie.

Mulvaney shares the conservative values currently espoused by the president and was a founder of the House Freedom Caucus in 2013, the group that always taunted the Republican leadership, opposing much government funding, including debt limit increases and budget agreements made with the Democrats.

But he also, after Trump secured the Republican nomination in 2016, called the candidate ""a terrible human being"" who he only was voting for out of an even greater dislike of Hillary Clinton.

It's not as if other presidential allies of today haven't said bad things about him in the past. On the campaign trail, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz called his rival ""a narcissist at a level I don't think this country's ever seen,"" for instance.

But if you were the nation's chief executive -- or the CEO of a much smaller entity, for that matter -- could you hire as your top aide and work with a person who had once dubbed you ""terrible""?

Or does this kind of talk come with the territory in politics, where many strange bedfellows are made because of having to run in elections against once and perhaps future allies? Should Trump indeed elevate this practical choice for staff chief to permanent status immediately?

Los Angeles Times on banning bump stocks, which allow semi-automatic weapons to fire like machine guns:

The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives said Tuesday that it had finalized a rule reclassifying so-called bump stocks -- the devices that can make a semiautomatic rifle fire nearly as quickly a fully automatic weapon -- as machine guns, which makes it illegal to manufacture, sell or possess them. The agency said a year ago it had the authority to reclassify the devices, and President Trump -- in the wake of the Parkland, Fla., school shooting -- directed the ATF to speed up the process. Tuesday's announcement -- a rare bit of welcome news from the Trump administration -- makes it official; White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters that owners of the conversion devices will have until March 21 to destroy them or turn them in to the ATF.

This is a good step. Unfortunately, it's all but certain to be challenged in the courts, and it's on shaky legal ground because of the way the new rule evolved. The Obama administration determined that because bump stocks have ""no automatically functioning mechanical parts and (perform) no automated mechanical functions when installed,"" they did not fit the definition of a machine gun in federal law, which meant the ATF lacked the authority to regulate them. Tuesday's announcement, by contrast, hinges not on the technical specifications, but on the functionality. In essence, if it fires like a machine gun, it's a machine gun. Cue the lawyers.

We hope the administration prevails in whatever challenges emerge, but the sure-fire way to resolve this would be for Congress to legislate bump stocks and related gadgets out of existence. Such devices serve no function other than to evade the strict congressional limit on machine guns by, as the ATF said, harnessing ""the recoil energy of the semiautomatic firearm in a manner that allows the trigger to reset and continue firing"" without the shooter having to pull the trigger for each shot.

A mass shooter in Las Vegas used bump stocks affixed to semiautomatic rifles to fire more than 1,000 rounds in a matter of minutes from a 32nd-floor suite of the Mandalay Bay Hotel into a crowd of some 20,000 people, killing 58 concertgoers and injuring hundreds of others. It was the largest single mass shooting in the modern era, drawing attention to bump stocks and sparking outraged demands by many -- the Los Angeles Times included -- that the devices be banned.

As welcome as this new rule is, it will do little to corral our national problem with gun violence. The vast majority of gun deaths come in ones and twos, led by suicides. ...

But it is progress. And the president deserves credit for sticking with his promise to find a way to ban bump stocks. ...

China Daily says telecommunications giant Huawei is a victim of U.S. panic attacks:

This year has not been an annus mirabilis for China's Huawei Technologies Ltd, the world's largest supplier of telecommunications network equipment and second-biggest maker of smartphones.

Although it has been constantly in the news and it is said there is no such thing as bad publicity, it has been making headlines because of the spurious claims it somehow poses a threat to the West, even world peace. It has never been explained exactly how.

In fact it is not because of anything it has done, but because its success has brought it into the crosshairs of the United States' anxiety attacks against China.

Huawei is at the forefront of 5G technology. This latest generation mobile network technology promises to bring the much anticipated and heralded internet of things to life and the US is determined to be the 5G leader.

Not only because whichever country develops the technology that is adopted as standard will have a huge commercial advantage. But also because by setting the standard it will have a knowledge advantage.

As a result, first the US and then one after another its most obedient allies have blocked Huawei from entering their 5G markets on security grounds.

None of them have offered any specific justification for blocking Huawei. They just repeat their claim that the company poses a security risk. That is why objective observers have concluded that those countries are politicizing a commercial issue.

It sets a harmful precedent. What if other countries used the same excuse to block US companies (not confined to the telecom sector)? The US companies are very competitive in many fields, including those that could pose huge security risks, such as finance.

While Huawei will not go unscathed from being prevented from entering key markets, as a competitive player, it still has a vast market to access in other parts of the world. It has signed contracts to supply 5G equipment to 25 telecom carriers, and more than 10,000 5G base stations have been shipped.

In stark contrast to the US and its allies, India for instance, has invited Huawei to conduct 5G trials in the country and complimented it on the role it has played in helping to develop its telecom industry.

The efforts of the US and its allies to try to shield their companies against a Chinese competitor are politically motivated, not the result of a fact-based or transparent decision-making process. And they are counterproductive to the concerted efforts that are needed to ensure the security of 5G networks."
368,medicine hat news,https://medicinehatnews.com/news/world-news/2019/01/14/congress-to-face-same-question-when-will-shutdown-end/,"By Darlene Superville, The Associated Press on January 14, 2019.

WASHINGTON - Congress returns to Washington for its first full week of legislative business since control of the House reverted to Democrats, but lawmakers will be confronted with the same lingering question: When will the partial government shutdown end?

One Republican senator says he's offered President Donald Trump a possible solution, though it may just be wishful thinking.

Sen. Lindsey Graham is encouraging Trump to reopen government for several weeks to continue negotiating with Democrats over the border wall Trump wants to build on the U.S.-Mexico border. If there's no deal at the end of that time, Graham says Trump would be free to take the more dramatic step of declaring a national emergency to build it.

But the South Carolina Republican says Trump still wants a deal on funding for the wall before agreeing to reopen shuttered government departments. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat, insists Trump reopen the government first.

Their weeks-old standoff led to the partial government shutdown, now on day 24 without a clear end in sight.

Trump insisted on Twitter Monday that he wanted to deal, declaring: ""I've been waiting all weekend. Democrats must get to work now. Border must be secured!""

Targeting Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, Trump also argued that the shutdown ""has become their, and the Democrats, fault!"" Trump weeks ago asserted that he would ""own"" the shutdown and polls show that he is taking most of the blame.

Graham, who has publicly pushed Trump to use his authority to declare a national emergency to build the wall, is suggesting a short-term fix.

""Before he pulls the plug on the legislative option, and I think we're almost there, I would urge him to open up the government for a short period of time, like three weeks, before he pulls the plug, see if we can get a deal,"" Graham said. ""If we can't at the end of three weeks, all bets are off.

""See if he can do it by himself through the emergency powers. That's my recommendation,"" added Graham, who has publicly pushed Trump to use his authority to declare a national emergency to build the wall. Such a step would allow Trump to bypass Congress and tap various pots of unspent federal money, including for military construction and disaster relief as well as from assets seized by law enforcement, to pay for the wall.

Trump has kept Washington on edge over whether he would resort to such a declaration, citing what he says is a ""crisis"" of drug smuggling and the trafficking of women and children at the border. The president initially sounded as though such a move was imminent, but then pulled back. He has said several times since he first mentioned the idea in public this month that he prefers a legislative solution.

A key question is how much more time is Trump willing to give lawmakers. Graham, who spoke with Trump by telephone on Sunday morning, said the legislative path ""is just about shut off"" and blamed intransigence by Pelosi.

The speaker's office had no immediate comment.

Democrats oppose an emergency declaration but may be powerless to block it. Some Republicans are wary, too, fearing how a future Democratic president might use that authority. Such a move, should Trump ultimately go that route, would almost certainly be challenged in the courts.

Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., called Graham's idea to reopen the government a ""great place to start.""

""I do think if we reopen the government, if the president ends this shutdown crisis, we have folks who can negotiate a responsible, modern investment in technology that will actually make us safer,"" Coons said.

Trump says technology is nice, but that the border can't be secured without a wall.

The White House has been laying the groundwork for an emergency declaration, which is feared by lawmakers in both parties.

Senate Homeland Security Committee Chairman Ron Johnson, R-Wis., said he'd ""hate to see"" a declaration issued because the wall wouldn't get built, presumably because of legal challenges. Democrats voted in the past for border security and should again, he said.

""I actually want to see this wall get built,"" Johnson said. ""I want to keep pressure on Democrats to actually come to the negotiating table in good faith and fund what they have supported in the past.""

Graham favours a declaration and said the time for talk is running out.

""It's the last option, not the first option, but we're pretty close to that being the only option,"" he said.

Graham and Coons spoke on ""Fox News Sunday"" and Johnson appeared on CNN's ""State of the Union.""

As President Donald Trump is said to be mulling ""other options"" for funding his border wall between the U.S. and Mexico, according to the Associated Press, a dark horse arises on the internet.

A GoFundMe campaign popped up Sunday, hoping to raise funds for Trump's proposed wall between the U.S. and Mexico, which isn't news in and of itself. There are plenty of those around.

But the organizers of this campaign are so encouraged that they've raised more-than $700,000 in just three days that they've bumped their original goal of $200 million up to a cool billion.

The GoFundMe organizer is listed as triple-amputee Air Force veteran Brian Kolfage, who lost both legs and his right arm in a blast at Balad Air Force Base in Iraq in 2004, according to the Arizona Daily Star. The fundraiser is titled, ""We the people will fund the wall.""

The contact listing for the organizer says ""The Wall Funding Team"" is located in Miramar, Fla.

""As a veteran who has given so much, 3 limbs, I feel deeply invested to this nation to ensure future generations have everything we have today,"" Kolfage wrote in the GoFundMe campaign description. ""Too many Americans have been murdered by illegal aliens and too many illegals are taking advantage of the United States taxpayers with no means of ever contributing to our society.

""I have grandparents who immigrated to America legally, they did it the correct way and it's time we uphold our laws, and get this wall BUILT! It's up to Americans to help out and pitch in to get this project rolling.""

Multiple studies and reports have shown, though, that illegal immigrants commit crime, violent or nonviolent, at lesser rates than do native-born Americans.

Kolfage's GoFundMe campaign was listed as the ""Top fundraiser"" on the front page of the crowd-sourced social fundraising website as of Wednesday afternoon, despite Kolfage's claims that the platform was trying to hide his fundraiser from potential donors.

Kolfage's Facebook page, where he posts content relevant to his conservative political beliefs, has more than 90,000 followers.

""We have contacted the Trump Administration to secure a point of contact where all funds will go upon completion,"" the campaign says. ""When get this information secured we will update. We have many very high level contacts already helping."""

""Silk, what other type of games (does Congress play), girl?"" Diamond asks.

Diamond continues: ""You know what, if the Congress thinks they're gonna be playing this hippity-hop and hoppity-hip with the American people when it comes to our national security, they've got another thing coming! Maybe we need to do a hip-hop for 'em.""

Their so-called rap quickly hit a nerve with Black Twitter, who compared the sisters' on-air antics to a live minstrel show.

""What in the step it and fetch it is this?"" sports columnist Jemele Hill wrote.

""Are they serious?"" another said in response to her tweet. ""I wonder how much Fox News is paying them for this minstrel show. Good Lord smh.""

""This buffoonery has to stop!"" wrote another.

Last week, the Democrat-controlled House passed a funding plan to re-open the federal government that did not include the $5.6 billion Trump demanded for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. The president has since threatened to let the partial shutdown drag on for months until Democrats approve the funding and even suggested declaring a ""national emergency"" to get the wall built."

Washington (CNN)Nancy Pelosi is poised to reclaim the title of House speaker on Thursday when the new Democratic majority arrives in Washington and takes over control of the House of Representatives.

A small, but vocal, faction of Democrats initially worked to derail Pelosi's bid to become the next Speaker following the 2018 midterm elections, but no challenger against her ever emerged and she ultimately succeed in winning over many of her critics.The longtime House Democratic leader is now on the verge of winning back the position of power she previously held when she served as the first and so far only female House speaker from 2007 to 2011.In the role of speaker, Pelosi will be one of the most visible members of the Democratic Party to regularly face off against President Donald Trump and will preside over an emboldened and energized Democratic majority that is poised to launch aggressive oversight of the President and his administration.One of the most immediate challenges that will confront Pelosi as leader of the new House Democratic majority will be the fight over the President's long-promised border wall that triggered a standoff between congressional Democrats and the President and resulted in a partial government shutdown, which is now in its second week.Read MorePelosi has already outlined a plan for Democrats to pass a legislative package later in the day on Thursday to re-open shuttered parts of the government. Contrary to the President's demands for $5 billion for a border wall, however, the legislation does not provide any new wall funding, setting up an early confrontation between the new Democratic majority and the administration.Pelosi's path to the speakershipPelosi always projected confidence that she would reclaim the Speaker's gavel, but faced criticism and pushback along the way.At the end of November, she secured the nomination to become speaker by winning support from a majority of House Democrats -- a total of 203 votes in closed-door leadership elections. But she came up slightly short of the total 218 votes typically needed to win the speakership in the final January vote.To become Speaker requires the support of a majority of all members of the House who are present and voting, a threshold that could be as high as 218 votes. It would be possible for Pelosi to win with fewer votes, as several previous House speakers have, if some members vote present or decline to participate.Ahead of the final vote, Pelosi deployed her deal-making abilities to win over detractors, and by mid-December, she appeared to have secured the votes necessary to prevail after negotiating an agreement with some of the Democrats who had been lobbying to block her from the speakership. As part of the agreement, Pelosi backed a proposal to enact term limits for the party's top three leaders.""I see myself as a bridge to the next generation of leaders, a recognition of my continuing responsibility to mentor and advance new Members into positions of power and responsibility in the House Democratic Caucus,"" Pelosi said in a statement at the time.

Such a step would allow Trump to bypass Congress and tap various pots of unspent federal money, including for military construction and disaster relief as well as from assets seized by law enforcement, to pay for the wall.

Trump has kept Washington on edge over whether he would resort to such a declaration, citing what he says is a ""crisis"" of drug smuggling and the trafficking of women and children at the border. The president initially sounded as though such a move was imminent, but then pulled back. He has said several times since he first mentioned the idea in public this month that he prefers a legislative solution.

A key question is how much more time is Trump willing to give lawmakers. Graham, who spoke with Trump by telephone on Sunday morning, said the legislative path ""is just about shut off"" and blamed intransigence by Pelosi.

The speaker's office had no immediate comment.

Democrats oppose an emergency declaration but may be powerless to block it. Some Republicans are wary, too, fearing how a future Democratic president might use that authority. Such a move, should Trump ultimately go that route, would almost certainly be challenged in the courts.

Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., called Graham's idea to reopen the government a ""great place to start.""

""I do think if we reopen the government, if the president ends this shutdown crisis, we have folks who can negotiate a responsible, modern investment in technology that will actually make us safer,"" Coons said.

Trump says technology is nice, but that the border can't be secured without a wall.

The White House has been laying the groundwork for an emergency declaration, which is feared by lawmakers in both parties.

Senate Homeland Security Committee Chairman Ron Johnson, R-Wis., said he'd ""hate to see"" a declaration issued because the wall wouldn't get built, presumably because of legal challenges. Democrats voted in the past for border security and should again, he said.

""I actually want to see this wall get built,"" Johnson said. ""I want to keep pressure on Democrats to actually come to the negotiating table in good faith and fund what they have supported in the past.""

Graham favors a declaration and said the time for talk is running out.

""It's the last option, not the first option, but we're pretty close to that being the only option,"" he said.

Lindsey Graham also says Trump still wants to reach a deal for the wall before agreeing to reopen shuttered government departments.

377,thecitizenng.com,https://thecitizenng.com/shutdown-trump-rejects-proposal-to-reopen-govt/,"US President Donald Trump said on Monday that he rejected a proposal from a Republican ally in the Senate that would have temporarily reopened closed parts of the government to allow resumption of negotiations on a funding standoff.

As the shutdown, the longest of its type in US history, entered its 24th day, Trump told reporters he disagreed with Republican Senator Lindsey Graham's proposal to reopen the government for three weeks.

If talks failed during that period, Graham said on Sunday, then Trump could go ahead and declare a national emergency to bypass Congress and get money for a wall on the US-Mexico border - the issue that triggered the shutdown on December 22.

Amid swelling criticism, Trump has refused to budge on his demand that a spending bill include $5.7bn for a wall on the country's southern border, a promise on which Trump campaigned for the presidency.

Democrats have rejected Trump's demand for funding for the border wall in addition to other border funds but have said they would support $1.3bn to bolster border security in other ways, including beefing up the number of Border Patrol agents and increasing surveillance.

The political crisis caused federal workers to miss their first paycheques on Friday, heightening concerns about mounting financial pressures on employees, including air traffic controllers and airport security officials, who continue to work without pay.

Roughly 800,000 federal workers have been furloughed or required to work without pay. Some employees have resorted to selling their possessions or posting appeals on online crowdfunding sites to help pay their bills.

The shutdown also affected travellers as a jump in unscheduled absences among federal airport security screeners forced partial closures of airports in Houston and Miami.

National parks also remain closed, food and drug inspections have been curtailed and key economic data is on hold. Federal courts are set to run out of money on Friday.

During a rally in Washington, DC on Thursday, federal workers, union leaders and Democrats called on the Trump administration to reopen the government.

""Let's call this shutdown what it is: It's a lockout,"" Richard Trumka, president of the AFL-CIO, a federation of unions, told the crowd.

""Shame on the Senate. Shame on the White House. This lockout has to end, and it has to end now.""

At least two unions have filed lawsuits against the Trump administration over the shutdown.

Later on Monday, Trump is scheduled to address a New Orleans gathering of farmers, a key bloc of Trump supporters who have been hit by the shutdown as federal loan and farm aid applications have stalled and key farming and crop data has been delayed.

The US Department of Agriculture (USDA) was set to release its views on the projected size of US soybean stockpiles, among other data, following a record-large domestic harvest and a trade war with China that has slowed US exports.

To fill the void on data, traders and farmers are relying on private crop forecasters, satellite imagery firms and brokerages offering analyses on trade and supplies. Some have been scouring Twitter for tidbits on shifting weather patterns and rumours of grain exports, but say it is difficult to replace the USDA.

""We're just doing the best we can, looking for as much information as is available,"" said Brian Basting, economist for Illinois-based broker Advance Trading, which provides customers with its own harvest and crop supply estimates.

Dan Henebry, an Illinois corn and soy farmer, said the absence of USDA data was making things difficult.

""You delay all these reports and the market has no idea where to go, other than trade guesses,"" Henebry said.

Trump has said he could declare a national emergency if he unable to strike a deal with politicians, although on Monday he told reporters he was not looking to do so.

He retweeted criticism of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer that urged the top Democratic leaders to negotiate with him.

""I've been waiting all weekend. Democrats must get to work now. Border must be secured!"" Trump wrote in an early morning tweet on Monday.

About one-quarter of the US government shut down last month as Republicans controlled both chambers of Congress as well as the White House. In December, Trump said he would take responsibility for the shutdown but has since shifted the blame to the Democrats. A growing proportion of Americans blame Trump for the closures, a recent Reuters/Ipsos poll found.

The president now must win concessions from the Democrats, who took over the US House of Representatives this month following November's midterm elections. He also must win over enough Senate Democrats to secure the 60 votes needed to pass funding legislation in that chamber.

Declaring a national emergency over immigration issues is fiercely opposed by Democrats and remains unpopular with some Republicans. It also would likely face an immediate legal challenge.

Pelosi called on the Republican-led Senate to vote on several bills passed earlier this month by the House to fund affected departments that do not include money for Trump's wall.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said he will not take up any legislation that does not have Trump's support.

Both the Senate and the House were scheduled to reconvene on Monday afternoon, despite a weekend winter storm that shuttered much of the Washington, DC, area; it remained unclear what, if any, steps politicians might take to address the lapsed funding measures for affected agencies.

Senator Chris Coons on Monday reiterated fellow Democrats' call for Trump to reopen the government while negotiations over the wall and immigration continue.

He acknowledged efforts by Graham and other Republicans to forge a temporary solution but said Trump has been unpredictable even among fellow conservatives with ever-shifting positions. - Al Jazeera."

379,cnn international,https://www.cnn.com/2018/12/17/politics/donald-trump-robert-mueller-government-shutdown-obamacare/index.html,"(CNN)A frenzied year in Washington is going out with a roar as the political forces that combined to make the first half of President Donald Trump's mandate so turbulent come to a head in a hugely consequential run-up to the holidays.

Looming over everything is the new reality, fueled by weeks of court filings by special counsel Robert Mueller and other prosecutors, that every corner of Trump's public life is now under investigation: his White House, his campaign, his presidential transition, his inaugural committee, his businesses.The President's sense of persecution prompted a rage-filled Twitter outburst on Sunday that also appeared to reflect concern about cooperation agreements secured by Mueller with his longtime personal attorney and fixer Michael Cohen and former national security adviser Michael Flynn.""The Russian Witch Hunt Hoax, started as the 'insurance policy' long before I even got elected, is very bad for our Country,"" Trump tweeted.""They are Entrapping people for misstatements, lies or unrelated things that took place many years ago. Nothing to do with Collusion. A Democrat Scam!""Read More Trump's tweet ignored the fact that the legality of the Mueller probe has been upheld in court on several occasions and that it has secured a number of convictions and is opening a window into the President's own behavior in its prosecutions of his associates.Former FBI Director James Comey, whom Trump fired, laid into the President in his own tweet Sunday, dismissing the President's claim on Twitter that the bureau's raid against Cohen this year was illegal.""This is from the President of our country, lying about the lawful execution of a search warrant issued by a federal judge. Shame on Republicans who don't speak up at this moment -- for the FBI, the rule of law, and the truth,"" Comey wrote. As a new week dawns, the capital is on edge to see whether Mueller has any more dramatic cards to play before the turn of the year. One event that may further irritate the President is Tuesday's sentencing hearing for Flynn, who admitted lying to the FBI.But the Russia investigation is only one element in a complex set of political dramas that are playing out before Washington breaks for the Christmas and New Year recess.An impasse over Trump's border wall could shutter parts of the government by the end of the week -- the latest battle in the war over immigration that has rocked American politics for more than a decade.Yet another Cabinet member, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, is going home trailed by scandal, in another rebuke to the idea that the Trump administration was ever about draining the swamp.A fresh staff shakeup is playing out in the West Wing, but experience suggests that new acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney will fare no better than his predecessors in imposing order on a President who defies management.Obamacare is having another brush with extinction in the courts, just as the Republican House majority built on a vow to overturn the law limps out of town.And the Democratic majority that will take over the House next year is already flexing its muscles after an extraordinary televised showdown between the party's top brass and Trump last week offered a preview of skirmishes to come.The President's biggest, indisputable success is the motoring economy and historically low unemployment. But there are growing fears after several volatile weeks that a slowdown is looming, given ebbing global growth, a trade war with China and churning market volatility. White House 'absolutely' ready for a shutdown The possibility of a partial shutdown when funding runs out for several key departments at the end of the week appeared to rise on Sunday, with the White House and top Democrats hunkering down over Trump's demand for $5 billion in border wall funding.""We're going to do whatever is necessary to build the border wall to stop this ongoing crisis of illegal immigration,"" White House senior policy adviser Stephen Miller said on CBS's ""Face the Nation.""Asked whether that meant forcing a shutdown to extract the funds from Congress on an issue that was foundational to Trump's presidential campaign, Miller replied, ""If it comes to it, absolutely.""But Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Trump will not get what he wants.""President Trump should understand, there are not the votes for the wall. In the House or the Senate, he is not going to get the wall in any form,"" Schumer said on NBC's ""Meet the Press.""Signs that the gap between the White House and Democrats is deepening raise the possibility that the showdown, if it does shutter government, could develop into the first big clash between the new Congress and the White House in January. New trouble for Obamacare Americans who rely on the Affordable Care Act got a surprise lump of coal late on Friday night when a federal judge in Texas ruled that the entire law was unconstitutional.The move set off a fresh duel over the centerpiece of Barack Obama's domestic agenda that has so far defied all GOP attempts to kill it off.Immediate legal opinion -- even from some conservatives -- suggested that the sweeping ruling could end up being overturned, though there is a chance the fight over Obamacare's fate could end up yet again in the Supreme Court in a test of the new conservative majority.The decision reignited the political wars over health care that Democrats believe played a significant role in their surge to victory in the House in the midterm elections. If that is the case, the Obamacare ruling, paradoxically, may not be good news for the GOP.But Trump welcomed the latest threat to his predecessor's legacy.""I believe we're going to get really good health care. Exciting things happened over the last 24 hours,"" Trump said at a congressional ball at the White House on Saturday night. Typically though, he gave few details of his vague plans to provide a better alternative to Obamacare, which now looks likely to be a key issue in yet another national election cycle. Swamp creatures Trump enters another week looking for another new Cabinet member after announcing the resignation of Zinke, who was facing multiple ethics probes and was a top oversight target of the new Democratic House.The New York Times and Washington Post also reported that Zinke might have been fired if he failed to quit by the end of the year.Possible replacements include Deputy Interior Secretary David Bernhardt and Nevada Republican Sen. Dean Heller, who lost his re-election race, sources with knowledge of the situation said.Mulvaney, meanwhile, is gearing up to take on the daunting task of being Trump's third chief of staff. Given the failure of his two predecessors, Reince Priebus and John Kelly, to rein in a President who trusts his gut above all, there are few expectations that Mulvaney will calm an often erratic White House and impose discipline, as many predecessors did in other administrations.""He's the chief of staff, not chief of the President, right? That's an important distinction,"" David Urban, the political strategist who masterminded Trump's 2016 victory in Pennsylvania, said on CNN's ""State of the Union.""Still, Mulvaney appears to have a trusting relationship with the President, following his tenure as his budget chief. And his knowledge of Capitol Hill, gained as a former member of the House, will be an asset as the White House seeks to outmaneuver would-be Speaker Nancy Pelosi and her troops next year. Russia to overshadow Trump's Christmas Trump heads into a Christmas break at his Mar-a-Lago resort this week in a position of increasing political and legal vulnerability after weeks of devastating revelations and court filings related to the Russia investigation.The President has been implicated by New York prosecutors overseen by his own Justice Department in directing criminal attempts to subvert campaign finance laws alongside Cohen, whose case was referred by Mueller.Cooperation by Cohen and Flynn is helping Mueller take his investigation deep into the President's inner circle. He has now uncovered multiple contacts between Trump associates and Russians during the time of Moscow's election meddling effort and repeated lying about those encounters.Speculation is frenzied about one mysterious scene on Friday in which an entire floor of the federal courthouse in Washington was locked down over a mystery subpoena appeal involving the special counsel's team.Things are certain to become more uncomfortable for Trump in the new year. Maryland Democratic Rep. Elijah Cummings, who is expected to take over the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, said on ""State of the Union"" that he would seek to secure testimony from Cohen before the President's former fixer reports to prison in March.There were also worrying signs for Trump in a new NBC/Wall Street Journal poll that found that 62% of respondents believe the President has not been truthful about the Russia investigation.Since his approval rating was 43% in the survey however, it seems that a portion of those Republicans who are uneasy about the President's attitude toward Mueller still don't see it as a deal breaker for their faith in him."

WASHINGTON (AP) -- The White House on Sunday pushed the federal government closer to the brink of a partial shutdown later this week, digging in on its demand for $5 billion to build a border wall as congressional Democrats stood firm against it.

""We're going to do whatever is necessary to build the border wall to stop this ongoing crisis of illegal immigration,"" said White House senior adviser Stephen Miller.

Asked if that meant having a government shutdown, he said: ""If it comes to it, absolutely.""

Trump said last week he would be ""proud"" to have a shutdown to get Congress to approve a $5 billion down payment to fulfill his campaign promise to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. But the president doesn't have the votes from the Republican-controlled Congress to support funding for the wall at that level.

Democratic congressional leaders, Sen. Chuck Schumer and Rep. Nancy Pelosi, have proposed no more than $1.6 billion, as outlined in a bipartisan Senate bill. The money would not go for the wall but for fencing upgrades and other border security. Democrats also offered to simply keep funding at its current level, $1.3 billion.

Trump lawyer Giuliani rules out Mueller interview with Trump

WASHINGTON (AP) -- With a number of probes moving closer to the Oval Office, President Donald Trump and his attorney unleashed a fresh series of attacks on the investigators, questioning their integrity while categorically ruling out the possibility of a presidential interview with the special counsel.

Trump and Rudy Giuliani used Twitter and television interviews Sunday to deliver a series of broadsides against special counsel Robert Mueller and federal prosecutors in New York. Giuliani said he was ""disgusted"" by the tactics used by Mueller in his probe into Russian election interference, including in securing guilty pleas from the president's former national security adviser Michael Flynn on a charge of lying to federal investigators.

Trump, Giuliani said, would not submit to an interview by Mueller's team.

""They're a joke,"" Giuliani told ""Fox News Sunday."" ''Over my dead body, but, you know, I could be dead.""

The special counsel, who is investigating possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russia, has continued to request an interview with the president. Last month, the White House sent written answers in response to the special counsel's questions about possible collusion. The White House has resisted answering questions on possible obstruction of justice.

Child's death highlights communication barriers on border

Shortly before a 7-year-old Guatemalan girl died in U.S. custody, her father signed a form stating that his daughter was in good health. But it's unclear how much the man understood on the form, which was written in English and read to him in Spanish by Border Patrol agents.

The death of Jakelin Caal highlights the communication challenges along the U.S.-Mexico border as agents come in contact with an increasing number of migrants who speak neither English nor Spanish.

Her father's native language is the Mayan tongue known as Q'eqchi'. His second language is Spanish. It's unclear whether something was lost in translation or whether it would have made a difference in saving Jakelin after the two were detained and underwent a health screening along a remote stretch of U.S.-Mexico border. But the case raises questions about the Border Patrol's use of English-only forms.

All agents are required to speak Spanish, and they receive formal Spanish training. Reading forms in Spanish is often enough to pose basic questions. But some other Spanish-speaking migrants reported signing paperwork that they later said they did not understand.

Scores of immigrant parents who were separated from their children after crossing the border in the spring said they signed forms agreeing to be deported with the understanding that their kids would be returning with them, only to find themselves deported without them.

KATOWICE, Poland (AP) -- Almost 200 nations, including the world's top greenhouse gas producers, China and the United States, have adopted a set of rules meant to breathe life into the 2015 Paris climate accord by setting out how countries should report their emissions and efforts to reduce them.

But negotiators delayed other key decisions until next year -- a move that frustrated environmentalists and countries that wanted more ambitious goals in light of scientists' warnings that the world must shift sharply away from fossil fuels in the coming decade.

""The majority of the rulebook for the Paris agreement has been created, which is something to be thankful for,"" said Mohamed Adow, a climate policy expert at Christian Aid. ""But the fact countries had to be dragged kicking and screaming to the finish line shows that some nations have not woken up"" to the dire consequences of global warming as outlined in a report by the U.N Panel on Climate Change, or IPCC.

Officials at the talks, which ended late Saturday in the Polish city of Katowice, agreed upon universal rules on how nations can cut emissions. Poor countries secured assurances on financial support to help them reduce emissions, adapt to changes such as rising sea levels and pay for damage that has already happened.

""Through this package, you have made a thousand little steps forward together,"" said Michal Kurtyka, a senior Polish official who led the talks.

French city honors victims of Christmas market attack

PARIS (AP) -- People filled a square in the French city of Strasbourg on Sunday to show respect and sympathy for the victims of last week's shooting attack near a famous Christmas market as the death toll rose to five.

French authorities said a Polish man died in a Strasbourg hospital Sunday, one of a dozen people wounded in last Tuesday's attack. Poland's Foreign Ministry extended condolences Sunday on Twitter to his family.

According to the newspaper DNA, more than 1,000 people attended the memorial, which ended with a minute of applause and a rendition of France's national anthem, ""La Marseillaise.""

The hour-long ceremony took place in Kleber Square, not far from where a gunman opened fire on Tuesday evening. Strasbourg Mayor Roland Ries praised the city's resilience in the face of hardship.

The ""extremely large crowd in the Christmas market"" on Saturday ""was an illustration of our commitment to these values ??on which our living together is based, which we will continue to defend against all those who want to attack it,"" Ries said.

Not into bingo, 84-year-old Texas woman gets college degree

RICHARDSON, Texas (AP) -- After raising five kids and retiring at age 77 from her secretarial job, Janet Fein couldn't be blamed for finally relaxing, but that's not her.

Fein, now 84, went to back to school and will accomplish a long-held goal this week when she graduates from the University of Texas at Dallas with a bachelor's degree.

""I didn't have anything to do in retirement and I didn't think that playing bingo was up to my speed,"" said Fein, who majored in sociology because she felt it was ""substantial.""

She said she enjoyed all the reading and writing papers. ""With each class I already knew a lot, but then I also learned a lot. And that made me happy,"" she said.

People 65 and older make up less than one percent of U.S. college students. In 2015, they accounted for about 67,000 of about 20 million college students, according to the National Center for Education Statistics.

Next-generation of GPS satellites are headed to space

DENVER (AP) -- After months of delays, the U.S. Air Force is about to launch the first of a new generation of GPS satellites, designed to be more accurate, secure and versatile.

But some of their most highly touted features will not be fully available until 2022 or later because of problems in a companion program to develop a new ground control system for the satellites, government auditors said.

The satellite is scheduled to lift off Tuesday from Cape Canaveral, Florida, aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. It's the first of 32 planned GPS III satellites that will replace older ones now in orbit. Lockheed Martin is building the new satellites outside Denver.

GPS is best-known for its widespread civilian applications, from navigation to time-stamping bank transactions. The Air Force estimates that 4 billion people worldwide use the system.

But it was developed by the U.S. military, which still designs, launches and operates the system. The Air Force controls a constellation of 31 GPS satellites from a high-security complex at Schriever Air Force Base outside Colorado Springs.

After fraud probe, new primary may replace GOP candidate

RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- Legislation quickly passed by North Carolina's lawmakers this week would prepare a path for Republicans to dump their nominee in a still-undecided U.S. House race marred with ballot fraud allegations.

""I think (legislators are) worried that Mark Harris might be damaged goods and they want to have the opportunity to have a different Republican nominee,"" said Carter Wrenn, a Republican operative and consultant to former U.S. Sen. Jesse Helms and others for more than 40 years. ""That's how I read those tea leaves.""

If the state elections board decides ballot irregularities or other problems cast the true outcome into doubt and force a redo, the legislation -- if allowed to go into law by Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper -- would require new primary elections in the 9th Congressional District race, in addition to a new general election.

That would allow Republicans another look at Mark Harris, the Republican who led Democrat Dan McCready by 905 votes in unofficial results. Harris hasn't been certified the winner, and an investigation is looking into missing absentee ballots in rural Bladen County and whether unsealed ballots illegally handled by collection teams there could have been altered.

Bladen was the only county among the eight within the 9th District where Harris won a majority of mail-in absentee ballots over McCready.

Top of mind: 'Justice' is Merriam-Webster's word of the year

NEW YORK (AP) -- Racial justice. Obstruction of justice. Social justice. The Justice Department. Merriam-Webster has chosen ""justice"" as its 2018 word of the year, driven by the churning news cycle over months and months.

The word follows ""toxic,"" picked by Oxford Dictionaries, and ""misinformation,"" plucked by Dictonary.com.

Peter Sokolowski, Merriam-Webster's editor at large, told The Associated Press ahead of Monday's announcement that ""justice"" consistently bubbled into the top 20 or 30 lookups on the company's website, spiking at times due to specific events but also skating close to the surface for much of the year.

While it's one of those common words people likely know how to spell and use correctly in a sentence, Sokolowski pointed to other reasons that drive search traffic. Among them is an attempt to focus a train of thought around a philosophical problem, or to seek aspirational motivation. Such well-known words are often among the most looked up every year, including those that are slightly abstract, including ""love,"" he said.

The designation for ""justice"" came soon after President Trump's one-time fixer, Michael Cohen, was sentenced to three years in prison for crimes that included arranging the payment of hush money to conceal his boss' alleged sexual affairs. He told a judge he agreed time and again to cover up Trump's ""dirty deeds"" out of ""blind loyalty.""

'Spider-Verse' swings to the top; 'Mortal Engines' tanks

LOS ANGELES (AP) -- ""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse"" swung to the top of the domestic box office in its first weekend in theaters, proving that there is widespread audience interest in big screen animated versions of Marvel's marquee superheroes.

The film led a host of newcomers that debuted to varying success on this pre-Christmas holiday weekend, including Clint Eastwood's drug smuggling drama ""The Mule"" and the Peter Jackson-produced epic ""Mortal Engines"" which bombed in North American theaters.

""Into the Spider-Verse"" earned an estimated $35.4 million from 3,813 theaters against a $90 million production budget according to Sony Pictures on Sunday, which is a record for animated movies in December (although the hybrid ""Alvin and the Chipmunks"" movies were higher). The film features an innovative animation style -- both CGI and hand-drawn -- and focuses on the Miles Morales character as he learns to become the famed web-slinger. It's another financial win for the studio's latest ""expanded Spider-Man universe"" strategy following ""Venom"" and ""Spider-Man: Homecoming.""

And ""Spider-Verse"" has been very well-received among critics, and audiences in exit surveys gave it a rare A+ CinemaScore -- a first for a Spider-Man film. It's also been nominated for a Golden Globe award for best animated feature and picked up a few honors from critics' groups as well, including the New York Film Critics Circle.

""We are playing to both families and fanboys. We're an all-audience film,"" said Adrian Smith, Sony's president of domestic distribution."

As President Donald Trump is said to be mulling ""other options"" for funding his border wall between the U.S. and Mexico, according to the Associated Press, a dark horse arises on the internet.

A GoFundMe campaign popped up Sunday, hoping to raise funds for Trump's proposed wall between the U.S. and Mexico, which isn't news in and of itself. There are plenty of those around.

But the organizers of this campaign are so encouraged that they've raised more-than $700,000 in just three days that they've bumped their original goal of $200 million up to a cool billion.

The GoFundMe organizer is listed as triple-amputee Air Force veteran Brian Kolfage, who lost both legs and his right arm in a blast at Balad Air Force Base in Iraq in 2004, according to the Arizona Daily Star.

The contact listing for the organizer says ""The Wall Funding Team"" is located in Miramar, Fla.

""As a veteran who has given so much, 3 limbs, I feel deeply invested to this nation to ensure future generations have everything we have today,"" Kolfage wrote in the GoFundMe campaign description. ""Too many Americans have been murdered by illegal aliens and too many illegals are taking advantage of the United States taxpayers with no means of ever contributing to our society.

""I have grandparents who immigrated to America legally, they did it the correct way and it's time we uphold our laws, and get this wall BUILT! It's up to Americans to help out and pitch in to get this project rolling.""

Multiple studies and reports have shown, though, that illegal immigrants commit crime, violent or nonviolent, at lesser rates than do native-born Americans.

Kolfage's GoFundMe campaign was listed as the ""Top fundraiser"" on the front page of the crowd-sourced social fundraising website as of Wednesday afternoon, despite Kolfage's claims that the platform was trying to hide his fundraiser from potential donors.

Kolfage's Facebook page, where he posts content relevant to his conservative political beliefs, has more than 90,000 followers.

""We have contacted the Trump Administration to secure a point of contact where all funds will go upon completion,"" the campaign says. ""When get this information secured we will update. We have many very high level contacts already helping."""
383,thenassauguardian.com,https://thenassauguardian.com/2019/01/14/congress-to-face-same-question-when-will-shutdown-end/,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congress returns to Washington for its first full week of legislative business since control of the House reverted to Democrats, but lawmakers will be confronted with the same lingering question: When will the partial government shutdown end?

One Republican senator says he's offered President Donald Trump a possible solution, though it may just be wishful thinking.

Sen. Lindsey Graham is encouraging Trump to reopen government for several weeks to continue negotiating with Democrats over the border wall Trump wants to build on the U.S.-Mexico border. If there's no deal at the end of that time, Graham says Trump would be free to take the more dramatic step of declaring a national emergency to build it.

But the South Carolina Republican says Trump still wants a deal on funding for the wall before agreeing to reopen shuttered government departments. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat, insists Trump reopen the government first.

Their weeks-old standoff led to the partial government shutdown, now on day 24 without a clear end in sight.

Trump insisted on Twitter Monday that he wanted to deal, declaring: ""I've been waiting all weekend. Democrats must get to work now. Border must be secured!""

Targeting Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, Trump also argued that the shutdown ""has become their, and the Democrats, fault!"" Trump weeks ago asserted that he would ""own"" the shutdown and polls show that he is taking most of the blame.

Graham, who has publicly pushed Trump to use his authority to declare a national emergency to build the wall, is suggesting a short-term fix.

""Before he pulls the plug on the legislative option, and I think we're almost there, I would urge him to open up the government for a short period of time, like three weeks, before he pulls the plug, see if we can get a deal,"" Graham said. ""If we can't at the end of three weeks, all bets are off.

""See if he can do it by himself through the emergency powers. That's my recommendation,"" added Graham, who has publicly pushed Trump to use his authority to declare a national emergency to build the wall. Such a step would allow Trump to bypass Congress and tap various pots of unspent federal money, including for military construction and disaster relief as well as from assets seized by law enforcement, to pay for the wall.

Trump has kept Washington on edge over whether he would resort to such a declaration, citing what he says is a ""crisis"" of drug smuggling and the trafficking of women and children at the border. The president initially sounded as though such a move was imminent, but then pulled back. He has said several times since he first mentioned the idea in public this month that he prefers a legislative solution.

A key question is how much more time is Trump willing to give lawmakers. Graham, who spoke with Trump by telephone on Sunday morning, said the legislative path ""is just about shut off"" and blamed intransigence by Pelosi.

The speaker's office had no immediate comment.

Democrats oppose an emergency declaration but may be powerless to block it. Some Republicans are wary, too, fearing how a future Democratic president might use that authority. Such a move, should Trump ultimately go that route, would almost certainly be challenged in the courts.

Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., called Graham's idea to reopen the government a ""great place to start.""

""I do think if we reopen the government, if the president ends this shutdown crisis, we have folks who can negotiate a responsible, modern investment in technology that will actually make us safer,"" Coons said.

Trump says technology is nice, but that the border can't be secured without a wall.

The White House has been laying the groundwork for an emergency declaration, which is feared by lawmakers in both parties.

Senate Homeland Security Committee Chairman Ron Johnson, R-Wis., said he'd ""hate to see"" a declaration issued because the wall wouldn't get built, presumably because of legal challenges. Democrats voted in the past for border security and should again, he said.

""I actually want to see this wall get built,"" Johnson said. ""I want to keep pressure on Democrats to actually come to the negotiating table in good faith and fund what they have supported in the past.""

Graham favors a declaration and said the time for talk is running out.

""It's the last option, not the first option, but we're pretty close to that being the only option,"" he said.

""I can't tell you when the government is going to be open. I can tell you it's not going to be open until we have a wall, a fence, whatever they would like to call it,"" Trump said in the Oval Office after a Christmas call with US troops.

Negotiations between congressional Democrats and the Trump administration over the President's demands for a border wall have so far not yielded an agreement, and the shutdown will continue until at least Thursday, when the Senate returns to Washington. Both sides seem entrenched in their opposing stances and it's possible parts of the government could remain closed until the new Congress is seated in the first week of January, when Democrats will take control of the House.

Trump repeated a claim made a day earlier -- without explanation -- that he'd recently approved 115 miles worth of border barrier. The White House hasn't provided any further details about the claim, which Trump first made on Twitter on Christmas Eve.

He said he would go to the new stretch of the wall in January.

""It's going to be built, hopefully rapidly,"" he said. ""I'm going there at the end of January for the start of construction. That's a big stretch.""

""We're almost having a groundbreaking, it's such a big section,"" he said. ""It's probably the biggest section we'll get out.""

Trump has previously visited wall prototypes near the border.

During a brief question-and-answer session with reporters, Trump also said he continues to have confidence in Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, despite the December downturn in the stock market. He also warned Democrats that oversight of his administration would amount to ""presidential harassment.""

Trump also claimed, without evidence, that federal employees on furlough or working without pay understand his demand for a border wall -- and support him in his mission.

""I think they understand what's happening,"" he said. ""They want border security. The people of this country want border security.""

""It's not a question of me,"" he continued. ""I would rather not be doing shutdowns. I've been at the White House. I love the White House, but I wasn't able to be with my family. I thought it would be wrong for me to be with my family, my family is in Florida, Palm Beach, and I just didn't want to go down and be there when other people are hurting.""

Trump was presumably referring to his adult children; his wife, Melania Trump, returned to the White House on Monday to spend the holiday with her husband.

Trump said many federal workers have told him to hold out for wall funding, though the President didn't provide names or positions of those workers.

""But many of those workers have said to me and communicated, stay out until you get the funding for the wall. These federal workers want the wall. The only one that doesn't want the wall are the Democrats, because they don't mind open borders, but open borders mean massive amounts of crime,"" he said."
386,centre daily times,https://www.centredaily.com/news/politics-government/national-politics/article224069750.html,"With illegal immigration at its lowest level in a decade, it's nothing short of stunning that the federal government is shut down over funding for a border wall.

Yet here we are, entering a third week of the shutdown because President Donald Trump has inexplicably chosen to dig his heels in on getting $5 billion to build a wall along stretches of the U.S. border with Mexico that do not already have such a barrier in place.

""As long as it takes,"" Trump said last week when asked how long he was willing to let the shutdown last. ""I mean, look, I'm prepared. I think the people of the country think I'm right. I think the people of this country think I'm right.""

Except, polling shows the opposite. Major polls conducted last month by Quinnipiac, Harvard, NPR and others all showed that a majority of Americans do not support the wall. And the number of wall supporters shrinks even more when asked if it is worth shutting down the government over.

The reality is that immigration from Mexico has been decreasing since 2007, and the number of unauthorized immigrants living in the U.S. is at its lowest level since 2004, according to the Pew Research Center.

Further, the majority of illegal immigration to the United States from Mexico occurs in and around heavily secured ports of entry like San Diego, El Paso and Brownsville, Texas, where 654 miles of wall, fencing and other barriers already exist. Spending billions to build a structure along vast, rural stretches of the border doesn't help with security at the sections of the border that most need help.

No one is arguing for unsecure borders. The newly installed Democratic Congress voted Thursday to approve a stopgap funding bill that would reopen the federal government and provide $1.3 billion for border security in the form of manpower and equipment but not a wall. Trump has said he won't sign it, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell refuses to let a bill come to the Senate floor that the president won't sign.

It's hard to know what the president's end game is. He couldn't get the border wall approved when Republicans controlled both the House and the Senate, so it seems odd to take this stance on the heels of a midterm election in which Democrats made their biggest gains in 40 years and took control of the House.

Trump may feel he is being true to his base of ardent supporters, among whom the border wall ranked high on their list of priorities. But his focus is sorely misplaced. Rather, his attention should be focused on the independent voters who took a chance on him in 2016 believing his style could prove effective at getting things done in Washington. Shutting down the federal government in an effort to get $5 billion for a wall that most Americans don't feel the country needs is the opposite of getting things done.

Laura Kelly is already on the case for Kansas kids with decision to name new DCF leader ' The Kansas City Star

This is why voters elected incoming Gov. Laura Kelly: Because we need to do so much better for Kansas children, because we badly need transparency in state government and because there is zero time to waste in recovering all that was lost under Governors Sam Brownback and Jeff Colyer.

So good for her for marching so briskly into 2019. On Thursday, Kelly announced that she will replace Gina Meier-Hummel as head of the state's child welfare system. The Kansas Department for Children and Families was on what seemed like permanent crisis footing long before Meier-Hummel got there in fall of 2017. But it has remained troubled under her sometimes questionable leadership, and a change was in order.

Meier-Hummel had a difficult job and did make some improvements, which began with a top-to-bottom audit.

But she talked about transparency and didn't show enough of it. She decided to hire inexperienced and unlicensed social workers to fill jobs investigating reports of abuse and neglect. And she replaced contracts for foster care, family preservation and other services with grants that got around rules on no-bid arrangements.

Kelly asked the Colyer administration that she'll soon supplant -- in 11 days, her announcement noted, and we're glad she's counting -- not to implement those grants at this point. Meier-Hummel immediately said she'd honor that request.

The governor-elect also said outright that the state's procurement process wasn't followed and that agency officials had tried to keep her from learning more about how the grantees were chosen.

We wanted Kelly to clean house and name names, for the sake of the state's struggling families, and she's already doing that.

As The Star has reported, the agency gave a major grant to a Florida nonprofit already facing heavy criticism for its foster care. An agency spokeswoman argued that they'd been hired to provide family preservation services, not foster care, but it's still the same nonprofit group.

Meier-Hummel will be succeeded on an interim basis by Laura Howard, who for now will head both the DCF and the Kansas Department for Aging and Disability Services. A former regional administrator in a federal agency overseeing substance abuse and mental health services, Howard is currently director of the Public Management Center in the School of Public Affairs and Administration at the University of Kansas.

Meier-Hummel responded to Kelly's no-nonsense announcement with a news release of her own. It listed her achievements, including starting a new Wichita abuse and neglect reporting line, ""changing key policies and procedures and implementing further mandated training"" and reducing the number of missing and runaway kids by just over a quarter. The suspended grants are in the ""absolute best interest"" of Kansas children and families, the DCF's announcement said.

That's a matter of opinion, but ours is that Kelly has done the right thing and is off to a promising start even before being sworn in as governor."
387,centre daily times,https://www.centredaily.com/news/business/article224277975.html,"The government shutdown has suspended federal cleanups at Superfund sites around the nation and forced the cancellation of public hearings, deepening the mistrust and resentment of surrounding residents who feel people in power long ago abandoned them to live among the toxic residue of the country's factories and mines.

""We are already hurting, and it's just adding more fuel to the fire,"" says 40-year-old Keisha Brown, whose wood-frame home is in a community nestled among coking plants and other factories on Birmingham's north side.

The mostly African-American community has been forced to cope with high levels of arsenic, lead and other contaminants in the soil that the Environmental Protection Agency has been scraping up and carting away, house by house.

As President Donald Trump and Congress battle over Trump's demand for a wall on the southern U.S. border, the nearly 3-week-old partial government shutdown has stopped federal work on Superfund sites except for cases where the administration deems ""there is an imminent threat to the safety of human life or to the protection of property.""

EPA's shutdown plans said the agency would evaluate about 800 Superfund sites to see how many could pose an immediate threat. As an example of that kind of threat, it cited an acid leak from a mine that could threaten the public water supply. That's the hazard at Northern California's Iron Mountain mine, where EPA workers help prevent an unending flow of lethally acidic runoff off the Superfund site from spilling into rivers downstream.

Practically speaking, said Bonnie Bellow, a former EPA official who worked on Superfund public outreach at the agency, the impact of the stoppage of work at sites across the nation ""wholly depends"" on the length of the shutdown.

""Unless there is immediate risk like a storm, a flood, a week or two of slowdowns is not going to very likely affect the cleanup at the site,"" Bellow said.

In north Birmingham, Brown said it's been a couple of weeks since she's spotted any EPA crews at people's houses. It wasn't clear if state workers or contractors were continuing work.

But long before the shutdown began, Brown harbored doubts the cleanup was working anyway. ""My main concern is the health of the people out here,"" said Brown, who has asthma. ""All of us are sick, and we've got to function on medicine every day.""

In terms of time, the federal government shutdown is a chronological blip in the long history of the site -- which includes ethics charges in a local bribery scandal to block federal cleanup efforts -- but adds to the uncertainty in an area where residents feel forgotten and betrayed.

At the EPA, the shutdown has furloughed the bulk of the agency's roughly 14,000 employees. It also means the EPA isn't getting most of the daily stream of environmental questions and tips from the public. Routine inspections aren't happening. State, local and private emails to EPA officials often get automated messages back promising a response when the shutdown ends.

In Montana, for instance, state officials this month found themselves fielding calls from a tribal member worried about drinking water with a funny look to it, said Kristi Ponozzo, public-policy director at that state's Department of Environmental Quality. The EPA normally provides tribes with technical assistance on water supplies.

With most EPA colleagues idled, Ponozzo said, her agency also had to call off an environmental review meeting for a mining project, potentially delaying the project.

But it's the agency's work at Superfund sites -- lessening the threat from old nuclear-weapons plants, chemical factories, mines and other entities -- that gets much of the attention.

Absent imminent peril, it would be up to state governments or contractors to continue any cleanup during the shutdown ""up to the point that additional EPA direction or funding is needed,"" the EPA said in a statement.

""Sites where cleanup activities have been stopped or shut down will be secured until cleanup activities are able to commence when the federal government reopens,"" the agency said.

For federal Superfund sites in Michigan, the shutdown means there are no EPA colleagues to consult, said Scott Dean, a spokesman for that state's Department of Environmental Quality.

At Michigan Superfund sites, day-to-day field operations were continuing since private contractors do most of the on-the-ground work, Dean said.

Bellow, the former EPA official, said the cancellation of hearings about Superfund sites posed immediate concerns.

In East Chicago, Indiana, for example, the EPA called off a planned public hearing set for last Wednesday to outline how the agency planned to clean up high levels of lead and arsenic in the soil.

The EPA has proposed a seven-month, $26.5 million cleanup that includes treating and removing tainted soil from the area, where a lead smelter previously was located.

During a public meeting Nov. 29, some residents complained that the EPA's approach would leave too much pollution in place. But others didn't get a chance to speak and were hoping to do so at the meeting this week, said Debbie Chizewer, a Northwestern University environmental attorney who represents community groups in the low-income area.

The EPA announced the cancellation in an online notice and gave no indication that it would be rescheduled.

Leaders of the East Chicago Calumet Community Advisory Group asked for a new hearing date and an extension of a Jan. 14 public comment deadline in a letter to the EPA's regional Superfund division.

Calls by The Associated Press to the agency's regional office in Chicago this week were not answered.

Local critics fear the EPA will use the delay caused by the shutdown as justification for pushing ahead with a cleanup strategy they consider flawed, Chizewer said, even though the agency has designated the affected area as an ""environmental justice community"" -- a low-income community of color that has been disproportionately harmed by pollution.

The EPA has a ""special obligation"" when dealing with such communities, Chizewer said. ""This would be an example of shutting them out for no good reason.""

In North Birmingham, former longtime neighborhood resident Charlie Powell said most of the people living in and around the Superfund site had already ""just got tired and fed up.""

388,ktvq.com,https://ktvq.com/cnn-us-politics/2018/12/16/trumps-washington-faces-one-last-week-of-uproar-in-2018/,"A frenzied year in Washington is going out with a roar as the political forces that combined to make the first half of President Donald Trump's mandate so turbulent come to a head in a hugely consequential run-up to the holidays.

Looming over everything is the new reality, fueled by weeks of court filings by special counsel Robert Mueller and other prosecutors, that every corner of Trump's public life is now under investigation: his White House, his campaign, his presidential transition, his inaugural committee, his businesses.

The President's sense of persecution prompted a rage-filled Twitter outburst on Sunday that also appeared to reflect concern about cooperation agreements secured by Mueller with his longtime personal attorney and fixer Michael Cohen and former national security adviser Michael Flynn.

""The Russian Witch Hunt Hoax, started as the 'insurance policy' long before I even got elected, is very bad for our Country,"" Trump tweeted.

""They are Entrapping people for misstatements, lies or unrelated things that took place many years ago. Nothing to do with Collusion. A Democrat Scam!""

Trump's tweet ignored the fact that the legality of the Mueller probe has been upheld in court on several occasions and that it has secured a number of convictions and is opening a window into the President's own behavior in its prosecutions of his associates.

Former FBI Director James Comey, whom Trump fired, laid into the President in his own tweet Sunday, dismissing the President's claim on Twitter that the bureau's raid against Cohen this year was illegal.

""This is from the President of our country, lying about the lawful execution of a search warrant issued by a federal judge. Shame on Republicans who don't speak up at this moment -- for the FBI, the rule of law, and the truth,"" Comey wrote.

As a new week dawns, the capital is on edge to see whether Mueller has any more dramatic cards to play before the turn of the year. One event that may further irritate the President is Tuesday's sentencing hearing for Flynn, who admitted lying to the FBI.

But the Russia investigation is only one element in a complex set of political dramas that are playing out before Washington breaks for the Christmas and New Year recess.

An impasse over Trump's border wall could shutter parts of the government by the end of the week -- the latest battle in the war over immigration that has rocked American politics for more than a decade.

Yet another Cabinet member, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, is going home trailed by scandal, in another rebuke to the idea that the Trump administration was ever about draining the swamp.

A fresh staff shakeup is playing out in the West Wing, but experience suggests that new acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney will fare no better than his predecessors in imposing order on a President who defies management.

Obamacare is having another brush with extinction in the courts, just as the Republican House majority built on a vow to overturn the law limps out of town.

And the Democratic majority that will take over the House next year is already flexing its muscles after an extraordinary televised showdown between the party's top brass and Trump last week offered a preview of skirmishes to come.

The President's biggest, indisputable success is the motoring economy and historically low unemployment. But there are growing fears after several volatile weeks that a slowdown is looming, given ebbing global growth, a trade war with China and churning market volatility.

The possibility of a partial shutdown when funding runs out for several key departments at the end of the week appeared to rise on Sunday, with the White House and top Democrats hunkering down over Trump's demand for $5 billion in border wall funding.

""We're going to do whatever is necessary to build the border wall to stop this ongoing crisis of illegal immigration,"" White House senior policy adviser Stephen Miller said on CBS's ""Face the Nation.""

Asked whether that meant forcing a shutdown to extract the funds from Congress on an issue that was foundational to Trump's presidential campaign, Miller replied, ""If it comes to it, absolutely.""

But Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Trump will not get what he wants.

""President Trump should understand, there are not the votes for the wall. In the House or the Senate, he is not going to get the wall in any form,"" Schumer said on NBC's ""Meet the Press.""

Signs that the gap between the White House and Democrats is deepening raise the possibility that the showdown, if it does shutter government, could develop into the first big clash between the new Congress and the White House in January.

Americans who rely on the Affordable Care Act got a surprise lump of coal late on Friday night when a federal judge in Texas ruled that the entire law was unconstitutional.

The move set off a fresh duel over the centerpiece of Barack Obama's domestic agenda that has so far defied all GOP attempts to kill it off.

Immediate legal opinion -- even from some conservatives -- suggested that the sweeping ruling could end up being overturned, though there is a chance the fight over Obamacare's fate could end up yet again in the Supreme Court in a test of the new conservative majority.

The decision reignited the political wars over health care that Democrats believe played a significant role in their surge to victory in the House in the midterm elections. If that is the case, the Obamacare ruling, paradoxically, may not be good news for the GOP.

But Trump welcomed the latest threat to his predecessor's legacy.

""I believe we're going to get really good health care. Exciting things happened over the last 24 hours,"" Trump said at a congressional ball at the White House on Saturday night. Typically though, he gave few details of his vague plans to provide a better alternative to Obamacare, which now looks likely to be a key issue in yet another national election cycle.

Trump enters another week looking for another new Cabinet member after announcing the resignation of Zinke, who was facing multiple ethics probes and was a top oversight target of the new Democratic House.

The New York Times and Washington Post also reported that Zinke might have been fired if he failed to quit by the end of the year.

Possible replacements include Deputy Interior Secretary David Bernhardt and Nevada Republican Sen. Dean Heller, who lost his re-election race, sources with knowledge of the situation said.

Mulvaney, meanwhile, is gearing up to take on the daunting task of being Trump's third chief of staff. Given the failure of his two predecessors, Reince Priebus and John Kelly, to rein in a President who trusts his gut above all, there are few expectations that Mulvaney will calm an often erratic White House and impose discipline, as many predecessors did in other administrations.

""He's the chief of staff, not chief of the President, right? That's an important distinction,"" David Urban, the political strategist who masterminded Trump's 2016 victory in Pennsylvania, said on CNN's ""State of the Union.""

Still, Mulvaney appears to have a trusting relationship with the President, following his tenure as his budget chief. And his knowledge of Capitol Hill, gained as a former member of the House, will be an asset as the White House seeks to outmaneuver would-be Speaker Nancy Pelosi and her troops next year.

Trump heads into a Christmas break at his Mar-a-Lago resort this week in a position of increasing political and legal vulnerability after weeks of devastating revelations and court filings related to the Russia investigation.

The President has been implicated by New York prosecutors overseen by his own Justice Department in directing criminal attempts to subvert campaign finance laws alongside Cohen, whose case was referred by Mueller.

Cooperation by Cohen and Flynn is helping Mueller take his investigation deep into the President's inner circle. He has now uncovered multiple contacts between Trump associates and Russians during the time of Moscow's election meddling effort and repeated lying about those encounters.

Speculation is frenzied about one mysterious scene on Friday in which an entire floor of the federal courthouse in Washington was locked down over a mystery subpoena appeal involving the special counsel's team.

Things are certain to become more uncomfortable for Trump in the new year. Maryland Democratic Rep. Elijah Cummings, who is expected to take over the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, said on ""State of the Union"" that he would seek to secure testimony from Cohen before the President's former fixer reports to prison in March.

There were also worrying signs for Trump in a new NBC/Wall Street Journal poll that found that 62% of respondents believe the President has not been truthful about the Russia investigation.

Since his approval rating was 43% in the survey however, it seems that a portion of those Republicans who are uneasy about the President's attitude toward Mueller still don't see it as a deal breaker for their faith in him."
389,ktvq.com,https://ktvq.com/news/trending/2019/01/03/nancy-pelosi-poised-to-be-elected-house-speaker-in-new-congress/,"Nancy Pelosi was officially elected the new House speaker on Thursday in a majority vote by the House of Representatives on the first day of the 116th Congress.

As House speaker, Pelosi will regularly face off against President Donald Trump and will preside over an emboldened and energized Democratic majority that is poised to launch aggressive oversight of the President and his administration.

Pelosi also makes history as she reclaims a title she previously held when she served as the first and so far only female House speaker from 2007 to 2011.

A small, but vocal, faction of Democrats initially worked to derail Pelosi's bid to become the next Speaker following the 2018 midterm elections, but no challenger against her ever emerged and she ultimately succeed in winning over many of her critics.

One of the most immediate challenges confronting Pelosi as leader of the new House Democratic majority will be the fight over the President's long-promised border wall that triggered a standoff between congressional Democrats and the President and resulted in a partial government shutdown, which is now in its second week.

Pelosi has already outlined a plan for Democrats to pass a legislative package later in the day on Thursday to re-open shuttered parts of the government. Contrary to the President's demands for $5 billion for a border wall, however, the legislation does not provide any new wall funding, setting up an early confrontation between the new Democratic majority and the administration.

Pelosi always projected confidence that she would reclaim the Speaker's gavel, but faced criticism and pushback along the way.

At the end of November, she secured the nomination to become speaker by winning support from a majority of House Democrats -- a total of 203 votes in closed-door leadership elections. But she came up slightly short of the total 218 votes typically needed to win the speakership in the final January vote.

To become Speaker requires the support of a majority of all members of the House who are present and voting, a threshold that could be as high as 218 votes. It would be possible for Pelosi to win with fewer votes, as several previous House speakers have, if some members vote present or decline to participate.

Ahead of the final vote, Pelosi deployed her deal-making abilities to win over detractors, and by mid-December, she appeared to have secured the votes necessary to prevail after negotiating an agreement with some of the Democrats who had been lobbying to block her from the speakership. As part of the agreement, Pelosi backed a proposal to enact term limits for the party's top three leaders.

""I see myself as a bridge to the next generation of leaders, a recognition of my continuing responsibility to mentor and advance new Members into positions of power and responsibility in the House Democratic Caucus,"" Pelosi said in a statement at the time."

The Army is looking for a few good robots. Not to fight -- not yet, at least -- but to help the men and women who do.

These robots aren't taking up arms, but the companies making them have waged a different kind of battle. At stake is a contract worth almost half a billion dollars for 3,000 backpack-sized robots that can defuse bombs and scout enemy positions. Competition for the work has spilled over into Congress and federal court.

Euro currency remains a work in progress on 20th birthday

FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- The euro is about to celebrate its 20th birthday, but the countries that use it are still wrestling with how the shared currency should work and how to fix flaws exposed by the debt crisis that marred its second decade.

The euro was launched on Jan. 1, 1999, when 10 countries fixed their exchange rates to it and handed decisions on interest rates to the newly-founded European Central Bank. Euro notes and coins went into circulation three years later.

The shared currency was seen as a solution to the constant quarrels over exchange rates that had marked European politics after World War II and as a logical extension of the European Union's tariff-free trade zone. Britain, notably, opted out, but 19 of 28 EU countries use the euro.

North Korea's 'Singapore shops' expose gap in sanctions push

PYONGYANG, North Korea (AP) -- Despite the unwanted publicity of a criminal trial for one of their main suppliers, business is booming at Pyongyang's 'Singapore shops,' which sell everything from Ukrainian vodka to brand-name knock-offs from China. The stores stock many of the very things United Nations' sanctions banning trade in luxury goods are intended to block and provide a nagging reminder that not all potential trade partners are lining up behind the U.N.'s pronouncements or the Trump administration's policy of maximum pressure on the North.

Especially when there's a buck -- or a few million bucks -- to be made.

US pending home sales slipped 0.7 percent in November

WASHINGTON (AP) -- Fewer Americans signed contracts to buy homes in November as higher mortgage rates and prices continued to squeeze would-be buyers out of the market.

The National Association of Realtors said Friday that its pending home sales index dipped 0.7 percent last month to 101.4. The index based on contract signings has dropped 7.7 percent over the past year and has recorded 11 straight year-over-year decreases.

Tesla names Oracle's Ellison to board in SEC settlement

Musk got into trouble with the Securities and Exchange Commission in early August when he said in a tweet that he had ""funding secured"" to take the electric car company private at $420 per share.

GOP and Democrats trade blame for shutdown, no deal in sight

WASHINGTON (AP) -- The partial government shutdown will almost certainly be handed off to a divided government to solve in the new year, as both parties traded blame Friday and President Donald Trump sought to raise the stakes in the weeklong impasse.

As agreement eludes Washington in the waning days of the Republican monopoly on power, it sets up the first big confrontation between Trump and newly empowered Democrats. Trump is sticking with his demand for money to build a border wall with Mexico, and Democrats, who take control of the House on Jan. 3, are refusing to give him what he wants.

Trump raised the stakes on Friday, reissuing threats to shut the U.S.-Mexico border to pressure Congress to fund the wall and to shut off aid to three Central American countries from which many migrants have fled.

392,centre daily times,https://www.centredaily.com/news/business/article223342450.html,"Excerpts from recent editorials in the United States and abroad:

The New York Times on a judge's rebuke of Michael Flynn and President Donald Trump's charitable foundation:

A bit of common sense and common decency intruded on Tuesday into the crazy world of Donald Trump.

In New York, the state attorney general announced that the president had agreed that the ""charity"" he used as a piggy bank has no reason to exist.

In Washington, a federal judge let a former top presidential aide know that you can parrot political spin or you can tell the truth, but you can't do both to someone who can send you to prison.

Michael Flynn, Mr. Trump's former national security adviser, appeared before Judge Emmet Sullivan to be sentenced to what he expected would be a term of probation, after pleading guilty to lying to federal investigators about conversations with the Russian ambassador. The office of the special counsel, Robert Mueller, had earlier filed a memo that said it would be right for Mr. Flynn to avoid prison after his extensive cooperation in the investigation of Trump ties to Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential campaign and after.

Then last week, in a memo about their client's sentencing, Mr. Flynn's lawyers implied that he had been tricked into lying and that the F.B.I. acted improperly in interviewing him -- points raised by pro-Trump commentators elaborating on the president's claims of being victimized by a witch hunt.

Judge Sullivan was having none of it.

""I cannot recall an instance of a court ever accepting a guilty plea from someone who did not maintain he was guilty,"" Judge Sullivan said, ""and I do not intend to start today.""

Chastened, Mr. Flynn told the judge that nobody tricked him, that he lied and that he knew he shouldn't have.

The judge was not upset only about Mr. Flynn's sneaky prevarication. He said he felt ""disgust"" at Mr. Flynn's offenses, that a retired three-star general would lie to the F.B.I. ""while on the physical premises of the White House,"" and, acting as an unregistered agent of a foreign country, Turkey, while he was an adviser to Mr. Trump (to which he admitted but was not charged). It was a bracing reminder of the brazenness of his misdeeds and of the standards the public should be able to expect of those who serve them.

Realizing that Judge Sullivan was considering a term of up to six months in prison, Mr. Flynn accepted his offer to delay the sentencing for 90 days until he has completed his cooperation with the special counsel.

""Good luck today in court to General Michael Flynn,"" Mr. Trump had tweeted first thing Tuesday morning.

""Thanks for nothing, Mr. President,"" Mr. Flynn might have thought as he left court.

Mr. Flynn should be grateful the judge offered him the chance to come clean. By contrast, the Donald J. Trump Foundation, a charity that provided no charity, quite properly received none from the New York attorney general's office.

Attorney General Barbara Underwood accused it of ""a shocking pattern of illegality"" that ""amounted to the Trump Foundation functioning as little more than a checkbook to serve Mr. Trump's business and political interests.""

Whatever money that remains will be disbursed under the supervision of Ms. Underwood's office and the judge overseeing the continuing lawsuit her office filed in June, seeking $2.8 million in restitution and a ban on Mr. Trump and his three oldest children serving on the boards of other nonprofit organizations.

In a series of stories exposing the foundation's true nature, The Washington Post found that its largest donation was to fix a fountain in front of the Plaza Hotel in Manhattan, which Mr. Trump owned at the time, that its funds were used to buy a portrait of Mr. Trump, and that it illegally provided political donations and paid for personal legal settlements.

All this comes just days after prosecutors announced that they believed that Mr. Trump had conspired with the owner of The National Enquirer and his fixer Michael Cohen to violate campaign finance laws by paying hush money to two women who said they had affairs with him. It's also just been reported that prosecutors are investigating spending by the Trump inaugural committee. The president still faces lawsuits on the constitutionality of his enriching himself while in office. Meanwhile, the special counsel's inquiry may be expanding rather than winding down.

It's fitting that despite all his bluster and threats, a president who's demonstrated such contempt for the rule of law is finding it so formidable.

That this goes to the essence of American governance was best summed up by Paula Duncan, the Trump enthusiast who was among the jurors who found Mr. Trump's former campaign chief Paul Manafort guilty of fraud, even though she had hoped he wouldn't be convicted.

Explaining her decision after the verdict, she told Fox News, ""No one's above the law.""

The Wall Street Journal on a judge's ruling on the Affordable Care Act's individual mandate:

No one opposes ObamaCare more than we do, and Democrats are now confirming that it was designed as a way-station to government-run health care. But a federal judge's ruling that the law is unconstitutional is likely to be overturned on appeal and may boomerang politically on Republicans.

Judge Reed O'Connor ruled for some 20 state plaintiffs that the Affordable Care Act's individual mandate is no longer legal because Republicans repealed its financial penalty as part of the 2017 tax reform. Recall that Chief Justice John Roberts joined four Justices to say ObamaCare's mandate was illegal as a command to individuals to buy insurance under the Commerce Clause. ""The Framers gave Congress the power to regulate commerce, not to compel it,"" he wrote.

Yet the Chief famously salvaged ObamaCare by unilaterally rewriting the mandate to be a ""tax"" that was within Congress's power. Never mind that Democrats had expressly said the penalty was not a tax. Majority Leader Roberts declared it to be so.

Enter Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, who argues in Texas v. U.S. that since Congress has repealed the mandate, the tax is no longer a tax, and ObamaCare is thus illegal. Judge O'Connor agreed with that logic, and he went further in ruling that since Congress said the mandate is crucial to the structure of ObamaCare, then all of ObamaCare must fall along with the mandate.

We'll admit to a certain satisfaction in seeing the Chief Justice hoist on his own logic. But his ruling in NFIB v. Sebelius was in 2012 and there is more at issue legally now than the ""tax"" issue in that opinion. One legal complication is that Congress in 2017 repealed the financial part of the individual mandate, not the structure of the mandate itself. Republicans used budget rules to pass tax reform so they couldn't repeal the mandate's express language.

The Affordable Care Act has also been up and running since 2014, which means so-called reliance interests come into play when considering a precedent. Millions of people now rely on ObamaCare's subsidies and rules, which argues against judges repealing the law by fiat.

Judge O'Connor breezes past this like a liberal Ninth Circuit appeals judge handling a Donald Trump appeal. He's right that Democrats claimed the individual mandate was essential to the Affordable Care Act. But when Congress killed the financial penalty in 2017 it left the rest of ObamaCare intact. When judging congressional intent, a judge must account for the amending Congress as well as the original Congress.

In any case, the Supreme Court's ""severability"" doctrine calls for restraint in declaring an entire law illegal merely because one part of it is. Our guess is that even the right-leaning Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals judges will overturn Judge O'Connor on this point.

As for the politics, Democrats claim to be alarmed by the ruling but the truth is they're elated. They want to use it to further pound Republicans for denying health insurance for pre-existing conditions if the law is overturned. Democrats campaigned across the country against Mr. Paxton's lawsuit to gain House and Senate seats in November, and they will now press votes in Congress so they can compound the gains in 2020.

President Trump hailed the ruling in a tweet, but he has never understood the Affordable Care Act. His Administration has done good work revising regulations to reduce health-care costs and increase access, but the risk is that the lawsuit will cause Republicans in Congress to panic politically and strike a deal with Democrats that reinforces ObamaCare. This is what happens when conservatives fall into the liberal trap of thinking they can use the courts to achieve policy goals that need to be won in Congress.

The Washington Post on withdrawing all 2,000 U.S. troops out of Syria:

PRESIDENT TRUMP'S sudden move to yank U.S. troops out of Syria undermined at a stroke several foreign policy goals he has championed. The president promised to finish the job of destroying the Islamic State, but the withdrawal will leave thousands of its fighters still in place. He vowed to roll back Iran's aggression across the Middle East, but his decision will allow its forces to entrench in the country that is the keystone of Tehran's ambitions. He promised to protect Israel, but that nation will now be left to face alone the buildup by Iran and its proxies along its northern border.

The president's top national security advisers had carefully developed and articulated a strategy of maintaining a U.S. presence in Syria until the Islamic State was beyond revival and Iran withdrew its forces -- a plan they were defending up until this week. Mr. Trump has again demonstrated, to them and to the world, that no U.S. policy or foreign commitment is immune from his whims.

Mr. Trump claimed the Islamic State had been defeated, but that is not the view of the Defense and State Departments. Thousands of jihadist fighters are still in Syria and control splotches of territory in the Euphrates Valley. A U.S. withdrawal will give the extremists an opportunity to reconstitute, as they did in Iraq following the premature U.S. withdrawal ordered by President Barack Obama.

Until Wednesday, a prime talking point of senior national security officials was that, ""if we've learned one thing over the years, (the) enduring defeat of a group like this means you can't just defeat their physical space and then leave,"" as the State Department's special envoy for the global campaign against the Islamic State, Brett McGurk, put it last week. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said it another way in September: ""Getting rid of the caliphate doesn't mean you then blindly say, 'Okay, we got rid of it,' march out, and then wonder why the caliphate comes back.""

Mr. Trump has justified some of his most controversial decisions, including his continued support for Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, as needed to contain Iran's threat to the United States and its allies. But the Syrian withdrawal hands Tehran and its ally Russia a windfall. Iran has deployed thousands of fighters and allied militiamen to Syria and aspires to create a corridor to Lebanon and the Mediterranean, as well as a new front against Israel along the Golan Heights. In reaction to that threat, Mr. Trump's national security adviser, John Bolton, announced Sept. 24 that ""We're not going to leave (Syria) as long as Iranian troops are outside Iranian borders, and that includes Iranian proxies and militias.""

U.S. ambitions in Syria have never been backed by adequate resources, and a case could be made that neither Congress nor the American public were prepared to support the mission suggested by Mr. Bolton. But Mr. Trump's decision appears to have been precipitated by the bellicose rhetoric of Turkey's Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who last week threatened -- not for the first time -- a military operation against Syrian Kurds, even though U.S. troops are positioned around them. The autocratic Turkish ruler appears to have extracted multiple favors from Mr. Trump in recent days, including the sale of U.S. Patriot missiles and a promise to reexamine the possible extradition of his rival, Fethullah Gulen, from Pennsylvania. If Mr. Trump received anything in return, he hasn't disclosed it.

The Syrian Kurdish forces, which have fought alongside the United States and played a crucial role in liberating most of eastern Syria from the jihadists, will be perhaps the foremost victims of Mr. Trump's decision. Betrayed by Washington, they will now be subject to a military offensive by Turkey. The stab in the back will send an unforgettable message to all who are asked to cooperate with the United States in the fight against terrorism: Washington is an unreliable and dangerous partner.

The Orange County (California) Register on Mick Mulvaney as Trump's choice for chief of staff:

President Trump has found a new chief of staff, albeit an interim one, in his director of the Office of Management and Budget, Mick Mulvaney.

That of chief is a terribly important post, perhaps government's most consequential aside from that of his boss. In theory, at least, the chief of staff is the gatekeeper for everything the president does, everyone he sees, everyone he talks to on the phone.

Perhaps, though few would expect this to be the case, the arbiter of every time he sends out a tweet, and of what it should say.

A Washington insider, a former congressman, Mulvaney is in many ways ideal for the job. He wants it, badly, whereas others with similarly impressive resumes touted for the job have indicated a strong desire to spend more time with their families, from Vice President Pence's staff chief Nick Ayers of Georgia to former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie.

Mulvaney shares the conservative values currently espoused by the president and was a founder of the House Freedom Caucus in 2013, the group that always taunted the Republican leadership, opposing much government funding, including debt limit increases and budget agreements made with the Democrats.

But he also, after Trump secured the Republican nomination in 2016, called the candidate ""a terrible human being"" who he only was voting for out of an even greater dislike of Hillary Clinton.

It's not as if other presidential allies of today haven't said bad things about him in the past. On the campaign trail, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz called his rival ""a narcissist at a level I don't think this country's ever seen,"" for instance.

But if you were the nation's chief executive -- or the CEO of a much smaller entity, for that matter -- could you hire as your top aide and work with a person who had once dubbed you ""terrible""?

Or does this kind of talk come with the territory in politics, where many strange bedfellows are made because of having to run in elections against once and perhaps future allies? Should Trump indeed elevate this practical choice for staff chief to permanent status immediately?

Los Angeles Times on banning bump stocks, which allow semi-automatic weapons to fire like machine guns:

The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives said Tuesday that it had finalized a rule reclassifying so-called bump stocks -- the devices that can make a semiautomatic rifle fire nearly as quickly a fully automatic weapon -- as machine guns, which makes it illegal to manufacture, sell or possess them. The agency said a year ago it had the authority to reclassify the devices, and President Trump -- in the wake of the Parkland, Fla., school shooting -- directed the ATF to speed up the process. Tuesday's announcement -- a rare bit of welcome news from the Trump administration -- makes it official; White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters that owners of the conversion devices will have until March 21 to destroy them or turn them in to the ATF.

This is a good step. Unfortunately, it's all but certain to be challenged in the courts, and it's on shaky legal ground because of the way the new rule evolved. The Obama administration determined that because bump stocks have ""no automatically functioning mechanical parts and (perform) no automated mechanical functions when installed,"" they did not fit the definition of a machine gun in federal law, which meant the ATF lacked the authority to regulate them. Tuesday's announcement, by contrast, hinges not on the technical specifications, but on the functionality. In essence, if it fires like a machine gun, it's a machine gun. Cue the lawyers.

We hope the administration prevails in whatever challenges emerge, but the sure-fire way to resolve this would be for Congress to legislate bump stocks and related gadgets out of existence. Such devices serve no function other than to evade the strict congressional limit on machine guns by, as the ATF said, harnessing ""the recoil energy of the semiautomatic firearm in a manner that allows the trigger to reset and continue firing"" without the shooter having to pull the trigger for each shot.

A mass shooter in Las Vegas used bump stocks affixed to semiautomatic rifles to fire more than 1,000 rounds in a matter of minutes from a 32nd-floor suite of the Mandalay Bay Hotel into a crowd of some 20,000 people, killing 58 concertgoers and injuring hundreds of others. It was the largest single mass shooting in the modern era, drawing attention to bump stocks and sparking outraged demands by many -- the Los Angeles Times included -- that the devices be banned.

As welcome as this new rule is, it will do little to corral our national problem with gun violence. The vast majority of gun deaths come in ones and twos, led by suicides. ...

But it is progress. And the president deserves credit for sticking with his promise to find a way to ban bump stocks. ...

China Daily says telecommunications giant Huawei is a victim of U.S. panic attacks:

This year has not been an annus mirabilis for China's Huawei Technologies Ltd, the world's largest supplier of telecommunications network equipment and second-biggest maker of smartphones.

Although it has been constantly in the news and it is said there is no such thing as bad publicity, it has been making headlines because of the spurious claims it somehow poses a threat to the West, even world peace. It has never been explained exactly how.

In fact it is not because of anything it has done, but because its success has brought it into the crosshairs of the United States' anxiety attacks against China.

Huawei is at the forefront of 5G technology. This latest generation mobile network technology promises to bring the much anticipated and heralded internet of things to life and the US is determined to be the 5G leader.

Not only because whichever country develops the technology that is adopted as standard will have a huge commercial advantage. But also because by setting the standard it will have a knowledge advantage.

As a result, first the US and then one after another its most obedient allies have blocked Huawei from entering their 5G markets on security grounds.

None of them have offered any specific justification for blocking Huawei. They just repeat their claim that the company poses a security risk. That is why objective observers have concluded that those countries are politicizing a commercial issue.

It sets a harmful precedent. What if other countries used the same excuse to block US companies (not confined to the telecom sector)? The US companies are very competitive in many fields, including those that could pose huge security risks, such as finance.

While Huawei will not go unscathed from being prevented from entering key markets, as a competitive player, it still has a vast market to access in other parts of the world. It has signed contracts to supply 5G equipment to 25 telecom carriers, and more than 10,000 5G base stations have been shipped.

In stark contrast to the US and its allies, India for instance, has invited Huawei to conduct 5G trials in the country and complimented it on the role it has played in helping to develop its telecom industry.

The efforts of the US and its allies to try to shield their companies against a Chinese competitor are politically motivated, not the result of a fact-based or transparent decision-making process. And they are counterproductive to the concerted efforts that are needed to ensure the security of 5G networks."
393,ktvq.com,https://ktvq.com/cnn-us-politics/2019/01/03/nancy-pelosi-poised-to-be-elected-house-speaker-in-new-congress/,"Nancy Pelosi is poised to reclaim the title of House speaker on Thursday when the new Democratic majority arrives in Washington and takes over control of the House of Representatives.

A small, but vocal, faction of Democrats initially worked to derail Pelosi's bid to become the next Speaker following the 2018 midterm elections, but no challenger against her ever emerged and she ultimately succeed in winning over many of her critics.

The longtime House Democratic leader is now on the verge of winning back the position of power she previously held when she served as the first and so far only female House speaker from 2007 to 2011.

In the role of speaker, Pelosi will be one of the most visible members of the Democratic Party to regularly face off against President Donald Trump and will preside over an emboldened and energized Democratic majority that is poised to launch aggressive oversight of the President and his administration.

One of the most immediate challenges that will confront Pelosi as leader of the new House Democratic majority will be the fight over the President's long-promised border wall that triggered a standoff between congressional Democrats and the President and resulted in a partial government shutdown, which is now in its second week.

Pelosi has already outlined a plan for Democrats to pass a legislative package later in the day on Thursday to re-open shuttered parts of the government. Contrary to the President's demands for $5 billion for a border wall, however, the legislation does not provide any new wall funding, setting up an early confrontation between the new Democratic majority and the administration.

Pelosi always projected confidence that she would reclaim the Speaker's gavel, but faced criticism and pushback along the way.

At the end of November, she secured the nomination to become speaker by winning support from a majority of House Democrats -- a total of 203 votes in closed-door leadership elections. But she came up slightly short of the total 218 votes typically needed to win the speakership in the final January vote.

To become Speaker requires the support of a majority of all members of the House who are present and voting, a threshold that could be as high as 218 votes. It would be possible for Pelosi to win with fewer votes, as several previous House speakers have, if some members vote present or decline to participate.

Ahead of the final vote, Pelosi deployed her deal-making abilities to win over detractors, and by mid-December, she appeared to have secured the votes necessary to prevail after negotiating an agreement with some of the Democrats who had been lobbying to block her from the speakership. As part of the agreement, Pelosi backed a proposal to enact term limits for the party's top three leaders.

""I see myself as a bridge to the next generation of leaders, a recognition of my continuing responsibility to mentor and advance new Members into positions of power and responsibility in the House Democratic Caucus,"" Pelosi said in a statement at the time."
394,outside the beltway,https://www.outsidethebeltway.com/trump-backs-away-from-national-emergency-option-as-shutdown-enters-record-territory/,"President Trump appears to be backing away from the idea of declaring a national emergency to get his wall built. But the other options he's considering aren't much better.

President Trump is apparently backing away from threats to declare a ""national emergency"" to get his border wall built:

WASHINGTON -- President Trump has stepped back from declaring a national emergency to pay for a border wall, under pressure from congressional Republicans, his own lawyers and advisers, who say using it as a way out of the government shutdown does not justify the precedent it would set and the legal questions it could raise.

""If today the national emergency is border security, tomorrow the national emergency might be climate change,"" Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, one of the idea's critics, said this week. Another Republican, Senator Mitt Romney of Utah, told an interviewer that declaring a national emergency should be reserved for ""the most extreme circumstances.""

Mr. Trump, who according to aides has grown increasingly frustrated over the refusal of Democrats to bend and sees the shutdown as a road with no off-ramp in sight, hinted on Friday that the warnings were having an effect.

""What we're not looking to do right now is national emergency,"" he told reporters gathered in the Cabinet Room as the shutdown approached its fourth week. Minutes later he contradicted himself, saying that he would declare a state of emergency if he had to.

As Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senator Chuck Schumer, the minority leader, have proved immune to Mr. Trump's threats, the idea of using the president's constitutional powers to declare an emergency has received close scrutiny in the White House because it would enable Mr. Trump to obtain the $5.7 billion he has sought for construction of a wall without the approval of Congress.

Instead, Mr. Trump would use his authority to transfer funds to the wall that were appropriated by Congress for other purposes. Toward that end, the Army Corps of Engineers has been directed to study whether it can divert about $13.9 billion in emergency aide set aside for Puerto Rico, Florida, Texas and California. And with the money secured, the president could drop his opposition to the appropriations bills whose passage would end the shutdown.

That would allow Mr. Trump to say he had never backed down from his fight with congressional Democrats or abandoned his pledge to build the wall even if the construction became tied up in legal challenges.

Former White House aides, who noted that Mr. Trump did not focus on the wall during the first two years of his presidency, said the optics of fighting for the wall were more important to the president than erecting it.

But opposition has come from many Republican quarters. Some conservatives see it as an unacceptable extension of executive power. Kellyanne Conway, a White House aide, has said it would essentially give Congress a pass. Representative Mike Simpson, Republican of Idaho and a member of the House Appropriations Committee, said it was not clear to him that an emergency declaration would even lead to the prompt reopening of the government.

He called it ""a bad escape hatch"" that was going to anger many House members.

Mr. Trump's reluctance is also frustrating allies ginning him up to take action. ""If it's a crisis, treat it like a crisis,"" Stephen K. Bannon, the former chief White House strategist, said in an interview. ""His best option now is to declare a national security emergency and get on with it.""

On Thursday, Mr. Trump traveled to the border in Texas to dramatize his support for a wall but used a photo-op along the banks of the Rio Grande on Thursday only to repeat his familiar arguments for building it. He sidestepped the issue when Sean Hannity, the Fox News host, asked him in an interview that night to detail what a national emergency would look like.

""There's some compromise needed,"" Mr. Trump said.

But Mr. Trump, who allies said was eager to spend time at his Mar-a-Lago club in Florida and resented the advice of aides to deliver an Oval Office address and travel to Texas on Thursday, is left with few good options.

As he searches for a way to end the political stalemate with Democratic lawmakers, Mr. Trump is finding himself boxed in, in a familiar position when it comes to immigration issues. Former aides say that is because he conflates legal and policy issues with public relations campaigns and does not anticipate an endgame.

This news contradicts reports yesterday and Thursday that seemed to indicate that the President was leaning toward the idea of a ""national emergency"" due to the fact that there clearly didn't seem like there was any way that Congress was going to give in on border wall funding. According to those reports, Trump was leaning this way even though legal advisers were advising against it due to the fact that such a move was most likely illegal and because of the bad precedent it would set. Notwithstanding that, Trump seemed to be leaning toward the idea that taking such action would allow him to 'save face' by saying he did something to try to get the wall built but had been stopped by the courts. In the meantime, he could have signed legislation reopening the government that didn't fund the border wall. In that manner, I suppose, he could both claim to his supporters that he had done what he could for the wall and singlehandedly reopened the government, even though it's obvious that he was the reason the government closed. Given the fact that polling is making clear that the public is blaming the President for the shutdown, it's unlikely that they'd be stupid enough to fall for this kind of spin.

This leaves the second option that the President is apparently considering, the idea of diverting money allocated for other purposes to pay for the border wall. As I explained yesterday, this would also seem to be a violation of the law:

As for the second proposal to use money that Congress has allocated to the Defense Department to build the wall, even though Congress has not explicitly organized such an action. As with the idea of a ""national emergency,"" while there are arguably some provisions of law that might permit this, the balance of Federal law says exactly the opposite, For example, this action would seem to directly violate long-standing Federal laws regarding the Federal budget such as the Federal Budget And Accounting Act and the Congressional Budget And Impoundment Act of 1974. The first law basically restates the Constitutional fact that Congress controls the purse strings and that the Executive Branch cannot spend money in a manner not authorized by Congress. The second strengthened those laws and limited the ability of the President to do things like refuse to spend allocated funds or use funds in an unauthorized manner. What all this means is that this move, which would fall short of declaring a ""national emergency"" would also end up in Court and would likely result in any action taken by the Trump Administration put on hold for the foreseeable future.

The fact that something isn't necessarily legal has never stopped the President before. We've seen this in connection with his Muslim Travel Ban, his efforts to ban transgender troops from serving in the military, his efforts to punish so-called 'sanctuary cities, his family separation and asylum policies on the southern border, and his efforts to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, this President has seen his policy proposals blocked, scaled back, or completely barred by the Federal Courts on a scale unseen by previous Administration. In several cases, these decisions have even come from Judges appointed by previous Republican Presidents and, in at least one case, by Trump himself. Invariably, the President's public reaction has been to attack the judiciary just as he attacked the Mexican-American Judge presiding over the Trump University during the campaign. I suppose one can respond to this by saying that Trump at least has not responded to these decisions by refusing to comply with them as his hero Andrew Jackson did, but the only honest response one can give to this is ""yet.""

At the same time the White House considers its options, the shutdown continues. As James Joyner noted this morning it has now become the longest shutdown in American history, surpassing even the twenty-one day shutdown of December 1995-January 1996 during the first year of joint rule by President Clinton and a Republican Congress. In that case, the shutdown ended in no small part due to the fact that Republicans began to realize that they were being harmed by the ongoing crisis. Now, we have polls showing that the President is suffering politically but he doesn't seem to care. Instead, he is thriving on the opposition and seems to be settling in for a prolonged battle even though he has no weapons left."
395,ktvq.com,https://ktvq.com/cnn-business-consumer/2019/01/08/networks-wasted-no-time-fact-checking-trumps-oval-office-address/,"A version of this article first appeared in the ""Reliable Sources"" newsletter. You can sign up for free right here.

Hey there, this is Oliver Darcy filling in for Brian Stelter.

That is the chyron on ""CNN Tonight"" as I'm writing tonight's newsletter -- and it's the big question heading into Wednesday. Did Trump's speech move the needle? Or, as John King put it earlier in the night, ""Did the president win over any Democrats?"" It's hard to imagine he did.

The brief Oval Office address didn't include any new arguments or information that would prompt anyone to be persuaded one way or another. As Fox's Chris Wallace bluntly summed up, ""The President tonight was making an offer the Democrat's can't accept.""

Earlier in the day, Trump hosted television news journalists for an off-the-record lunch at the White House where he reportedly made a huge admission. NYT's Peter Baker reported via sources in the room that Trump privately told the journalists he wasn't inclined to deliver the prime time address, but had been persuaded to do so by advisers.

One source told Baker that Trump conceded the speech was ""not going to change a damn thing."" The source said Trump went even further, saying his trip to the border was just a big photo op. Then he pointed to Bill Shine and Sarah Sanders and said, ""But, these people behind you say it's worth it."" In other words, even Trump didn't think he would persuade anyone with his speech.

>> Publicly, of course, Trump played up his speech, tweeting late Tuesday night, ""Thank you for soooo many nice comments regarding my Oval Office speech. A very interesting experience!""

Before the networks made the decision to air Trump's address, a debate raged in media circles: Should the channels turn over their valuable air time for what was almost certainly going to be a political speech? After some deliberation, every broadcast and cable news outlet decided to do so. Ted Koppel told NYT prior to the speech, ""When the president of the United States asks for airtime, you've got to do it."" And look, at the end of the day, networks were put in a difficult position.

But now, in hindsight, I'm wondering: Are TV execs comfortable with their decision? Bill Carter tweeted, ""Networks should feel totally burned. Shouldn't they come out + tell WH: That was a fraudulent request; forget asking for platform for your political posturing ever again?"" And Erik Wemple noted, ""Looks like the White House secured major network TV time for an address that repeats all of the president's arguments on immigration, only, this time, through a TelePrompTer.""

Brian Stelter emails from Las Vegas: I'm here at CES, where I can report that... umm... almost no one watched the speech or the Democratic response. Here's my sense: The cable newsers are almost always going to carry a big prime time presidential speech. The broadcast networks are inclined to say yes, as well, though it's more complicated for them.

The broadcast execs noted that this was Trump's first time asking for airtime for an Oval Office address. They also noted that the country is in the midst of a partial government shutdown. Given the newsless nature of this address, they are likely to be a bit more skeptical the next time Trump requests time... But this is the bottom line: One of the powers of the presidency is the power to address the nation.

TV networks did air Trump's speech in the most responsible manner in which they could, fact-checking his claims immediately after it concluded. NBC ""Nightly News"" anchor Lester Holt noted that the president repeated ""some of the dubious claims he's made in the past."" ABC's Cecilia Vega helped check facts with George Stephanopoulos. ""Just because you say it's a crisis, doesn't necessarily make it one,"" Vega said. Fox's Shep Smith listed off a number of areas on which Trump misled the public during his speech. And CBS ""Evening News"" anchor Jeff Glor told viewers the he hoped to ""fact check any inaccurate assertions.""

>> That said, Tom Kludt flagged a salient point from Glor who said, ""There is some nuance to some of these arguments that unfortunately [due to] time, sometimes gets lost.""

CNN and MSNBC not only spent much of the evening checking Trump's claims against the facts on-air, but they did so aggressively in the chyrons. Throughout the night, I noticed various fact check's (like the one above) being employed by both of the networks.

Alex Koppelman emails: One argument we've heard frequently during the discussion over whether or not networks should take Trump live is that we all provide comprehensive fact-checks, both on air and online, of what he says after he says it, or sometimes during. That's a good thing, no question -- but when it comes to justifying taking him live, there's a major caveat that I haven't seen discussed: We don't really know if fact-checks work, or whether we're doing them the right way.

A 2011 CJR article noted that one study showed that the more effective way to fact-check the conspiracy theory that Barack Obama is a Muslim would be to state the fact -- Obama is a Christian -- rather than state and correct the falsehood. The same researchers also explored the effect that the race of the people conducting the research survey had on respondents' answers about these facts, and concluded, ""our findings suggest that the context in which corrective information about sensitive topics is delivered affects how people perceive and respond to them.""

This is not settled science by any means -- but there are people studying it. And if we as an industry are going to rely on fact-checking as our shield when we choose to give over our space to words we know will contain misinformation, we should be talking to those researchers, providing funding for their work, even bringing them in-house to help us test and improve our approach. We owe our audiences more than just going with our guts and hoping it works out.

CNN: Hosts Chris Cuomo and Don Lemon featured analysis and fact checking from reporters and contributors. Lemon opened up his show with a thorough fact-check of Trump's speech.

Fox News: After Bret Baier signed off Fox News' special coverage, Sean Hannity spent much of the evening unsurprisingly advocating for Trump's position on the wall. Guests included Lindsey Graham and Mark Levin, both of whom were supportive of the president.

MSNBC: Rachel Maddow scored a big guest, interviewing Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez who slammed Trump. ""The one thing the president has not talked about is the fact he has systematically engaged in the violation of... human rights on our border,"" Ocasio-Cortez said, according to Mediaite. ""He has separated children from their families.""

This should come as no surprise. The Daily Beast reported that ahead of his Oval Office address, Trump ""leaned on a number of advisers for how to navigate the government shutdown he'd waged over funding for his border wall."" The advisers, per The Beast, included Sean Hannity, and Lou Dobbs who encouraged Trump to continue demanding funding for the wall.

>> Related: Tomi Lahren noted in this tweet that Trump's Oval Office address used similar rhetoric to commentary she had delivered on Hannity's show. ""Something @realDonaldTrump said in his #OvalOfficeAddress tonight sounded familiar...""

Stelter emails: The accumulation of daily deceptions and fear-mongering matters a LOT more than a single speech. But this episode has sparked some smart discussions about the media's Trump coverage. Hopefully it'll continue. I talked with The New Yorker's Isaac Chotiner about these issues... Here's the Q&A...

396,forum of fargo-moorhead,https://www.inforum.com/news/government-and-politics/939017-Partial-government-shutdown-assured-after-lawmakers-leave-Capitol-without-budget-deal,"WASHINGTON - Large parts of the federal government are shutting down overnight after President Donald Trump torpedoed a bipartisan spending deal because it lacked the money he demanded for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.

Funding for numerous agencies, including those that operate parks, homeland security, law enforcement, tax collection and transportation, was set to expire at midnight. Close to 400,000 federal workers are expected to be sent home without pay until a deal is reached, and numerous services will be halted in that time, with the impacts broadening the longer the funding lapse lasts.

The shutdown intensifies a standoff between Trump, who is demanding $5.7 billion for a border wall, and congressional Democrats, who have vowed to block any wall funding and have the votes to do so. It marks a deflating final chapter for Republicans as they complete two years of unified GOP control in Washington - as well as an acrimonious prelude to the upcoming era of divided government, after Democrats take the House in January.

Trump saw the final days of this year as his last chance to try to extract funding for the wall, while Democrats, united against the wall and buttressed by big wins in the midterm elections, showed no signs of buckling to his demands amid a flurry of attacks this week.

The White House and congressional leaders continued negotiations late Friday, but by 8:30 p.m., the House and the Senate had adjourned for the night. That made it impossible to vote on any spending agreement until Saturday, and it remained unclear whether any deal would materialize by then.

It is unclear how long a shutdown might last. Trump predicted earlier Friday that it could drag on for a ""very long time.""

The Senate on Friday considered legislation that would fund the government agencies through Feb. 8 and appropriate $5.7 billion for the erection of 215 miles of wall structures along the Mexico border.

The House passed that legislation Thursday evening, but Senate Democrats successfully unified on Friday and refused to back that measure.

Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said Friday that Democrats were open to discussions with the White House and Republicans but would not agree to any measure that funded the construction of a new border wall.

Schumer said Friday that the Senate had unanimously agreed to a spending bill earlier in the week and accused Trump of having a ""temper tantrum"" because he wasn't getting money for the wall.

""President Trump, you will not get your wall,"" Schumer said. ""You're not getting your wall today, next week or on Jan. 3 when Democrats take control of the House.""

Democrats tried to make clear to the White House for weeks that they had the votes to block any measure that contained money for the wall.

As their power became clear to White House officials, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders signaled Tuesday that Trump was planning to withdraw his request for the funds in an effort to keep the government open.

But he received a torrent of criticism from conservative lawmakers and commentators following this decision, and he reversed course on Thursday, scuttling a temporary, bipartisan spending bill that would have extended funding through Feb. 8 but did not contain wall money.

Trump on Friday urged Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., to change long-standing Senate rules to pass the House's measure providing $5.7 billion for the wall.

McConnell refused, making it impossible for Senate Republicans to marshal the measure through because Democrats control 49 seats in the 100-member chamber.

""We're going to be working very hard to get something passed in the Senate,"" Trump said earlier Friday in the Oval Office. ""Now it's up to the Democrats as to whether or not we have a shutdown tonight. I hope we don't, but we've very much prepared for a long shutdown.""

Republicans were frustrated by the reversal, and Democrats warned Friday that the president's erratic and unvetted decisions in recent days were unsettling financial markets, foreign allies and even members of his Cabinet.

""This is tyranny of talk radio hosts, right? And so, how do you deal with that?"" said Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn. ""You have two talk radio hosts who completely flipped the president. And so, do we succumb to tyranny of talk radio hosts?""

Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis announced his resignation Thursday. The Dow Jones industrial average had one of its worst weeks in recent decades and has fallen almost 4,400 points, or 16 percent, since October.

Multiple federal parks and monuments are slated to close, some as soon as Saturday morning. The Securities and Exchange Commission posted a list of the services it will soon suspend, including the processing of certain business records. The Justice Department, Commerce Department and Internal Revenue Service are preparing to send thousands of workers home without pay.

And Trump's prediction that a shutdown would last ""for a very long time"" meant that hundreds of thousands of federal employees risk missing at least one paycheck. Even the Border Patrol agents and Transportation Security Administration officials who are directed to continue working during the shutdown will not be paid until Congress funds their agencies.

About 400,000 federal workers would be furloughed, according to a Washington Post projection. But a number of federal agencies, including the Pentagon, will not be directly affected, because Congress already passed multiple other spending bills this year that secured funding through September.

As the funding lapse lengthens, the negotiations will prove to be a major test for Trump, Schumer, McConnell and House conservatives as they jostle for footing in Washington's new power structure.

Friday afternoon saw a flurry of discussions begin in the afternoon when McConnell, Democrats and Vice President Mike Pence began huddling separately in the Capitol.

Pence separately joined Trump adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner and White House budget director Mick Mulvaney for a meeting with House conservatives. But the talks yielded no clear evidence of progress, and eventually Pence and his entourage left the Capitol.

""We don't have a deal,"" Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Richard Shelby, R-Ala., told reporters after emerging from a late meeting with the vice president. ""There are a lot of moving parts, and we're trying to get them moving together.""

The construction of a wall along the border with Mexico was one of Trump's top campaign promises in 2016, and he had promised that Mexico would finance the entire project. But since taking office, he has demanded the money from Congress.

Senate Democrats have blocked every attempt so far. Trump has also threatened to shut the government down numerous times if he doesn't receive money for the border wall, but before Friday night, he had backed down every time.

In recent days, Trump has tried a number of different tactics to try to secure the money. He called on Cabinet secretaries to search their budgets for extra funds, and on Wednesday, he said the entire project would be built by the military. But by Thursday he was back to demanding that Congress provide the funding, leaving many GOP lawmakers scrambling to accede to his demands.

The shutdown followed a day of posturing and unsuccessful negotiations in the Senate on Friday.

After meeting with Trump at the White House, McConnell called a vote aimed at advancing the bill with $5.7 billion for the border wall, saying the legislation would not be considered controversial in more normal times.

""I'm proud to vote for it,"" McConnell said.

But after hours of maneuvering, it became clear that the legislation would not command the support needed to pass, although the Senate advanced it on a procedural vote - with Pence breaking a tie - to keep a legislative vehicle alive in case a deal does emerge.

Trump, meanwhile, ratcheted up public pressure on Democrats to cave on the wall.

In a spate of morning Twitter posts, Trump sought to pin blame on Democrats for a potential shutdown, even though he said last week that he would accept responsibility for a shutdown.

But Democrats showed no signs of relenting, and on Friday night, they continued to blame Trump and the Republicans for the partial shutdown.

""I think we ought to make it clear that it's the president's abrupt change in position and refusal to accept the deal he's already told his leadership he'd accept,"" said Sen. Christopher Coons, D-Del.

""Look, this is the last week we have a Republican-controlled Senate and House and White House - they've got to work this out."""
397,lethbridgeherald.com,https://lethbridgeherald.com/business/2019/01/11/federal-work-at-superfund-sites-suspended-during-shutdown/,"BIRMINGHAM, Ala. - The government shutdown has suspended federal cleanups at Superfund sites around the nation and forced the cancellation of public hearings, deepening the mistrust and resentment of surrounding residents who feel people in power long ago abandoned them to live among the toxic residue of the country's factories and mines.

""We are already hurting, and it's just adding more fuel to the fire,"" says 40-year-old Keisha Brown. Her home is in a community nestled among plants that turn coal into carbon-rich fuel and other factories on Birmingham's north side.

The mostly African-American community has been forced to cope with high levels of arsenic, lead and other contaminants in the soil that the Environmental Protection Agency has been scraping up and carting away, house by house.

As President Donald Trump and Congress battle over Trump's demand for a wall on the southern U.S. border, the 3-week-old partial government shutdown has stopped federal work on Superfund sites except for cases where the administration deems ""there is an imminent threat to the safety of human life or to the protection of property.""

EPA's shutdown plans said the agency would evaluate about 800 Superfund sites to see how many could pose an immediate threat. As an example of that kind of threat, it cited an acid leak from a mine that could threaten the public water supply. That's the hazard at Northern California's Iron Mountain mine, where EPA workers help prevent an unending flow of lethally acidic runoff off the Superfund site from spilling into rivers downstream.

Practically speaking, said Bonnie Bellow, a former EPA official who worked on Superfund public outreach at the agency, the impact of the stoppage of work at sites across the nation ""wholly depends"" on the length of the shutdown.

""Unless there is immediate risk like a storm, a flood, a week or two of slowdowns is not going to very likely affect the cleanup at the site,"" Bellow said.

In north Birmingham, Brown said it's been a couple of weeks since she's spotted any EPA crews at people's houses. It was unclear if state workers or contractors were continuing work.

But long before the shutdown began, Brown harboured doubts the cleanup was working anyway.

""My main concern is the health of the people out here,"" said Brown, who has asthma. ""All of us are sick, and we've got to function on medicine every day.""

In terms of time, the federal government shutdown is a chronological blip in the long history of the site - which includes ethics charges in a local bribery scandal to block federal cleanup efforts - but adds to the uncertainty in an area where residents feel forgotten and betrayed.

At the EPA, the shutdown has furloughed the bulk of the agency's roughly 14,000 employees. It also means the EPA isn't getting most of the daily stream of environmental questions and tips from the public. Routine inspections aren't happening. State, local and private emails to EPA officials often get automated messages back promising a response when the shutdown ends.

In Montana, for instance, state officials this month found themselves fielding calls from a tribal member worried about drinking water with a funny look to it, said Kristi Ponozzo, public-policy director at that state's Department of Environmental Quality. The EPA normally provides tribes with technical assistance on water supplies.

With most EPA colleagues idled, Ponozzo said, her agency also had to call off an environmental review meeting for a mining project, potentially delaying the project.

But it's the agency's work at Superfund sites - lessening the threat from old nuclear-weapons plants, chemical factories, mines and other entities - that gets much of the attention.

Absent imminent peril, it would be up to state governments or contractors to continue any cleanup during the shutdown ""up to the point that additional EPA direction or funding is needed,"" the EPA said in a statement.

""Sites where cleanup activities have been stopped or shut down will be secured until cleanup activities are able to commence when the federal government reopens,"" the agency said.

For federal Superfund sites in Michigan, the shutdown means there are no EPA colleagues to consult, said Scott Dean, a spokesman for that state's Department of Environmental Quality.

At Michigan Superfund sites, day-to-day field operations were continuing since private contractors do most of the on-the-ground work, Dean said.

Bellow, the former EPA official, said the cancellation of hearings about Superfund sites posed immediate concerns.

In East Chicago, Indiana, for example, the EPA called off a planned public hearing set for last Wednesday to outline how the agency planned to clean up high levels of lead and arsenic in the soil.

The EPA has proposed a seven-month, $26.5 million cleanup that includes treating and removing tainted soil from the area, where a lead smelter was located.

During a public meeting Nov. 29, some residents complained that the EPA's approach would leave too much pollution in place. Others didn't get a chance to speak and were hoping to do so at the meeting this week, said Debbie Chizewer, a Northwestern University environmental attorney who represents community groups in the low-income area.

The EPA announced the cancellation in an online notice and gave no indication that it would be rescheduled.

Leaders of the East Chicago Calumet Community Advisory Group asked for a new hearing date and an extension of a Jan. 14 public comment deadline in a letter to the EPA's regional Superfund division.

Calls by The Associated Press to the agency's regional office in Chicago this week were not answered.

Local critics fear the EPA will use the delay caused by the shutdown as justification for pushing ahead with a cleanup strategy they consider flawed, Chizewer said, even though the agency has designated the affected area as an ""environmental justice community,"" a low-income community of colour that has been disproportionately harmed by pollution.

The EPA has a ""special obligation"" when dealing with such communities, Chizewer said. ""This would be an example of shutting them out for no good reason.""

In North Birmingham, former longtime neighbourhood resident Charlie Powell said most of the people living in and around the Superfund site had already ""just got tired and fed up.""

Powell left the area but started a group called PANIC, People Against Neighborhood Industrial Contamination. He said he believes money would be better spent helping residents move away from the pollution.

""Can I say hell?"" Powell said when asked what residents have been through.

For AP's complete coverage of the U.S. government shutdown: https://apnews.com/GovernmentShutdown"
398,asia times,http://www.atimes.com/recent-us-moves-reflect-its-shifting-focus-to-indo-pacific/,"The administration of US President Donald Trump sent out confusing signals soon after coming to office by threatening to withdraw the US from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization, the World Trade Organization, and the United Nations Human Rights Council. The administration also slapped sanctions against Iran and Russia in a bid to coerce and prevent them from adopting strategies contrary to Washington's interests.

Of late, Washington seems poised to disengage militarily from Yemen, Syria and Afghanistan. This apart, President Trump's decision to erect a wall against neighbor Mexico to prevent migration has precipitated the country into a temporary domestic political chaos.

However, there are clear indications that the administration will maintain its influence in the Middle East through its Arab Gulf allies. For instance, the administration has not only been lobbying for maintaining arms supplies to Saudi Arabia, President Trump has admired Riyadh's willingness to contribute to reconstruction efforts in Syria. He said: ""Saudi Arabia has now agreed to spend the necessary money needed to help rebuild Syria, instead of the United States. Isn't it nice when immensely wealthy countries help rebuild their neighbors.""

Amid perceptible disagreements within the administration, the decision seems to be based on the realization of America's long military entanglements claiming substantial amount of economic resources with mounting troop casualties in the region without palpable benefits and solutions at sight. It is in this light that the administration's decision to draw up plans to remove approximately 7,000 US troops from Afghanistan as well as all 2,000 from Syria must be understood.

On the other side, the administration has clearly adopted measures to enhance its role and contain Chinese influence in the Indo-Pacific region. The administration not only articulated an innovative geographical expression for the ""Asia-Pacific"" by renaming it ""Indo-Pacific'' and underlined the centrality of India to the region but containment of China and formation of a group of allies became central to its Indo-Pacific strategy.

Indicating positive engagement in the Indo-Pacific region, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced $113 million in new technology, energy and infrastructure initiatives with the objective of casting the US as a trustworthy partner in the Indo-Pacific region in July and some days later he pledged to provide $300 million in new security funding for the region.

Meanwhile, Australian Foreign Minister Julie Bishop said in July, ""Australia, the United States and Japan have announced a trilateral partnership to invest in projects ... that would build infrastructure, address development challenges, increase connectivity, and promote economic growth.""

The belief that the Trump administration on the lines of ""America first"" thinking would hamper the alliance system is refuted by its stress on the formation of a formidable alliance system in the Indo-Pacific. The administration concluded a so-called 2+2 meeting with India on September 6 that devoted more time to discussions on the American imperative of shaping the contours of Indo-Pacific policy and intended to bring India closer to the US in sharing similar viewpoints as regards their role and aspirations in the Indo-Pacific region.

In Washington's perception, New Delhi was a reluctant partner in the overall American strategy to strengthen the US-Japan-India-Australia quadrilateral format primarily aimed at containing Chinese influence. The Trump administration seemed poised to inspire and recruit stable partners in the Indo-Pacific region in the face of rising prominence of the Chinese role under the rubric of the Belt and Road Initiative (BRI).

Signing of the defense pact known as the Communications Compatibility and Security Agreement (COMCASA) on the eve of the 2+2 dialogue, while facilitating Indian military platforms' access to encrypted, cutting-edge and high-end secured communication equipment from the US, was primarily aimed at allowing interoperability between the US and Indian armed and naval forces and enabling India to put Chinese moves in the Indian Ocean and Himalayas under close surveillance.

The two countries also agreed to conduct tri-service military exercise during the dialogue. Forging ahead with Indo-US strategic relations, the American leadership granted India Strategic Trade Authorization-1 (STA-1) status with an objective to ease export controls over sales of high-technology product, which has so far been applicable only to its NATO allies.

On the other side, the Trump administration indicating a low priority for the Afghan engagement (Islamabad was previously considered central to Washington's Afghan war and peace strategy) extended its suspension of security assistance to Pakistan as Islamabad failed to act against terrorism as per the American convictions.

While the leadership in Pakistan was reeling under economic crisis and poised to seek loans from the International Monetary Fund, the Trump administration expressed its unwillingness to assist Islamabad in securing any loans from the IMF to repay Chinese loans. The administration remained cautious as to Beijing's rising geopolitical influence under its BRI, which it believed could rise to global prominence if unchecked.

The administration continued to show its disapproval of the Chinese BRI over issues from rising indebtedness among participating countries to lack of transparency and disregard for an open and inclusive approach on sustainable financing. Further, it took to stiff trade restrictions to check Beijing's growing economic clout allegedly by illegitimate means, which took the form of a trade war between the two great powers.

The Trump administration made efforts at attaining breakthroughs in the process of denuclearization of North Korea and ushering in peace on the Korean Peninsula arguably to concentrate more on containing Chinese influence. The administration meanwhile announced its decision to withdraw from the landmark Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty with Russia, indicating its preference for a comprehensive pact that included Russia, the United States and China, and US national security adviser John Bolton was noticed saying in Moscow that Russia had been violating the INF Treaty for years and rising powers such as China meant that it was a ""new strategic reality out there.""

It is worthwhile mentioning that the Indo-Pacific region is not only rich in natural resources, especially hydrocarbons that fuel the industrial engines of the world's economies, it is also emerging as a center of international trade and investment by throwing up a large market of nearly half of the world's population. There are in fact many reports that predict that by 2050, half of the world's top 20 economies will be in the Indo-Pacific and countries like India, China, Indonesia and Japan will be among the top five economies in the world."
399,forum of fargo-moorhead,https://www.inforum.com/news/government-and-politics/941665-Trump-threatens-to-shut-down-border-as-government-funding-stalemate-drags-on,"WASHINGTON - With the partial government shutdown headed toward its second week and no resolution in sight, President Donald Trump on Friday issued a string of tweets in which he once again vowed to close the entire U.S. border with Mexico and halt aid to several Latin American countries unless Democrats agree to his demand for billions of dollars in wall funding.

Trump is also canceling plans to visit his Florida resort, Mar-a-Lago, and will remain in Washington over the New Year holiday, Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney said.

About 25 percent of the federal government has been shut down since Saturday, with roughly 800,000 workers affected, including an estimated 350,000 who are on furlough at home.

""We will be forced to close the Southern Border entirely if the Obstructionist Democrats do not give us the money to finish the Wall & also change the ridiculous immigration laws that our Country is saddled with,"" Trump said in a morning tweet.

In a reprise of his threat before the midterm elections to cut off aid to Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador as a caravan of migrants was making its way toward the United States, Trump said that those three countries ""are doing nothing for the United States but taking our money.""

""Word is that a new Caravan is forming in Honduras and they are doing nothing about it,"" he said, without providing further details. ""We will be cutting off all aid to these 3 countries - taking advantage of U.S. for years!""

Despite Trump's threat, the United States this month announced a new collaboration with Mexico on a program to curb migration from Central American countries, with much of the $10.6 billion U.S. contribution to be drawn from existing aid programs.

Trump's tweets come as Congress has effectively given up on breaking the impasse over the president's demands for border-wall funding, all but ensuring that the partial government shutdown will stretch into at least the start of the new year.

The House and the Senate convened for just minutes on Thursday before gaveling closed until next week. During the brief session in the House, Republicans shot down a Democratic attempt to vote on legislation to reopen the government.

As he did Thursday, Trump remained out of public view on Friday. In an appearance on Fox News, Mulvaney said that the president had ""canceled his plans for Christmas, and now he's canceled his plan for New Year's.""

""He's staying in Washington, D.C., over New Year's,"" said Mulvaney, who is set to become Trump's acting chief of staff next month.

Even though Trump will be in town and Republicans control both chambers of Congress, Mulvaney acknowledged that little progress on a deal is expected until the start of the new Congress on Jan. 3, when Democrats will retake the House. Contending that Democrats ""have simply shut down the discussions,"" he sought to place the blame on House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., who is expected to be elected speaker in the new Congress.

""Nancy Pelosi, in fairness, does not have the votes for the speakership yet,"" Mulvaney said. ""She cannot be seen by her party as being weak on negotiating with Donald Trump. So we fully expect that until she is elected speaker and has locked that vote up, we don't expect to hear from the Democrats again.""

According to a Washington Post tally, Pelosi, who won the Democratic caucus's nomination for the speakership in late November, appears to have secured enough support to be elected speaker in January.

Pelosi's spokesman, Drew Hammill, said in a statement Friday that Democrats ""are united against the President's immoral, ineffective and expensive wall - the wall that he specifically promised that Mexico would pay for.""

Democrats will not consider any offers that have not been publicly endorsed by Trump himself, he said.

""While we await the president's public proposal, Democrats have made it clear that, under a House Democratic majority, we will vote swiftly to reopen government on Day One,"" Hammill said.

At the heart of the stalemate is Trump's demand for $5 billion in funding for his proposed wall at the U.S.-Mexico border. Congressional Democrats have rejected that figure and in recent weeks have refused to publicly endorse a figure above $1.3 billion, which continues existing funding levels and includes money for new border fencing and levee walls, but not the concrete wall Trump once demanded before he started more recently talking about ""steel slats.""

Mulvaney said Friday that ""some folks use the term 'wall' and they mean different things.""

""Everyone agrees that what we can and should be building on that southern border is that steel barrier that the president tweeted out. That's what he wants to build. The Democrats, believe it or not, don't call that a wall,"" he said.

400,lethbridgeherald.com,https://lethbridgeherald.com/news/world-news/2019/01/14/congress-to-face-same-question-when-will-shutdown-end/,"WASHINGTON - Congress returns to Washington for its first full week of legislative business since control of the House reverted to Democrats, but lawmakers will be confronted with the same lingering question: When will the partial government shutdown end?

One Republican senator says he's offered President Donald Trump a possible solution, though it may just be wishful thinking.

Sen. Lindsey Graham is encouraging Trump to reopen government for several weeks to continue negotiating with Democrats over the border wall Trump wants to build on the U.S.-Mexico border. If there's no deal at the end of that time, Graham says Trump would be free to take the more dramatic step of declaring a national emergency to build it.

But the South Carolina Republican says Trump still wants a deal on funding for the wall before agreeing to reopen shuttered government departments. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat, insists Trump reopen the government first.

Their weeks-old standoff led to the partial government shutdown, now on day 24 without a clear end in sight.

Trump insisted on Twitter Monday that he wanted to deal, declaring: ""I've been waiting all weekend. Democrats must get to work now. Border must be secured!""

Targeting Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, Trump also argued that the shutdown ""has become their, and the Democrats, fault!"" Trump weeks ago asserted that he would ""own"" the shutdown and polls show that he is taking most of the blame.

Graham, who has publicly pushed Trump to use his authority to declare a national emergency to build the wall, is suggesting a short-term fix.

""Before he pulls the plug on the legislative option, and I think we're almost there, I would urge him to open up the government for a short period of time, like three weeks, before he pulls the plug, see if we can get a deal,"" Graham said. ""If we can't at the end of three weeks, all bets are off.

""See if he can do it by himself through the emergency powers. That's my recommendation,"" added Graham, who has publicly pushed Trump to use his authority to declare a national emergency to build the wall. Such a step would allow Trump to bypass Congress and tap various pots of unspent federal money, including for military construction and disaster relief as well as from assets seized by law enforcement, to pay for the wall.

Trump has kept Washington on edge over whether he would resort to such a declaration, citing what he says is a ""crisis"" of drug smuggling and the trafficking of women and children at the border. The president initially sounded as though such a move was imminent, but then pulled back. He has said several times since he first mentioned the idea in public this month that he prefers a legislative solution.

A key question is how much more time is Trump willing to give lawmakers. Graham, who spoke with Trump by telephone on Sunday morning, said the legislative path ""is just about shut off"" and blamed intransigence by Pelosi.

The speaker's office had no immediate comment.

Democrats oppose an emergency declaration but may be powerless to block it. Some Republicans are wary, too, fearing how a future Democratic president might use that authority. Such a move, should Trump ultimately go that route, would almost certainly be challenged in the courts.

Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., called Graham's idea to reopen the government a ""great place to start.""

""I do think if we reopen the government, if the president ends this shutdown crisis, we have folks who can negotiate a responsible, modern investment in technology that will actually make us safer,"" Coons said.

Trump says technology is nice, but that the border can't be secured without a wall.

The White House has been laying the groundwork for an emergency declaration, which is feared by lawmakers in both parties.

Senate Homeland Security Committee Chairman Ron Johnson, R-Wis., said he'd ""hate to see"" a declaration issued because the wall wouldn't get built, presumably because of legal challenges. Democrats voted in the past for border security and should again, he said.

""I actually want to see this wall get built,"" Johnson said. ""I want to keep pressure on Democrats to actually come to the negotiating table in good faith and fund what they have supported in the past.""

Graham favours a declaration and said the time for talk is running out.

""It's the last option, not the first option, but we're pretty close to that being the only option,"" he said.

Graham and Coons spoke on ""Fox News Sunday"" and Johnson appeared on CNN's ""State of the Union.""

402,belleville news-democrat,https://www.bnd.com/news/business/article224277975.html,"The government shutdown has suspended federal cleanups at Superfund sites around the nation and forced the cancellation of public hearings, deepening the mistrust and resentment of surrounding residents who feel people in power long ago abandoned them to live among the toxic residue of the country's factories and mines.

""We are already hurting, and it's just adding more fuel to the fire,"" says 40-year-old Keisha Brown, whose wood-frame home is in a community nestled among coking plants and other factories on Birmingham's north side.

The mostly African-American community has been forced to cope with high levels of arsenic, lead and other contaminants in the soil that the Environmental Protection Agency has been scraping up and carting away, house by house.

As President Donald Trump and Congress battle over Trump's demand for a wall on the southern U.S. border, the nearly 3-week-old partial government shutdown has stopped federal work on Superfund sites except for cases where the administration deems ""there is an imminent threat to the safety of human life or to the protection of property.""

EPA's shutdown plans said the agency would evaluate about 800 Superfund sites to see how many could pose an immediate threat. As an example of that kind of threat, it cited an acid leak from a mine that could threaten the public water supply. That's the hazard at Northern California's Iron Mountain mine, where EPA workers help prevent an unending flow of lethally acidic runoff off the Superfund site from spilling into rivers downstream.

Practically speaking, said Bonnie Bellow, a former EPA official who worked on Superfund public outreach at the agency, the impact of the stoppage of work at sites across the nation ""wholly depends"" on the length of the shutdown.

""Unless there is immediate risk like a storm, a flood, a week or two of slowdowns is not going to very likely affect the cleanup at the site,"" Bellow said.

In north Birmingham, Brown said it's been a couple of weeks since she's spotted any EPA crews at people's houses. It wasn't clear if state workers or contractors were continuing work.

But long before the shutdown began, Brown harbored doubts the cleanup was working anyway. ""My main concern is the health of the people out here,"" said Brown, who has asthma. ""All of us are sick, and we've got to function on medicine every day.""

In terms of time, the federal government shutdown is a chronological blip in the long history of the site -- which includes ethics charges in a local bribery scandal to block federal cleanup efforts -- but adds to the uncertainty in an area where residents feel forgotten and betrayed.

At the EPA, the shutdown has furloughed the bulk of the agency's roughly 14,000 employees. It also means the EPA isn't getting most of the daily stream of environmental questions and tips from the public. Routine inspections aren't happening. State, local and private emails to EPA officials often get automated messages back promising a response when the shutdown ends.

In Montana, for instance, state officials this month found themselves fielding calls from a tribal member worried about drinking water with a funny look to it, said Kristi Ponozzo, public-policy director at that state's Department of Environmental Quality. The EPA normally provides tribes with technical assistance on water supplies.

With most EPA colleagues idled, Ponozzo said, her agency also had to call off an environmental review meeting for a mining project, potentially delaying the project.

But it's the agency's work at Superfund sites -- lessening the threat from old nuclear-weapons plants, chemical factories, mines and other entities -- that gets much of the attention.

Absent imminent peril, it would be up to state governments or contractors to continue any cleanup during the shutdown ""up to the point that additional EPA direction or funding is needed,"" the EPA said in a statement.

""Sites where cleanup activities have been stopped or shut down will be secured until cleanup activities are able to commence when the federal government reopens,"" the agency said.

For federal Superfund sites in Michigan, the shutdown means there are no EPA colleagues to consult, said Scott Dean, a spokesman for that state's Department of Environmental Quality.

At Michigan Superfund sites, day-to-day field operations were continuing since private contractors do most of the on-the-ground work, Dean said.

Bellow, the former EPA official, said the cancellation of hearings about Superfund sites posed immediate concerns.

In East Chicago, Indiana, for example, the EPA called off a planned public hearing set for last Wednesday to outline how the agency planned to clean up high levels of lead and arsenic in the soil.

The EPA has proposed a seven-month, $26.5 million cleanup that includes treating and removing tainted soil from the area, where a lead smelter previously was located.

During a public meeting Nov. 29, some residents complained that the EPA's approach would leave too much pollution in place. But others didn't get a chance to speak and were hoping to do so at the meeting this week, said Debbie Chizewer, a Northwestern University environmental attorney who represents community groups in the low-income area.

The EPA announced the cancellation in an online notice and gave no indication that it would be rescheduled.

403,the news tribune,https://www.thenewstribune.com/news/nation-world/article223193915.html,"White House digs in on border wall demand, risking shutdown

WASHINGTON (AP) -- The White House on Sunday pushed the federal government closer to the brink of a partial shutdown later this week, digging in on its demand for $5 billion to build a border wall as congressional Democrats stood firm against it.

""We're going to do whatever is necessary to build the border wall to stop this ongoing crisis of illegal immigration,"" said White House senior adviser Stephen Miller.

Asked if that meant having a government shutdown, he said: ""If it comes to it, absolutely.""

Trump said last week he would be ""proud"" to have a shutdown to get Congress to approve a $5 billion down payment to fulfill his campaign promise to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. But the president doesn't have the votes from the Republican-controlled Congress to support funding for the wall at that level.

Democratic congressional leaders, Sen. Chuck Schumer and Rep. Nancy Pelosi, have proposed no more than $1.6 billion, as outlined in a bipartisan Senate bill. The money would not go for the wall but for fencing upgrades and other border security. Democrats also offered to simply keep funding at its current level, $1.3 billion.

Trump lawyer Giuliani rules out Mueller interview with Trump

WASHINGTON (AP) -- With a number of probes moving closer to the Oval Office, President Donald Trump and his attorney unleashed a fresh series of attacks on the investigators, questioning their integrity while categorically ruling out the possibility of a presidential interview with the special counsel.

Trump and Rudy Giuliani used Twitter and television interviews Sunday to deliver a series of broadsides against special counsel Robert Mueller and federal prosecutors in New York. Giuliani said he was ""disgusted"" by the tactics used by Mueller in his probe into Russian election interference, including in securing guilty pleas from the president's former national security adviser Michael Flynn on a charge of lying to federal investigators.

Trump, Giuliani said, would not submit to an interview by Mueller's team.

""They're a joke,"" Giuliani told ""Fox News Sunday."" ''Over my dead body, but, you know, I could be dead.""

The special counsel, who is investigating possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russia, has continued to request an interview with the president. Last month, the White House sent written answers in response to the special counsel's questions about possible collusion. The White House has resisted answering questions on possible obstruction of justice.

Child's death highlights communication barriers on border

Shortly before a 7-year-old Guatemalan girl died in U.S. custody, her father signed a form stating that his daughter was in good health. But it's unclear how much the man understood on the form, which was written in English and read to him in Spanish by Border Patrol agents.

The death of Jakelin Caal highlights the communication challenges along the U.S.-Mexico border as agents come in contact with an increasing number of migrants who speak neither English nor Spanish.

Her father's native language is the Mayan tongue known as Q'eqchi'. His second language is Spanish. It's unclear whether something was lost in translation or whether it would have made a difference in saving Jakelin after the two were detained and underwent a health screening along a remote stretch of U.S.-Mexico border. But the case raises questions about the Border Patrol's use of English-only forms.

All agents are required to speak Spanish, and they receive formal Spanish training. Reading forms in Spanish is often enough to pose basic questions. But some other Spanish-speaking migrants reported signing paperwork that they later said they did not understand.

Scores of immigrant parents who were separated from their children after crossing the border in the spring said they signed forms agreeing to be deported with the understanding that their kids would be returning with them, only to find themselves deported without them. Many had to wait months before being reunited with them in their homelands.

Talks adopt 'rulebook' to put Paris climate deal into action

KATOWICE, Poland (AP) -- Almost 200 nations, including the world's top greenhouse gas producers, China and the United States, have adopted a set of rules meant to breathe life into the 2015 Paris climate accord by setting out how countries should report their emissions and efforts to reduce them.

But negotiators delayed other key decisions until next year -- a move that frustrated environmentalists and countries that wanted more ambitious goals in light of scientists' warnings that the world must shift sharply away from fossil fuels in the coming decade.

""The majority of the rulebook for the Paris agreement has been created, which is something to be thankful for,"" said Mohamed Adow, a climate policy expert at Christian Aid. ""But the fact countries had to be dragged kicking and screaming to the finish line shows that some nations have not woken up"" to the dire consequences of global warming as outlined in a report by the U.N Panel on Climate Change, or IPCC.

Officials at the talks, which ended late Saturday in the Polish city of Katowice, agreed upon universal rules on how nations can cut emissions. Poor countries secured assurances on financial support to help them reduce emissions, adapt to changes such as rising sea levels and pay for damage that has already happened.

""Through this package, you have made a thousand little steps forward together,"" said Michal Kurtyka, a senior Polish official who led the talks.

French city honors victims of Christmas market attack

PARIS (AP) -- People filled a square in the French city of Strasbourg on Sunday to show respect and sympathy for the victims of last week's shooting attack near a famous Christmas market as the death toll rose to five.

French authorities said a Polish man died in a Strasbourg hospital Sunday, one of a dozen people wounded in last Tuesday's attack. Poland's Foreign Ministry extended condolences Sunday on Twitter to his family.

According to the newspaper DNA, more than 1,000 people attended the memorial, which ended with a minute of applause and a rendition of France's national anthem, ""La Marseillaise.""

The hour-long ceremony took place in Kleber Square, not far from where a gunman opened fire on Tuesday evening. Strasbourg Mayor Roland Ries praised the city's resilience in the face of hardship.

The ""extremely large crowd in the Christmas market"" on Saturday ""was an illustration of our commitment to these values ??on which our living together is based, which we will continue to defend against all those who want to attack it,"" Ries said.

Not into bingo, 84-year-old Texas woman gets college degree

RICHARDSON, Texas (AP) -- After raising five kids and retiring at age 77 from her secretarial job, Janet Fein couldn't be blamed for finally relaxing, but that's not her.

Fein, now 84, went to back to school and will accomplish a long-held goal this week when she graduates from the University of Texas at Dallas with a bachelor's degree.

""I didn't have anything to do in retirement and I didn't think that playing bingo was up to my speed,"" said Fein, who majored in sociology because she felt it was ""substantial.""

She said she enjoyed all the reading and writing papers. ""With each class I already knew a lot, but then I also learned a lot. And that made me happy,"" she said.

People 65 and older make up less than one percent of U.S. college students. In 2015, they accounted for about 67,000 of about 20 million college students, according to the National Center for Education Statistics.

Next-generation of GPS satellites are headed to space

DENVER (AP) -- After months of delays, the U.S. Air Force is about to launch the first of a new generation of GPS satellites, designed to be more accurate, secure and versatile.

But some of their most highly touted features will not be fully available until 2022 or later because of problems in a companion program to develop a new ground control system for the satellites, government auditors said.

The satellite is scheduled to lift off Tuesday from Cape Canaveral, Florida, aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. It's the first of 32 planned GPS III satellites that will replace older ones now in orbit. Lockheed Martin is building the new satellites outside Denver.

GPS is best-known for its widespread civilian applications, from navigation to time-stamping bank transactions. The Air Force estimates that 4 billion people worldwide use the system.

But it was developed by the U.S. military, which still designs, launches and operates the system. The Air Force controls a constellation of 31 GPS satellites from a high-security complex at Schriever Air Force Base outside Colorado Springs.

After fraud probe, new primary may replace GOP candidate

RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- Legislation quickly passed by North Carolina's lawmakers this week would prepare a path for Republicans to dump their nominee in a still-undecided U.S. House race marred with ballot fraud allegations.

""I think (legislators are) worried that Mark Harris might be damaged goods and they want to have the opportunity to have a different Republican nominee,"" said Carter Wrenn, a Republican operative and consultant to former U.S. Sen. Jesse Helms and others for more than 40 years. ""That's how I read those tea leaves.""

If the state elections board decides ballot irregularities or other problems cast the true outcome into doubt and force a redo, the legislation -- if allowed to go into law by Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper -- would require new primary elections in the 9th Congressional District race, in addition to a new general election.

That would allow Republicans another look at Mark Harris, the Republican who led Democrat Dan McCready by 905 votes in unofficial results. Harris hasn't been certified the winner, and an investigation is looking into missing absentee ballots in rural Bladen County and whether unsealed ballots illegally handled by collection teams there could have been altered.

Bladen was the only county among the eight within the 9th District where Harris won a majority of mail-in absentee ballots over McCready.

Top of mind: 'Justice' is Merriam-Webster's word of the year

NEW YORK (AP) -- Racial justice. Obstruction of justice. Social justice. The Justice Department. Merriam-Webster has chosen ""justice"" as its 2018 word of the year, driven by the churning news cycle over months and months.

The word follows ""toxic,"" picked by Oxford Dictionaries, and ""misinformation,"" plucked by Dictonary.com.

Peter Sokolowski, Merriam-Webster's editor at large, told The Associated Press ahead of Monday's announcement that ""justice"" consistently bubbled into the top 20 or 30 lookups on the company's website, spiking at times due to specific events but also skating close to the surface for much of the year.

While it's one of those common words people likely know how to spell and use correctly in a sentence, Sokolowski pointed to other reasons that drive search traffic. Among them is an attempt to focus a train of thought around a philosophical problem, or to seek aspirational motivation. Such well-known words are often among the most looked up every year, including those that are slightly abstract, including ""love,"" he said.

The designation for ""justice"" came soon after President Trump's one-time fixer, Michael Cohen, was sentenced to three years in prison for crimes that included arranging the payment of hush money to conceal his boss' alleged sexual affairs. He told a judge he agreed time and again to cover up Trump's ""dirty deeds"" out of ""blind loyalty.""

'Spider-Verse' swings to the top; 'Mortal Engines' tanks

LOS ANGELES (AP) -- ""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse"" swung to the top of the domestic box office in its first weekend in theaters, proving that there is widespread audience interest in big screen animated versions of Marvel's marquee superheroes.

The film led a host of newcomers that debuted to varying success on this pre-Christmas holiday weekend, including Clint Eastwood's drug smuggling drama ""The Mule"" and the Peter Jackson-produced epic ""Mortal Engines"" which bombed in North American theaters.

""Into the Spider-Verse"" earned an estimated $35.4 million from 3,813 theaters against a $90 million production budget according to Sony Pictures on Sunday, which is a record for animated movies in December (although the hybrid ""Alvin and the Chipmunks"" movies were higher). The film features an innovative animation style -- both CGI and hand-drawn -- and focuses on the Miles Morales character as he learns to become the famed web-slinger. It's another financial win for the studio's latest ""expanded Spider-Man universe"" strategy following ""Venom"" and ""Spider-Man: Homecoming.""

And ""Spider-Verse"" has been very well-received among critics, and audiences in exit surveys gave it a rare A+ CinemaScore -- a first for a Spider-Man film. It's also been nominated for a Golden Globe award for best animated feature and picked up a few honors from critics' groups as well, including the New York Film Critics Circle.

""We are playing to both families and fanboys. We're an all-audience film,"" said Adrian Smith, Sony's president of domestic distribution."
404,the news tribune,https://www.thenewstribune.com/news/nation-world/article224499960.html,"Congress returns to Washington for its first full week of legislative business since control of the House reverted to Democrats, but lawmakers will be confronted with the same lingering question: When will the partial government shutdown end?

One Republican senator says he's offered President Donald Trump a possible solution, though it may just be wishful thinking.

Sen. Lindsey Graham is encouraging Trump to reopen government for several weeks to continue negotiating with Democrats over the border wall Trump wants to build on the U.S.-Mexico border. If there's no deal at the end of that time, Graham says Trump would be free to take the more dramatic step of declaring a national emergency to build it.

But the South Carolina Republican says Trump still wants a deal on funding for the wall before agreeing to reopen shuttered government departments. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat, insists Trump reopen the government first.

Their weeks-old standoff led to the partial government shutdown, now on day 24 without a clear end in sight.

""Before he pulls the plug on the legislative option, and I think we're almost there, I would urge him to open up the government for a short period of time, like three weeks, before he pulls the plug, see if we can get a deal,"" Graham said. ""If we can't at the end of three weeks, all bets are off.

""See if he can do it by himself through the emergency powers. That's my recommendation,"" added Graham, who has publicly pushed Trump to use his authority to declare a national emergency to build the wall. Such a step would allow Trump to bypass Congress and tap various pots of unspent federal money, including for military construction and disaster relief as well as from assets seized by law enforcement, to pay for the wall.

Trump has kept Washington on edge over whether he would resort to such a declaration, citing what he says is a ""crisis"" of drug smuggling and the trafficking of women and children at the border. The president initially sounded as though such a move was imminent, but then pulled back. He has said several times since he first mentioned the idea in public this month that he prefers a legislative solution.

A key question is how much more time is Trump willing to give lawmakers. Graham, who spoke with Trump by telephone on Sunday morning, said the legislative path ""is just about shut off"" and blamed intransigence by Pelosi.

The speaker's office had no immediate comment.

Democrats oppose an emergency declaration but may be powerless to block it. Some Republicans are wary, too, fearing how a future Democratic president might use that authority. Such a move, should Trump ultimately go that route, would almost certainly be challenged in the courts.

Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., called Graham's idea to reopen the government a ""great place to start.""

""I do think if we reopen the government, if the president ends this shutdown crisis, we have folks who can negotiate a responsible, modern investment in technology that will actually make us safer,"" Coons said.

Trump says technology is nice, but that the border can't be secured without a wall.

The White House has been laying the groundwork for an emergency declaration, which is feared by lawmakers in both parties.

Senate Homeland Security Committee Chairman Ron Johnson, R-Wis., said he'd ""hate to see"" a declaration issued because the wall wouldn't get built, presumably because of legal challenges. Democrats voted in the past for border security and should again, he said.

""I actually want to see this wall get built,"" Johnson said. ""I want to keep pressure on Democrats to actually come to the negotiating table in good faith and fund what they have supported in the past.""

Graham favors a declaration and said the time for talk is running out.

""It's the last option, not the first option, but we're pretty close to that being the only option,"" he said.

Graham and Coons spoke on ""Fox News Sunday"" and Johnson appeared on CNN's ""State of the Union."""
405,belleville news-democrat,https://www.bnd.com/news/politics-government/national-politics/article224069750.html,"With illegal immigration at its lowest level in a decade, it's nothing short of stunning that the federal government is shut down over funding for a border wall.

Yet here we are, entering a third week of the shutdown because President Donald Trump has inexplicably chosen to dig his heels in on getting $5 billion to build a wall along stretches of the U.S. border with Mexico that do not already have such a barrier in place.

""As long as it takes,"" Trump said last week when asked how long he was willing to let the shutdown last. ""I mean, look, I'm prepared. I think the people of the country think I'm right. I think the people of this country think I'm right.""

Except, polling shows the opposite. Major polls conducted last month by Quinnipiac, Harvard, NPR and others all showed that a majority of Americans do not support the wall. And the number of wall supporters shrinks even more when asked if it is worth shutting down the government over.

The reality is that immigration from Mexico has been decreasing since 2007, and the number of unauthorized immigrants living in the U.S. is at its lowest level since 2004, according to the Pew Research Center.

Further, the majority of illegal immigration to the United States from Mexico occurs in and around heavily secured ports of entry like San Diego, El Paso and Brownsville, Texas, where 654 miles of wall, fencing and other barriers already exist. Spending billions to build a structure along vast, rural stretches of the border doesn't help with security at the sections of the border that most need help.

No one is arguing for unsecure borders. The newly installed Democratic Congress voted Thursday to approve a stopgap funding bill that would reopen the federal government and provide $1.3 billion for border security in the form of manpower and equipment but not a wall. Trump has said he won't sign it, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell refuses to let a bill come to the Senate floor that the president won't sign.

It's hard to know what the president's end game is. He couldn't get the border wall approved when Republicans controlled both the House and the Senate, so it seems odd to take this stance on the heels of a midterm election in which Democrats made their biggest gains in 40 years and took control of the House.

Trump may feel he is being true to his base of ardent supporters, among whom the border wall ranked high on their list of priorities. But his focus is sorely misplaced. Rather, his attention should be focused on the independent voters who took a chance on him in 2016 believing his style could prove effective at getting things done in Washington. Shutting down the federal government in an effort to get $5 billion for a wall that most Americans don't feel the country needs is the opposite of getting things done.

Laura Kelly is already on the case for Kansas kids with decision to name new DCF leader ' The Kansas City Star

This is why voters elected incoming Gov. Laura Kelly: Because we need to do so much better for Kansas children, because we badly need transparency in state government and because there is zero time to waste in recovering all that was lost under Governors Sam Brownback and Jeff Colyer.

So good for her for marching so briskly into 2019. On Thursday, Kelly announced that she will replace Gina Meier-Hummel as head of the state's child welfare system. The Kansas Department for Children and Families was on what seemed like permanent crisis footing long before Meier-Hummel got there in fall of 2017. But it has remained troubled under her sometimes questionable leadership, and a change was in order.

Meier-Hummel had a difficult job and did make some improvements, which began with a top-to-bottom audit.

But she talked about transparency and didn't show enough of it. She decided to hire inexperienced and unlicensed social workers to fill jobs investigating reports of abuse and neglect. And she replaced contracts for foster care, family preservation and other services with grants that got around rules on no-bid arrangements.

Kelly asked the Colyer administration that she'll soon supplant -- in 11 days, her announcement noted, and we're glad she's counting -- not to implement those grants at this point. Meier-Hummel immediately said she'd honor that request.

The governor-elect also said outright that the state's procurement process wasn't followed and that agency officials had tried to keep her from learning more about how the grantees were chosen.

We wanted Kelly to clean house and name names, for the sake of the state's struggling families, and she's already doing that.

As The Star has reported, the agency gave a major grant to a Florida nonprofit already facing heavy criticism for its foster care. An agency spokeswoman argued that they'd been hired to provide family preservation services, not foster care, but it's still the same nonprofit group.

Meier-Hummel will be succeeded on an interim basis by Laura Howard, who for now will head both the DCF and the Kansas Department for Aging and Disability Services. A former regional administrator in a federal agency overseeing substance abuse and mental health services, Howard is currently director of the Public Management Center in the School of Public Affairs and Administration at the University of Kansas.

Meier-Hummel responded to Kelly's no-nonsense announcement with a news release of her own. It listed her achievements, including starting a new Wichita abuse and neglect reporting line, ""changing key policies and procedures and implementing further mandated training"" and reducing the number of missing and runaway kids by just over a quarter. The suspended grants are in the ""absolute best interest"" of Kansas children and families, the DCF's announcement said.

That's a matter of opinion, but ours is that Kelly has done the right thing and is off to a promising start even before being sworn in as governor."
406,the news tribune,https://www.thenewstribune.com/news/business/article224277975.html,"The government shutdown has suspended federal cleanups at Superfund sites around the nation and forced the cancellation of public hearings, deepening the mistrust and resentment of surrounding residents who feel people in power long ago abandoned them to live among the toxic residue of the country's factories and mines.

""We are already hurting, and it's just adding more fuel to the fire,"" says 40-year-old Keisha Brown, whose wood-frame home is in a community nestled among coking plants and other factories on Birmingham's north side.

The mostly African-American community has been forced to cope with high levels of arsenic, lead and other contaminants in the soil that the Environmental Protection Agency has been scraping up and carting away, house by house.

As President Donald Trump and Congress battle over Trump's demand for a wall on the southern U.S. border, the nearly 3-week-old partial government shutdown has stopped federal work on Superfund sites except for cases where the administration deems ""there is an imminent threat to the safety of human life or to the protection of property.""

EPA's shutdown plans said the agency would evaluate about 800 Superfund sites to see how many could pose an immediate threat. As an example of that kind of threat, it cited an acid leak from a mine that could threaten the public water supply. That's the hazard at Northern California's Iron Mountain mine, where EPA workers help prevent an unending flow of lethally acidic runoff off the Superfund site from spilling into rivers downstream.

Practically speaking, said Bonnie Bellow, a former EPA official who worked on Superfund public outreach at the agency, the impact of the stoppage of work at sites across the nation ""wholly depends"" on the length of the shutdown.

""Unless there is immediate risk like a storm, a flood, a week or two of slowdowns is not going to very likely affect the cleanup at the site,"" Bellow said.

In north Birmingham, Brown said it's been a couple of weeks since she's spotted any EPA crews at people's houses. It wasn't clear if state workers or contractors were continuing work.

But long before the shutdown began, Brown harbored doubts the cleanup was working anyway. ""My main concern is the health of the people out here,"" said Brown, who has asthma. ""All of us are sick, and we've got to function on medicine every day.""

In terms of time, the federal government shutdown is a chronological blip in the long history of the site -- which includes ethics charges in a local bribery scandal to block federal cleanup efforts -- but adds to the uncertainty in an area where residents feel forgotten and betrayed.

At the EPA, the shutdown has furloughed the bulk of the agency's roughly 14,000 employees. It also means the EPA isn't getting most of the daily stream of environmental questions and tips from the public. Routine inspections aren't happening. State, local and private emails to EPA officials often get automated messages back promising a response when the shutdown ends.

In Montana, for instance, state officials this month found themselves fielding calls from a tribal member worried about drinking water with a funny look to it, said Kristi Ponozzo, public-policy director at that state's Department of Environmental Quality. The EPA normally provides tribes with technical assistance on water supplies.

With most EPA colleagues idled, Ponozzo said, her agency also had to call off an environmental review meeting for a mining project, potentially delaying the project.

But it's the agency's work at Superfund sites -- lessening the threat from old nuclear-weapons plants, chemical factories, mines and other entities -- that gets much of the attention.

Absent imminent peril, it would be up to state governments or contractors to continue any cleanup during the shutdown ""up to the point that additional EPA direction or funding is needed,"" the EPA said in a statement.

""Sites where cleanup activities have been stopped or shut down will be secured until cleanup activities are able to commence when the federal government reopens,"" the agency said.

For federal Superfund sites in Michigan, the shutdown means there are no EPA colleagues to consult, said Scott Dean, a spokesman for that state's Department of Environmental Quality.

At Michigan Superfund sites, day-to-day field operations were continuing since private contractors do most of the on-the-ground work, Dean said.

Bellow, the former EPA official, said the cancellation of hearings about Superfund sites posed immediate concerns.

In East Chicago, Indiana, for example, the EPA called off a planned public hearing set for last Wednesday to outline how the agency planned to clean up high levels of lead and arsenic in the soil.

The EPA has proposed a seven-month, $26.5 million cleanup that includes treating and removing tainted soil from the area, where a lead smelter previously was located.

During a public meeting Nov. 29, some residents complained that the EPA's approach would leave too much pollution in place. But others didn't get a chance to speak and were hoping to do so at the meeting this week, said Debbie Chizewer, a Northwestern University environmental attorney who represents community groups in the low-income area.

The EPA announced the cancellation in an online notice and gave no indication that it would be rescheduled.

Leaders of the East Chicago Calumet Community Advisory Group asked for a new hearing date and an extension of a Jan. 14 public comment deadline in a letter to the EPA's regional Superfund division.

Calls by The Associated Press to the agency's regional office in Chicago this week were not answered.

Local critics fear the EPA will use the delay caused by the shutdown as justification for pushing ahead with a cleanup strategy they consider flawed, Chizewer said, even though the agency has designated the affected area as an ""environmental justice community"" -- a low-income community of color that has been disproportionately harmed by pollution.

The EPA has a ""special obligation"" when dealing with such communities, Chizewer said. ""This would be an example of shutting them out for no good reason.""

In North Birmingham, former longtime neighborhood resident Charlie Powell said most of the people living in and around the Superfund site had already ""just got tired and fed up.""

Powell left the area but started a group called PANIC, People Against Neighborhood Industrial Contamination. He believes money would be better spent helping residents move away from the pollution.

""Can I say hell?"" Powell said when asked what residents have been through.

Knickmeyer reported from Washington. Associated Press writers John Flesher in Traverse City, Mich., and Matthew Brown in Helena, Mont., contributed to this report."
407,kbzk tv 7,https://kbzk.com/news/politics/2019/01/03/nancy-pelosi-poised-to-be-elected-house-speaker-in-new-congress/,"Nancy Pelosi was officially elected the new House speaker on Thursday in a majority vote by the House of Representatives on the first day of the 116th Congress.

As House speaker, Pelosi will regularly face off against President Donald Trump and will preside over an emboldened and energized Democratic majority that is poised to launch aggressive oversight of the President and his administration.

Pelosi also makes history as she reclaims a title she previously held when she served as the first and so far only female House speaker from 2007 to 2011.

A small, but vocal, faction of Democrats initially worked to derail Pelosi's bid to become the next Speaker following the 2018 midterm elections, but no challenger against her ever emerged and she ultimately succeed in winning over many of her critics.

One of the most immediate challenges confronting Pelosi as leader of the new House Democratic majority will be the fight over the President's long-promised border wall that triggered a standoff between congressional Democrats and the President and resulted in a partial government shutdown, which is now in its second week.

Pelosi has already outlined a plan for Democrats to pass a legislative package later in the day on Thursday to re-open shuttered parts of the government. Contrary to the President's demands for $5 billion for a border wall, however, the legislation does not provide any new wall funding, setting up an early confrontation between the new Democratic majority and the administration.

Pelosi always projected confidence that she would reclaim the Speaker's gavel, but faced criticism and pushback along the way.

At the end of November, she secured the nomination to become speaker by winning support from a majority of House Democrats -- a total of 203 votes in closed-door leadership elections. But she came up slightly short of the total 218 votes typically needed to win the speakership in the final January vote.

To become Speaker requires the support of a majority of all members of the House who are present and voting, a threshold that could be as high as 218 votes. It would be possible for Pelosi to win with fewer votes, as several previous House speakers have, if some members vote present or decline to participate.

Ahead of the final vote, Pelosi deployed her deal-making abilities to win over detractors, and by mid-December, she appeared to have secured the votes necessary to prevail after negotiating an agreement with some of the Democrats who had been lobbying to block her from the speakership. As part of the agreement, Pelosi backed a proposal to enact term limits for the party's top three leaders.

""I see myself as a bridge to the next generation of leaders, a recognition of my continuing responsibility to mentor and advance new Members into positions of power and responsibility in the House Democratic Caucus,"" Pelosi said in a statement at the time."
408,belleville news-democrat,https://www.bnd.com/news/business/article223342450.html,"Excerpts from recent editorials in the United States and abroad:

The New York Times on a judge's rebuke of Michael Flynn and President Donald Trump's charitable foundation:

A bit of common sense and common decency intruded on Tuesday into the crazy world of Donald Trump.

In New York, the state attorney general announced that the president had agreed that the ""charity"" he used as a piggy bank has no reason to exist.

In Washington, a federal judge let a former top presidential aide know that you can parrot political spin or you can tell the truth, but you can't do both to someone who can send you to prison.

Michael Flynn, Mr. Trump's former national security adviser, appeared before Judge Emmet Sullivan to be sentenced to what he expected would be a term of probation, after pleading guilty to lying to federal investigators about conversations with the Russian ambassador. The office of the special counsel, Robert Mueller, had earlier filed a memo that said it would be right for Mr. Flynn to avoid prison after his extensive cooperation in the investigation of Trump ties to Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential campaign and after.

Then last week, in a memo about their client's sentencing, Mr. Flynn's lawyers implied that he had been tricked into lying and that the F.B.I. acted improperly in interviewing him -- points raised by pro-Trump commentators elaborating on the president's claims of being victimized by a witch hunt.

Judge Sullivan was having none of it.

""I cannot recall an instance of a court ever accepting a guilty plea from someone who did not maintain he was guilty,"" Judge Sullivan said, ""and I do not intend to start today.""

Chastened, Mr. Flynn told the judge that nobody tricked him, that he lied and that he knew he shouldn't have.

The judge was not upset only about Mr. Flynn's sneaky prevarication. He said he felt ""disgust"" at Mr. Flynn's offenses, that a retired three-star general would lie to the F.B.I. ""while on the physical premises of the White House,"" and, acting as an unregistered agent of a foreign country, Turkey, while he was an adviser to Mr. Trump (to which he admitted but was not charged). It was a bracing reminder of the brazenness of his misdeeds and of the standards the public should be able to expect of those who serve them.

Realizing that Judge Sullivan was considering a term of up to six months in prison, Mr. Flynn accepted his offer to delay the sentencing for 90 days until he has completed his cooperation with the special counsel.

""Good luck today in court to General Michael Flynn,"" Mr. Trump had tweeted first thing Tuesday morning.

""Thanks for nothing, Mr. President,"" Mr. Flynn might have thought as he left court.

Mr. Flynn should be grateful the judge offered him the chance to come clean. By contrast, the Donald J. Trump Foundation, a charity that provided no charity, quite properly received none from the New York attorney general's office.

Attorney General Barbara Underwood accused it of ""a shocking pattern of illegality"" that ""amounted to the Trump Foundation functioning as little more than a checkbook to serve Mr. Trump's business and political interests.""

Whatever money that remains will be disbursed under the supervision of Ms. Underwood's office and the judge overseeing the continuing lawsuit her office filed in June, seeking $2.8 million in restitution and a ban on Mr. Trump and his three oldest children serving on the boards of other nonprofit organizations.

In a series of stories exposing the foundation's true nature, The Washington Post found that its largest donation was to fix a fountain in front of the Plaza Hotel in Manhattan, which Mr. Trump owned at the time, that its funds were used to buy a portrait of Mr. Trump, and that it illegally provided political donations and paid for personal legal settlements.

All this comes just days after prosecutors announced that they believed that Mr. Trump had conspired with the owner of The National Enquirer and his fixer Michael Cohen to violate campaign finance laws by paying hush money to two women who said they had affairs with him. It's also just been reported that prosecutors are investigating spending by the Trump inaugural committee. The president still faces lawsuits on the constitutionality of his enriching himself while in office. Meanwhile, the special counsel's inquiry may be expanding rather than winding down.

It's fitting that despite all his bluster and threats, a president who's demonstrated such contempt for the rule of law is finding it so formidable.

That this goes to the essence of American governance was best summed up by Paula Duncan, the Trump enthusiast who was among the jurors who found Mr. Trump's former campaign chief Paul Manafort guilty of fraud, even though she had hoped he wouldn't be convicted.

Explaining her decision after the verdict, she told Fox News, ""No one's above the law.""

The Wall Street Journal on a judge's ruling on the Affordable Care Act's individual mandate:

No one opposes ObamaCare more than we do, and Democrats are now confirming that it was designed as a way-station to government-run health care. But a federal judge's ruling that the law is unconstitutional is likely to be overturned on appeal and may boomerang politically on Republicans.

Judge Reed O'Connor ruled for some 20 state plaintiffs that the Affordable Care Act's individual mandate is no longer legal because Republicans repealed its financial penalty as part of the 2017 tax reform. Recall that Chief Justice John Roberts joined four Justices to say ObamaCare's mandate was illegal as a command to individuals to buy insurance under the Commerce Clause. ""The Framers gave Congress the power to regulate commerce, not to compel it,"" he wrote.

Yet the Chief famously salvaged ObamaCare by unilaterally rewriting the mandate to be a ""tax"" that was within Congress's power. Never mind that Democrats had expressly said the penalty was not a tax. Majority Leader Roberts declared it to be so.

Enter Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, who argues in Texas v. U.S. that since Congress has repealed the mandate, the tax is no longer a tax, and ObamaCare is thus illegal. Judge O'Connor agreed with that logic, and he went further in ruling that since Congress said the mandate is crucial to the structure of ObamaCare, then all of ObamaCare must fall along with the mandate.

We'll admit to a certain satisfaction in seeing the Chief Justice hoist on his own logic. But his ruling in NFIB v. Sebelius was in 2012 and there is more at issue legally now than the ""tax"" issue in that opinion. One legal complication is that Congress in 2017 repealed the financial part of the individual mandate, not the structure of the mandate itself. Republicans used budget rules to pass tax reform so they couldn't repeal the mandate's express language.

The Affordable Care Act has also been up and running since 2014, which means so-called reliance interests come into play when considering a precedent. Millions of people now rely on ObamaCare's subsidies and rules, which argues against judges repealing the law by fiat.

Judge O'Connor breezes past this like a liberal Ninth Circuit appeals judge handling a Donald Trump appeal. He's right that Democrats claimed the individual mandate was essential to the Affordable Care Act. But when Congress killed the financial penalty in 2017 it left the rest of ObamaCare intact. When judging congressional intent, a judge must account for the amending Congress as well as the original Congress.

In any case, the Supreme Court's ""severability"" doctrine calls for restraint in declaring an entire law illegal merely because one part of it is. Our guess is that even the right-leaning Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals judges will overturn Judge O'Connor on this point.

As for the politics, Democrats claim to be alarmed by the ruling but the truth is they're elated. They want to use it to further pound Republicans for denying health insurance for pre-existing conditions if the law is overturned. Democrats campaigned across the country against Mr. Paxton's lawsuit to gain House and Senate seats in November, and they will now press votes in Congress so they can compound the gains in 2020.

President Trump hailed the ruling in a tweet, but he has never understood the Affordable Care Act. His Administration has done good work revising regulations to reduce health-care costs and increase access, but the risk is that the lawsuit will cause Republicans in Congress to panic politically and strike a deal with Democrats that reinforces ObamaCare. This is what happens when conservatives fall into the liberal trap of thinking they can use the courts to achieve policy goals that need to be won in Congress.

The Washington Post on withdrawing all 2,000 U.S. troops out of Syria:

PRESIDENT TRUMP'S sudden move to yank U.S. troops out of Syria undermined at a stroke several foreign policy goals he has championed. The president promised to finish the job of destroying the Islamic State, but the withdrawal will leave thousands of its fighters still in place. He vowed to roll back Iran's aggression across the Middle East, but his decision will allow its forces to entrench in the country that is the keystone of Tehran's ambitions. He promised to protect Israel, but that nation will now be left to face alone the buildup by Iran and its proxies along its northern border.

The president's top national security advisers had carefully developed and articulated a strategy of maintaining a U.S. presence in Syria until the Islamic State was beyond revival and Iran withdrew its forces -- a plan they were defending up until this week. Mr. Trump has again demonstrated, to them and to the world, that no U.S. policy or foreign commitment is immune from his whims.

Mr. Trump claimed the Islamic State had been defeated, but that is not the view of the Defense and State Departments. Thousands of jihadist fighters are still in Syria and control splotches of territory in the Euphrates Valley. A U.S. withdrawal will give the extremists an opportunity to reconstitute, as they did in Iraq following the premature U.S. withdrawal ordered by President Barack Obama.

Until Wednesday, a prime talking point of senior national security officials was that, ""if we've learned one thing over the years, (the) enduring defeat of a group like this means you can't just defeat their physical space and then leave,"" as the State Department's special envoy for the global campaign against the Islamic State, Brett McGurk, put it last week. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said it another way in September: ""Getting rid of the caliphate doesn't mean you then blindly say, 'Okay, we got rid of it,' march out, and then wonder why the caliphate comes back.""

Mr. Trump has justified some of his most controversial decisions, including his continued support for Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, as needed to contain Iran's threat to the United States and its allies. But the Syrian withdrawal hands Tehran and its ally Russia a windfall. Iran has deployed thousands of fighters and allied militiamen to Syria and aspires to create a corridor to Lebanon and the Mediterranean, as well as a new front against Israel along the Golan Heights. In reaction to that threat, Mr. Trump's national security adviser, John Bolton, announced Sept. 24 that ""We're not going to leave (Syria) as long as Iranian troops are outside Iranian borders, and that includes Iranian proxies and militias.""

U.S. ambitions in Syria have never been backed by adequate resources, and a case could be made that neither Congress nor the American public were prepared to support the mission suggested by Mr. Bolton. But Mr. Trump's decision appears to have been precipitated by the bellicose rhetoric of Turkey's Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who last week threatened -- not for the first time -- a military operation against Syrian Kurds, even though U.S. troops are positioned around them. The autocratic Turkish ruler appears to have extracted multiple favors from Mr. Trump in recent days, including the sale of U.S. Patriot missiles and a promise to reexamine the possible extradition of his rival, Fethullah Gulen, from Pennsylvania. If Mr. Trump received anything in return, he hasn't disclosed it.

The Syrian Kurdish forces, which have fought alongside the United States and played a crucial role in liberating most of eastern Syria from the jihadists, will be perhaps the foremost victims of Mr. Trump's decision. Betrayed by Washington, they will now be subject to a military offensive by Turkey. The stab in the back will send an unforgettable message to all who are asked to cooperate with the United States in the fight against terrorism: Washington is an unreliable and dangerous partner.

The Orange County (California) Register on Mick Mulvaney as Trump's choice for chief of staff:

President Trump has found a new chief of staff, albeit an interim one, in his director of the Office of Management and Budget, Mick Mulvaney.

That of chief is a terribly important post, perhaps government's most consequential aside from that of his boss. In theory, at least, the chief of staff is the gatekeeper for everything the president does, everyone he sees, everyone he talks to on the phone.

Perhaps, though few would expect this to be the case, the arbiter of every time he sends out a tweet, and of what it should say.

A Washington insider, a former congressman, Mulvaney is in many ways ideal for the job. He wants it, badly, whereas others with similarly impressive resumes touted for the job have indicated a strong desire to spend more time with their families, from Vice President Pence's staff chief Nick Ayers of Georgia to former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie.

Mulvaney shares the conservative values currently espoused by the president and was a founder of the House Freedom Caucus in 2013, the group that always taunted the Republican leadership, opposing much government funding, including debt limit increases and budget agreements made with the Democrats.

But he also, after Trump secured the Republican nomination in 2016, called the candidate ""a terrible human being"" who he only was voting for out of an even greater dislike of Hillary Clinton.

It's not as if other presidential allies of today haven't said bad things about him in the past. On the campaign trail, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz called his rival ""a narcissist at a level I don't think this country's ever seen,"" for instance.

But if you were the nation's chief executive -- or the CEO of a much smaller entity, for that matter -- could you hire as your top aide and work with a person who had once dubbed you ""terrible""?

Or does this kind of talk come with the territory in politics, where many strange bedfellows are made because of having to run in elections against once and perhaps future allies? Should Trump indeed elevate this practical choice for staff chief to permanent status immediately?

Los Angeles Times on banning bump stocks, which allow semi-automatic weapons to fire like machine guns:

The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives said Tuesday that it had finalized a rule reclassifying so-called bump stocks -- the devices that can make a semiautomatic rifle fire nearly as quickly a fully automatic weapon -- as machine guns, which makes it illegal to manufacture, sell or possess them. The agency said a year ago it had the authority to reclassify the devices, and President Trump -- in the wake of the Parkland, Fla., school shooting -- directed the ATF to speed up the process. Tuesday's announcement -- a rare bit of welcome news from the Trump administration -- makes it official; White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters that owners of the conversion devices will have until March 21 to destroy them or turn them in to the ATF.

This is a good step. Unfortunately, it's all but certain to be challenged in the courts, and it's on shaky legal ground because of the way the new rule evolved. The Obama administration determined that because bump stocks have ""no automatically functioning mechanical parts and (perform) no automated mechanical functions when installed,"" they did not fit the definition of a machine gun in federal law, which meant the ATF lacked the authority to regulate them. Tuesday's announcement, by contrast, hinges not on the technical specifications, but on the functionality. In essence, if it fires like a machine gun, it's a machine gun. Cue the lawyers.

We hope the administration prevails in whatever challenges emerge, but the sure-fire way to resolve this would be for Congress to legislate bump stocks and related gadgets out of existence. Such devices serve no function other than to evade the strict congressional limit on machine guns by, as the ATF said, harnessing ""the recoil energy of the semiautomatic firearm in a manner that allows the trigger to reset and continue firing"" without the shooter having to pull the trigger for each shot.

A mass shooter in Las Vegas used bump stocks affixed to semiautomatic rifles to fire more than 1,000 rounds in a matter of minutes from a 32nd-floor suite of the Mandalay Bay Hotel into a crowd of some 20,000 people, killing 58 concertgoers and injuring hundreds of others. It was the largest single mass shooting in the modern era, drawing attention to bump stocks and sparking outraged demands by many -- the Los Angeles Times included -- that the devices be banned.

As welcome as this new rule is, it will do little to corral our national problem with gun violence. The vast majority of gun deaths come in ones and twos, led by suicides. ...

But it is progress. And the president deserves credit for sticking with his promise to find a way to ban bump stocks. ...

China Daily says telecommunications giant Huawei is a victim of U.S. panic attacks:

This year has not been an annus mirabilis for China's Huawei Technologies Ltd, the world's largest supplier of telecommunications network equipment and second-biggest maker of smartphones.

Although it has been constantly in the news and it is said there is no such thing as bad publicity, it has been making headlines because of the spurious claims it somehow poses a threat to the West, even world peace. It has never been explained exactly how.

In fact it is not because of anything it has done, but because its success has brought it into the crosshairs of the United States' anxiety attacks against China.

Huawei is at the forefront of 5G technology. This latest generation mobile network technology promises to bring the much anticipated and heralded internet of things to life and the US is determined to be the 5G leader.

Not only because whichever country develops the technology that is adopted as standard will have a huge commercial advantage. But also because by setting the standard it will have a knowledge advantage.

As a result, first the US and then one after another its most obedient allies have blocked Huawei from entering their 5G markets on security grounds.

None of them have offered any specific justification for blocking Huawei. They just repeat their claim that the company poses a security risk. That is why objective observers have concluded that those countries are politicizing a commercial issue.

It sets a harmful precedent. What if other countries used the same excuse to block US companies (not confined to the telecom sector)? The US companies are very competitive in many fields, including those that could pose huge security risks, such as finance.

While Huawei will not go unscathed from being prevented from entering key markets, as a competitive player, it still has a vast market to access in other parts of the world. It has signed contracts to supply 5G equipment to 25 telecom carriers, and more than 10,000 5G base stations have been shipped.

In stark contrast to the US and its allies, India for instance, has invited Huawei to conduct 5G trials in the country and complimented it on the role it has played in helping to develop its telecom industry.

The efforts of the US and its allies to try to shield their companies against a Chinese competitor are politically motivated, not the result of a fact-based or transparent decision-making process. And they are counterproductive to the concerted efforts that are needed to ensure the security of 5G networks."

As President Donald Trump is said to be mulling ""other options"" for funding his border wall between the U.S. and Mexico, according to the Associated Press, a dark horse arises on the internet.

A GoFundMe campaign popped up Sunday, hoping to raise funds for Trump's proposed wall between the U.S. and Mexico, which isn't news in and of itself. There are plenty of those around.

But the organizers of this campaign are so encouraged that they've raised more-than $700,000 in just three days that they've bumped their original goal of $200 million up to a cool billion.

The GoFundMe organizer is listed as triple-amputee Air Force veteran Brian Kolfage, who lost both legs and his right arm in a blast at Balad Air Force Base in Iraq in 2004, according to the Arizona Daily Star. The fundraiser is titled, ""We the people will fund the wall.""

The contact listing for the organizer says ""The Wall Funding Team"" is located in Miramar, Fla.

""As a veteran who has given so much, 3 limbs, I feel deeply invested to this nation to ensure future generations have everything we have today,"" Kolfage wrote in the GoFundMe campaign description. ""Too many Americans have been murdered by illegal aliens and too many illegals are taking advantage of the United States taxpayers with no means of ever contributing to our society.

""I have grandparents who immigrated to America legally, they did it the correct way and it's time we uphold our laws, and get this wall BUILT! It's up to Americans to help out and pitch in to get this project rolling.""

411,the news tribune,https://www.thenewstribune.com/news/business/article224126560.html,"The Latest on President Donald Trump and the partial government shutdown (all times local):

3:16 p.m.

Congressional leaders from both parties have returned to the White House for another round of negotiations with President Donald Trump on the ongoing partial government shutdown.

The two sides have made no apparent progress in the past week, with Trump sticking to his demand of $5.7 billion for a border barrier and Democrats insisting they won't give him the money.

Trump has been making a public case that there is a ""crisis"" at the southern border. And he's still threatening to declare a national emergency to circumvent Congress if he can't get the wall money from them.

He told reporters during a visit to the Capitol earlier Wednesday that he may turn to a declaration ""at some point"" if top Democrats Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi ""don't agree"" with his assessment about the problems at the border.

President Donald Trump says Republicans are ""totally unified"" in the shutdown standoff over his long-promised southern border wall, though some GOP lawmakers have been expressing concern about the 19-day partial government closure.

Trump traveled to Capitol Hill on Wednesday to meet with Senate Republicans. He says there was ""no discussion about anything other than solidarity.""

Trump has been considering a national emergency declaration to bypass Congress to build the wall. He says he ""may do that at some point"" if he can't get a deal with Democrats.

Trump also plans to meet with top congressional Democrats and Republicans at the White House on Wednesday.

President Donald Trump arrived on Capitol Hill claiming he has ""tremendous"" support as he headed into a meeting with Republican senators uneasy with the government shutdown over his border wall.

Asked how long the shutdown would last, Trump told reporters Wednesday ""whatever it takes.""

The partial shutdown is now in its 19th day, the second longest ever.

Trump and Vice President Mike Pence arrived for the private lunch meeting with the Senate GOP caucus to shore up support.

Several Republican senators have said the government should be re-opened while talks continue over border security and Trump's demand for money to build the wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.

President Donald Trump says he thinks he and the Democrats are ""getting closer"" to a deal to end the budget stalemate that has partially shut down the government despite no evidence that any progress has been made.

And he's suggesting the partial government shutdown could be ""a blessing in disguise"" because, he suggests, it could lead to a broader immigration deal.

Trump spoke Wednesday during an Oval Office bill signing on anti-human trafficking legislation. It's a day after he delivered a prime-time address trying to make the case for his long-stalled U.S.-Mexico border wall.

Trump says that he would like to see ""real immigration reform in this country because we need it."" He says, ""Everybody wants to see immigration reform,"" adding that perhaps the stalemate ""will turn out to be a blessing in disguise.""

Gone are the days when the U.S. and Mexican governments regularly exchanged statements over President Donald Trump's insistence on a border wall.

Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said Wednesday he won't be drawn into what he calls a U.S. internal dispute, an apparent reference to the 19-day-old partial U.S. government shutdown over a border barrier.

Lopez Obrador says, ""We are not going to respond to situations arising from internal affairs in the United States.""

Unlike his predecessor, the Mexican leader didn't have to respond to any specific aspersion about Mexico, because Trump didn't make any in his Tuesday night address to the American public. Relations between the two leaders have been surprisingly cordial, given their ideological differences.

Lopez Obrador said, ""Of course, there are those ... who want us to get into a confrontation. We always want a friendly relationship with the United States, a cooperative relationship.""

As a presidential candidate Trump promised Mexico would pay for a border wall, but Mexico refused.

President Donald Trump is using a bill signing focused on curbing human trafficking to push his case for a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border.

Trump says a southern border that is not secured exacerbates the incidents of human trafficking. He says, ""As long as we have a border that is not secure, we're going to suffer the consequences of that.""

Wednesday's bill signing came a day after Trump's prime-time speech designed to persuade Americans that illegal immigration and trafficking at the border are a crisis.

Democrats have called Trump's promised wall costly, ineffective and ""immoral"" and say he's ""manufacturing a crisis.""

The bill Trump signed is designed to enhance an annual State Department report that measures global efforts to eliminate human trafficking.

The White House says it's the fourth bipartisan bill the Republican president has signed in the last few weeks to prevent human trafficking.

Congressional Democrats say they'll head to the White House with the plan to reopen the government -- the same one they've been presenting. They're asking President Donald Trump to accept a bipartisan bill to fund border security without the wall.

Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Wednesday the president ""could end the Trump shutdown and re-open the government today, and he should.""

Pelosi and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer spoke at an event where they were flanked by federal workers going without pay during the shutdown, now in its 19th day.

Schumer called workers the ""collateral damage"" of Trump's ""temper tantrum."" He said the president failed to ""persuade a soul"" during his ""divisive"" prime-time address Tuesday night to the nation.

Trump meets with congressional leaders at the White House Wednesday afternoon. He rejected the Senate's bipartisan funding bill in December, sparking the shutdown.

The White House is trying to keep jittery congressional Republicans from defecting over the toll the partial government shutdown is taking in their states.

President Donald Trump and Democrats have been at an impasse over funding for his proposed border wall, which has led to a partial government shutdown, now in its 19th day.

Trump meets with Senate Republicans Wednesday on Capitol Hill just hours after he argued on national television that a border wall was needed to resolve a security and humanitarian ""crisis.""

Senators say the shutdown has led to disruptions in agricultural payments for farmers, as well as for home buyers trying to secure government-backed home loans. Lawmakers also are worried about missed paychecks for government workers Friday.

As many as half a dozen GOP senators have said the government should reopen while border security negotiations with Democrats continue.

President Donald Trump again linked illegal immigration along the southern border with drugs and violent crime as he urged Democratic lawmakers to fund his proposed border wall.

In his first national address from the Oval Office, the president gave no indication he was softening his stance that the partial government shutdown would continue without money for the wall.

Trump argued Tuesday night that the wall was needed to resolve what he called a security and humanitarian ""crisis.""

He addressed the nation as the shutdown stretched through its third week, with hundreds of thousands of federal workers going without pay and some congressional Republicans growing increasingly jittery about the impasse.

Trump plans to visit Senate Republicans at the Capitol on Wednesday before meeting with Democratic leaders at the White House."
412,kbzk tv 7,https://kbzk.com/cnn-us-politics/2018/12/16/trumps-washington-faces-one-last-week-of-uproar-in-2018/,"A frenzied year in Washington is going out with a roar as the political forces that combined to make the first half of President Donald Trump's mandate so turbulent come to a head in a hugely consequential run-up to the holidays.

Looming over everything is the new reality, fueled by weeks of court filings by special counsel Robert Mueller and other prosecutors, that every corner of Trump's public life is now under investigation: his White House, his campaign, his presidential transition, his inaugural committee, his businesses.

The President's sense of persecution prompted a rage-filled Twitter outburst on Sunday that also appeared to reflect concern about cooperation agreements secured by Mueller with his longtime personal attorney and fixer Michael Cohen and former national security adviser Michael Flynn.

""The Russian Witch Hunt Hoax, started as the 'insurance policy' long before I even got elected, is very bad for our Country,"" Trump tweeted.

""They are Entrapping people for misstatements, lies or unrelated things that took place many years ago. Nothing to do with Collusion. A Democrat Scam!""

Trump's tweet ignored the fact that the legality of the Mueller probe has been upheld in court on several occasions and that it has secured a number of convictions and is opening a window into the President's own behavior in its prosecutions of his associates.

Former FBI Director James Comey, whom Trump fired, laid into the President in his own tweet Sunday, dismissing the President's claim on Twitter that the bureau's raid against Cohen this year was illegal.

""This is from the President of our country, lying about the lawful execution of a search warrant issued by a federal judge. Shame on Republicans who don't speak up at this moment -- for the FBI, the rule of law, and the truth,"" Comey wrote.

As a new week dawns, the capital is on edge to see whether Mueller has any more dramatic cards to play before the turn of the year. One event that may further irritate the President is Tuesday's sentencing hearing for Flynn, who admitted lying to the FBI.

But the Russia investigation is only one element in a complex set of political dramas that are playing out before Washington breaks for the Christmas and New Year recess.

An impasse over Trump's border wall could shutter parts of the government by the end of the week -- the latest battle in the war over immigration that has rocked American politics for more than a decade.

Yet another Cabinet member, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, is going home trailed by scandal, in another rebuke to the idea that the Trump administration was ever about draining the swamp.

A fresh staff shakeup is playing out in the West Wing, but experience suggests that new acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney will fare no better than his predecessors in imposing order on a President who defies management.

Obamacare is having another brush with extinction in the courts, just as the Republican House majority built on a vow to overturn the law limps out of town.

And the Democratic majority that will take over the House next year is already flexing its muscles after an extraordinary televised showdown between the party's top brass and Trump last week offered a preview of skirmishes to come.

The President's biggest, indisputable success is the motoring economy and historically low unemployment. But there are growing fears after several volatile weeks that a slowdown is looming, given ebbing global growth, a trade war with China and churning market volatility.

The possibility of a partial shutdown when funding runs out for several key departments at the end of the week appeared to rise on Sunday, with the White House and top Democrats hunkering down over Trump's demand for $5 billion in border wall funding.

""We're going to do whatever is necessary to build the border wall to stop this ongoing crisis of illegal immigration,"" White House senior policy adviser Stephen Miller said on CBS's ""Face the Nation.""

Asked whether that meant forcing a shutdown to extract the funds from Congress on an issue that was foundational to Trump's presidential campaign, Miller replied, ""If it comes to it, absolutely.""

But Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Trump will not get what he wants.

""President Trump should understand, there are not the votes for the wall. In the House or the Senate, he is not going to get the wall in any form,"" Schumer said on NBC's ""Meet the Press.""

Signs that the gap between the White House and Democrats is deepening raise the possibility that the showdown, if it does shutter government, could develop into the first big clash between the new Congress and the White House in January.

Americans who rely on the Affordable Care Act got a surprise lump of coal late on Friday night when a federal judge in Texas ruled that the entire law was unconstitutional.

The move set off a fresh duel over the centerpiece of Barack Obama's domestic agenda that has so far defied all GOP attempts to kill it off.

Immediate legal opinion -- even from some conservatives -- suggested that the sweeping ruling could end up being overturned, though there is a chance the fight over Obamacare's fate could end up yet again in the Supreme Court in a test of the new conservative majority.

The decision reignited the political wars over health care that Democrats believe played a significant role in their surge to victory in the House in the midterm elections. If that is the case, the Obamacare ruling, paradoxically, may not be good news for the GOP.

But Trump welcomed the latest threat to his predecessor's legacy.

""I believe we're going to get really good health care. Exciting things happened over the last 24 hours,"" Trump said at a congressional ball at the White House on Saturday night. Typically though, he gave few details of his vague plans to provide a better alternative to Obamacare, which now looks likely to be a key issue in yet another national election cycle.

Trump enters another week looking for another new Cabinet member after announcing the resignation of Zinke, who was facing multiple ethics probes and was a top oversight target of the new Democratic House.

The New York Times and Washington Post also reported that Zinke might have been fired if he failed to quit by the end of the year.

Possible replacements include Deputy Interior Secretary David Bernhardt and Nevada Republican Sen. Dean Heller, who lost his re-election race, sources with knowledge of the situation said.

Mulvaney, meanwhile, is gearing up to take on the daunting task of being Trump's third chief of staff. Given the failure of his two predecessors, Reince Priebus and John Kelly, to rein in a President who trusts his gut above all, there are few expectations that Mulvaney will calm an often erratic White House and impose discipline, as many predecessors did in other administrations.

""He's the chief of staff, not chief of the President, right? That's an important distinction,"" David Urban, the political strategist who masterminded Trump's 2016 victory in Pennsylvania, said on CNN's ""State of the Union.""

Still, Mulvaney appears to have a trusting relationship with the President, following his tenure as his budget chief. And his knowledge of Capitol Hill, gained as a former member of the House, will be an asset as the White House seeks to outmaneuver would-be Speaker Nancy Pelosi and her troops next year.

Trump heads into a Christmas break at his Mar-a-Lago resort this week in a position of increasing political and legal vulnerability after weeks of devastating revelations and court filings related to the Russia investigation.

The President has been implicated by New York prosecutors overseen by his own Justice Department in directing criminal attempts to subvert campaign finance laws alongside Cohen, whose case was referred by Mueller.

Cooperation by Cohen and Flynn is helping Mueller take his investigation deep into the President's inner circle. He has now uncovered multiple contacts between Trump associates and Russians during the time of Moscow's election meddling effort and repeated lying about those encounters.

Speculation is frenzied about one mysterious scene on Friday in which an entire floor of the federal courthouse in Washington was locked down over a mystery subpoena appeal involving the special counsel's team.

Things are certain to become more uncomfortable for Trump in the new year. Maryland Democratic Rep. Elijah Cummings, who is expected to take over the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, said on ""State of the Union"" that he would seek to secure testimony from Cohen before the President's former fixer reports to prison in March.

There were also worrying signs for Trump in a new NBC/Wall Street Journal poll that found that 62% of respondents believe the President has not been truthful about the Russia investigation.

Since his approval rating was 43% in the survey however, it seems that a portion of those Republicans who are uneasy about the President's attitude toward Mueller still don't see it as a deal breaker for their faith in him."
413,belleville news-democrat,https://www.bnd.com/news/nation-world/national/article223193915.html,"White House digs in on border wall demand, risking shutdown

WASHINGTON (AP) -- The White House on Sunday pushed the federal government closer to the brink of a partial shutdown later this week, digging in on its demand for $5 billion to build a border wall as congressional Democrats stood firm against it.

""We're going to do whatever is necessary to build the border wall to stop this ongoing crisis of illegal immigration,"" said White House senior adviser Stephen Miller.

Asked if that meant having a government shutdown, he said: ""If it comes to it, absolutely.""

Trump said last week he would be ""proud"" to have a shutdown to get Congress to approve a $5 billion down payment to fulfill his campaign promise to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. But the president doesn't have the votes from the Republican-controlled Congress to support funding for the wall at that level.

Democratic congressional leaders, Sen. Chuck Schumer and Rep. Nancy Pelosi, have proposed no more than $1.6 billion, as outlined in a bipartisan Senate bill. The money would not go for the wall but for fencing upgrades and other border security. Democrats also offered to simply keep funding at its current level, $1.3 billion.

Trump lawyer Giuliani rules out Mueller interview with Trump

WASHINGTON (AP) -- With a number of probes moving closer to the Oval Office, President Donald Trump and his attorney unleashed a fresh series of attacks on the investigators, questioning their integrity while categorically ruling out the possibility of a presidential interview with the special counsel.

Trump and Rudy Giuliani used Twitter and television interviews Sunday to deliver a series of broadsides against special counsel Robert Mueller and federal prosecutors in New York. Giuliani said he was ""disgusted"" by the tactics used by Mueller in his probe into Russian election interference, including in securing guilty pleas from the president's former national security adviser Michael Flynn on a charge of lying to federal investigators.

Trump, Giuliani said, would not submit to an interview by Mueller's team.

""They're a joke,"" Giuliani told ""Fox News Sunday."" ''Over my dead body, but, you know, I could be dead.""

The special counsel, who is investigating possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russia, has continued to request an interview with the president. Last month, the White House sent written answers in response to the special counsel's questions about possible collusion. The White House has resisted answering questions on possible obstruction of justice.

Child's death highlights communication barriers on border

Shortly before a 7-year-old Guatemalan girl died in U.S. custody, her father signed a form stating that his daughter was in good health. But it's unclear how much the man understood on the form, which was written in English and read to him in Spanish by Border Patrol agents.

The death of Jakelin Caal highlights the communication challenges along the U.S.-Mexico border as agents come in contact with an increasing number of migrants who speak neither English nor Spanish.

Her father's native language is the Mayan tongue known as Q'eqchi'. His second language is Spanish. It's unclear whether something was lost in translation or whether it would have made a difference in saving Jakelin after the two were detained and underwent a health screening along a remote stretch of U.S.-Mexico border. But the case raises questions about the Border Patrol's use of English-only forms.

All agents are required to speak Spanish, and they receive formal Spanish training. Reading forms in Spanish is often enough to pose basic questions. But some other Spanish-speaking migrants reported signing paperwork that they later said they did not understand.

Scores of immigrant parents who were separated from their children after crossing the border in the spring said they signed forms agreeing to be deported with the understanding that their kids would be returning with them, only to find themselves deported without them. Many had to wait months before being reunited with them in their homelands.

Talks adopt 'rulebook' to put Paris climate deal into action

KATOWICE, Poland (AP) -- Almost 200 nations, including the world's top greenhouse gas producers, China and the United States, have adopted a set of rules meant to breathe life into the 2015 Paris climate accord by setting out how countries should report their emissions and efforts to reduce them.

But negotiators delayed other key decisions until next year -- a move that frustrated environmentalists and countries that wanted more ambitious goals in light of scientists' warnings that the world must shift sharply away from fossil fuels in the coming decade.

""The majority of the rulebook for the Paris agreement has been created, which is something to be thankful for,"" said Mohamed Adow, a climate policy expert at Christian Aid. ""But the fact countries had to be dragged kicking and screaming to the finish line shows that some nations have not woken up"" to the dire consequences of global warming as outlined in a report by the U.N Panel on Climate Change, or IPCC.

Officials at the talks, which ended late Saturday in the Polish city of Katowice, agreed upon universal rules on how nations can cut emissions. Poor countries secured assurances on financial support to help them reduce emissions, adapt to changes such as rising sea levels and pay for damage that has already happened.

""Through this package, you have made a thousand little steps forward together,"" said Michal Kurtyka, a senior Polish official who led the talks.

French city honors victims of Christmas market attack

PARIS (AP) -- People filled a square in the French city of Strasbourg on Sunday to show respect and sympathy for the victims of last week's shooting attack near a famous Christmas market as the death toll rose to five.

French authorities said a Polish man died in a Strasbourg hospital Sunday, one of a dozen people wounded in last Tuesday's attack. Poland's Foreign Ministry extended condolences Sunday on Twitter to his family.

According to the newspaper DNA, more than 1,000 people attended the memorial, which ended with a minute of applause and a rendition of France's national anthem, ""La Marseillaise.""

The hour-long ceremony took place in Kleber Square, not far from where a gunman opened fire on Tuesday evening. Strasbourg Mayor Roland Ries praised the city's resilience in the face of hardship.

The ""extremely large crowd in the Christmas market"" on Saturday ""was an illustration of our commitment to these values ??on which our living together is based, which we will continue to defend against all those who want to attack it,"" Ries said.

RICHARDSON, Texas (AP) -- After raising five kids and retiring at age 77 from her secretarial job, Janet Fein couldn't be blamed for finally relaxing, but that's not her.

Fein, now 84, went to back to school and will accomplish a long-held goal this week when she graduates from the University of Texas at Dallas with a bachelor's degree.

""I didn't have anything to do in retirement and I didn't think that playing bingo was up to my speed,"" said Fein, who majored in sociology because she felt it was ""substantial.""

She said she enjoyed all the reading and writing papers. ""With each class I already knew a lot, but then I also learned a lot. And that made me happy,"" she said.

People 65 and older make up less than one percent of U.S. college students. In 2015, they accounted for about 67,000 of about 20 million college students, according to the National Center for Education Statistics.

Next-generation of GPS satellites are headed to space

DENVER (AP) -- After months of delays, the U.S. Air Force is about to launch the first of a new generation of GPS satellites, designed to be more accurate, secure and versatile.

But some of their most highly touted features will not be fully available until 2022 or later because of problems in a companion program to develop a new ground control system for the satellites, government auditors said.

The satellite is scheduled to lift off Tuesday from Cape Canaveral, Florida, aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. It's the first of 32 planned GPS III satellites that will replace older ones now in orbit. Lockheed Martin is building the new satellites outside Denver.

GPS is best-known for its widespread civilian applications, from navigation to time-stamping bank transactions. The Air Force estimates that 4 billion people worldwide use the system.

But it was developed by the U.S. military, which still designs, launches and operates the system. The Air Force controls a constellation of 31 GPS satellites from a high-security complex at Schriever Air Force Base outside Colorado Springs.

After fraud probe, new primary may replace GOP candidate

RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- Legislation quickly passed by North Carolina's lawmakers this week would prepare a path for Republicans to dump their nominee in a still-undecided U.S. House race marred with ballot fraud allegations.

""I think (legislators are) worried that Mark Harris might be damaged goods and they want to have the opportunity to have a different Republican nominee,"" said Carter Wrenn, a Republican operative and consultant to former U.S. Sen. Jesse Helms and others for more than 40 years. ""That's how I read those tea leaves.""

If the state elections board decides ballot irregularities or other problems cast the true outcome into doubt and force a redo, the legislation -- if allowed to go into law by Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper -- would require new primary elections in the 9th Congressional District race, in addition to a new general election.

That would allow Republicans another look at Mark Harris, the Republican who led Democrat Dan McCready by 905 votes in unofficial results. Harris hasn't been certified the winner, and an investigation is looking into missing absentee ballots in rural Bladen County and whether unsealed ballots illegally handled by collection teams there could have been altered.

Bladen was the only county among the eight within the 9th District where Harris won a majority of mail-in absentee ballots over McCready.

Top of mind: 'Justice' is Merriam-Webster's word of the year

NEW YORK (AP) -- Racial justice. Obstruction of justice. Social justice. The Justice Department. Merriam-Webster has chosen ""justice"" as its 2018 word of the year, driven by the churning news cycle over months and months.

The word follows ""toxic,"" picked by Oxford Dictionaries, and ""misinformation,"" plucked by Dictonary.com.

Peter Sokolowski, Merriam-Webster's editor at large, told The Associated Press ahead of Monday's announcement that ""justice"" consistently bubbled into the top 20 or 30 lookups on the company's website, spiking at times due to specific events but also skating close to the surface for much of the year.

While it's one of those common words people likely know how to spell and use correctly in a sentence, Sokolowski pointed to other reasons that drive search traffic. Among them is an attempt to focus a train of thought around a philosophical problem, or to seek aspirational motivation. Such well-known words are often among the most looked up every year, including those that are slightly abstract, including ""love,"" he said.

The designation for ""justice"" came soon after President Trump's one-time fixer, Michael Cohen, was sentenced to three years in prison for crimes that included arranging the payment of hush money to conceal his boss' alleged sexual affairs. He told a judge he agreed time and again to cover up Trump's ""dirty deeds"" out of ""blind loyalty.""

'Spider-Verse' swings to the top; 'Mortal Engines' tanks

LOS ANGELES (AP) -- ""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse"" swung to the top of the domestic box office in its first weekend in theaters, proving that there is widespread audience interest in big screen animated versions of Marvel's marquee superheroes.

The film led a host of newcomers that debuted to varying success on this pre-Christmas holiday weekend, including Clint Eastwood's drug smuggling drama ""The Mule"" and the Peter Jackson-produced epic ""Mortal Engines"" which bombed in North American theaters.

""Into the Spider-Verse"" earned an estimated $35.4 million from 3,813 theaters against a $90 million production budget according to Sony Pictures on Sunday, which is a record for animated movies in December (although the hybrid ""Alvin and the Chipmunks"" movies were higher). The film features an innovative animation style -- both CGI and hand-drawn -- and focuses on the Miles Morales character as he learns to become the famed web-slinger. It's another financial win for the studio's latest ""expanded Spider-Man universe"" strategy following ""Venom"" and ""Spider-Man: Homecoming.""

And ""Spider-Verse"" has been very well-received among critics, and audiences in exit surveys gave it a rare A+ CinemaScore -- a first for a Spider-Man film. It's also been nominated for a Golden Globe award for best animated feature and picked up a few honors from critics' groups as well, including the New York Film Critics Circle.

""We are playing to both families and fanboys. We're an all-audience film,"" said Adrian Smith, Sony's president of domestic distribution."
414,belleville news-democrat,https://www.bnd.com/news/business/article224126560.html,"The Latest on President Donald Trump and the partial government shutdown (all times local):

4 p.m.

Vice President Mike Pence says Democrats were ""unwilling to even negotiate"" an end to the partial government shutdown and the standoff over President Donald Trump's desire for a border barrier.

Pence spoke outside the West Wing after a contentious meeting Wednesday between Trump and congressional leaders.

Pence says, ""I think the president made his position very clear today that there will be no deal without a wall.""

Pence says Trump asked House Speaker Nancy Pelosi whether she would be willing to agree to funding for a wall or a barrier on the southern border if he re-opened the government quickly.

Pence says, ""When she said 'No,' the president said 'Goodbye.""

Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said Trump had a ""temper tantrum."" Pence says of the president, ""I don't recall him ever raising his voice.""

Top Democrats say President Donald Trump walked out of a meeting with congressional leaders as talks to end the partial government shutdown remain at an impasse.

Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said Trump asked House Speaker Nancy Pelosi at Wednesday's White House meeting whether she would agree to fund his wall.

When she said ""no,"" Schumer says, Trump got up and said, ""Then we have nothing to discuss."" Schumer says, ""And he just walked out.""

Schumer is calling Trump's actions ""really, really unfortunate.""

Trump is also weighing in on the meeting by tweet, calling it ""a total waste of time.""

He tweets that once Pelosi rejected his long-stalled border wall, he ""said bye-bye, nothing else works!""

Congressional leaders from both parties have returned to the White House for another round of negotiations with President Donald Trump on the ongoing partial government shutdown.

The two sides have made no apparent progress in the past week, with Trump sticking to his demand of $5.7 billion for a border barrier and Democrats insisting they won't give him the money.

Trump has been making a public case that there is a ""crisis"" at the southern border. And he's still threatening to declare a national emergency to circumvent Congress if he can't get the wall money from them.

He told reporters during a visit to the Capitol earlier Wednesday that he may turn to a declaration ""at some point"" if top Democrats Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi ""don't agree"" with his assessment about the problems at the border.

President Donald Trump says Republicans are ""totally unified"" in the shutdown standoff over his long-promised southern border wall, though some GOP lawmakers have been expressing concern about the 19-day partial government closure.

Trump traveled to Capitol Hill on Wednesday to meet with Senate Republicans. He says there was ""no discussion about anything other than solidarity.""

Trump has been considering a national emergency declaration to bypass Congress to build the wall. He says he ""may do that at some point"" if he can't get a deal with Democrats.

Trump also plans to meet with top congressional Democrats and Republicans at the White House on Wednesday.

President Donald Trump arrived on Capitol Hill claiming he has ""tremendous"" support as he headed into a meeting with Republican senators uneasy with the government shutdown over his border wall.

Asked how long the shutdown would last, Trump told reporters Wednesday ""whatever it takes.""

The partial shutdown is now in its 19th day, the second longest ever.

Trump and Vice President Mike Pence arrived for the private lunch meeting with the Senate GOP caucus to shore up support.

Several Republican senators have said the government should be re-opened while talks continue over border security and Trump's demand for money to build the wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.

President Donald Trump says he thinks he and the Democrats are ""getting closer"" to a deal to end the budget stalemate that has partially shut down the government despite no evidence that any progress has been made.

And he's suggesting the partial government shutdown could be ""a blessing in disguise"" because, he suggests, it could lead to a broader immigration deal.

Trump spoke Wednesday during an Oval Office bill signing on anti-human trafficking legislation. It's a day after he delivered a prime-time address trying to make the case for his long-stalled U.S.-Mexico border wall.

Trump says that he would like to see ""real immigration reform in this country because we need it."" He says, ""Everybody wants to see immigration reform,"" adding that perhaps the stalemate ""will turn out to be a blessing in disguise.""

Gone are the days when the U.S. and Mexican governments regularly exchanged statements over President Donald Trump's insistence on a border wall.

Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said Wednesday he won't be drawn into what he calls a U.S. internal dispute, an apparent reference to the 19-day-old partial U.S. government shutdown over a border barrier.

Lopez Obrador says, ""We are not going to respond to situations arising from internal affairs in the United States.""

Unlike his predecessor, the Mexican leader didn't have to respond to any specific aspersion about Mexico, because Trump didn't make any in his Tuesday night address to the American public. Relations between the two leaders have been surprisingly cordial, given their ideological differences.

Lopez Obrador said, ""Of course, there are those ... who want us to get into a confrontation. We always want a friendly relationship with the United States, a cooperative relationship.""

As a presidential candidate Trump promised Mexico would pay for a border wall, but Mexico refused.

President Donald Trump is using a bill signing focused on curbing human trafficking to push his case for a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border.

Trump says a southern border that is not secured exacerbates the incidents of human trafficking. He says, ""As long as we have a border that is not secure, we're going to suffer the consequences of that.""

Wednesday's bill signing came a day after Trump's prime-time speech designed to persuade Americans that illegal immigration and trafficking at the border are a crisis.

Democrats have called Trump's promised wall costly, ineffective and ""immoral"" and say he's ""manufacturing a crisis.""

The bill Trump signed is designed to enhance an annual State Department report that measures global efforts to eliminate human trafficking.

The White House says it's the fourth bipartisan bill the Republican president has signed in the last few weeks to prevent human trafficking.

Congressional Democrats say they'll head to the White House with the plan to reopen the government -- the same one they've been presenting. They're asking President Donald Trump to accept a bipartisan bill to fund border security without the wall.

Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Wednesday the president ""could end the Trump shutdown and re-open the government today, and he should.""

Pelosi and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer spoke at an event where they were flanked by federal workers going without pay during the shutdown, now in its 19th day.

Schumer called workers the ""collateral damage"" of Trump's ""temper tantrum."" He said the president failed to ""persuade a soul"" during his ""divisive"" prime-time address Tuesday night to the nation.

Trump meets with congressional leaders at the White House Wednesday afternoon. He rejected the Senate's bipartisan funding bill in December, sparking the shutdown.

The White House is trying to keep jittery congressional Republicans from defecting over the toll the partial government shutdown is taking in their states.

President Donald Trump and Democrats have been at an impasse over funding for his proposed border wall, which has led to a partial government shutdown, now in its 19th day.

Trump meets with Senate Republicans Wednesday on Capitol Hill just hours after he argued on national television that a border wall was needed to resolve a security and humanitarian ""crisis.""

Senators say the shutdown has led to disruptions in agricultural payments for farmers, as well as for home buyers trying to secure government-backed home loans. Lawmakers also are worried about missed paychecks for government workers Friday.

As many as half a dozen GOP senators have said the government should reopen while border security negotiations with Democrats continue.

President Donald Trump again linked illegal immigration along the southern border with drugs and violent crime as he urged Democratic lawmakers to fund his proposed border wall.

In his first national address from the Oval Office, the president gave no indication he was softening his stance that the partial government shutdown would continue without money for the wall.

Trump argued Tuesday night that the wall was needed to resolve what he called a security and humanitarian ""crisis.""

He addressed the nation as the shutdown stretched through its third week, with hundreds of thousands of federal workers going without pay and some congressional Republicans growing increasingly jittery about the impasse.

Trump plans to visit Senate Republicans at the Capitol on Wednesday before meeting with Democratic leaders at the White House."

""I can't tell you when the government is going to be open. I can tell you it's not going to be open until we have a wall, a fence, whatever they would like to call it,"" Trump said in the Oval Office after a Christmas call with US troops.

Trump repeated a claim made a day earlier -- without explanation -- that he'd recently approved 115 miles worth of border barrier. The White House hasn't provided any further details about the claim, which Trump first made on Twitter on Christmas Eve.

He said he would go to the new stretch of the wall in January.

""It's going to be built, hopefully rapidly,"" he said. ""I'm going there at the end of January for the start of construction. That's a big stretch.""

""We're almost having a groundbreaking, it's such a big section,"" he said. ""It's probably the biggest section we'll get out.""

Trump has previously visited wall prototypes near the border."
416,kbzk tv 7,https://kbzk.com/cnn-us-politics/2019/01/03/nancy-pelosi-poised-to-be-elected-house-speaker-in-new-congress/,"Nancy Pelosi is poised to reclaim the title of House speaker on Thursday when the new Democratic majority arrives in Washington and takes over control of the House of Representatives.

A small, but vocal, faction of Democrats initially worked to derail Pelosi's bid to become the next Speaker following the 2018 midterm elections, but no challenger against her ever emerged and she ultimately succeed in winning over many of her critics.

The longtime House Democratic leader is now on the verge of winning back the position of power she previously held when she served as the first and so far only female House speaker from 2007 to 2011.

In the role of speaker, Pelosi will be one of the most visible members of the Democratic Party to regularly face off against President Donald Trump and will preside over an emboldened and energized Democratic majority that is poised to launch aggressive oversight of the President and his administration.

One of the most immediate challenges that will confront Pelosi as leader of the new House Democratic majority will be the fight over the President's long-promised border wall that triggered a standoff between congressional Democrats and the President and resulted in a partial government shutdown, which is now in its second week.

Pelosi has already outlined a plan for Democrats to pass a legislative package later in the day on Thursday to re-open shuttered parts of the government. Contrary to the President's demands for $5 billion for a border wall, however, the legislation does not provide any new wall funding, setting up an early confrontation between the new Democratic majority and the administration.

Pelosi always projected confidence that she would reclaim the Speaker's gavel, but faced criticism and pushback along the way.

At the end of November, she secured the nomination to become speaker by winning support from a majority of House Democrats -- a total of 203 votes in closed-door leadership elections. But she came up slightly short of the total 218 votes typically needed to win the speakership in the final January vote.

To become Speaker requires the support of a majority of all members of the House who are present and voting, a threshold that could be as high as 218 votes. It would be possible for Pelosi to win with fewer votes, as several previous House speakers have, if some members vote present or decline to participate.

Ahead of the final vote, Pelosi deployed her deal-making abilities to win over detractors, and by mid-December, she appeared to have secured the votes necessary to prevail after negotiating an agreement with some of the Democrats who had been lobbying to block her from the speakership. As part of the agreement, Pelosi backed a proposal to enact term limits for the party's top three leaders.

""I see myself as a bridge to the next generation of leaders, a recognition of my continuing responsibility to mentor and advance new Members into positions of power and responsibility in the House Democratic Caucus,"" Pelosi said in a statement at the time."
417,kbzk tv 7,https://kbzk.com/cnn-business-consumer/2019/01/08/networks-wasted-no-time-fact-checking-trumps-oval-office-address/,"A version of this article first appeared in the ""Reliable Sources"" newsletter. You can sign up for free right here.

Hey there, this is Oliver Darcy filling in for Brian Stelter.

That is the chyron on ""CNN Tonight"" as I'm writing tonight's newsletter -- and it's the big question heading into Wednesday. Did Trump's speech move the needle? Or, as John King put it earlier in the night, ""Did the president win over any Democrats?"" It's hard to imagine he did.

The brief Oval Office address didn't include any new arguments or information that would prompt anyone to be persuaded one way or another. As Fox's Chris Wallace bluntly summed up, ""The President tonight was making an offer the Democrat's can't accept.""

Earlier in the day, Trump hosted television news journalists for an off-the-record lunch at the White House where he reportedly made a huge admission. NYT's Peter Baker reported via sources in the room that Trump privately told the journalists he wasn't inclined to deliver the prime time address, but had been persuaded to do so by advisers.

One source told Baker that Trump conceded the speech was ""not going to change a damn thing."" The source said Trump went even further, saying his trip to the border was just a big photo op. Then he pointed to Bill Shine and Sarah Sanders and said, ""But, these people behind you say it's worth it."" In other words, even Trump didn't think he would persuade anyone with his speech.

>> Publicly, of course, Trump played up his speech, tweeting late Tuesday night, ""Thank you for soooo many nice comments regarding my Oval Office speech. A very interesting experience!""

Before the networks made the decision to air Trump's address, a debate raged in media circles: Should the channels turn over their valuable air time for what was almost certainly going to be a political speech? After some deliberation, every broadcast and cable news outlet decided to do so. Ted Koppel told NYT prior to the speech, ""When the president of the United States asks for airtime, you've got to do it."" And look, at the end of the day, networks were put in a difficult position.

But now, in hindsight, I'm wondering: Are TV execs comfortable with their decision? Bill Carter tweeted, ""Networks should feel totally burned. Shouldn't they come out + tell WH: That was a fraudulent request; forget asking for platform for your political posturing ever again?"" And Erik Wemple noted, ""Looks like the White House secured major network TV time for an address that repeats all of the president's arguments on immigration, only, this time, through a TelePrompTer.""

Brian Stelter emails from Las Vegas: I'm here at CES, where I can report that... umm... almost no one watched the speech or the Democratic response. Here's my sense: The cable newsers are almost always going to carry a big prime time presidential speech. The broadcast networks are inclined to say yes, as well, though it's more complicated for them.

The broadcast execs noted that this was Trump's first time asking for airtime for an Oval Office address. They also noted that the country is in the midst of a partial government shutdown. Given the newsless nature of this address, they are likely to be a bit more skeptical the next time Trump requests time... But this is the bottom line: One of the powers of the presidency is the power to address the nation.

TV networks did air Trump's speech in the most responsible manner in which they could, fact-checking his claims immediately after it concluded. NBC ""Nightly News"" anchor Lester Holt noted that the president repeated ""some of the dubious claims he's made in the past."" ABC's Cecilia Vega helped check facts with George Stephanopoulos. ""Just because you say it's a crisis, doesn't necessarily make it one,"" Vega said. Fox's Shep Smith listed off a number of areas on which Trump misled the public during his speech. And CBS ""Evening News"" anchor Jeff Glor told viewers the he hoped to ""fact check any inaccurate assertions.""

>> That said, Tom Kludt flagged a salient point from Glor who said, ""There is some nuance to some of these arguments that unfortunately [due to] time, sometimes gets lost.""

CNN and MSNBC not only spent much of the evening checking Trump's claims against the facts on-air, but they did so aggressively in the chyrons. Throughout the night, I noticed various fact check's (like the one above) being employed by both of the networks.

Alex Koppelman emails: One argument we've heard frequently during the discussion over whether or not networks should take Trump live is that we all provide comprehensive fact-checks, both on air and online, of what he says after he says it, or sometimes during. That's a good thing, no question -- but when it comes to justifying taking him live, there's a major caveat that I haven't seen discussed: We don't really know if fact-checks work, or whether we're doing them the right way.

A 2011 CJR article noted that one study showed that the more effective way to fact-check the conspiracy theory that Barack Obama is a Muslim would be to state the fact -- Obama is a Christian -- rather than state and correct the falsehood. The same researchers also explored the effect that the race of the people conducting the research survey had on respondents' answers about these facts, and concluded, ""our findings suggest that the context in which corrective information about sensitive topics is delivered affects how people perceive and respond to them.""

This is not settled science by any means -- but there are people studying it. And if we as an industry are going to rely on fact-checking as our shield when we choose to give over our space to words we know will contain misinformation, we should be talking to those researchers, providing funding for their work, even bringing them in-house to help us test and improve our approach. We owe our audiences more than just going with our guts and hoping it works out.

CNN: Hosts Chris Cuomo and Don Lemon featured analysis and fact checking from reporters and contributors. Lemon opened up his show with a thorough fact-check of Trump's speech.

Fox News: After Bret Baier signed off Fox News' special coverage, Sean Hannity spent much of the evening unsurprisingly advocating for Trump's position on the wall. Guests included Lindsey Graham and Mark Levin, both of whom were supportive of the president.

MSNBC: Rachel Maddow scored a big guest, interviewing Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez who slammed Trump. ""The one thing the president has not talked about is the fact he has systematically engaged in the violation of... human rights on our border,"" Ocasio-Cortez said, according to Mediaite. ""He has separated children from their families.""

This should come as no surprise. The Daily Beast reported that ahead of his Oval Office address, Trump ""leaned on a number of advisers for how to navigate the government shutdown he'd waged over funding for his border wall."" The advisers, per The Beast, included Sean Hannity, and Lou Dobbs who encouraged Trump to continue demanding funding for the wall.

>> Related: Tomi Lahren noted in this tweet that Trump's Oval Office address used similar rhetoric to commentary she had delivered on Hannity's show. ""Something @realDonaldTrump said in his #OvalOfficeAddress tonight sounded familiar...""

Stelter emails: The accumulation of daily deceptions and fear-mongering matters a LOT more than a single speech. But this episode has sparked some smart discussions about the media's Trump coverage. Hopefully it'll continue. I talked with The New Yorker's Isaac Chotiner about these issues... Here's the Q&A...

418,the news tribune,https://www.thenewstribune.com/news/business/article223342450.html,"Excerpts from recent editorials in the United States and abroad:

The New York Times on a judge's rebuke of Michael Flynn and President Donald Trump's charitable foundation:

A bit of common sense and common decency intruded on Tuesday into the crazy world of Donald Trump.

In New York, the state attorney general announced that the president had agreed that the ""charity"" he used as a piggy bank has no reason to exist.

In Washington, a federal judge let a former top presidential aide know that you can parrot political spin or you can tell the truth, but you can't do both to someone who can send you to prison.

Michael Flynn, Mr. Trump's former national security adviser, appeared before Judge Emmet Sullivan to be sentenced to what he expected would be a term of probation, after pleading guilty to lying to federal investigators about conversations with the Russian ambassador. The office of the special counsel, Robert Mueller, had earlier filed a memo that said it would be right for Mr. Flynn to avoid prison after his extensive cooperation in the investigation of Trump ties to Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential campaign and after.

Then last week, in a memo about their client's sentencing, Mr. Flynn's lawyers implied that he had been tricked into lying and that the F.B.I. acted improperly in interviewing him -- points raised by pro-Trump commentators elaborating on the president's claims of being victimized by a witch hunt.

Judge Sullivan was having none of it.

""I cannot recall an instance of a court ever accepting a guilty plea from someone who did not maintain he was guilty,"" Judge Sullivan said, ""and I do not intend to start today.""

Chastened, Mr. Flynn told the judge that nobody tricked him, that he lied and that he knew he shouldn't have.

The judge was not upset only about Mr. Flynn's sneaky prevarication. He said he felt ""disgust"" at Mr. Flynn's offenses, that a retired three-star general would lie to the F.B.I. ""while on the physical premises of the White House,"" and, acting as an unregistered agent of a foreign country, Turkey, while he was an adviser to Mr. Trump (to which he admitted but was not charged). It was a bracing reminder of the brazenness of his misdeeds and of the standards the public should be able to expect of those who serve them.

Realizing that Judge Sullivan was considering a term of up to six months in prison, Mr. Flynn accepted his offer to delay the sentencing for 90 days until he has completed his cooperation with the special counsel.

""Good luck today in court to General Michael Flynn,"" Mr. Trump had tweeted first thing Tuesday morning.

""Thanks for nothing, Mr. President,"" Mr. Flynn might have thought as he left court.

Mr. Flynn should be grateful the judge offered him the chance to come clean. By contrast, the Donald J. Trump Foundation, a charity that provided no charity, quite properly received none from the New York attorney general's office.

Attorney General Barbara Underwood accused it of ""a shocking pattern of illegality"" that ""amounted to the Trump Foundation functioning as little more than a checkbook to serve Mr. Trump's business and political interests.""

Whatever money that remains will be disbursed under the supervision of Ms. Underwood's office and the judge overseeing the continuing lawsuit her office filed in June, seeking $2.8 million in restitution and a ban on Mr. Trump and his three oldest children serving on the boards of other nonprofit organizations.

In a series of stories exposing the foundation's true nature, The Washington Post found that its largest donation was to fix a fountain in front of the Plaza Hotel in Manhattan, which Mr. Trump owned at the time, that its funds were used to buy a portrait of Mr. Trump, and that it illegally provided political donations and paid for personal legal settlements.

All this comes just days after prosecutors announced that they believed that Mr. Trump had conspired with the owner of The National Enquirer and his fixer Michael Cohen to violate campaign finance laws by paying hush money to two women who said they had affairs with him. It's also just been reported that prosecutors are investigating spending by the Trump inaugural committee. The president still faces lawsuits on the constitutionality of his enriching himself while in office. Meanwhile, the special counsel's inquiry may be expanding rather than winding down.

It's fitting that despite all his bluster and threats, a president who's demonstrated such contempt for the rule of law is finding it so formidable.

That this goes to the essence of American governance was best summed up by Paula Duncan, the Trump enthusiast who was among the jurors who found Mr. Trump's former campaign chief Paul Manafort guilty of fraud, even though she had hoped he wouldn't be convicted.

Explaining her decision after the verdict, she told Fox News, ""No one's above the law.""

The Wall Street Journal on a judge's ruling on the Affordable Care Act's individual mandate:

No one opposes ObamaCare more than we do, and Democrats are now confirming that it was designed as a way-station to government-run health care. But a federal judge's ruling that the law is unconstitutional is likely to be overturned on appeal and may boomerang politically on Republicans.

Judge Reed O'Connor ruled for some 20 state plaintiffs that the Affordable Care Act's individual mandate is no longer legal because Republicans repealed its financial penalty as part of the 2017 tax reform. Recall that Chief Justice John Roberts joined four Justices to say ObamaCare's mandate was illegal as a command to individuals to buy insurance under the Commerce Clause. ""The Framers gave Congress the power to regulate commerce, not to compel it,"" he wrote.

Yet the Chief famously salvaged ObamaCare by unilaterally rewriting the mandate to be a ""tax"" that was within Congress's power. Never mind that Democrats had expressly said the penalty was not a tax. Majority Leader Roberts declared it to be so.

Enter Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, who argues in Texas v. U.S. that since Congress has repealed the mandate, the tax is no longer a tax, and ObamaCare is thus illegal. Judge O'Connor agreed with that logic, and he went further in ruling that since Congress said the mandate is crucial to the structure of ObamaCare, then all of ObamaCare must fall along with the mandate.

We'll admit to a certain satisfaction in seeing the Chief Justice hoist on his own logic. But his ruling in NFIB v. Sebelius was in 2012 and there is more at issue legally now than the ""tax"" issue in that opinion. One legal complication is that Congress in 2017 repealed the financial part of the individual mandate, not the structure of the mandate itself. Republicans used budget rules to pass tax reform so they couldn't repeal the mandate's express language.

The Affordable Care Act has also been up and running since 2014, which means so-called reliance interests come into play when considering a precedent. Millions of people now rely on ObamaCare's subsidies and rules, which argues against judges repealing the law by fiat.

Judge O'Connor breezes past this like a liberal Ninth Circuit appeals judge handling a Donald Trump appeal. He's right that Democrats claimed the individual mandate was essential to the Affordable Care Act. But when Congress killed the financial penalty in 2017 it left the rest of ObamaCare intact. When judging congressional intent, a judge must account for the amending Congress as well as the original Congress.

In any case, the Supreme Court's ""severability"" doctrine calls for restraint in declaring an entire law illegal merely because one part of it is. Our guess is that even the right-leaning Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals judges will overturn Judge O'Connor on this point.

As for the politics, Democrats claim to be alarmed by the ruling but the truth is they're elated. They want to use it to further pound Republicans for denying health insurance for pre-existing conditions if the law is overturned. Democrats campaigned across the country against Mr. Paxton's lawsuit to gain House and Senate seats in November, and they will now press votes in Congress so they can compound the gains in 2020.

President Trump hailed the ruling in a tweet, but he has never understood the Affordable Care Act. His Administration has done good work revising regulations to reduce health-care costs and increase access, but the risk is that the lawsuit will cause Republicans in Congress to panic politically and strike a deal with Democrats that reinforces ObamaCare. This is what happens when conservatives fall into the liberal trap of thinking they can use the courts to achieve policy goals that need to be won in Congress.

The Washington Post on withdrawing all 2,000 U.S. troops out of Syria:

PRESIDENT TRUMP'S sudden move to yank U.S. troops out of Syria undermined at a stroke several foreign policy goals he has championed. The president promised to finish the job of destroying the Islamic State, but the withdrawal will leave thousands of its fighters still in place. He vowed to roll back Iran's aggression across the Middle East, but his decision will allow its forces to entrench in the country that is the keystone of Tehran's ambitions. He promised to protect Israel, but that nation will now be left to face alone the buildup by Iran and its proxies along its northern border.

The president's top national security advisers had carefully developed and articulated a strategy of maintaining a U.S. presence in Syria until the Islamic State was beyond revival and Iran withdrew its forces -- a plan they were defending up until this week. Mr. Trump has again demonstrated, to them and to the world, that no U.S. policy or foreign commitment is immune from his whims.

Mr. Trump claimed the Islamic State had been defeated, but that is not the view of the Defense and State Departments. Thousands of jihadist fighters are still in Syria and control splotches of territory in the Euphrates Valley. A U.S. withdrawal will give the extremists an opportunity to reconstitute, as they did in Iraq following the premature U.S. withdrawal ordered by President Barack Obama.

Until Wednesday, a prime talking point of senior national security officials was that, ""if we've learned one thing over the years, (the) enduring defeat of a group like this means you can't just defeat their physical space and then leave,"" as the State Department's special envoy for the global campaign against the Islamic State, Brett McGurk, put it last week. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said it another way in September: ""Getting rid of the caliphate doesn't mean you then blindly say, 'Okay, we got rid of it,' march out, and then wonder why the caliphate comes back.""

Mr. Trump has justified some of his most controversial decisions, including his continued support for Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, as needed to contain Iran's threat to the United States and its allies. But the Syrian withdrawal hands Tehran and its ally Russia a windfall. Iran has deployed thousands of fighters and allied militiamen to Syria and aspires to create a corridor to Lebanon and the Mediterranean, as well as a new front against Israel along the Golan Heights. In reaction to that threat, Mr. Trump's national security adviser, John Bolton, announced Sept. 24 that ""We're not going to leave (Syria) as long as Iranian troops are outside Iranian borders, and that includes Iranian proxies and militias.""

U.S. ambitions in Syria have never been backed by adequate resources, and a case could be made that neither Congress nor the American public were prepared to support the mission suggested by Mr. Bolton. But Mr. Trump's decision appears to have been precipitated by the bellicose rhetoric of Turkey's Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who last week threatened -- not for the first time -- a military operation against Syrian Kurds, even though U.S. troops are positioned around them. The autocratic Turkish ruler appears to have extracted multiple favors from Mr. Trump in recent days, including the sale of U.S. Patriot missiles and a promise to reexamine the possible extradition of his rival, Fethullah Gulen, from Pennsylvania. If Mr. Trump received anything in return, he hasn't disclosed it.

The Syrian Kurdish forces, which have fought alongside the United States and played a crucial role in liberating most of eastern Syria from the jihadists, will be perhaps the foremost victims of Mr. Trump's decision. Betrayed by Washington, they will now be subject to a military offensive by Turkey. The stab in the back will send an unforgettable message to all who are asked to cooperate with the United States in the fight against terrorism: Washington is an unreliable and dangerous partner.

The Orange County (California) Register on Mick Mulvaney as Trump's choice for chief of staff:

President Trump has found a new chief of staff, albeit an interim one, in his director of the Office of Management and Budget, Mick Mulvaney.

That of chief is a terribly important post, perhaps government's most consequential aside from that of his boss. In theory, at least, the chief of staff is the gatekeeper for everything the president does, everyone he sees, everyone he talks to on the phone.

Perhaps, though few would expect this to be the case, the arbiter of every time he sends out a tweet, and of what it should say.

A Washington insider, a former congressman, Mulvaney is in many ways ideal for the job. He wants it, badly, whereas others with similarly impressive resumes touted for the job have indicated a strong desire to spend more time with their families, from Vice President Pence's staff chief Nick Ayers of Georgia to former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie.

Mulvaney shares the conservative values currently espoused by the president and was a founder of the House Freedom Caucus in 2013, the group that always taunted the Republican leadership, opposing much government funding, including debt limit increases and budget agreements made with the Democrats.

But he also, after Trump secured the Republican nomination in 2016, called the candidate ""a terrible human being"" who he only was voting for out of an even greater dislike of Hillary Clinton.

It's not as if other presidential allies of today haven't said bad things about him in the past. On the campaign trail, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz called his rival ""a narcissist at a level I don't think this country's ever seen,"" for instance.

But if you were the nation's chief executive -- or the CEO of a much smaller entity, for that matter -- could you hire as your top aide and work with a person who had once dubbed you ""terrible""?

Or does this kind of talk come with the territory in politics, where many strange bedfellows are made because of having to run in elections against once and perhaps future allies? Should Trump indeed elevate this practical choice for staff chief to permanent status immediately?

Los Angeles Times on banning bump stocks, which allow semi-automatic weapons to fire like machine guns:

The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives said Tuesday that it had finalized a rule reclassifying so-called bump stocks -- the devices that can make a semiautomatic rifle fire nearly as quickly a fully automatic weapon -- as machine guns, which makes it illegal to manufacture, sell or possess them. The agency said a year ago it had the authority to reclassify the devices, and President Trump -- in the wake of the Parkland, Fla., school shooting -- directed the ATF to speed up the process. Tuesday's announcement -- a rare bit of welcome news from the Trump administration -- makes it official; White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters that owners of the conversion devices will have until March 21 to destroy them or turn them in to the ATF.

This is a good step. Unfortunately, it's all but certain to be challenged in the courts, and it's on shaky legal ground because of the way the new rule evolved. The Obama administration determined that because bump stocks have ""no automatically functioning mechanical parts and (perform) no automated mechanical functions when installed,"" they did not fit the definition of a machine gun in federal law, which meant the ATF lacked the authority to regulate them. Tuesday's announcement, by contrast, hinges not on the technical specifications, but on the functionality. In essence, if it fires like a machine gun, it's a machine gun. Cue the lawyers.

We hope the administration prevails in whatever challenges emerge, but the sure-fire way to resolve this would be for Congress to legislate bump stocks and related gadgets out of existence. Such devices serve no function other than to evade the strict congressional limit on machine guns by, as the ATF said, harnessing ""the recoil energy of the semiautomatic firearm in a manner that allows the trigger to reset and continue firing"" without the shooter having to pull the trigger for each shot.

A mass shooter in Las Vegas used bump stocks affixed to semiautomatic rifles to fire more than 1,000 rounds in a matter of minutes from a 32nd-floor suite of the Mandalay Bay Hotel into a crowd of some 20,000 people, killing 58 concertgoers and injuring hundreds of others. It was the largest single mass shooting in the modern era, drawing attention to bump stocks and sparking outraged demands by many -- the Los Angeles Times included -- that the devices be banned.

As welcome as this new rule is, it will do little to corral our national problem with gun violence. The vast majority of gun deaths come in ones and twos, led by suicides. ...

But it is progress. And the president deserves credit for sticking with his promise to find a way to ban bump stocks. ...

China Daily says telecommunications giant Huawei is a victim of U.S. panic attacks:

This year has not been an annus mirabilis for China's Huawei Technologies Ltd, the world's largest supplier of telecommunications network equipment and second-biggest maker of smartphones.

Although it has been constantly in the news and it is said there is no such thing as bad publicity, it has been making headlines because of the spurious claims it somehow poses a threat to the West, even world peace. It has never been explained exactly how.

In fact it is not because of anything it has done, but because its success has brought it into the crosshairs of the United States' anxiety attacks against China.

Huawei is at the forefront of 5G technology. This latest generation mobile network technology promises to bring the much anticipated and heralded internet of things to life and the US is determined to be the 5G leader.

Not only because whichever country develops the technology that is adopted as standard will have a huge commercial advantage. But also because by setting the standard it will have a knowledge advantage.

As a result, first the US and then one after another its most obedient allies have blocked Huawei from entering their 5G markets on security grounds.

None of them have offered any specific justification for blocking Huawei. They just repeat their claim that the company poses a security risk. That is why objective observers have concluded that those countries are politicizing a commercial issue.

It sets a harmful precedent. What if other countries used the same excuse to block US companies (not confined to the telecom sector)? The US companies are very competitive in many fields, including those that could pose huge security risks, such as finance.

While Huawei will not go unscathed from being prevented from entering key markets, as a competitive player, it still has a vast market to access in other parts of the world. It has signed contracts to supply 5G equipment to 25 telecom carriers, and more than 10,000 5G base stations have been shipped.

In stark contrast to the US and its allies, India for instance, has invited Huawei to conduct 5G trials in the country and complimented it on the role it has played in helping to develop its telecom industry.

The efforts of the US and its allies to try to shield their companies against a Chinese competitor are politically motivated, not the result of a fact-based or transparent decision-making process. And they are counterproductive to the concerted efforts that are needed to ensure the security of 5G networks."
419,"""the village reporter"" & ""the hometown huddle""",http://www.thevillagereporter.com/graham-urging-president-trump-to-reopen-government-for-a-few-weeks/,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Republican lawmaker advising President Donald Trump said he is encouraging the president to reopen the government for several weeks to continue negotiating with Democrats over funding for a U.S.-Mexico border wall before the president takes the more drastic step of declaring a national emergency.

But that may be wishful thinking, given that Sen. Lindsey Graham also says Trump still wants to reach a deal for the wall before agreeing to reopen shuttered government departments. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a leading Democratic negotiator, insists that Trump reopen the government first.

The weeks-old standoff over funding led to the partial government shutdown that hit day 23 on Sunday without an end in sight.

""Before he pulls the plug on the legislative option, and I think we're almost there, I would urge him to open up the government for a short period of time, like three weeks, before he pulls the plug, see if we can get a deal,"" said Graham, a South Carolina Republican. ""If we can't at the end of three weeks, all bets are off.""

""See if he can do it by himself through the emergency powers. That's my recommendation,"" added Graham, who has publicly pushed Trump to use his authority to declare a national emergency to build the wall. Such a step would allow Trump to bypass Congress and tap various pots of unspent federal money, including for military construction and disaster relief and from asset seized by law enforcement, to pay for the wall.

Trump has kept Washington on edge over whether he would resort to such a declaration, citing what he says is a ""crisis"" of drug smuggling and the trafficking of women and children at the border. The president initially sounded as though such a move was imminent, but then pulled back. He has said several times since he first mentioned the idea in public earlier this month that he prefers to try to reach a deal with Congress.

A key question is how much more time is Trump willing to give lawmakers. Graham, who said he and Trump talked by telephone on Sunday morning, said the legislative path ""is just about shut off"" and blamed Pelosi.

The speaker's office had no immediate comment.

Democrats oppose an emergency declaration but may be powerless to block it. Some Republicans are wary, too, fearing how a future Democratic president might use that authority. Such a move, should Trump ultimately go that route, would almost certainly be challenged in the courts.

Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., called Graham's idea to reopen the government a ""great place to start.""

""I do think if we reopen the government, if the president ends this shutdown crisis, we have folks who can negotiate a responsible, modern investment in technology that will actually make us safer,"" Coons said.

Trump has maintained that the border cannot be secured without a wall.

Graham said he thinks Trump is willing to accept the $5.7 billion he has insisted on for the wall, along with some immigration measures Democrats might find acceptable, such as helping immigrants who were illegally brought to the U.S. as children.

Trump has expressed interest in a broader immigration overhaul, but says he first wants the Supreme Court to address the class of immigrants known as ""Dreamers."" Pelosi also has shown no interest in accepting a wall -- she has called it an ""immorality"" -- in exchange for immigration fixes.

And, Trump, who was holed up in the White House as snow blanketed Washington on Sunday, appeared to shoot down Graham's suggestion of a ""wall plus"" deal, saying on Twitter that even Democrats don't want to make ""Dreamers"" part of the negotiations.

""The damage done to our Country from a badly broken Border - Drugs, Crime and so much that is bad - is far greater than a Shutdown, which the Dems can easily fix as soon as they come back to Washington!"" Trump said in a separate tweet.

The White House has been laying the groundwork for an emergency declaration, feared by members of both parties.

Senate Homeland Security Committee Chairman Ron Johnson, R-Wis., said he would ""hate to see"" a declaration because then the wall wouldn't get built, presumably because of legal challenges. Democrats voted in the past for border security and should again, he said.

""I actually want to see this wall get built,"" Johnson said. ""I want to keep pressure on Democrats to actually come to the negotiating table in good faith and fund what they have supported in the past.""

But Graham, who favors a presidential declaration, said the time for talk is running out.

""It's the last option, not the first option, but we're pretty close to that being the only option,"" he said.

Graham and Coons spoke on ""Fox News Sunday."" Johnson appeared on CNN's ""State of the Union."""
420,duluth budgeteer news,https://www.duluthnewstribune.com/news/government-and-politics/4549208-trump-threatens-shut-down-border-government-funding-stalemate,"WASHINGTON - With the partial government shutdown headed toward its second week and no resolution in sight, President Donald Trump on Friday issued a string of tweets in which he once again vowed to close the entire U.S. border with Mexico and halt aid to several Latin American countries unless Democrats agree to his demand for billions of dollars in wall funding.

Trump is also canceling plans to visit his Florida resort, Mar-a-Lago, and will remain in Washington over the New Year holiday, Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney said.

About 25 percent of the federal government has been shut down since Saturday, with roughly 800,000 workers affected, including an estimated 350,000 who are on furlough at home.

""We will be forced to close the Southern Border entirely if the Obstructionist Democrats do not give us the money to finish the Wall & also change the ridiculous immigration laws that our Country is saddled with,"" Trump said in a morning tweet.

In a reprise of his threat before the midterm elections to cut off aid to Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador as a caravan of migrants was making its way toward the United States, Trump said that those three countries ""are doing nothing for the United States but taking our money.""

""Word is that a new Caravan is forming in Honduras and they are doing nothing about it,"" he said, without providing further details. ""We will be cutting off all aid to these 3 countries - taking advantage of U.S. for years!""

Despite Trump's threat, the United States this month announced a new collaboration with Mexico on a program to curb migration from Central American countries, with much of the $10.6 billion U.S. contribution to be drawn from existing aid programs.

Trump's tweets come as Congress has effectively given up on breaking the impasse over the president's demands for border-wall funding, all but ensuring that the partial government shutdown will stretch into at least the start of the new year.

The House and the Senate convened for just minutes on Thursday before gaveling closed until next week. During the brief session in the House, Republicans shot down a Democratic attempt to vote on legislation to reopen the government.

As he did Thursday, Trump remained out of public view on Friday. In an appearance on Fox News, Mulvaney said that the president had ""canceled his plans for Christmas, and now he's canceled his plan for New Year's.""

""He's staying in Washington, D.C., over New Year's,"" said Mulvaney, who is set to become Trump's acting chief of staff next month.

Even though Trump will be in town and Republicans control both chambers of Congress, Mulvaney acknowledged that little progress on a deal is expected until the start of the new Congress on Jan. 3, when Democrats will retake the House. Contending that Democrats ""have simply shut down the discussions,"" he sought to place the blame on House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., who is expected to be elected speaker in the new Congress.

""Nancy Pelosi, in fairness, does not have the votes for the speakership yet,"" Mulvaney said. ""She cannot be seen by her party as being weak on negotiating with Donald Trump. So we fully expect that until she is elected speaker and has locked that vote up, we don't expect to hear from the Democrats again.""

According to a Washington Post tally, Pelosi, who won the Democratic caucus's nomination for the speakership in late November, appears to have secured enough support to be elected speaker in January.

Pelosi's spokesman, Drew Hammill, said in a statement Friday that Democrats ""are united against the President's immoral, ineffective and expensive wall - the wall that he specifically promised that Mexico would pay for.""

Democrats will not consider any offers that have not been publicly endorsed by Trump himself, he said.

""While we await the president's public proposal, Democrats have made it clear that, under a House Democratic majority, we will vote swiftly to reopen government on Day One,"" Hammill said.

At the heart of the stalemate is Trump's demand for $5 billion in funding for his proposed wall at the U.S.-Mexico border. Congressional Democrats have rejected that figure and in recent weeks have refused to publicly endorse a figure above $1.3 billion, which continues existing funding levels and includes money for new border fencing and levee walls, but not the concrete wall Trump once demanded before he started more recently talking about ""steel slats.""

Mulvaney said Friday that ""some folks use the term 'wall' and they mean different things.""

""Everyone agrees that what we can and should be building on that southern border is that steel barrier that the president tweeted out. That's what he wants to build. The Democrats, believe it or not, don't call that a wall,"" he said.

421,duluth budgeteer news,https://www.duluthnewstribune.com/news/government-and-politics/4546960-partial-government-shutdown-assured-after-lawmakers-leave,"WASHINGTON - Large parts of the federal government are shutting down overnight after President Donald Trump torpedoed a bipartisan spending deal because it lacked the money he demanded for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.

Funding for numerous agencies, including those that operate parks, homeland security, law enforcement, tax collection and transportation, was set to expire at midnight. Close to 400,000 federal workers are expected to be sent home without pay until a deal is reached, and numerous services will be halted in that time, with the impacts broadening the longer the funding lapse lasts.

The shutdown intensifies a standoff between Trump, who is demanding $5.7 billion for a border wall, and congressional Democrats, who have vowed to block any wall funding and have the votes to do so. It marks a deflating final chapter for Republicans as they complete two years of unified GOP control in Washington - as well as an acrimonious prelude to the upcoming era of divided government, after Democrats take the House in January.

Trump saw the final days of this year as his last chance to try to extract funding for the wall, while Democrats, united against the wall and buttressed by big wins in the midterm elections, showed no signs of buckling to his demands amid a flurry of attacks this week.

The White House and congressional leaders continued negotiations late Friday, but by 8:30 p.m., the House and the Senate had adjourned for the night. That made it impossible to vote on any spending agreement until Saturday, and it remained unclear whether any deal would materialize by then.

It is unclear how long a shutdown might last. Trump predicted earlier Friday that it could drag on for a ""very long time.""

The Senate on Friday considered legislation that would fund the government agencies through Feb. 8 and appropriate $5.7 billion for the erection of 215 miles of wall structures along the Mexico border.

The House passed that legislation Thursday evening, but Senate Democrats successfully unified on Friday and refused to back that measure.

Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said Friday that Democrats were open to discussions with the White House and Republicans but would not agree to any measure that funded the construction of a new border wall.

Schumer said Friday that the Senate had unanimously agreed to a spending bill earlier in the week and accused Trump of having a ""temper tantrum"" because he wasn't getting money for the wall.

""President Trump, you will not get your wall,"" Schumer said. ""You're not getting your wall today, next week or on Jan. 3 when Democrats take control of the House.""

Democrats tried to make clear to the White House for weeks that they had the votes to block any measure that contained money for the wall.

As their power became clear to White House officials, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders signaled Tuesday that Trump was planning to withdraw his request for the funds in an effort to keep the government open.

But he received a torrent of criticism from conservative lawmakers and commentators following this decision, and he reversed course on Thursday, scuttling a temporary, bipartisan spending bill that would have extended funding through Feb. 8 but did not contain wall money.

Trump on Friday urged Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., to change long-standing Senate rules to pass the House's measure providing $5.7 billion for the wall.

McConnell refused, making it impossible for Senate Republicans to marshal the measure through because Democrats control 49 seats in the 100-member chamber.

""We're going to be working very hard to get something passed in the Senate,"" Trump said earlier Friday in the Oval Office. ""Now it's up to the Democrats as to whether or not we have a shutdown tonight. I hope we don't, but we're very much prepared for a long shutdown.""

Republicans were frustrated by the reversal, and Democrats warned Friday that the president's erratic and unvetted decisions in recent days were unsettling financial markets, foreign allies and even members of his Cabinet.

""This is tyranny of talk radio hosts, right? And so, how do you deal with that?"" said Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn. ""You have two talk radio hosts who completely flipped the president. And so, do we succumb to tyranny of talk radio hosts?""

Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis announced his resignation Thursday. The Dow Jones industrial average had one of its worst weeks in recent decades and has fallen almost 4,400 points, or 16 percent, since October.

Multiple federal parks and monuments are slated to close, some as soon as Saturday morning. The Securities and Exchange Commission posted a list of the services it will soon suspend, including the processing of certain business records. The Justice Department, Commerce Department and Internal Revenue Service are preparing to send thousands of workers home without pay.

And Trump's prediction that a shutdown would last ""for a very long time"" meant that hundreds of thousands of federal employees risk missing at least one paycheck. Even the Border Patrol agents and Transportation Security Administration officials who are directed to continue working during the shutdown will not be paid until Congress funds their agencies.

About 400,000 federal workers would be furloughed, according to a Washington Post projection. But a number of federal agencies, including the Pentagon, will not be directly affected, because Congress already passed multiple other spending bills this year that secured funding through September.

As the funding lapse lengthens, the negotiations will prove to be a major test for Trump, Schumer, McConnell and House conservatives as they jostle for footing in Washington's new power structure.

Friday afternoon saw a flurry of discussions begin in the afternoon when McConnell, Democrats and Vice President Mike Pence began huddling separately in the Capitol.

Pence separately joined Trump adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner and White House budget director Mick Mulvaney for a meeting with House conservatives. But the talks yielded no clear evidence of progress, and eventually, Pence and his entourage left the Capitol.

""We don't have a deal,"" Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Richard Shelby, R-Ala., told reporters after emerging from a late meeting with the vice president. ""There are a lot of moving parts, and we're trying to get them moving together.""

The construction of a wall along the border with Mexico was one of Trump's top campaign promises in 2016, and he had promised that Mexico would finance the entire project. But since taking office, he has demanded the money from Congress.

Senate Democrats have blocked every attempt so far. Trump has also threatened to shut the government down numerous times if he doesn't receive money for the border wall, but before Friday night, he had backed down every time.

In recent days, Trump has tried a number of different tactics to try to secure the money. He called on Cabinet secretaries to search their budgets for extra funds, and on Wednesday, he said the entire project would be built by the military. But by Thursday he was back to demanding that Congress provide the funding, leaving many GOP lawmakers scrambling to accede to his demands.

The shutdown followed a day of posturing and unsuccessful negotiations in the Senate on Friday.

After meeting with Trump at the White House, McConnell called a vote aimed at advancing the bill with $5.7 billion for the border wall, saying the legislation would not be considered controversial in more normal times.

""I'm proud to vote for it,"" McConnell said.

But after hours of maneuvering, it became clear that the legislation would not command the support needed to pass, although the Senate advanced it on a procedural vote - with Pence breaking a tie - to keep a legislative vehicle alive in case a deal does emerge.

Trump, meanwhile, ratcheted up public pressure on Democrats to cave on the wall.

In a spate of morning Twitter posts, Trump sought to pin blame on Democrats for a potential shutdown, even though he said last week that he would accept responsibility for a shutdown.

But Democrats showed no signs of relenting, and on Friday night, they continued to blame Trump and the Republicans for the partial shutdown.

""I think we ought to make it clear that it's the president's abrupt change in position and refusal to accept the deal he's already told his leadership he'd accept,"" said Sen. Christopher Coons, D-Del.

""Look, this is the last week we have a Republican-controlled Senate and House and White House - they've got to work this out."""

President Donald Trump is fighting for U.S. citizens and seeking to prevent further needless deaths at the hands of illegal immigrants by enforcing immigration laws and pushing for a border wall.

But the Democrats' new talking point -- as well as many members of the mainstream media's -- is calling the illegal immigration and border crisis a ""manufactured crisis"" that the GOP designed to force the funding of Trump's border wall.

The Ohio Jobs and Justice PAC (OJJPAC) released a list of victims illegal immigrants killed in the U.S. with descriptions of the crimes and pictures of the victims, showing that these deaths were not manufactured in the slightest.

Trump delivered his first Oval Office address on Tuesday evening, which the major TV networks carried during prime time. The address occurred amid a partial government shutdown, which resulted from Democrats' refusal to give Trump the $5 billion in border wall funding he has demanded.

The president asked Democrats to join Republicans in combatting the ""growing humanitarian and security crisis at our southern border.""

Trump asked the congressional Democrats, ""How much more American blood must we shed before Congress does its job?""

""Over the years, thousands of Americans have been brutally killed by those who illegally entered our country, and thousands more lives will be lost if we don't act right now,"" Trump warned.

But Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) are still refusing to budge on border wall funding and refuse to see the need for a wall.

The parents of Pierce Corcoran (pictured above), a 22-year-old Tennessean who died after an illegal immigrant struck him by swerving into oncoming traffic, told Fox News host Laura Ingraham Thursday on ""The Ingraham Angle"" that they were outraged at Democrats for calling the border crisis ""manufactured.""

""It's real. And it really ticks me off when I see Pelosi acting like a three-year-old and saying that it's fabricated,"" D.J. Corcoran said. ""[Pierce] is dead. His death is real ... It's not fabricated. And he died at the hands of an illegal immigrant.""

Wendy Corcoran said Democrats ""just don't get that someone has died at the hands of someone else that shouldn't have been here,"" adding that ""our government has failed us.""

OJJPAC included Pierce Corcoran's picture at the top of its list of victims.

""These deaths could have been prevented if Congress and Executive branch would have secured our border and enforced U.S. immigration laws,"" OJJPAC founder Steve Salvi said in a statement with the list.

WASHINGTON (AP) -- The White House on Sunday pushed the federal government closer to the brink of a partial shutdown later this week, digging in on its demand for $5 billion to build a border wall as congressional Democrats stood firm against it.

""We're going to do whatever is necessary to build the border wall to stop this ongoing crisis of illegal immigration,"" said White House senior adviser Stephen Miller.

Asked if that meant having a government shutdown, he said: ""If it comes to it, absolutely.""

Trump said last week he would be ""proud"" to have a shutdown to get Congress to approve a $5 billion down payment to fulfill his campaign promise to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. But the president doesn't have the votes from the Republican-controlled Congress to support funding for the wall at that level.

Democratic congressional leaders, Sen. Chuck Schumer and Rep. Nancy Pelosi, have proposed no more than $1.6 billion, as outlined in a bipartisan Senate bill. The money would not go for the wall but for fencing upgrades and other border security. Democrats also offered to simply keep funding at its current level, $1.3 billion.

Trump lawyer Giuliani rules out Mueller interview with Trump

WASHINGTON (AP) -- With a number of probes moving closer to the Oval Office, President Donald Trump and his attorney unleashed a fresh series of attacks on the investigators, questioning their integrity while categorically ruling out the possibility of a presidential interview with the special counsel.

Trump and Rudy Giuliani used Twitter and television interviews Sunday to deliver a series of broadsides against special counsel Robert Mueller and federal prosecutors in New York. Giuliani said he was ""disgusted"" by the tactics used by Mueller in his probe into Russian election interference, including in securing guilty pleas from the president's former national security adviser Michael Flynn on a charge of lying to federal investigators.

Trump, Giuliani said, would not submit to an interview by Mueller's team.

""They're a joke,"" Giuliani told ""Fox News Sunday."" ''Over my dead body, but, you know, I could be dead.""

The special counsel, who is investigating possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russia, has continued to request an interview with the president. Last month, the White House sent written answers in response to the special counsel's questions about possible collusion. The White House has resisted answering questions on possible obstruction of justice.

Shortly before a 7-year-old Guatemalan girl died in U.S. custody, her father signed a form stating that his daughter was in good health. But it's unclear how much the man understood on the form, which was written in English and read to him in Spanish by Border Patrol agents.

The death of Jakelin Caal highlights the communication challenges along the U.S.-Mexico border as agents come in contact with an increasing number of migrants who speak neither English nor Spanish.

Her father's native language is the Mayan tongue known as Q'eqchi'. His second language is Spanish. It's unclear whether something was lost in translation or whether it would have made a difference in saving Jakelin after the two were detained and underwent a health screening along a remote stretch of U.S.-Mexico border. But the case raises questions about the Border Patrol's use of English-only forms.

All agents are required to speak Spanish, and they receive formal Spanish training. Reading forms in Spanish is often enough to pose basic questions. But some other Spanish-speaking migrants reported signing paperwork that they later said they did not understand.

Scores of immigrant parents who were separated from their children after crossing the border in the spring said they signed forms agreeing to be deported with the understanding that their kids would be returning with them, only to find themselves deported without them. Many had to wait months before being reunited with them in their homelands.

Talks adopt 'rulebook' to put Paris climate deal into action

KATOWICE, Poland (AP) -- Almost 200 nations, including the world's top greenhouse gas producers, China and the United States, have adopted a set of rules meant to breathe life into the 2015 Paris climate accord by setting out how countries should report their emissions and efforts to reduce them.

But negotiators delayed other key decisions until next year -- a move that frustrated environmentalists and countries that wanted more ambitious goals in light of scientists' warnings that the world must shift sharply away from fossil fuels in the coming decade.

""The majority of the rulebook for the Paris agreement has been created, which is something to be thankful for,"" said Mohamed Adow, a climate policy expert at Christian Aid. ""But the fact countries had to be dragged kicking and screaming to the finish line shows that some nations have not woken up"" to the dire consequences of global warming as outlined in a report by the U.N Panel on Climate Change, or IPCC.

Officials at the talks, which ended late Saturday in the Polish city of Katowice, agreed upon universal rules on how nations can cut emissions. Poor countries secured assurances on financial support to help them reduce emissions, adapt to changes such as rising sea levels and pay for damage that has already happened.

""Through this package, you have made a thousand little steps forward together,"" said Michal Kurtyka, a senior Polish official who led the talks.

French city honors victims of Christmas market attack

PARIS (AP) -- People filled a square in the French city of Strasbourg on Sunday to show respect and sympathy for the victims of last week's shooting attack near a famous Christmas market as the death toll rose to five.

French authorities said a Polish man died in a Strasbourg hospital Sunday, one of a dozen people wounded in last Tuesday's attack. Poland's Foreign Ministry extended condolences Sunday on Twitter to his family.

According to the newspaper DNA, more than 1,000 people attended the memorial, which ended with a minute of applause and a rendition of France's national anthem, ""La Marseillaise.""

The hour-long ceremony took place in Kleber Square, not far from where a gunman opened fire on Tuesday evening. Strasbourg Mayor Roland Ries praised the city's resilience in the face of hardship.

The ""extremely large crowd in the Christmas market"" on Saturday ""was an illustration of our commitment to these values ??on which our living together is based, which we will continue to defend against all those who want to attack it,"" Ries said.

Not into bingo, 84-year-old Texas woman gets college degree

RICHARDSON, Texas (AP) -- After raising five kids and retiring at age 77 from her secretarial job, Janet Fein couldn't be blamed for finally relaxing, but that's not her.

Fein, now 84, went to back to school and will accomplish a long-held goal this week when she graduates from the University of Texas at Dallas with a bachelor's degree.

""I didn't have anything to do in retirement and I didn't think that playing bingo was up to my speed,"" said Fein, who majored in sociology because she felt it was ""substantial.""

She said she enjoyed all the reading and writing papers. ""With each class I already knew a lot, but then I also learned a lot. And that made me happy,"" she said.

People 65 and older make up less than one percent of U.S. college students. In 2015, they accounted for about 67,000 of about 20 million college students, according to the National Center for Education Statistics.

Next-generation of GPS satellites are headed to space

DENVER (AP) -- After months of delays, the U.S. Air Force is about to launch the first of a new generation of GPS satellites, designed to be more accurate, secure and versatile.

But some of their most highly touted features will not be fully available until 2022 or later because of problems in a companion program to develop a new ground control system for the satellites, government auditors said.

The satellite is scheduled to lift off Tuesday from Cape Canaveral, Florida, aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. It's the first of 32 planned GPS III satellites that will replace older ones now in orbit. Lockheed Martin is building the new satellites outside Denver.

GPS is best-known for its widespread civilian applications, from navigation to time-stamping bank transactions. The Air Force estimates that 4 billion people worldwide use the system.

But it was developed by the U.S. military, which still designs, launches and operates the system. The Air Force controls a constellation of 31 GPS satellites from a high-security complex at Schriever Air Force Base outside Colorado Springs.

After fraud probe, new primary may replace GOP candidate

RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- Legislation quickly passed by North Carolina's lawmakers this week would prepare a path for Republicans to dump their nominee in a still-undecided U.S. House race marred with ballot fraud allegations.

""I think (legislators are) worried that Mark Harris might be damaged goods and they want to have the opportunity to have a different Republican nominee,"" said Carter Wrenn, a Republican operative and consultant to former U.S. Sen. Jesse Helms and others for more than 40 years. ""That's how I read those tea leaves.""

If the state elections board decides ballot irregularities or other problems cast the true outcome into doubt and force a redo, the legislation -- if allowed to go into law by Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper -- would require new primary elections in the 9th Congressional District race, in addition to a new general election.

That would allow Republicans another look at Mark Harris, the Republican who led Democrat Dan McCready by 905 votes in unofficial results. Harris hasn't been certified the winner, and an investigation is looking into missing absentee ballots in rural Bladen County and whether unsealed ballots illegally handled by collection teams there could have been altered.

Bladen was the only county among the eight within the 9th District where Harris won a majority of mail-in absentee ballots over McCready.

Top of mind: 'Justice' is Merriam-Webster's word of the year

NEW YORK (AP) -- Racial justice. Obstruction of justice. Social justice. The Justice Department. Merriam-Webster has chosen ""justice"" as its 2018 word of the year, driven by the churning news cycle over months and months.

The word follows ""toxic,"" picked by Oxford Dictionaries, and ""misinformation,"" plucked by Dictonary.com.

Peter Sokolowski, Merriam-Webster's editor at large, told The Associated Press ahead of Monday's announcement that ""justice"" consistently bubbled into the top 20 or 30 lookups on the company's website, spiking at times due to specific events but also skating close to the surface for much of the year.

While it's one of those common words people likely know how to spell and use correctly in a sentence, Sokolowski pointed to other reasons that drive search traffic. Among them is an attempt to focus a train of thought around a philosophical problem, or to seek aspirational motivation. Such well-known words are often among the most looked up every year, including those that are slightly abstract, including ""love,"" he said.

The designation for ""justice"" came soon after President Trump's one-time fixer, Michael Cohen, was sentenced to three years in prison for crimes that included arranging the payment of hush money to conceal his boss' alleged sexual affairs. He told a judge he agreed time and again to cover up Trump's ""dirty deeds"" out of ""blind loyalty.""

'Spider-Verse' swings to the top; 'Mortal Engines' tanks

LOS ANGELES (AP) -- ""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse"" swung to the top of the domestic box office in its first weekend in theaters, proving that there is widespread audience interest in big screen animated versions of Marvel's marquee superheroes.

The film led a host of newcomers that debuted to varying success on this pre-Christmas holiday weekend, including Clint Eastwood's drug smuggling drama ""The Mule"" and the Peter Jackson-produced epic ""Mortal Engines"" which bombed in North American theaters.

""Into the Spider-Verse"" earned an estimated $35.4 million from 3,813 theaters against a $90 million production budget according to Sony Pictures on Sunday, which is a record for animated movies in December (although the hybrid ""Alvin and the Chipmunks"" movies were higher). The film features an innovative animation style -- both CGI and hand-drawn -- and focuses on the Miles Morales character as he learns to become the famed web-slinger. It's another financial win for the studio's latest ""expanded Spider-Man universe"" strategy following ""Venom"" and ""Spider-Man: Homecoming.""

And ""Spider-Verse"" has been very well-received among critics, and audiences in exit surveys gave it a rare A+ CinemaScore -- a first for a Spider-Man film. It's also been nominated for a Golden Globe award for best animated feature and picked up a few honors from critics' groups as well, including the New York Film Critics Circle.

""We are playing to both families and fanboys. We're an all-audience film,"" said Adrian Smith, Sony's president of domestic distribution."
424,wjbc,http://www.wjbc.com/news/trumps-washington-faces-one-last-week-of-uproar-in-2018/,"A frenzied year in Washington is going out with a roar as the political forces that combined to make the first half of President Donald Trump's mandate so turbulent come to a head in a hugely consequential run-up to the holidays.

Looming over everything is the new reality, fueled by weeks of court filings by special counsel Robert Mueller and other prosecutors, that every corner of Trump's public life is now under investigation: his White House, his campaign, his presidential transition, his inaugural committee, his businesses.

The President's sense of persecution prompted a rage-filled Twitter outburst on Sunday that also appeared to reflect concern about cooperation agreements secured by Mueller with his longtime personal attorney and fixer Michael Cohen and former national security adviser Michael Flynn.

""The Russian Witch Hunt Hoax, started as the 'insurance policy' long before I even got elected, is very bad for our Country,"" Trump tweeted.

""They are Entrapping people for misstatements, lies or unrelated things that took place many years ago. Nothing to do with Collusion. A Democrat Scam!""

Trump's tweet ignored the fact that the legality of the Mueller probe has been upheld in court on several occasions and that it has secured a number of convictions and is opening a window into the President's own behavior in its prosecutions of his associates.

Former FBI Director James Comey, whom Trump fired, laid into the President in his own tweet Sunday, dismissing the President's claim on Twitter that the bureau's raid against Cohen this year was illegal.

""This is from the President of our country, lying about the lawful execution of a search warrant issued by a federal judge. Shame on Republicans who don't speak up at this moment -- for the FBI, the rule of law, and the truth,"" Comey wrote.

As a new week dawns, the capital is on edge to see whether Mueller has any more dramatic cards to play before the turn of the year. One event that may further irritate the President is Tuesday's sentencing hearing for Flynn, who admitted lying to the FBI.

But the Russia investigation is only one element in a complex set of political dramas that are playing out before Washington breaks for the Christmas and New Year recess.

An impasse over Trump's border wall could shutter parts of the government by the end of the week -- the latest battle in the war over immigration that has rocked American politics for more than a decade.

Yet another Cabinet member, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, is going home trailed by scandal, in another rebuke to the idea that the Trump administration was ever about draining the swamp.

A fresh staff shakeup is playing out in the West Wing, but experience suggests that new acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney will fare no better than his predecessors in imposing order on a President who defies management.

Obamacare is having another brush with extinction in the courts, just as the Republican House majority built on a vow to overturn the law limps out of town.

And the Democratic majority that will take over the House next year is already flexing its muscles after an extraordinary televised showdown between the party's top brass and Trump last week offered a preview of skirmishes to come.

The President's biggest, indisputable success is the motoring economy and historically low unemployment. But there are growing fears after several volatile weeks that a slowdown is looming, given ebbing global growth, a trade war with China and churning market volatility.

White House 'absolutely' ready for a shutdown

The possibility of a partial shutdown when funding runs out for several key departments at the end of the week appeared to rise on Sunday, with the White House and top Democrats hunkering down over Trump's demand for $5 billion in border wall funding.

""We're going to do whatever is necessary to build the border wall to stop this ongoing crisis of illegal immigration,"" White House senior policy adviser Stephen Miller said on CBS's ""Face the Nation.""

Asked whether that meant forcing a shutdown to extract the funds from Congress on an issue that was foundational to Trump's presidential campaign, Miller replied, ""If it comes to it, absolutely.""

But Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said Trump will not get what he wants.

""President Trump should understand, there are not the votes for the wall. In the House or the Senate, he is not going to get the wall in any form,"" Schumer said on NBC's ""Meet the Press.""

Signs that the gap between the White House and Democrats is deepening raise the possibility that the showdown, if it does shutter government, could develop into the first big clash between the new Congress and the White House in January.

New trouble for Obamacare

Americans who rely on the Affordable Care Act got a surprise lump of coal late on Friday night when a federal judge in Texas ruled that the entire law was unconstitutional.

The move set off a fresh duel over the centerpiece of Barack Obama's domestic agenda that has so far defied all GOP attempts to kill it off.

Immediate legal opinion -- even from some conservatives -- suggested that the sweeping ruling could end up being overturned, though there is a chance the fight over Obamacare's fate could end up yet again in the Supreme Court in a test of the new conservative majority.

The decision reignited the political wars over health care that Democrats believe played a significant role in their surge to victory in the House in the midterm elections. If that is the case, the Obamacare ruling, paradoxically, may not be good news for the GOP.

But Trump welcomed the latest threat to his predecessor's legacy.

""I believe we're going to get really good health care. Exciting things happened over the last 24 hours,"" Trump said at a congressional ball at the White House on Saturday night. Typically though, he gave few details of his vague plans to provide a better alternative to Obamacare, which now looks likely to be a key issue in yet another national election cycle.

Swamp creatures

Trump enters another week looking for another new Cabinet member after announcing the resignation of Zinke, who was facing multiple ethics probes and was a top oversight target of the new Democratic House.

The New York Times and Washington Post also reported that Zinke might have been fired if he failed to quit by the end of the year.

Possible replacements include Deputy Interior Secretary David Bernhardt and Nevada Republican Sen. Dean Heller, who lost his re-election race, sources with knowledge of the situation said.

Mulvaney, meanwhile, is gearing up to take on the daunting task of being Trump's third chief of staff. Given the failure of his two predecessors, Reince Priebus and John Kelly, to rein in a President who trusts his gut above all, there are few expectations that Mulvaney will calm an often erratic White House and impose discipline, as many predecessors did in other administrations.

""He's the chief of staff, not chief of the President, right? That's an important distinction,"" David Urban, the political strategist who masterminded Trump's 2016 victory in Pennsylvania, said on CNN's ""State of the Union.""

Still, Mulvaney appears to have a trusting relationship with the President, following his tenure as his budget chief. And his knowledge of Capitol Hill, gained as a former member of the House, will be an asset as the White House seeks to outmaneuver would-be Speaker Nancy Pelosi and her troops next year.

Russia to overshadow Trump's Christmas

Trump heads into a Christmas break at his Mar-a-Lago resort this week in a position of increasing political and legal vulnerability after weeks of devastating revelations and court filings related to the Russia investigation.

The President has been implicated by New York prosecutors overseen by his own Justice Department in directing criminal attempts to subvert campaign finance laws alongside Cohen, whose case was referred by Mueller.

Cooperation by Cohen and Flynn is helping Mueller take his investigation deep into the President's inner circle. He has now uncovered multiple contacts between Trump associates and Russians during the time of Moscow's election meddling effort and repeated lying about those encounters.

Speculation is frenzied about one mysterious scene on Friday in which an entire floor of the federal courthouse in Washington was locked down over a mystery subpoena appeal involving the special counsel's team.

Things are certain to become more uncomfortable for Trump in the new year. Maryland Democratic Rep. Elijah Cummings, who is expected to take over the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, said on ""State of the Union"" that he would seek to secure testimony from Cohen before the President's former fixer reports to prison in March.

There were also worrying signs for Trump in a new NBC/Wall Street Journal poll that found that 62% of respondents believe the President has not been truthful about the Russia investigation.

Since his approval rating was 43% in the survey however, it seems that a portion of those Republicans who are uneasy about the President's attitude toward Mueller still don't see it as a deal breaker for their faith in him."
425,houston chronicle,https://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/politics/texas/article/Trump-plan-to-tap-Army-Corps-funds-for-wall-hits-13527841.php,"WASHINGTON -

While details of the proposal remained unclear, lawmakers in both parties scrambled to win assurances from the White House and allay concerns about projects in the Gulf Region, including a proposed coastal barrier to protect Galveston Bay and the Houston Ship Channel.

Reports that President Donald Trump has been briefed on a plan to use unspent money from Army Corps of Engineers projects heightened tensions in Congress about his threat to use emergency powers to build hundreds of miles of barriers along the U.S.-Mexico border, much of it in the Rio Grande Valley.

The controversy also highlighted long-standing concerns about the slow pace at which Washington has released emergency disaster funds to Texas since Hurricane Harvey in 2017.

A White House spokesman declined to confirm details of the plan Friday as the nation lurched into the third week of a partial government shutdown in a budget fight over Trump's long-promised border wall.

Trump, speaking at a White House roundtable on border security Friday, maintained he has the right to declare a national emergency to build the wall, but did not say when he might.

""I'm not going to do it so fast,"" Trump said, adding that Democrats in Congress ""should come back and vote"" for the $5.7 billion in wall funds he has requested for 2019. ""We want Congress to do its job. What we're not looking to do right now is a national emergency.""

While Texas Republicans have largely backed the president in his standoff with Democratic leaders in Congress, some have balked at the prospect of siphoning money from military construction or emergency disaster projects.

""I will oppose any reprogramming of Harvey disaster funds,"" Texas U.S. Sen. John Cornyn, a top Senate Republican, said Friday in Austin. ""We worked very hard to make sure that the victims of Hurricane Harvey, their concerns are addressed and Texas is able to rebuild. And I think we are all together on that.""

Cornyn, who opposes declaring a national emergency, said he talked to the White House, along with Gov. Greg Abbott, Lt. Gov. Dan Patrick and members of the Texas congressional delegation. ""We are all unified in that position,"" he said.

Confusion still reigned in Congress Friday about the president's intentions. While Democrats raised alarms about losing flood control and other disaster recovery funds in Texas, Puerto Rico and other storm-hit zones, Republicans sought to minimize those concerns - at least in Texas.

""I don't think we're going to see that money jeopardized in any way,"" Republican Texas Sen. Ted Cruz said of Hurricane Harvey relief funding.

U.S. Rep. Kevin Brady, a top House Republican from The Woodlands, took to Twitter to push back against media reports that the administration might be eyeing money earmarked for Army Corps projects in the Houston area.

""I've spoken directly with the White House. Absolutely not true,"" Brady tweeted. ""@realDonaldTrump committed to border security/ will not back down until adequate $$ are secured. Fully supports Corps funding to help Harvey communities rebuild/prevent future flooding.""

Other Texas Republicans were less definitive about the administration's plans.

Freshman Houston Republican Dan Crenshaw said he met with Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney Friday and voiced his concern about how this move would affect his district. He said only that the White House shared his concerns.

""I've made it clear to the Administration that not one penny can be spared when it comes to Harvey relief funding, a point to which they were very sympathetic,"" Crenshaw said.

Democrats raise alarm

Democrat Lizzie Pannill Fletcher, who won a historically Republican House seat in Houston in November, said it should not even be an option for the White House to build a disputed border wall with needed storm protection dollars.

""Congress appropriated these funds specifically to help this community rebuild after Hurricane Harvey,"" said Fletcher, who made flood control projects a mainstay of her campaign against Republican incumbent John Culberson. ""Even the suggestion that these Harvey recovery funds be diverted for any other purpose is unacceptable.""

Houston Democrat Sheila Jackson Lee called the proposal ""outrageous and immoral, and an affront to the millions of Americans affected by real disasters that have struck the homeland.""

Also among those expressing concern was Sugar Land Republican Pete Olson, a Trump ally.

""I reiterate my support for protecting America along our southern border,"" Olson said. ""However, recent reports have indicated flood control disaster relief funds - including those for Harvey recovery - could be tapped to fund construction of a wall. I strongly object to this proposal.""

Olson noted that Harvey was the third consecutive year of historic flooding for Houston and the second hurricane to make landfall in the region in the last ten years.

""Our region simply cannot delay construction of desperately needed flood control projects any longer. America is a strong nation that must properly secure our border without sacrificing the safety and security of the millions of Americans living along the Gulf Coast,"" Olson said.

Some media reports have suggested that Trump was briefed about the plan during his flight Thursday to the southern border city of McAllen. One option reportedly contemplates taking some of the unspent $13.9 billion that Congress approved last year for civil works projects around the U.S. and Puerto Rico.

Administration sources have been quoted anonymously saying that using Army Corps money is ""definitely an option,"" though nothing has been finalized.

Among the ongoing Army Corps projects in Houston are improvements to the aging Addicks and Barker Reservoirs, which were designed to prevent downstream flooding. In danger of spilling over during Hurricane Harvey, they were opened to release water, flooding Buffalo Bayou.

Some regional officials also have expressed concern about future of Army Corps funds for the long-sought ""Ike Dike"" - a 70-mile-long coastal barrier to protect the coastline around Galveston Bay against storm surges. The most recent version of the plan - now under study - carries a price tag of as much as $31 billion.

A spokeswoman for U.S. Rep. Randy Weber, a Republican whose district extends to Galveston, said the impact of the president's plan remains uncertain. ""With the fluid nature of things, we can't speak to the hypothetical situation in which Army Corps funds would be used,"" said the spokeswoman, Emma Polefko.

Is Trump targeting backlogged funding?

Ike Dike proponent Michel Bechtel, the mayor of the Morgan's Point, a Harris County city on Galveston Bay, said that he had only seen media reports of Trump's plan. ""I don't know what's real and what's not real,"" he said.

Bechtel discounted fears of losing coastal barrier funding which Congress has yet to approve. ""There's nothing there for them to take away from,"" he said. ""There's no money there.""

But Bechtel, a leader in the Ike Dike project as president of the Harris County Mayors and Councils Association, noted that during negotiations over a 2017 federal water resources bill the administration sought to take back an estimated $4 billion for backlogged civic works projects that Congress had authorized more than ten years ago but which were never started.

On top of the $1.3 billion Democrats have agreed to allocate for border security, that would almost satisfy Trump's total border wall request.

""That may indeed be what they're talking about,"" Bechtel said. ""We haven't seen anything as far as any current projects that have been approved where they're calling back the money. So there may be a lot of confusion about that.""

Whether or not Trump goes through with some type of emergency plan to fund the wall - a move that Democrats have vowed to fight in court - the prospect of taking storm protection monies has renewed criticism of the administration's response to Hurricane Harvey.

Texas officials, who were allocated nearly $5 billion last year by Congress for disaster mitigation, complained earlier this month about bureaucratic logjams.

""We cannot afford to wait any longer,"" Texas Land Commissioner George P. Bush wrote in a letter to Mulvaney. ""Please approve these rules for publication as soon as possible so we can get started on construction of vital infrastructure projects to protect Texans from the type of damage caused by Hurricane Harvey."""
426,the fresno bee,https://www.fresnobee.com/news/business/article223342450.html,"Excerpts from recent editorials in the United States and abroad:

The New York Times on a judge's rebuke of Michael Flynn and President Donald Trump's charitable foundation:

A bit of common sense and common decency intruded on Tuesday into the crazy world of Donald Trump.

In New York, the state attorney general announced that the president had agreed that the ""charity"" he used as a piggy bank has no reason to exist.

In Washington, a federal judge let a former top presidential aide know that you can parrot political spin or you can tell the truth, but you can't do both to someone who can send you to prison.

Michael Flynn, Mr. Trump's former national security adviser, appeared before Judge Emmet Sullivan to be sentenced to what he expected would be a term of probation, after pleading guilty to lying to federal investigators about conversations with the Russian ambassador. The office of the special counsel, Robert Mueller, had earlier filed a memo that said it would be right for Mr. Flynn to avoid prison after his extensive cooperation in the investigation of Trump ties to Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential campaign and after.

Then last week, in a memo about their client's sentencing, Mr. Flynn's lawyers implied that he had been tricked into lying and that the F.B.I. acted improperly in interviewing him -- points raised by pro-Trump commentators elaborating on the president's claims of being victimized by a witch hunt.

Judge Sullivan was having none of it.

""I cannot recall an instance of a court ever accepting a guilty plea from someone who did not maintain he was guilty,"" Judge Sullivan said, ""and I do not intend to start today.""

Chastened, Mr. Flynn told the judge that nobody tricked him, that he lied and that he knew he shouldn't have.

The judge was not upset only about Mr. Flynn's sneaky prevarication. He said he felt ""disgust"" at Mr. Flynn's offenses, that a retired three-star general would lie to the F.B.I. ""while on the physical premises of the White House,"" and, acting as an unregistered agent of a foreign country, Turkey, while he was an adviser to Mr. Trump (to which he admitted but was not charged). It was a bracing reminder of the brazenness of his misdeeds and of the standards the public should be able to expect of those who serve them.

Realizing that Judge Sullivan was considering a term of up to six months in prison, Mr. Flynn accepted his offer to delay the sentencing for 90 days until he has completed his cooperation with the special counsel.

""Good luck today in court to General Michael Flynn,"" Mr. Trump had tweeted first thing Tuesday morning.

""Thanks for nothing, Mr. President,"" Mr. Flynn might have thought as he left court.

Mr. Flynn should be grateful the judge offered him the chance to come clean. By contrast, the Donald J. Trump Foundation, a charity that provided no charity, quite properly received none from the New York attorney general's office.

Attorney General Barbara Underwood accused it of ""a shocking pattern of illegality"" that ""amounted to the Trump Foundation functioning as little more than a checkbook to serve Mr. Trump's business and political interests.""

Whatever money that remains will be disbursed under the supervision of Ms. Underwood's office and the judge overseeing the continuing lawsuit her office filed in June, seeking $2.8 million in restitution and a ban on Mr. Trump and his three oldest children serving on the boards of other nonprofit organizations.

In a series of stories exposing the foundation's true nature, The Washington Post found that its largest donation was to fix a fountain in front of the Plaza Hotel in Manhattan, which Mr. Trump owned at the time, that its funds were used to buy a portrait of Mr. Trump, and that it illegally provided political donations and paid for personal legal settlements.

All this comes just days after prosecutors announced that they believed that Mr. Trump had conspired with the owner of The National Enquirer and his fixer Michael Cohen to violate campaign finance laws by paying hush money to two women who said they had affairs with him. It's also just been reported that prosecutors are investigating spending by the Trump inaugural committee. The president still faces lawsuits on the constitutionality of his enriching himself while in office. Meanwhile, the special counsel's inquiry may be expanding rather than winding down.

It's fitting that despite all his bluster and threats, a president who's demonstrated such contempt for the rule of law is finding it so formidable.

That this goes to the essence of American governance was best summed up by Paula Duncan, the Trump enthusiast who was among the jurors who found Mr. Trump's former campaign chief Paul Manafort guilty of fraud, even though she had hoped he wouldn't be convicted.

Explaining her decision after the verdict, she told Fox News, ""No one's above the law.""

The Wall Street Journal on a judge's ruling on the Affordable Care Act's individual mandate:

No one opposes ObamaCare more than we do, and Democrats are now confirming that it was designed as a way-station to government-run health care. But a federal judge's ruling that the law is unconstitutional is likely to be overturned on appeal and may boomerang politically on Republicans.

Judge Reed O'Connor ruled for some 20 state plaintiffs that the Affordable Care Act's individual mandate is no longer legal because Republicans repealed its financial penalty as part of the 2017 tax reform. Recall that Chief Justice John Roberts joined four Justices to say ObamaCare's mandate was illegal as a command to individuals to buy insurance under the Commerce Clause. ""The Framers gave Congress the power to regulate commerce, not to compel it,"" he wrote.

Yet the Chief famously salvaged ObamaCare by unilaterally rewriting the mandate to be a ""tax"" that was within Congress's power. Never mind that Democrats had expressly said the penalty was not a tax. Majority Leader Roberts declared it to be so.

Enter Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, who argues in Texas v. U.S. that since Congress has repealed the mandate, the tax is no longer a tax, and ObamaCare is thus illegal. Judge O'Connor agreed with that logic, and he went further in ruling that since Congress said the mandate is crucial to the structure of ObamaCare, then all of ObamaCare must fall along with the mandate.

We'll admit to a certain satisfaction in seeing the Chief Justice hoist on his own logic. But his ruling in NFIB v. Sebelius was in 2012 and there is more at issue legally now than the ""tax"" issue in that opinion. One legal complication is that Congress in 2017 repealed the financial part of the individual mandate, not the structure of the mandate itself. Republicans used budget rules to pass tax reform so they couldn't repeal the mandate's express language.

The Affordable Care Act has also been up and running since 2014, which means so-called reliance interests come into play when considering a precedent. Millions of people now rely on ObamaCare's subsidies and rules, which argues against judges repealing the law by fiat.

Judge O'Connor breezes past this like a liberal Ninth Circuit appeals judge handling a Donald Trump appeal. He's right that Democrats claimed the individual mandate was essential to the Affordable Care Act. But when Congress killed the financial penalty in 2017 it left the rest of ObamaCare intact. When judging congressional intent, a judge must account for the amending Congress as well as the original Congress.

In any case, the Supreme Court's ""severability"" doctrine calls for restraint in declaring an entire law illegal merely because one part of it is. Our guess is that even the right-leaning Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals judges will overturn Judge O'Connor on this point.

As for the politics, Democrats claim to be alarmed by the ruling but the truth is they're elated. They want to use it to further pound Republicans for denying health insurance for pre-existing conditions if the law is overturned. Democrats campaigned across the country against Mr. Paxton's lawsuit to gain House and Senate seats in November, and they will now press votes in Congress so they can compound the gains in 2020.

President Trump hailed the ruling in a tweet, but he has never understood the Affordable Care Act. His Administration has done good work revising regulations to reduce health-care costs and increase access, but the risk is that the lawsuit will cause Republicans in Congress to panic politically and strike a deal with Democrats that reinforces ObamaCare. This is what happens when conservatives fall into the liberal trap of thinking they can use the courts to achieve policy goals that need to be won in Congress.

The Washington Post on withdrawing all 2,000 U.S. troops out of Syria:

PRESIDENT TRUMP'S sudden move to yank U.S. troops out of Syria undermined at a stroke several foreign policy goals he has championed. The president promised to finish the job of destroying the Islamic State, but the withdrawal will leave thousands of its fighters still in place. He vowed to roll back Iran's aggression across the Middle East, but his decision will allow its forces to entrench in the country that is the keystone of Tehran's ambitions. He promised to protect Israel, but that nation will now be left to face alone the buildup by Iran and its proxies along its northern border.

The president's top national security advisers had carefully developed and articulated a strategy of maintaining a U.S. presence in Syria until the Islamic State was beyond revival and Iran withdrew its forces -- a plan they were defending up until this week. Mr. Trump has again demonstrated, to them and to the world, that no U.S. policy or foreign commitment is immune from his whims.

Mr. Trump claimed the Islamic State had been defeated, but that is not the view of the Defense and State Departments. Thousands of jihadist fighters are still in Syria and control splotches of territory in the Euphrates Valley. A U.S. withdrawal will give the extremists an opportunity to reconstitute, as they did in Iraq following the premature U.S. withdrawal ordered by President Barack Obama.

Until Wednesday, a prime talking point of senior national security officials was that, ""if we've learned one thing over the years, (the) enduring defeat of a group like this means you can't just defeat their physical space and then leave,"" as the State Department's special envoy for the global campaign against the Islamic State, Brett McGurk, put it last week. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said it another way in September: ""Getting rid of the caliphate doesn't mean you then blindly say, 'Okay, we got rid of it,' march out, and then wonder why the caliphate comes back.""

Mr. Trump has justified some of his most controversial decisions, including his continued support for Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, as needed to contain Iran's threat to the United States and its allies. But the Syrian withdrawal hands Tehran and its ally Russia a windfall. Iran has deployed thousands of fighters and allied militiamen to Syria and aspires to create a corridor to Lebanon and the Mediterranean, as well as a new front against Israel along the Golan Heights. In reaction to that threat, Mr. Trump's national security adviser, John Bolton, announced Sept. 24 that ""We're not going to leave (Syria) as long as Iranian troops are outside Iranian borders, and that includes Iranian proxies and militias.""

U.S. ambitions in Syria have never been backed by adequate resources, and a case could be made that neither Congress nor the American public were prepared to support the mission suggested by Mr. Bolton. But Mr. Trump's decision appears to have been precipitated by the bellicose rhetoric of Turkey's Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who last week threatened -- not for the first time -- a military operation against Syrian Kurds, even though U.S. troops are positioned around them. The autocratic Turkish ruler appears to have extracted multiple favors from Mr. Trump in recent days, including the sale of U.S. Patriot missiles and a promise to reexamine the possible extradition of his rival, Fethullah Gulen, from Pennsylvania. If Mr. Trump received anything in return, he hasn't disclosed it.

The Syrian Kurdish forces, which have fought alongside the United States and played a crucial role in liberating most of eastern Syria from the jihadists, will be perhaps the foremost victims of Mr. Trump's decision. Betrayed by Washington, they will now be subject to a military offensive by Turkey. The stab in the back will send an unforgettable message to all who are asked to cooperate with the United States in the fight against terrorism: Washington is an unreliable and dangerous partner.

The Orange County (California) Register on Mick Mulvaney as Trump's choice for chief of staff:

President Trump has found a new chief of staff, albeit an interim one, in his director of the Office of Management and Budget, Mick Mulvaney.

That of chief is a terribly important post, perhaps government's most consequential aside from that of his boss. In theory, at least, the chief of staff is the gatekeeper for everything the president does, everyone he sees, everyone he talks to on the phone.

Perhaps, though few would expect this to be the case, the arbiter of every time he sends out a tweet, and of what it should say.

A Washington insider, a former congressman, Mulvaney is in many ways ideal for the job. He wants it, badly, whereas others with similarly impressive resumes touted for the job have indicated a strong desire to spend more time with their families, from Vice President Pence's staff chief Nick Ayers of Georgia to former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie.

Mulvaney shares the conservative values currently espoused by the president and was a founder of the House Freedom Caucus in 2013, the group that always taunted the Republican leadership, opposing much government funding, including debt limit increases and budget agreements made with the Democrats.

But he also, after Trump secured the Republican nomination in 2016, called the candidate ""a terrible human being"" who he only was voting for out of an even greater dislike of Hillary Clinton.

It's not as if other presidential allies of today haven't said bad things about him in the past. On the campaign trail, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz called his rival ""a narcissist at a level I don't think this country's ever seen,"" for instance.

But if you were the nation's chief executive -- or the CEO of a much smaller entity, for that matter -- could you hire as your top aide and work with a person who had once dubbed you ""terrible""?

Or does this kind of talk come with the territory in politics, where many strange bedfellows are made because of having to run in elections against once and perhaps future allies? Should Trump indeed elevate this practical choice for staff chief to permanent status immediately?

Los Angeles Times on banning bump stocks, which allow semi-automatic weapons to fire like machine guns:

The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives said Tuesday that it had finalized a rule reclassifying so-called bump stocks -- the devices that can make a semiautomatic rifle fire nearly as quickly a fully automatic weapon -- as machine guns, which makes it illegal to manufacture, sell or possess them. The agency said a year ago it had the authority to reclassify the devices, and President Trump -- in the wake of the Parkland, Fla., school shooting -- directed the ATF to speed up the process. Tuesday's announcement -- a rare bit of welcome news from the Trump administration -- makes it official; White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters that owners of the conversion devices will have until March 21 to destroy them or turn them in to the ATF.

This is a good step. Unfortunately, it's all but certain to be challenged in the courts, and it's on shaky legal ground because of the way the new rule evolved. The Obama administration determined that because bump stocks have ""no automatically functioning mechanical parts and (perform) no automated mechanical functions when installed,"" they did not fit the definition of a machine gun in federal law, which meant the ATF lacked the authority to regulate them. Tuesday's announcement, by contrast, hinges not on the technical specifications, but on the functionality. In essence, if it fires like a machine gun, it's a machine gun. Cue the lawyers.

We hope the administration prevails in whatever challenges emerge, but the sure-fire way to resolve this would be for Congress to legislate bump stocks and related gadgets out of existence. Such devices serve no function other than to evade the strict congressional limit on machine guns by, as the ATF said, harnessing ""the recoil energy of the semiautomatic firearm in a manner that allows the trigger to reset and continue firing"" without the shooter having to pull the trigger for each shot.

A mass shooter in Las Vegas used bump stocks affixed to semiautomatic rifles to fire more than 1,000 rounds in a matter of minutes from a 32nd-floor suite of the Mandalay Bay Hotel into a crowd of some 20,000 people, killing 58 concertgoers and injuring hundreds of others. It was the largest single mass shooting in the modern era, drawing attention to bump stocks and sparking outraged demands by many -- the Los Angeles Times included -- that the devices be banned.

As welcome as this new rule is, it will do little to corral our national problem with gun violence. The vast majority of gun deaths come in ones and twos, led by suicides. ...

But it is progress. And the president deserves credit for sticking with his promise to find a way to ban bump stocks. ...

China Daily says telecommunications giant Huawei is a victim of U.S. panic attacks:

This year has not been an annus mirabilis for China's Huawei Technologies Ltd, the world's largest supplier of telecommunications network equipment and second-biggest maker of smartphones.

Although it has been constantly in the news and it is said there is no such thing as bad publicity, it has been making headlines because of the spurious claims it somehow poses a threat to the West, even world peace. It has never been explained exactly how.

In fact it is not because of anything it has done, but because its success has brought it into the crosshairs of the United States' anxiety attacks against China.

Huawei is at the forefront of 5G technology. This latest generation mobile network technology promises to bring the much anticipated and heralded internet of things to life and the US is determined to be the 5G leader.

Not only because whichever country develops the technology that is adopted as standard will have a huge commercial advantage. But also because by setting the standard it will have a knowledge advantage.

As a result, first the US and then one after another its most obedient allies have blocked Huawei from entering their 5G markets on security grounds.

None of them have offered any specific justification for blocking Huawei. They just repeat their claim that the company poses a security risk. That is why objective observers have concluded that those countries are politicizing a commercial issue.

It sets a harmful precedent. What if other countries used the same excuse to block US companies (not confined to the telecom sector)? The US companies are very competitive in many fields, including those that could pose huge security risks, such as finance.

While Huawei will not go unscathed from being prevented from entering key markets, as a competitive player, it still has a vast market to access in other parts of the world. It has signed contracts to supply 5G equipment to 25 telecom carriers, and more than 10,000 5G base stations have been shipped.

In stark contrast to the US and its allies, India for instance, has invited Huawei to conduct 5G trials in the country and complimented it on the role it has played in helping to develop its telecom industry.

The efforts of the US and its allies to try to shield their companies against a Chinese competitor are politically motivated, not the result of a fact-based or transparent decision-making process. And they are counterproductive to the concerted efforts that are needed to ensure the security of 5G networks."
427,the fresno bee,https://www.fresnobee.com/news/state/california/article223445505.html,"President Trump traveled to the center of California's tragic wildfire on Nov. 17. He toured devastated areas with Gov. Jerry Brown and Gov.-elect Gavin Newsom. By

President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Friday that calls for expanding logging on millions of acres of federal forest lands as part of a plan to reduce wildfire risks.

""For decades, dense trees and undergrowth have amassed in these lands, fueling catastrophic wildfires,"" Trump wrote in the order, released as Congress haggled over funding for Trump's border wall with a government shutdown looming. ""These conditions, along with insect infestation, invasive species, disease, and drought, have weakened our forests, rangelands, and other federal lands, and have placed communities and homes at risk of damage from catastrophic wildfires. Active management of vegetation is needed to treat these dangerous conditions on Federal lands but is often delayed.""

Trump's order calls for easing regulatory burdens that would allow for the harvest of least 3.8 billion board feet of timber from lands managed by the U.S. Forest Service and another 600 million board feet of timber on Bureau of Land Management property.

Those figures represent a substantial increase in timber sales over recent years.

In 2017, the Forest Service harvested more than 2.9 billion board feet of timber, according to a summary the agency released last year. In 2016, the BLM had more than 233.2 million board feet of timber for sale.

Environmental groups blasted Trump's order.

Denise Boggs of the the Northern California environmental group Conservation Congress said it ignored climate change, and didn't address the need to thin areas directly around communities to prevent them from catching fire.

""It won't work, and we know that ... All the fire ecologists are saying the same thing: You can't log your way out of this situation,"" Boggs said. ""Logging in the back country is just a gift to the timber industry.""

Boggs said environmentalists will certainly sue if Trump tries to ramp up logging.

Since taking office, the Trump administration has advocated for more aggressive timber management to boost struggling rural economies and to proactively fight fires. This year, Northern California's devastating Carr and Camp fires became the backdrop as Trump and administration officials made their case.

""We have to do management, maintenance,"" Trump said while touring Camp Fire-scorched Paradise neighborhoods last month. ""We'll be working also with environmental groups. I think everybody's seen the light.""

He cited the ""forest nation"" of Finland, which Trump said spends ""a lot of time raking and cleaning and doing things, and they don't have any problem.""

Touring Redding neighborhoods burned by the Carr Fire this summer, Trump's outgoing Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke blamed ""special interest"" environmentalists for using the courts to block thinning projects that he said would reduce fire risk.

""We have been held hostage by these environmental terrorist groups ... that have refused to allow harvest of timber,"" Zinke earlier told conservative news outlet Breitbart News.

While state officials are less likely to use the word ""logging"" to describe the work, California has vowed to become more aggressive when it comes to forest management.

Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown secured $96 million from the Legislature this year to pay for more forest management projects.

He also signed Senate Bill 901, which attempts to shield electric utilities from certain wildfire costs but also relaxes logging restrictions for larger trees on small parcels of privately owned land.

The new law allocates $1 billion over five years, generated by proceeds from the state's ""cap and trade"" carbon emissions program, to ramp up forest thinning."
428,houston chronicle,https://www.houstonchronicle.com/news/article/8-year-old-migrant-dies-in-US-custody-on-13490262.php,"A Guatemalan child detained by U.S. Customs and Border Patrol died early Tuesday at a hospital in New Mexico, the agency reported.

The unidentified child is the second border-crosser to die in government custody this month. Seven-year-old Jakelin Caal died Dec. 7 of dehydration and shock, less than a day after she was apprehended by border agents.

In the second case, an agent noticed Monday that the child had become ill. The boy and his father were taken to Gerald Champion Regional Medical Center in Alamogordo, N.M, where the boy was diagnosed with a cold, according to a CBP news release.

NO DEAL: Trump vows to keep federal shutdown until wall funding secured

Later, he was found to have a fever and was held for an additional 90 minutes before he was released with prescriptions for an antibiotic and Ibuprofen.

But the child became more seriously ill Monday night, when he vomited, and was taken back to the hospital. He died shortly after midnight on Christmas Day.

The cause of the child's death is not known. An investigation into CBP actions will be conducted, the news release said."
429,northwest arkansas democrat gazette,https://www.nwaonline.com/news/2019/jan/06/sides-give-no-ground-in-huddle-on-stand/,"WASHINGTON -- The government shutdown that has halted paychecks for hundreds of thousands of federal workers began its third week Saturday with no end in sight, as Vice President Mike Pence, top White House officials and senior congressional aides met for more than two hours without reaching a deal to reopen the government.

Inside the meeting at the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, Pence refused to budge from the more than $5 billion President Donald Trump has demanded from Congress to pay for a portion of his promised wall along the U.S.-Mexico border, according to two Democratic officials briefed on the negotiations.

The standoff -- which has heavily affected national parks and other operations and threatens to halt payments as varied as food stamps and tax refunds -- has made Trump's unrealized border wall the linchpin of his presidency as he seeks to make good on a signature campaign promise.

The two sides are scheduled to meet again this afternoon, but there was little hope that the broad divide between Trump and Democrats over his demand for wall funding would be bridged anytime soon. Saturday's talks came a day after Trump said the government shutdown could continue for ""months or even years"" if Democrats did not relent on their steadfast refusal to grant him the wall money.

The White House said funding was not discussed in-depth, but the administration was clear that it needed funding for a wall and that it wanted to resolve the shutdown all at once.

While Trump has stood by his $5.7 billion demand, Senate Democrats have offered $1.3 billion for border security, including fencing, and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California, and the top Senate Democrat, Charles Schumer of New York, have repeatedly said that they will not agree to any wall funding. Pelosi has called a border wall an ""immorality.""

The vice president's office said that Pence had reiterated the president's position that any deal needed to include funding for the wall. The office also said that Democrats had requested additional information from the Department of Homeland Security about its needs to deal with border issues.

Pence was deputized by Trump to oversee Saturday's talks, but he did not have the president's blessing to float new or specific numbers as he did last month in a meeting with Schumer, according to two Trump aides who were not authorized to speak publicly. That meant few specifics were discussed Saturday, as Democratic staff members repeatedly pushed the administration to reopen the federal government and negotiate differences over the border after the shutdown ends.

But the administration -- represented by Pence, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney and senior adviser Jared Kushner -- refused, according to multiple officials.

""Not much headway made today,"" Trump tweeted Saturday afternoon. ""Second meeting set for tomorrow. After so many decades, must finally and permanently fix the problems on the Southern Border!""

Before the meeting began Saturday morning, Trump took a combative tone in several Twitter messages and claimed that news coverage documenting cracks in Republican support for his hard-line position were inaccurate.

""Great support coming from all sides for Border Security (including Wall) on our very dangerous Southern Border,"" Trump tweeted. ""Teams negotiating this weekend! Washington Post and NBC reporting of events, including Fake sources, has been very inaccurate (to put it mildly)!""

Trump spent much of Saturday on the phone with allies, talking through his positioning on the shutdown and hearing their reviews of his Friday news conference in the Rose Garden, according to a person close to him. Two people regularly on his call list -- Rep. Mark Meadows, R-N.C., and Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C. -- have encouraged Trump to hold fast and refuse to agree to reopen the government unless wall funding is secured, the person said.

""I've never seen the president as resolved on any issue as he is on this,"" Meadows said Saturday. ""But he is open to new ideas about how to end the impasse.""

During Saturday's meeting, Democratic aides asked the White House to lay out in formal detail the administration's funding request for the border -- including its specific security requests, what the money would be used for, and what in the Homeland Security budget the administration would cut to make the numbers work, people familiar with the meeting said.

Democrats ""emphasized that it's important for us to have an updated budget request from the White House because they have been all over the map,"" said another official briefed on the discussion. The White House plans to provide those figures before the group meets again this afternoon.

With talks stalled Saturday, Pelosi announced that House Democrats plan to start approving individual bills to reopen shuttered agencies starting with the Treasury Department to ensure Americans receive their tax refunds.

""While President Trump threatens to keep the government shut down for 'years,' Democrats are taking immediate further action to reopen government, so that we can meet the needs of the American people, protect our borders and respect our workers,"" Pelosi said.

Some centrist Republicans on Saturday urged Trump and congressional leaders to reopen the government, reflecting growing unease in their ranks about the prolonged shutdown and the political cost the GOP might pay.

""With Nancy Pelosi as speaker, it's going to have to be a compromise solution,"" Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick, R-Pa., a moderate and former FBI agent who represents the Philadelphia suburbs, said in an interview. ""It's our most basic function as members of Congress to fund the government, and we need to have these battles on immigration and other issues on their own turf, separately.""

A number of Republicans, including Sen. Cory Gardner, R-Colo., have said in recent days that a shutdown is not the ""right answer.""

On Friday, Sen. Thom Tillis, R-N.C., became the third member of his party in the Senate to call for an end to the shutdown, joining Gardner and Sen. Susan Collins of Maine.

In an op-ed article for the newspaper The Hill published Friday evening, Tillis encouraged Congress to strike a deal that would provide ""long-term certainty to the DACA population"" -- the participants in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program who were brought to the United States as children -- and ""force out the extreme elements on either side of the aisle.""

""When it comes to securing our borders, it's important to note that the real solution is not going to be a big, literal physical wall, but rather an all-the-above, all-hands-on-deck approach,"" he wrote, adding his support for solutions including ""physical barriers and steel fences.""

In an interview with NBC's Meet the Press, set to air today, Mulvaney argued that the administration was willing to deal. He said Trump was willing to forgo a concrete wall for steel or other materials.

""If he has to give up a concrete wall, replace it with a steel fence to do that so that Democrats can say, 'See? He's not building a wall anymore,' that should help us move in the right direction,'"" Mulvaney said.

White House senior aides were to depart late Saturday for Camp David for a staff retreat where discussions about policy and priorities for 2019 are to be planned, and the president is expected to join them today. Mulvaney is spearheading the gathering as a way of connecting with his new deputies and colleagues, according to officials.

On Friday, federal agencies were directed to hold off on enacting pay raises for top administration officials during the shutdown.

The guidance was issued in a memo from Margaret Weichert, the acting director of the Office of Personnel Management.

The raises were the result of a pay freeze for top federal officials, including the vice president and Cabinet secretaries, that was on the verge of expiring because of the shutdown.

In the memo, Weichert writes that, ""In the current absence of Congressional guidance,"" the Office of Personnel Management ""believes it would be prudent for agencies to continue to pay these senior political officials at the frozen rate until appropriations legislation is enacted that would clarify the status of the freeze.""

White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said earlier Friday that the administration was ""aware of the issue"" and ""exploring options to prevent this from being implemented while some federal workers are furloughed.""

Trump had also told reporters that he ""might consider"" asking Cabinet secretaries and other top officials to forgo the raises. Pence committed to doing so.

Sanders, in her statement, called the raises ""another unnecessary byproduct of the shutdown"" and put the onus on Congress, saying it ""can easily take care of this by funding the government and securing our borders.""

430,the fresno bee,https://www.fresnobee.com/news/politics-government/national-politics/article224499960.html,"Congress returns to Washington for its first full week of legislative business since control of the House reverted to Democrats, but lawmakers will be confronted with the same lingering question: When will the partial government shutdown end?

One Republican senator says he's offered President Donald Trump a possible solution, though it may just be wishful thinking.

Sen. Lindsey Graham is encouraging Trump to reopen government for several weeks to continue negotiating with Democrats over the border wall Trump wants to build on the U.S.-Mexico border. If there's no deal at the end of that time, Graham says Trump would be free to take the more dramatic step of declaring a national emergency to build it.

But the South Carolina Republican says Trump still wants a deal on funding for the wall before agreeing to reopen shuttered government departments. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat, insists Trump reopen the government first.

Their weeks-old standoff led to the partial government shutdown, now on day 24 without a clear end in sight.

""Before he pulls the plug on the legislative option, and I think we're almost there, I would urge him to open up the government for a short period of time, like three weeks, before he pulls the plug, see if we can get a deal,"" Graham said. ""If we can't at the end of three weeks, all bets are off.

""See if he can do it by himself through the emergency powers. That's my recommendation,"" added Graham, who has publicly pushed Trump to use his authority to declare a national emergency to build the wall. Such a step would allow Trump to bypass Congress and tap various pots of unspent federal money, including for military construction and disaster relief as well as from assets seized by law enforcement, to pay for the wall.

Trump has kept Washington on edge over whether he would resort to such a declaration, citing what he says is a ""crisis"" of drug smuggling and the trafficking of women and children at the border. The president initially sounded as though such a move was imminent, but then pulled back. He has said several times since he first mentioned the idea in public this month that he prefers a legislative solution.

A key question is how much more time is Trump willing to give lawmakers. Graham, who spoke with Trump by telephone on Sunday morning, said the legislative path ""is just about shut off"" and blamed intransigence by Pelosi.

The speaker's office had no immediate comment.

Democrats oppose an emergency declaration but may be powerless to block it. Some Republicans are wary, too, fearing how a future Democratic president might use that authority. Such a move, should Trump ultimately go that route, would almost certainly be challenged in the courts.

Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., called Graham's idea to reopen the government a ""great place to start.""

""I do think if we reopen the government, if the president ends this shutdown crisis, we have folks who can negotiate a responsible, modern investment in technology that will actually make us safer,"" Coons said.

Trump says technology is nice, but that the border can't be secured without a wall.

The White House has been laying the groundwork for an emergency declaration, which is feared by lawmakers in both parties.

Senate Homeland Security Committee Chairman Ron Johnson, R-Wis., said he'd ""hate to see"" a declaration issued because the wall wouldn't get built, presumably because of legal challenges. Democrats voted in the past for border security and should again, he said.

""I actually want to see this wall get built,"" Johnson said. ""I want to keep pressure on Democrats to actually come to the negotiating table in good faith and fund what they have supported in the past.""

Graham favors a declaration and said the time for talk is running out.

""It's the last option, not the first option, but we're pretty close to that being the only option,"" he said.

Graham and Coons spoke on ""Fox News Sunday"" and Johnson appeared on CNN's ""State of the Union."""
431,the fresno bee,https://www.fresnobee.com/news/business/article224277975.html,"The government shutdown has suspended federal cleanups at Superfund sites around the nation and forced the cancellation of public hearings, deepening the mistrust and resentment of surrounding residents who feel people in power long ago abandoned them to live among the toxic residue of the country's factories and mines.

""We are already hurting, and it's just adding more fuel to the fire,"" says 40-year-old Keisha Brown, whose wood-frame home is in a community nestled among coking plants and other factories on Birmingham's north side.

The mostly African-American community has been forced to cope with high levels of arsenic, lead and other contaminants in the soil that the Environmental Protection Agency has been scraping up and carting away, house by house.

As President Donald Trump and Congress battle over Trump's demand for a wall on the southern U.S. border, the nearly 3-week-old partial government shutdown has stopped federal work on Superfund sites except for cases where the administration deems ""there is an imminent threat to the safety of human life or to the protection of property.""

EPA's shutdown plans said the agency would evaluate about 800 Superfund sites to see how many could pose an immediate threat. As an example of that kind of threat, it cited an acid leak from a mine that could threaten the public water supply. That's the hazard at Northern California's Iron Mountain mine, where EPA workers help prevent an unending flow of lethally acidic runoff off the Superfund site from spilling into rivers downstream.

Practically speaking, said Bonnie Bellow, a former EPA official who worked on Superfund public outreach at the agency, the impact of the stoppage of work at sites across the nation ""wholly depends"" on the length of the shutdown.

""Unless there is immediate risk like a storm, a flood, a week or two of slowdowns is not going to very likely affect the cleanup at the site,"" Bellow said.

In north Birmingham, Brown said it's been a couple of weeks since she's spotted any EPA crews at people's houses. It wasn't clear if state workers or contractors were continuing work.

But long before the shutdown began, Brown harbored doubts the cleanup was working anyway. ""My main concern is the health of the people out here,"" said Brown, who has asthma. ""All of us are sick, and we've got to function on medicine every day.""

In terms of time, the federal government shutdown is a chronological blip in the long history of the site -- which includes ethics charges in a local bribery scandal to block federal cleanup efforts -- but adds to the uncertainty in an area where residents feel forgotten and betrayed.

At the EPA, the shutdown has furloughed the bulk of the agency's roughly 14,000 employees. It also means the EPA isn't getting most of the daily stream of environmental questions and tips from the public. Routine inspections aren't happening. State, local and private emails to EPA officials often get automated messages back promising a response when the shutdown ends.

In Montana, for instance, state officials this month found themselves fielding calls from a tribal member worried about drinking water with a funny look to it, said Kristi Ponozzo, public-policy director at that state's Department of Environmental Quality. The EPA normally provides tribes with technical assistance on water supplies.

With most EPA colleagues idled, Ponozzo said, her agency also had to call off an environmental review meeting for a mining project, potentially delaying the project.

But it's the agency's work at Superfund sites -- lessening the threat from old nuclear-weapons plants, chemical factories, mines and other entities -- that gets much of the attention.

Absent imminent peril, it would be up to state governments or contractors to continue any cleanup during the shutdown ""up to the point that additional EPA direction or funding is needed,"" the EPA said in a statement.

""Sites where cleanup activities have been stopped or shut down will be secured until cleanup activities are able to commence when the federal government reopens,"" the agency said.

For federal Superfund sites in Michigan, the shutdown means there are no EPA colleagues to consult, said Scott Dean, a spokesman for that state's Department of Environmental Quality.

At Michigan Superfund sites, day-to-day field operations were continuing since private contractors do most of the on-the-ground work, Dean said.

Bellow, the former EPA official, said the cancellation of hearings about Superfund sites posed immediate concerns.

In East Chicago, Indiana, for example, the EPA called off a planned public hearing set for last Wednesday to outline how the agency planned to clean up high levels of lead and arsenic in the soil.

The EPA has proposed a seven-month, $26.5 million cleanup that includes treating and removing tainted soil from the area, where a lead smelter previously was located.

During a public meeting Nov. 29, some residents complained that the EPA's approach would leave too much pollution in place. But others didn't get a chance to speak and were hoping to do so at the meeting this week, said Debbie Chizewer, a Northwestern University environmental attorney who represents community groups in the low-income area.

The EPA announced the cancellation in an online notice and gave no indication that it would be rescheduled.

Leaders of the East Chicago Calumet Community Advisory Group asked for a new hearing date and an extension of a Jan. 14 public comment deadline in a letter to the EPA's regional Superfund division.

Calls by The Associated Press to the agency's regional office in Chicago this week were not answered.

Local critics fear the EPA will use the delay caused by the shutdown as justification for pushing ahead with a cleanup strategy they consider flawed, Chizewer said, even though the agency has designated the affected area as an ""environmental justice community"" -- a low-income community of color that has been disproportionately harmed by pollution.

The EPA has a ""special obligation"" when dealing with such communities, Chizewer said. ""This would be an example of shutting them out for no good reason.""

In North Birmingham, former longtime neighborhood resident Charlie Powell said most of the people living in and around the Superfund site had already ""just got tired and fed up.""

Powell left the area but started a group called PANIC, People Against Neighborhood Industrial Contamination. He believes money would be better spent helping residents move away from the pollution.

""Can I say hell?"" Powell said when asked what residents have been through.

If there's no deal at the end of that time, Graham says Trump would be free to take the more dramatic step of declaring a national emergency to build it.

But the South Carolina Republican says Trump still wants a deal on funding for the wall before agreeing to reopen shuttered government departments. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat, insists Trump reopen the government first.

Their weeks-old standoff led to the partial government shutdown, now on day 24 without a clear end in sight.

Trump insisted on Twitter Monday that he wanted to deal, declaring: ""I've been waiting all weekend. Democrats must get to work now. Border must be secured!""

Targeting Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, Trump also argued that the shutdown ""has become their, and the Democrats, fault!"" Trump weeks ago asserted that he would ""own"" the shutdown and polls show that he is taking most of the blame.

Graham, who has publicly pushed Trump to use his authority to declare a national emergency to build the wall, is suggesting a short-term fix.

""Before he pulls the plug on the legislative option, and I think we're almost there, I would urge him to open up the government for a short period of time, like three weeks, before he pulls the plug, see if we can get a deal,"" Graham said. ""If we can't at the end of three weeks, all bets are off.

""See if he can do it by himself through the emergency powers. That's my recommendation,"" added Graham, who has publicly pushed Trump to use his authority to declare a national emergency to build the wall. Such a step would allow Trump to bypass Congress and tap various pots of unspent federal money, including for military construction and disaster relief as well as from assets seized by law enforcement, to pay for the wall.

Trump has kept Washington on edge over whether he would resort to such a declaration, citing what he says is a ""crisis"" of drug smuggling and the trafficking of women and children at the border. The president initially sounded as though such a move was imminent, but then pulled back. He has said several times since he first mentioned the idea in public this month that he prefers a legislative solution.

A key question is how much more time is Trump willing to give lawmakers. Graham, who spoke with Trump by telephone on Sunday morning, said the legislative path ""is just about shut off"" and blamed intransigence by Pelosi.

The speaker's office had no immediate comment.

Democrats oppose an emergency declaration but may be powerless to block it. Some Republicans are wary, too, fearing how a future Democratic president might use that authority. Such a move, should Trump ultimately go that route, would almost certainly be challenged in the courts.

Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., called Graham's idea to reopen the government a ""great place to start.""

""I do think if we reopen the government, if the president ends this shutdown crisis, we have folks who can negotiate a responsible, modern investment in technology that will actually make us safer,"" Coons said.

Trump says technology is nice, but that the border can't be secured without a wall.

The White House has been laying the groundwork for an emergency declaration, which is feared by lawmakers in both parties.

Senate Homeland Security Committee Chairman Ron Johnson, R-Wis., said he'd ""hate to see"" a declaration issued because the wall wouldn't get built, presumably because of legal challenges. Democrats voted in the past for border security and should again, he said.

""I actually want to see this wall get built,"" Johnson said. ""I want to keep pressure on Democrats to actually come to the negotiating table in good faith and fund what they have supported in the past.""

Graham favors a declaration and said the time for talk is running out.

""It's the last option, not the first option, but we're pretty close to that being the only option,"" he said.

Graham and Coons spoke on ""Fox News Sunday"" and Johnson appeared on CNN's ""State of the Union.""

3:16 p.m.

Congressional leaders from both parties have returned to the White House for another round of negotiations with President Donald Trump on the ongoing partial government shutdown.

The two sides have made no apparent progress in the past week, with Trump sticking to his demand of $5.7 billion for a border barrier and Democrats insisting they won't give him the money.

Trump has been making a public case that there is a ""crisis"" at the southern border. And he's still threatening to declare a national emergency to circumvent Congress if he can't get the wall money from them.

He told reporters during a visit to the Capitol earlier Wednesday that he may turn to a declaration ""at some point"" if top Democrats Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi ""don't agree"" with his assessment about the problems at the border.

President Donald Trump says Republicans are ""totally unified"" in the shutdown standoff over his long-promised southern border wall, though some GOP lawmakers have been expressing concern about the 19-day partial government closure.

Trump traveled to Capitol Hill on Wednesday to meet with Senate Republicans. He says there was ""no discussion about anything other than solidarity.""

Trump has been considering a national emergency declaration to bypass Congress to build the wall. He says he ""may do that at some point"" if he can't get a deal with Democrats.

Trump also plans to meet with top congressional Democrats and Republicans at the White House on Wednesday.

President Donald Trump arrived on Capitol Hill claiming he has ""tremendous"" support as he headed into a meeting with Republican senators uneasy with the government shutdown over his border wall.

Asked how long the shutdown would last, Trump told reporters Wednesday ""whatever it takes.""

The partial shutdown is now in its 19th day, the second longest ever.

Trump and Vice President Mike Pence arrived for the private lunch meeting with the Senate GOP caucus to shore up support.

Several Republican senators have said the government should be re-opened while talks continue over border security and Trump's demand for money to build the wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.

President Donald Trump says he thinks he and the Democrats are ""getting closer"" to a deal to end the budget stalemate that has partially shut down the government despite no evidence that any progress has been made.

And he's suggesting the partial government shutdown could be ""a blessing in disguise"" because, he suggests, it could lead to a broader immigration deal.

Trump spoke Wednesday during an Oval Office bill signing on anti-human trafficking legislation. It's a day after he delivered a prime-time address trying to make the case for his long-stalled U.S.-Mexico border wall.

Trump says that he would like to see ""real immigration reform in this country because we need it."" He says, ""Everybody wants to see immigration reform,"" adding that perhaps the stalemate ""will turn out to be a blessing in disguise.""

Gone are the days when the U.S. and Mexican governments regularly exchanged statements over President Donald Trump's insistence on a border wall.

Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said Wednesday he won't be drawn into what he calls a U.S. internal dispute, an apparent reference to the 19-day-old partial U.S. government shutdown over a border barrier.

Lopez Obrador says, ""We are not going to respond to situations arising from internal affairs in the United States.""

Unlike his predecessor, the Mexican leader didn't have to respond to any specific aspersion about Mexico, because Trump didn't make any in his Tuesday night address to the American public. Relations between the two leaders have been surprisingly cordial, given their ideological differences.

Lopez Obrador said, ""Of course, there are those ... who want us to get into a confrontation. We always want a friendly relationship with the United States, a cooperative relationship.""

As a presidential candidate Trump promised Mexico would pay for a border wall, but Mexico refused.

President Donald Trump is using a bill signing focused on curbing human trafficking to push his case for a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border.

Trump says a southern border that is not secured exacerbates the incidents of human trafficking. He says, ""As long as we have a border that is not secure, we're going to suffer the consequences of that.""

Wednesday's bill signing came a day after Trump's prime-time speech designed to persuade Americans that illegal immigration and trafficking at the border are a crisis.

Democrats have called Trump's promised wall costly, ineffective and ""immoral"" and say he's ""manufacturing a crisis.""

The bill Trump signed is designed to enhance an annual State Department report that measures global efforts to eliminate human trafficking.

The White House says it's the fourth bipartisan bill the Republican president has signed in the last few weeks to prevent human trafficking.

Congressional Democrats say they'll head to the White House with the plan to reopen the government -- the same one they've been presenting. They're asking President Donald Trump to accept a bipartisan bill to fund border security without the wall.

Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Wednesday the president ""could end the Trump shutdown and re-open the government today, and he should.""

Pelosi and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer spoke at an event where they were flanked by federal workers going without pay during the shutdown, now in its 19th day.

Schumer called workers the ""collateral damage"" of Trump's ""temper tantrum."" He said the president failed to ""persuade a soul"" during his ""divisive"" prime-time address Tuesday night to the nation.

Trump meets with congressional leaders at the White House Wednesday afternoon. He rejected the Senate's bipartisan funding bill in December, sparking the shutdown.

The White House is trying to keep jittery congressional Republicans from defecting over the toll the partial government shutdown is taking in their states.

President Donald Trump and Democrats have been at an impasse over funding for his proposed border wall, which has led to a partial government shutdown, now in its 19th day.

Trump meets with Senate Republicans Wednesday on Capitol Hill just hours after he argued on national television that a border wall was needed to resolve a security and humanitarian ""crisis.""

Senators say the shutdown has led to disruptions in agricultural payments for farmers, as well as for home buyers trying to secure government-backed home loans. Lawmakers also are worried about missed paychecks for government workers Friday.

As many as half a dozen GOP senators have said the government should reopen while border security negotiations with Democrats continue.

President Donald Trump again linked illegal immigration along the southern border with drugs and violent crime as he urged Democratic lawmakers to fund his proposed border wall.

In his first national address from the Oval Office, the president gave no indication he was softening his stance that the partial government shutdown would continue without money for the wall.

Trump argued Tuesday night that the wall was needed to resolve what he called a security and humanitarian ""crisis.""

He addressed the nation as the shutdown stretched through its third week, with hundreds of thousands of federal workers going without pay and some congressional Republicans growing increasingly jittery about the impasse.

Trump plans to visit Senate Republicans at the Capitol on Wednesday before meeting with Democratic leaders at the White House."
434,the fresno bee,https://www.fresnobee.com/news/politics-government/national-politics/article224069750.html,"With illegal immigration at its lowest level in a decade, it's nothing short of stunning that the federal government is shut down over funding for a border wall.

Yet here we are, entering a third week of the shutdown because President Donald Trump has inexplicably chosen to dig his heels in on getting $5 billion to build a wall along stretches of the U.S. border with Mexico that do not already have such a barrier in place.

""As long as it takes,"" Trump said last week when asked how long he was willing to let the shutdown last. ""I mean, look, I'm prepared. I think the people of the country think I'm right. I think the people of this country think I'm right.""

Except, polling shows the opposite. Major polls conducted last month by Quinnipiac, Harvard, NPR and others all showed that a majority of Americans do not support the wall. And the number of wall supporters shrinks even more when asked if it is worth shutting down the government over.

The reality is that immigration from Mexico has been decreasing since 2007, and the number of unauthorized immigrants living in the U.S. is at its lowest level since 2004, according to the Pew Research Center.

Further, the majority of illegal immigration to the United States from Mexico occurs in and around heavily secured ports of entry like San Diego, El Paso and Brownsville, Texas, where 654 miles of wall, fencing and other barriers already exist. Spending billions to build a structure along vast, rural stretches of the border doesn't help with security at the sections of the border that most need help.

No one is arguing for unsecure borders. The newly installed Democratic Congress voted Thursday to approve a stopgap funding bill that would reopen the federal government and provide $1.3 billion for border security in the form of manpower and equipment but not a wall. Trump has said he won't sign it, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell refuses to let a bill come to the Senate floor that the president won't sign.

It's hard to know what the president's end game is. He couldn't get the border wall approved when Republicans controlled both the House and the Senate, so it seems odd to take this stance on the heels of a midterm election in which Democrats made their biggest gains in 40 years and took control of the House.

Trump may feel he is being true to his base of ardent supporters, among whom the border wall ranked high on their list of priorities. But his focus is sorely misplaced. Rather, his attention should be focused on the independent voters who took a chance on him in 2016 believing his style could prove effective at getting things done in Washington. Shutting down the federal government in an effort to get $5 billion for a wall that most Americans don't feel the country needs is the opposite of getting things done.

Laura Kelly is already on the case for Kansas kids with decision to name new DCF leader ' The Kansas City Star

This is why voters elected incoming Gov. Laura Kelly: Because we need to do so much better for Kansas children, because we badly need transparency in state government and because there is zero time to waste in recovering all that was lost under Governors Sam Brownback and Jeff Colyer.

So good for her for marching so briskly into 2019. On Thursday, Kelly announced that she will replace Gina Meier-Hummel as head of the state's child welfare system. The Kansas Department for Children and Families was on what seemed like permanent crisis footing long before Meier-Hummel got there in fall of 2017. But it has remained troubled under her sometimes questionable leadership, and a change was in order.

Meier-Hummel had a difficult job and did make some improvements, which began with a top-to-bottom audit.

But she talked about transparency and didn't show enough of it. She decided to hire inexperienced and unlicensed social workers to fill jobs investigating reports of abuse and neglect. And she replaced contracts for foster care, family preservation and other services with grants that got around rules on no-bid arrangements.

Kelly asked the Colyer administration that she'll soon supplant -- in 11 days, her announcement noted, and we're glad she's counting -- not to implement those grants at this point. Meier-Hummel immediately said she'd honor that request.

The governor-elect also said outright that the state's procurement process wasn't followed and that agency officials had tried to keep her from learning more about how the grantees were chosen.

We wanted Kelly to clean house and name names, for the sake of the state's struggling families, and she's already doing that.

As The Star has reported, the agency gave a major grant to a Florida nonprofit already facing heavy criticism for its foster care. An agency spokeswoman argued that they'd been hired to provide family preservation services, not foster care, but it's still the same nonprofit group.

Meier-Hummel will be succeeded on an interim basis by Laura Howard, who for now will head both the DCF and the Kansas Department for Aging and Disability Services. A former regional administrator in a federal agency overseeing substance abuse and mental health services, Howard is currently director of the Public Management Center in the School of Public Affairs and Administration at the University of Kansas.

Meier-Hummel responded to Kelly's no-nonsense announcement with a news release of her own. It listed her achievements, including starting a new Wichita abuse and neglect reporting line, ""changing key policies and procedures and implementing further mandated training"" and reducing the number of missing and runaway kids by just over a quarter. The suspended grants are in the ""absolute best interest"" of Kansas children and families, the DCF's announcement said.

That's a matter of opinion, but ours is that Kelly has done the right thing and is off to a promising start even before being sworn in as governor."

As President Donald Trump is said to be mulling ""other options"" for funding his border wall between the U.S. and Mexico, according to the Associated Press, a dark horse arises on the internet.

A GoFundMe campaign popped up Sunday, hoping to raise funds for Trump's proposed wall between the U.S. and Mexico, which isn't news in and of itself. There are plenty of those around.

But the organizers of this campaign are so encouraged that they've raised more-than $700,000 in just three days that they've bumped their original goal of $200 million up to a cool billion.

The GoFundMe organizer is listed as triple-amputee Air Force veteran Brian Kolfage, who lost both legs and his right arm in a blast at Balad Air Force Base in Iraq in 2004, according to the Arizona Daily Star. The fundraiser is titled, ""We the people will fund the wall.""

The contact listing for the organizer says ""The Wall Funding Team"" is located in Miramar, Fla.

""As a veteran who has given so much, 3 limbs, I feel deeply invested to this nation to ensure future generations have everything we have today,"" Kolfage wrote in the GoFundMe campaign description. ""Too many Americans have been murdered by illegal aliens and too many illegals are taking advantage of the United States taxpayers with no means of ever contributing to our society.

""I have grandparents who immigrated to America legally, they did it the correct way and it's time we uphold our laws, and get this wall BUILT! It's up to Americans to help out and pitch in to get this project rolling.""

Multiple studies and reports have shown, though, that illegal immigrants commit crime, violent or nonviolent, at lesser rates than do native-born Americans.

Kolfage's GoFundMe campaign was listed as the ""Top fundraiser"" on the front page of the crowd-sourced social fundraising website as of Wednesday afternoon, despite Kolfage's claims that the platform was trying to hide his fundraiser from potential donors.

Kolfage's Facebook page, where he posts content relevant to his conservative political beliefs, has more than 90,000 followers.

""We have contacted the Trump Administration to secure a point of contact where all funds will go upon completion,"" the campaign says. ""When get this information secured we will update. We have many very high level contacts already helping."""

Congressional Democrats say they'll head to the White House with the plan to reopen the government -- the same one they've been presenting. They're asking President Donald Trump to accept a bipartisan bill to fund border security without the wall.

Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Wednesday the president ""could end the Trump shutdown and re-open the government today, and he should.""

Pelosi and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer spoke at an event where they were flanked by federal workers going without pay during the shutdown, now in its 19th day.

Schumer called workers the ""collateral damage"" of Trump's ""temper tantrum."" He said the president failed to ""persuade a soul"" during his ""divisive"" prime-time address Tuesday night to the nation.

Trump meets with congressional leaders at the White House Wednesday afternoon. He rejected the Senate's bipartisan funding bill in December, sparking the shutdown.

The White House is trying to keep jittery congressional Republicans from defecting over the toll the partial government shutdown is taking in their states.

President Donald Trump and Democrats have been at an impasse over funding for his proposed border wall, which has led to a partial government shutdown, now in its 19th day.

Trump meets with Senate Republicans Wednesday on Capitol Hill just hours after he argued on national television that a border wall was needed to resolve a security and humanitarian ""crisis.""

Senators say the shutdown has led to disruptions in agricultural payments for farmers, as well as for home buyers trying to secure government-backed home loans. Lawmakers also are worried about missed paychecks for government workers Friday.

As many as half a dozen GOP senators have said the government should reopen while border security negotiations with Democrats continue.

President Donald Trump again linked illegal immigration along the southern border with drugs and violent crime as he urged Democratic lawmakers to fund his proposed border wall.

In his first national address from the Oval Office, the president gave no indication he was softening his stance that the partial government shutdown would continue without money for the wall.

Trump argued Tuesday night that the wall was needed to resolve what he called a security and humanitarian ""crisis.""

He addressed the nation as the shutdown stretched through its third week, with hundreds of thousands of federal workers going without pay and some congressional Republicans growing increasingly jittery about the impasse.

438,grand forks herald,https://www.grandforksherald.com/news/government-and-politics/4546960-partial-government-shutdown-assured-after-lawmakers-leave,"WASHINGTON - Large parts of the federal government are shutting down overnight after President Donald Trump torpedoed a bipartisan spending deal because it lacked the money he demanded for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.

Funding for numerous agencies, including those that operate parks, homeland security, law enforcement, tax collection and transportation, was set to expire at midnight. Close to 400,000 federal workers are expected to be sent home without pay until a deal is reached, and numerous services will be halted in that time, with the impacts broadening the longer the funding lapse lasts.

The shutdown intensifies a standoff between Trump, who is demanding $5.7 billion for a border wall, and congressional Democrats, who have vowed to block any wall funding and have the votes to do so. It marks a deflating final chapter for Republicans as they complete two years of unified GOP control in Washington - as well as an acrimonious prelude to the upcoming era of divided government, after Democrats take the House in January.

Trump saw the final days of this year as his last chance to try to extract funding for the wall, while Democrats, united against the wall and buttressed by big wins in the midterm elections, showed no signs of buckling to his demands amid a flurry of attacks this week.

The White House and congressional leaders continued negotiations late Friday, but by 8:30 p.m., the House and the Senate had adjourned for the night. That made it impossible to vote on any spending agreement until Saturday, and it remained unclear whether any deal would materialize by then.

It is unclear how long a shutdown might last. Trump predicted earlier Friday that it could drag on for a ""very long time.""

The Senate on Friday considered legislation that would fund the government agencies through Feb. 8 and appropriate $5.7 billion for the erection of 215 miles of wall structures along the Mexico border.

The House passed that legislation Thursday evening, but Senate Democrats successfully unified on Friday and refused to back that measure.

Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said Friday that Democrats were open to discussions with the White House and Republicans but would not agree to any measure that funded the construction of a new border wall.

Schumer said Friday that the Senate had unanimously agreed to a spending bill earlier in the week and accused Trump of having a ""temper tantrum"" because he wasn't getting money for the wall.

""President Trump, you will not get your wall,"" Schumer said. ""You're not getting your wall today, next week or on Jan. 3 when Democrats take control of the House.""

Democrats tried to make clear to the White House for weeks that they had the votes to block any measure that contained money for the wall.

As their power became clear to White House officials, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders signaled Tuesday that Trump was planning to withdraw his request for the funds in an effort to keep the government open.

But he received a torrent of criticism from conservative lawmakers and commentators following this decision, and he reversed course on Thursday, scuttling a temporary, bipartisan spending bill that would have extended funding through Feb. 8 but did not contain wall money.

Trump on Friday urged Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., to change long-standing Senate rules to pass the House's measure providing $5.7 billion for the wall.

McConnell refused, making it impossible for Senate Republicans to marshal the measure through because Democrats control 49 seats in the 100-member chamber.

""We're going to be working very hard to get something passed in the Senate,"" Trump said earlier Friday in the Oval Office. ""Now it's up to the Democrats as to whether or not we have a shutdown tonight. I hope we don't, but we're very much prepared for a long shutdown.""

Republicans were frustrated by the reversal, and Democrats warned Friday that the president's erratic and unvetted decisions in recent days were unsettling financial markets, foreign allies and even members of his Cabinet.

""This is tyranny of talk radio hosts, right? And so, how do you deal with that?"" said Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn. ""You have two talk radio hosts who completely flipped the president. And so, do we succumb to tyranny of talk radio hosts?""

Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis announced his resignation Thursday. The Dow Jones industrial average had one of its worst weeks in recent decades and has fallen almost 4,400 points, or 16 percent, since October.

Multiple federal parks and monuments are slated to close, some as soon as Saturday morning. The Securities and Exchange Commission posted a list of the services it will soon suspend, including the processing of certain business records. The Justice Department, Commerce Department and Internal Revenue Service are preparing to send thousands of workers home without pay.

And Trump's prediction that a shutdown would last ""for a very long time"" meant that hundreds of thousands of federal employees risk missing at least one paycheck. Even the Border Patrol agents and Transportation Security Administration officials who are directed to continue working during the shutdown will not be paid until Congress funds their agencies.

About 400,000 federal workers would be furloughed, according to a Washington Post projection. But a number of federal agencies, including the Pentagon, will not be directly affected, because Congress already passed multiple other spending bills this year that secured funding through September.

As the funding lapse lengthens, the negotiations will prove to be a major test for Trump, Schumer, McConnell and House conservatives as they jostle for footing in Washington's new power structure.

Friday afternoon saw a flurry of discussions begin in the afternoon when McConnell, Democrats and Vice President Mike Pence began huddling separately in the Capitol.

Pence separately joined Trump adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner and White House budget director Mick Mulvaney for a meeting with House conservatives. But the talks yielded no clear evidence of progress, and eventually, Pence and his entourage left the Capitol.

""We don't have a deal,"" Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Richard Shelby, R-Ala., told reporters after emerging from a late meeting with the vice president. ""There are a lot of moving parts, and we're trying to get them moving together.""

The construction of a wall along the border with Mexico was one of Trump's top campaign promises in 2016, and he had promised that Mexico would finance the entire project. But since taking office, he has demanded the money from Congress.

Senate Democrats have blocked every attempt so far. Trump has also threatened to shut the government down numerous times if he doesn't receive money for the border wall, but before Friday night, he had backed down every time.

In recent days, Trump has tried a number of different tactics to try to secure the money. He called on Cabinet secretaries to search their budgets for extra funds, and on Wednesday, he said the entire project would be built by the military. But by Thursday he was back to demanding that Congress provide the funding, leaving many GOP lawmakers scrambling to accede to his demands.

The shutdown followed a day of posturing and unsuccessful negotiations in the Senate on Friday.

After meeting with Trump at the White House, McConnell called a vote aimed at advancing the bill with $5.7 billion for the border wall, saying the legislation would not be considered controversial in more normal times.

""I'm proud to vote for it,"" McConnell said.

But after hours of maneuvering, it became clear that the legislation would not command the support needed to pass, although the Senate advanced it on a procedural vote - with Pence breaking a tie - to keep a legislative vehicle alive in case a deal does emerge.

Trump, meanwhile, ratcheted up public pressure on Democrats to cave on the wall.

In a spate of morning Twitter posts, Trump sought to pin blame on Democrats for a potential shutdown, even though he said last week that he would accept responsibility for a shutdown.

But Democrats showed no signs of relenting, and on Friday night, they continued to blame Trump and the Republicans for the partial shutdown.

""I think we ought to make it clear that it's the president's abrupt change in position and refusal to accept the deal he's already told his leadership he'd accept,"" said Sen. Christopher Coons, D-Del.

""Look, this is the last week we have a Republican-controlled Senate and House and White House - they've got to work this out."""

Here is a brief look at Press TV Newsroom's headlines from 0900 GMT to 1700 GMT, January 2, 2018.

US government shutdown

US President, Donald Trump, has called for a meeting with Congress leaders to seek an end to the federal government's partial shutdown. The meeting is due on Wednesday, a day before Democrats plan to approve a spending package meant to end the shutdown, now in its second week. They're at odds with Trump over the money he wants for the construction of a wall at the Mexico border. Trump wants five-billion dollars to build the wall, which he says is needed to curb illegal immigration to the United States. Democrats have not contained the funding demanded by him in the spending package. They're critical of the president's tough immigration policies. The dispute has caused a quarter of the federal government to shut down, affecting nearly 800,000 workers.

Sudan political tension

Opposition parties and groups in Sudan say they want President Omar-al-Bashir to resign amid the dire economic crisis in the country. The opposition includes former allies of the president and breakaway groups and traditional parties. In a press conference on Tuesday, the dissident groups asked for a sovereign council to set a suitable date for democratic elections. They said they look for a government that would offer freedom and democracy and would bring peace to the country's conflict-ridden areas. The groups expressed their demands in a memorandum that is expected to be presented to Bashir on Wednesday. Sudan has been rocked by deadly anti-government protests during the past few weeks.

Philippines floods

The death toll from Philippines' devastating landslides and floods has climbed to 85. Authorities say twenty people are still missing. Rescue teams are slowly reaching remote areas around the Bicol and eastern Visayas regions where a tropical depression caused the disaster on Sunday. Bicol was the hardest hit, as intense rains destroyed agricultural products. Rescuers use heavy-lifting equipment to clear roads leading to landslide sites. Officials put three close provinces under a state of calamity to give them access to emergency funds in case a similar situation happens.

Lebanon political impasse

Officials from the Lebanese resistance movement, Hezbollah, say a solution to the current impasse over a new government formation in Lebanon is very close. The officials say the government formation is beneficial, particularly, in light of what they called the Israeli dangers. Earlier, Prime Minister-designate Saad al-Hariri said he and President Michel Aoun were determined to form a government. Lebanese politicians remain divided since the general election in May. Rival parties have competed over the allocation of cabinet positions. Hezbollah and its political allies secured over half of the seats in the election.

Israeli settlement

New figures show Israeli settlement constructions have witnessed a dramatic rise under US President Donald Trump's administration. The data obtained by the Associated Press indicate a record high number of settler units could be built in the following years due to huge number of approvals made.

Denmark train accident

At least six people have lost their lives during a train accident in Denmark. Over a dozen others also sustained injuries. The incident took place on a bridge connecting the two islands of Zealand and Funen. The bridge is now closed for both trains and vehicles. Police say debris from a passing freight train caused the accident. The train was heading towards the capital with 131 passengers on board. Witnesses say a loud crash was heard and windows started to smash."
440,myrtlebeachonline,https://www.myrtlebeachonline.com/news/nation-world/national/article223193915.html,"White House digs in on border wall demand, risking shutdown

WASHINGTON (AP) -- The White House on Sunday pushed the federal government closer to the brink of a partial shutdown later this week, digging in on its demand for $5 billion to build a border wall as congressional Democrats stood firm against it.

""We're going to do whatever is necessary to build the border wall to stop this ongoing crisis of illegal immigration,"" said White House senior adviser Stephen Miller.

Asked if that meant having a government shutdown, he said: ""If it comes to it, absolutely.""

Trump said last week he would be ""proud"" to have a shutdown to get Congress to approve a $5 billion down payment to fulfill his campaign promise to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. But the president doesn't have the votes from the Republican-controlled Congress to support funding for the wall at that level.

Democratic congressional leaders, Sen. Chuck Schumer and Rep. Nancy Pelosi, have proposed no more than $1.6 billion, as outlined in a bipartisan Senate bill. The money would not go for the wall but for fencing upgrades and other border security. Democrats also offered to simply keep funding at its current level, $1.3 billion.

Trump lawyer Giuliani rules out Mueller interview with Trump

WASHINGTON (AP) -- With a number of probes moving closer to the Oval Office, President Donald Trump and his attorney unleashed a fresh series of attacks on the investigators, questioning their integrity while categorically ruling out the possibility of a presidential interview with the special counsel.

Trump and Rudy Giuliani used Twitter and television interviews Sunday to deliver a series of broadsides against special counsel Robert Mueller and federal prosecutors in New York. Giuliani said he was ""disgusted"" by the tactics used by Mueller in his probe into Russian election interference, including in securing guilty pleas from the president's former national security adviser Michael Flynn on a charge of lying to federal investigators.

Trump, Giuliani said, would not submit to an interview by Mueller's team.

""They're a joke,"" Giuliani told ""Fox News Sunday."" ''Over my dead body, but, you know, I could be dead.""

The special counsel, who is investigating possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russia, has continued to request an interview with the president. Last month, the White House sent written answers in response to the special counsel's questions about possible collusion. The White House has resisted answering questions on possible obstruction of justice.

Child's death highlights communication barriers on border

Shortly before a 7-year-old Guatemalan girl died in U.S. custody, her father signed a form stating that his daughter was in good health. But it's unclear how much the man understood on the form, which was written in English and read to him in Spanish by Border Patrol agents.

The death of Jakelin Caal highlights the communication challenges along the U.S.-Mexico border as agents come in contact with an increasing number of migrants who speak neither English nor Spanish.

Her father's native language is the Mayan tongue known as Q'eqchi'. His second language is Spanish. It's unclear whether something was lost in translation or whether it would have made a difference in saving Jakelin after the two were detained and underwent a health screening along a remote stretch of U.S.-Mexico border. But the case raises questions about the Border Patrol's use of English-only forms.

All agents are required to speak Spanish, and they receive formal Spanish training. Reading forms in Spanish is often enough to pose basic questions. But some other Spanish-speaking migrants reported signing paperwork that they later said they did not understand.

Scores of immigrant parents who were separated from their children after crossing the border in the spring said they signed forms agreeing to be deported with the understanding that their kids would be returning with them, only to find themselves deported without them. Many had to wait months before being reunited with them in their homelands.

Talks adopt 'rulebook' to put Paris climate deal into action

KATOWICE, Poland (AP) -- Almost 200 nations, including the world's top greenhouse gas producers, China and the United States, have adopted a set of rules meant to breathe life into the 2015 Paris climate accord by setting out how countries should report their emissions and efforts to reduce them.

But negotiators delayed other key decisions until next year -- a move that frustrated environmentalists and countries that wanted more ambitious goals in light of scientists' warnings that the world must shift sharply away from fossil fuels in the coming decade.

""The majority of the rulebook for the Paris agreement has been created, which is something to be thankful for,"" said Mohamed Adow, a climate policy expert at Christian Aid. ""But the fact countries had to be dragged kicking and screaming to the finish line shows that some nations have not woken up"" to the dire consequences of global warming as outlined in a report by the U.N Panel on Climate Change, or IPCC.

Officials at the talks, which ended late Saturday in the Polish city of Katowice, agreed upon universal rules on how nations can cut emissions. Poor countries secured assurances on financial support to help them reduce emissions, adapt to changes such as rising sea levels and pay for damage that has already happened.

""Through this package, you have made a thousand little steps forward together,"" said Michal Kurtyka, a senior Polish official who led the talks.

French city honors victims of Christmas market attack

PARIS (AP) -- People filled a square in the French city of Strasbourg on Sunday to show respect and sympathy for the victims of last week's shooting attack near a famous Christmas market as the death toll rose to five.

French authorities said a Polish man died in a Strasbourg hospital Sunday, one of a dozen people wounded in last Tuesday's attack. Poland's Foreign Ministry extended condolences Sunday on Twitter to his family.

According to the newspaper DNA, more than 1,000 people attended the memorial, which ended with a minute of applause and a rendition of France's national anthem, ""La Marseillaise.""

The hour-long ceremony took place in Kleber Square, not far from where a gunman opened fire on Tuesday evening. Strasbourg Mayor Roland Ries praised the city's resilience in the face of hardship.

The ""extremely large crowd in the Christmas market"" on Saturday ""was an illustration of our commitment to these values ??on which our living together is based, which we will continue to defend against all those who want to attack it,"" Ries said.

Not into bingo, 84-year-old Texas woman gets college degree

RICHARDSON, Texas (AP) -- After raising five kids and retiring at age 77 from her secretarial job, Janet Fein couldn't be blamed for finally relaxing, but that's not her.

Fein, now 84, went to back to school and will accomplish a long-held goal this week when she graduates from the University of Texas at Dallas with a bachelor's degree.

""I didn't have anything to do in retirement and I didn't think that playing bingo was up to my speed,"" said Fein, who majored in sociology because she felt it was ""substantial.""

She said she enjoyed all the reading and writing papers. ""With each class I already knew a lot, but then I also learned a lot. And that made me happy,"" she said.

People 65 and older make up less than one percent of U.S. college students. In 2015, they accounted for about 67,000 of about 20 million college students, according to the National Center for Education Statistics.

Next-generation of GPS satellites are headed to space

DENVER (AP) -- After months of delays, the U.S. Air Force is about to launch the first of a new generation of GPS satellites, designed to be more accurate, secure and versatile.

But some of their most highly touted features will not be fully available until 2022 or later because of problems in a companion program to develop a new ground control system for the satellites, government auditors said.

The satellite is scheduled to lift off Tuesday from Cape Canaveral, Florida, aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. It's the first of 32 planned GPS III satellites that will replace older ones now in orbit. Lockheed Martin is building the new satellites outside Denver.

GPS is best-known for its widespread civilian applications, from navigation to time-stamping bank transactions. The Air Force estimates that 4 billion people worldwide use the system.

But it was developed by the U.S. military, which still designs, launches and operates the system. The Air Force controls a constellation of 31 GPS satellites from a high-security complex at Schriever Air Force Base outside Colorado Springs.

After fraud probe, new primary may replace GOP candidate

RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- Legislation quickly passed by North Carolina's lawmakers this week would prepare a path for Republicans to dump their nominee in a still-undecided U.S. House race marred with ballot fraud allegations.

""I think (legislators are) worried that Mark Harris might be damaged goods and they want to have the opportunity to have a different Republican nominee,"" said Carter Wrenn, a Republican operative and consultant to former U.S. Sen. Jesse Helms and others for more than 40 years. ""That's how I read those tea leaves.""

If the state elections board decides ballot irregularities or other problems cast the true outcome into doubt and force a redo, the legislation -- if allowed to go into law by Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper -- would require new primary elections in the 9th Congressional District race, in addition to a new general election.

That would allow Republicans another look at Mark Harris, the Republican who led Democrat Dan McCready by 905 votes in unofficial results. Harris hasn't been certified the winner, and an investigation is looking into missing absentee ballots in rural Bladen County and whether unsealed ballots illegally handled by collection teams there could have been altered.

Bladen was the only county among the eight within the 9th District where Harris won a majority of mail-in absentee ballots over McCready.

Top of mind: 'Justice' is Merriam-Webster's word of the year

NEW YORK (AP) -- Racial justice. Obstruction of justice. Social justice. The Justice Department. Merriam-Webster has chosen ""justice"" as its 2018 word of the year, driven by the churning news cycle over months and months.

The word follows ""toxic,"" picked by Oxford Dictionaries, and ""misinformation,"" plucked by Dictonary.com.

Peter Sokolowski, Merriam-Webster's editor at large, told The Associated Press ahead of Monday's announcement that ""justice"" consistently bubbled into the top 20 or 30 lookups on the company's website, spiking at times due to specific events but also skating close to the surface for much of the year.

While it's one of those common words people likely know how to spell and use correctly in a sentence, Sokolowski pointed to other reasons that drive search traffic. Among them is an attempt to focus a train of thought around a philosophical problem, or to seek aspirational motivation. Such well-known words are often among the most looked up every year, including those that are slightly abstract, including ""love,"" he said.

The designation for ""justice"" came soon after President Trump's one-time fixer, Michael Cohen, was sentenced to three years in prison for crimes that included arranging the payment of hush money to conceal his boss' alleged sexual affairs. He told a judge he agreed time and again to cover up Trump's ""dirty deeds"" out of ""blind loyalty.""

'Spider-Verse' swings to the top; 'Mortal Engines' tanks

LOS ANGELES (AP) -- ""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse"" swung to the top of the domestic box office in its first weekend in theaters, proving that there is widespread audience interest in big screen animated versions of Marvel's marquee superheroes.

The film led a host of newcomers that debuted to varying success on this pre-Christmas holiday weekend, including Clint Eastwood's drug smuggling drama ""The Mule"" and the Peter Jackson-produced epic ""Mortal Engines"" which bombed in North American theaters.

""Into the Spider-Verse"" earned an estimated $35.4 million from 3,813 theaters against a $90 million production budget according to Sony Pictures on Sunday, which is a record for animated movies in December (although the hybrid ""Alvin and the Chipmunks"" movies were higher). The film features an innovative animation style -- both CGI and hand-drawn -- and focuses on the Miles Morales character as he learns to become the famed web-slinger. It's another financial win for the studio's latest ""expanded Spider-Man universe"" strategy following ""Venom"" and ""Spider-Man: Homecoming.""

And ""Spider-Verse"" has been very well-received among critics, and audiences in exit surveys gave it a rare A+ CinemaScore -- a first for a Spider-Man film. It's also been nominated for a Golden Globe award for best animated feature and picked up a few honors from critics' groups as well, including the New York Film Critics Circle.

""We are playing to both families and fanboys. We're an all-audience film,"" said Adrian Smith, Sony's president of domestic distribution."

As President Donald Trump is said to be mulling ""other options"" for funding his border wall between the U.S. and Mexico, according to the Associated Press, a dark horse arises on the internet.

A GoFundMe campaign popped up Sunday, hoping to raise funds for Trump's proposed wall between the U.S. and Mexico, which isn't news in and of itself. There are plenty of those around.

But the organizers of this campaign are so encouraged that they've raised more-than $700,000 in just three days that they've bumped their original goal of $200 million up to a cool billion.

The GoFundMe organizer is listed as triple-amputee Air Force veteran Brian Kolfage, who lost both legs and his right arm in a blast at Balad Air Force Base in Iraq in 2004, according to the Arizona Daily Star. The fundraiser is titled, ""We the people will fund the wall.""

The contact listing for the organizer says ""The Wall Funding Team"" is located in Miramar, Fla.

""As a veteran who has given so much, 3 limbs, I feel deeply invested to this nation to ensure future generations have everything we have today,"" Kolfage wrote in the GoFundMe campaign description. ""Too many Americans have been murdered by illegal aliens and too many illegals are taking advantage of the United States taxpayers with no means of ever contributing to our society.

""I have grandparents who immigrated to America legally, they did it the correct way and it's time we uphold our laws, and get this wall BUILT! It's up to Americans to help out and pitch in to get this project rolling.""

Multiple studies and reports have shown, though, that illegal immigrants commit crime, violent or nonviolent, at lesser rates than do native-born Americans.

Kolfage's GoFundMe campaign was listed as the ""Top fundraiser"" on the front page of the crowd-sourced social fundraising website as of Wednesday afternoon, despite Kolfage's claims that the platform was trying to hide his fundraiser from potential donors.

Kolfage's Facebook page, where he posts content relevant to his conservative political beliefs, has more than 90,000 followers.

""We have contacted the Trump Administration to secure a point of contact where all funds will go upon completion,"" the campaign says. ""When get this information secured we will update. We have many very high level contacts already helping."""

Twenty-four days into the longest government shutdown in US history, the strain is being felt acutely by the US Coast Guard, as some 42,000 active-duty members are preparing to miss their first paycheck on January 15.

In a January 10 letter, Vice Commandant Adm. Charles Ray said that without an appropriation or funding measure, ""the Coast Guard will not be able to meet the next payroll,"" an extreme disruption that officials averted in late December by moving funds around.""Let me assure you your leadership continues to do everything possible, both internal and external to the Service, to ensure we can process your pay as soon as we receive an appropriation,"" Ray added. ""However, I do not know when that will occur.""

The Army, Navy, Air Force, and Marine Corps are funded through the Defense Department, which got it its fiscal year 2019 budget in the fall, and none of their troops are missing a paycheck.

But the Coast Guard, while technically a military branch, is funded through the Homeland Security Department, funding for which has been held up amid a dispute between President Donald Trump and Congress over $5.7 billion Trump wants to start construction of a wall on the US-Mexico border.

A work-around secured funding for Coast Guard payroll on December 31, paying the service's active-duty members and reservists who drilled before funding lapsed, but service leaders have said it cannot be repeated. Civilian employees are unpaid since December 21.Active-duty members deemed essential have continued working, as have about 1,300 civilian workers. Most of the service's

In the Coast Guard's 14th district, which covers 12.2 million square miles of the Pacific Ocean, 835 active-duty personnel and some civilians are still working from bases in Hawaii and Guam and detachments in Japan and Singapore, carrying out ""essential operations"" such as search-and-rescue and law enforcement, 14th district spokeswoman Chief Sara Muir told Stars and Stripes.

Between December 21 and January 7, the district handled 46 cases, including two major ones, Muir said. On January 13, Coast Guard personnel medevaced a crew member off a fishing vessel 80 miles north of Kauai.

Other operations, like recreational-vessel safety checks and issuing or renewing licenses and other administrative work, has been curtailed. The service has said vendors who provide fuel and other services also won't be paid until funding resumes.

As the shutdown drags on, communities around the country have mustered to support Coast Guard members and families, particularly junior members, many of whom lack savings.

On January 12, dozens of northern Michigan residents gathered for a silent auction and donation event, with funds raised going toward expenses like rent, medical bills, and heating for service members and their families.

""Whenever you cannot predict when you're gonna get your next paycheck, but you know exactly when the bills are due, it causes a lot of stress,"" Kenneth Arbogast, a retired Coast Guard chief petty officer, told UpNorthLive.com. ""And for younger members, young families, that's really a challenge.""

On January 13, more than 600 service members, including 168 families, gathered in Alameda, California, for a giveaway organized by the East Bay Coast Guard Spouses Club, providing them with everything from fresh fruit to diapers.

""It's worrisome. I have to put food in my family's belly,"" said Coast Guard mechanic Kyle Turcott, who is working without pay. ""Ain't no telling, we may not get paid until the first of next month,"" added Nathan Knight, another service member.

The organizers said they were working on another food drive and could host another distribution event this week.

On January 14, Thomas Edison State University in New Jersey announced that Coast Guard students affected by the shutdown would be able to defer payments until tuition assistance was available again. The school has 135 active-duty students - 27 of whom are registered for February.In Rhode Island, Roger Williams University

Navy Federal Credit Union, which serves military members, veterans, and civilian Defense Department employees, has said it would offer no-interest loans up to $6,000 to workers affected by the shutdown, with repayment automatically deducted from paychecks once direct-deposit resumes.

In his January 10 letter, Ray also said that the Coast Guard Mutual Assistance Board had increased the interest-free loans it was offering, focusing on junior members, allowing those with dependents to get up to $1,000.

In Texas, Coast Guard noncommissioned officers have raised money through local chapters of the Coast Guard Petty Officers Association. Last week, they brought in food to cook at Ellington Field Joint Reserve Base, encouraging younger service members to take food home.

Erin Picou, whose husband is a chief petty officer with 17 years experience, said her family could cover the most important bills, but the mortgage for their house, on which they spent their savings six months ago, is less certain.

""It's pretty scary. I don't want the bank to take my new house,"" Picou told The San Antonio Express-News.""I can't speak for them, but I myself think my husband has worked his ass off. He needs to get a paycheck,"" Picou added. ""It's hard to focus on search and rescue if you don't know whether your kids and family are going to have a roof over their head and food on the table.""

Measures have been introduced to Congress to ensure pay for Coast Guard members. However, Ray said, ""I cannot predict what course that legislation may take.""

In a Facebook post on Sunday, Coast Guard commandant Adm. Karl Schultz told service members the branch was continuing ""228 years of military service around the globe,"" including preparations for yearly ice-clearing in Antarctica, maritime-security operations in the Middle East, and drug interdictions in Central and South America.

443,grand forks herald,https://www.grandforksherald.com/news/government-and-politics/4549208-trump-threatens-shut-down-border-government-funding-stalemate,"WASHINGTON - With the partial government shutdown headed toward its second week and no resolution in sight, President Donald Trump on Friday issued a string of tweets in which he once again vowed to close the entire U.S. border with Mexico and halt aid to several Latin American countries unless Democrats agree to his demand for billions of dollars in wall funding.

Trump is also canceling plans to visit his Florida resort, Mar-a-Lago, and will remain in Washington over the New Year holiday, Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney said.

About 25 percent of the federal government has been shut down since Saturday, with roughly 800,000 workers affected, including an estimated 350,000 who are on furlough at home.

""We will be forced to close the Southern Border entirely if the Obstructionist Democrats do not give us the money to finish the Wall & also change the ridiculous immigration laws that our Country is saddled with,"" Trump said in a morning tweet.

In a reprise of his threat before the midterm elections to cut off aid to Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador as a caravan of migrants was making its way toward the United States, Trump said that those three countries ""are doing nothing for the United States but taking our money.""

""Word is that a new Caravan is forming in Honduras and they are doing nothing about it,"" he said, without providing further details. ""We will be cutting off all aid to these 3 countries - taking advantage of U.S. for years!""

Despite Trump's threat, the United States this month announced a new collaboration with Mexico on a program to curb migration from Central American countries, with much of the $10.6 billion U.S. contribution to be drawn from existing aid programs.

Trump's tweets come as Congress has effectively given up on breaking the impasse over the president's demands for border-wall funding, all but ensuring that the partial government shutdown will stretch into at least the start of the new year.

The House and the Senate convened for just minutes on Thursday before gaveling closed until next week. During the brief session in the House, Republicans shot down a Democratic attempt to vote on legislation to reopen the government.

As he did Thursday, Trump remained out of public view on Friday. In an appearance on Fox News, Mulvaney said that the president had ""canceled his plans for Christmas, and now he's canceled his plan for New Year's.""

""He's staying in Washington, D.C., over New Year's,"" said Mulvaney, who is set to become Trump's acting chief of staff next month.

Even though Trump will be in town and Republicans control both chambers of Congress, Mulvaney acknowledged that little progress on a deal is expected until the start of the new Congress on Jan. 3, when Democrats will retake the House. Contending that Democrats ""have simply shut down the discussions,"" he sought to place the blame on House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., who is expected to be elected speaker in the new Congress.

""Nancy Pelosi, in fairness, does not have the votes for the speakership yet,"" Mulvaney said. ""She cannot be seen by her party as being weak on negotiating with Donald Trump. So we fully expect that until she is elected speaker and has locked that vote up, we don't expect to hear from the Democrats again.""

According to a Washington Post tally, Pelosi, who won the Democratic caucus's nomination for the speakership in late November, appears to have secured enough support to be elected speaker in January.

Pelosi's spokesman, Drew Hammill, said in a statement Friday that Democrats ""are united against the President's immoral, ineffective and expensive wall - the wall that he specifically promised that Mexico would pay for.""

Democrats will not consider any offers that have not been publicly endorsed by Trump himself, he said.

""While we await the president's public proposal, Democrats have made it clear that, under a House Democratic majority, we will vote swiftly to reopen government on Day One,"" Hammill said.

At the heart of the stalemate is Trump's demand for $5 billion in funding for his proposed wall at the U.S.-Mexico border. Congressional Democrats have rejected that figure and in recent weeks have refused to publicly endorse a figure above $1.3 billion, which continues existing funding levels and includes money for new border fencing and levee walls, but not the concrete wall Trump once demanded before he started more recently talking about ""steel slats.""

Mulvaney said Friday that ""some folks use the term 'wall' and they mean different things.""

""Everyone agrees that what we can and should be building on that southern border is that steel barrier that the president tweeted out. That's what he wants to build. The Democrats, believe it or not, don't call that a wall,"" he said.

444,myrtlebeachonline,https://www.myrtlebeachonline.com/news/business/national-business/article224277975.html,"The government shutdown has suspended federal cleanups at Superfund sites around the nation and forced the cancellation of public hearings, deepening the mistrust and resentment of surrounding residents who feel people in power long ago abandoned them to live among the toxic residue of the country's factories and mines.

""We are already hurting, and it's just adding more fuel to the fire,"" says 40-year-old Keisha Brown, whose wood-frame home is in a community nestled among coking plants and other factories on Birmingham's north side.

The mostly African-American community has been forced to cope with high levels of arsenic, lead and other contaminants in the soil that the Environmental Protection Agency has been scraping up and carting away, house by house.

As President Donald Trump and Congress battle over Trump's demand for a wall on the southern U.S. border, the nearly 3-week-old partial government shutdown has stopped federal work on Superfund sites except for cases where the administration deems ""there is an imminent threat to the safety of human life or to the protection of property.""

EPA's shutdown plans said the agency would evaluate about 800 Superfund sites to see how many could pose an immediate threat. As an example of that kind of threat, it cited an acid leak from a mine that could threaten the public water supply. That's the hazard at Northern California's Iron Mountain mine, where EPA workers help prevent an unending flow of lethally acidic runoff off the Superfund site from spilling into rivers downstream.

Practically speaking, said Bonnie Bellow, a former EPA official who worked on Superfund public outreach at the agency, the impact of the stoppage of work at sites across the nation ""wholly depends"" on the length of the shutdown.

""Unless there is immediate risk like a storm, a flood, a week or two of slowdowns is not going to very likely affect the cleanup at the site,"" Bellow said.

In north Birmingham, Brown said it's been a couple of weeks since she's spotted any EPA crews at people's houses. It wasn't clear if state workers or contractors were continuing work.

But long before the shutdown began, Brown harbored doubts the cleanup was working anyway. ""My main concern is the health of the people out here,"" said Brown, who has asthma. ""All of us are sick, and we've got to function on medicine every day.""

In terms of time, the federal government shutdown is a chronological blip in the long history of the site -- which includes ethics charges in a local bribery scandal to block federal cleanup efforts -- but adds to the uncertainty in an area where residents feel forgotten and betrayed.

At the EPA, the shutdown has furloughed the bulk of the agency's roughly 14,000 employees. It also means the EPA isn't getting most of the daily stream of environmental questions and tips from the public. Routine inspections aren't happening. State, local and private emails to EPA officials often get automated messages back promising a response when the shutdown ends.

In Montana, for instance, state officials this month found themselves fielding calls from a tribal member worried about drinking water with a funny look to it, said Kristi Ponozzo, public-policy director at that state's Department of Environmental Quality. The EPA normally provides tribes with technical assistance on water supplies.

With most EPA colleagues idled, Ponozzo said, her agency also had to call off an environmental review meeting for a mining project, potentially delaying the project.

But it's the agency's work at Superfund sites -- lessening the threat from old nuclear-weapons plants, chemical factories, mines and other entities -- that gets much of the attention.

Absent imminent peril, it would be up to state governments or contractors to continue any cleanup during the shutdown ""up to the point that additional EPA direction or funding is needed,"" the EPA said in a statement.

""Sites where cleanup activities have been stopped or shut down will be secured until cleanup activities are able to commence when the federal government reopens,"" the agency said.

For federal Superfund sites in Michigan, the shutdown means there are no EPA colleagues to consult, said Scott Dean, a spokesman for that state's Department of Environmental Quality.

At Michigan Superfund sites, day-to-day field operations were continuing since private contractors do most of the on-the-ground work, Dean said.

Bellow, the former EPA official, said the cancellation of hearings about Superfund sites posed immediate concerns.

In East Chicago, Indiana, for example, the EPA called off a planned public hearing set for last Wednesday to outline how the agency planned to clean up high levels of lead and arsenic in the soil.

The EPA has proposed a seven-month, $26.5 million cleanup that includes treating and removing tainted soil from the area, where a lead smelter previously was located.

During a public meeting Nov. 29, some residents complained that the EPA's approach would leave too much pollution in place. But others didn't get a chance to speak and were hoping to do so at the meeting this week, said Debbie Chizewer, a Northwestern University environmental attorney who represents community groups in the low-income area.

The EPA announced the cancellation in an online notice and gave no indication that it would be rescheduled.

Leaders of the East Chicago Calumet Community Advisory Group asked for a new hearing date and an extension of a Jan. 14 public comment deadline in a letter to the EPA's regional Superfund division.

Calls by The Associated Press to the agency's regional office in Chicago this week were not answered.

Local critics fear the EPA will use the delay caused by the shutdown as justification for pushing ahead with a cleanup strategy they consider flawed, Chizewer said, even though the agency has designated the affected area as an ""environmental justice community"" -- a low-income community of color that has been disproportionately harmed by pollution.

The EPA has a ""special obligation"" when dealing with such communities, Chizewer said. ""This would be an example of shutting them out for no good reason.""

In North Birmingham, former longtime neighborhood resident Charlie Powell said most of the people living in and around the Superfund site had already ""just got tired and fed up.""

Powell left the area but started a group called PANIC, People Against Neighborhood Industrial Contamination. He believes money would be better spent helping residents move away from the pollution.

""Can I say hell?"" Powell said when asked what residents have been through.

445,myrtlebeachonline,https://www.myrtlebeachonline.com/news/politics-government/national-politics/article224069750.html,"With illegal immigration at its lowest level in a decade, it's nothing short of stunning that the federal government is shut down over funding for a border wall.

Yet here we are, entering a third week of the shutdown because President Donald Trump has inexplicably chosen to dig his heels in on getting $5 billion to build a wall along stretches of the U.S. border with Mexico that do not already have such a barrier in place.

""As long as it takes,"" Trump said last week when asked how long he was willing to let the shutdown last. ""I mean, look, I'm prepared. I think the people of the country think I'm right. I think the people of this country think I'm right.""

Except, polling shows the opposite. Major polls conducted last month by Quinnipiac, Harvard, NPR and others all showed that a majority of Americans do not support the wall. And the number of wall supporters shrinks even more when asked if it is worth shutting down the government over.

The reality is that immigration from Mexico has been decreasing since 2007, and the number of unauthorized immigrants living in the U.S. is at its lowest level since 2004, according to the Pew Research Center.

Further, the majority of illegal immigration to the United States from Mexico occurs in and around heavily secured ports of entry like San Diego, El Paso and Brownsville, Texas, where 654 miles of wall, fencing and other barriers already exist. Spending billions to build a structure along vast, rural stretches of the border doesn't help with security at the sections of the border that most need help.

No one is arguing for unsecure borders. The newly installed Democratic Congress voted Thursday to approve a stopgap funding bill that would reopen the federal government and provide $1.3 billion for border security in the form of manpower and equipment but not a wall. Trump has said he won't sign it, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell refuses to let a bill come to the Senate floor that the president won't sign.

It's hard to know what the president's end game is. He couldn't get the border wall approved when Republicans controlled both the House and the Senate, so it seems odd to take this stance on the heels of a midterm election in which Democrats made their biggest gains in 40 years and took control of the House.

Trump may feel he is being true to his base of ardent supporters, among whom the border wall ranked high on their list of priorities. But his focus is sorely misplaced. Rather, his attention should be focused on the independent voters who took a chance on him in 2016 believing his style could prove effective at getting things done in Washington. Shutting down the federal government in an effort to get $5 billion for a wall that most Americans don't feel the country needs is the opposite of getting things done.

Laura Kelly is already on the case for Kansas kids with decision to name new DCF leader ' The Kansas City Star

This is why voters elected incoming Gov. Laura Kelly: Because we need to do so much better for Kansas children, because we badly need transparency in state government and because there is zero time to waste in recovering all that was lost under Governors Sam Brownback and Jeff Colyer.

So good for her for marching so briskly into 2019. On Thursday, Kelly announced that she will replace Gina Meier-Hummel as head of the state's child welfare system. The Kansas Department for Children and Families was on what seemed like permanent crisis footing long before Meier-Hummel got there in fall of 2017. But it has remained troubled under her sometimes questionable leadership, and a change was in order.

Meier-Hummel had a difficult job and did make some improvements, which began with a top-to-bottom audit.

But she talked about transparency and didn't show enough of it. She decided to hire inexperienced and unlicensed social workers to fill jobs investigating reports of abuse and neglect. And she replaced contracts for foster care, family preservation and other services with grants that got around rules on no-bid arrangements.

Kelly asked the Colyer administration that she'll soon supplant -- in 11 days, her announcement noted, and we're glad she's counting -- not to implement those grants at this point. Meier-Hummel immediately said she'd honor that request.

The governor-elect also said outright that the state's procurement process wasn't followed and that agency officials had tried to keep her from learning more about how the grantees were chosen.

We wanted Kelly to clean house and name names, for the sake of the state's struggling families, and she's already doing that.

As The Star has reported, the agency gave a major grant to a Florida nonprofit already facing heavy criticism for its foster care. An agency spokeswoman argued that they'd been hired to provide family preservation services, not foster care, but it's still the same nonprofit group.

Meier-Hummel will be succeeded on an interim basis by Laura Howard, who for now will head both the DCF and the Kansas Department for Aging and Disability Services. A former regional administrator in a federal agency overseeing substance abuse and mental health services, Howard is currently director of the Public Management Center in the School of Public Affairs and Administration at the University of Kansas.

Meier-Hummel responded to Kelly's no-nonsense announcement with a news release of her own. It listed her achievements, including starting a new Wichita abuse and neglect reporting line, ""changing key policies and procedures and implementing further mandated training"" and reducing the number of missing and runaway kids by just over a quarter. The suspended grants are in the ""absolute best interest"" of Kansas children and families, the DCF's announcement said.

That's a matter of opinion, but ours is that Kelly has done the right thing and is off to a promising start even before being sworn in as governor."
446,myrtlebeachonline,https://www.myrtlebeachonline.com/news/business/national-business/article223342450.html,"Excerpts from recent editorials in the United States and abroad:

The New York Times on a judge's rebuke of Michael Flynn and President Donald Trump's charitable foundation:

A bit of common sense and common decency intruded on Tuesday into the crazy world of Donald Trump.

In New York, the state attorney general announced that the president had agreed that the ""charity"" he used as a piggy bank has no reason to exist.

In Washington, a federal judge let a former top presidential aide know that you can parrot political spin or you can tell the truth, but you can't do both to someone who can send you to prison.

Michael Flynn, Mr. Trump's former national security adviser, appeared before Judge Emmet Sullivan to be sentenced to what he expected would be a term of probation, after pleading guilty to lying to federal investigators about conversations with the Russian ambassador. The office of the special counsel, Robert Mueller, had earlier filed a memo that said it would be right for Mr. Flynn to avoid prison after his extensive cooperation in the investigation of Trump ties to Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential campaign and after.

Then last week, in a memo about their client's sentencing, Mr. Flynn's lawyers implied that he had been tricked into lying and that the F.B.I. acted improperly in interviewing him -- points raised by pro-Trump commentators elaborating on the president's claims of being victimized by a witch hunt.

Judge Sullivan was having none of it.

""I cannot recall an instance of a court ever accepting a guilty plea from someone who did not maintain he was guilty,"" Judge Sullivan said, ""and I do not intend to start today.""

Chastened, Mr. Flynn told the judge that nobody tricked him, that he lied and that he knew he shouldn't have.

The judge was not upset only about Mr. Flynn's sneaky prevarication. He said he felt ""disgust"" at Mr. Flynn's offenses, that a retired three-star general would lie to the F.B.I. ""while on the physical premises of the White House,"" and, acting as an unregistered agent of a foreign country, Turkey, while he was an adviser to Mr. Trump (to which he admitted but was not charged). It was a bracing reminder of the brazenness of his misdeeds and of the standards the public should be able to expect of those who serve them.

Realizing that Judge Sullivan was considering a term of up to six months in prison, Mr. Flynn accepted his offer to delay the sentencing for 90 days until he has completed his cooperation with the special counsel.

""Good luck today in court to General Michael Flynn,"" Mr. Trump had tweeted first thing Tuesday morning.

""Thanks for nothing, Mr. President,"" Mr. Flynn might have thought as he left court.

Mr. Flynn should be grateful the judge offered him the chance to come clean. By contrast, the Donald J. Trump Foundation, a charity that provided no charity, quite properly received none from the New York attorney general's office.

Attorney General Barbara Underwood accused it of ""a shocking pattern of illegality"" that ""amounted to the Trump Foundation functioning as little more than a checkbook to serve Mr. Trump's business and political interests.""

Whatever money that remains will be disbursed under the supervision of Ms. Underwood's office and the judge overseeing the continuing lawsuit her office filed in June, seeking $2.8 million in restitution and a ban on Mr. Trump and his three oldest children serving on the boards of other nonprofit organizations.

In a series of stories exposing the foundation's true nature, The Washington Post found that its largest donation was to fix a fountain in front of the Plaza Hotel in Manhattan, which Mr. Trump owned at the time, that its funds were used to buy a portrait of Mr. Trump, and that it illegally provided political donations and paid for personal legal settlements.

All this comes just days after prosecutors announced that they believed that Mr. Trump had conspired with the owner of The National Enquirer and his fixer Michael Cohen to violate campaign finance laws by paying hush money to two women who said they had affairs with him. It's also just been reported that prosecutors are investigating spending by the Trump inaugural committee. The president still faces lawsuits on the constitutionality of his enriching himself while in office. Meanwhile, the special counsel's inquiry may be expanding rather than winding down.

It's fitting that despite all his bluster and threats, a president who's demonstrated such contempt for the rule of law is finding it so formidable.

That this goes to the essence of American governance was best summed up by Paula Duncan, the Trump enthusiast who was among the jurors who found Mr. Trump's former campaign chief Paul Manafort guilty of fraud, even though she had hoped he wouldn't be convicted.

Explaining her decision after the verdict, she told Fox News, ""No one's above the law.""

The Wall Street Journal on a judge's ruling on the Affordable Care Act's individual mandate:

No one opposes ObamaCare more than we do, and Democrats are now confirming that it was designed as a way-station to government-run health care. But a federal judge's ruling that the law is unconstitutional is likely to be overturned on appeal and may boomerang politically on Republicans.

Judge Reed O'Connor ruled for some 20 state plaintiffs that the Affordable Care Act's individual mandate is no longer legal because Republicans repealed its financial penalty as part of the 2017 tax reform. Recall that Chief Justice John Roberts joined four Justices to say ObamaCare's mandate was illegal as a command to individuals to buy insurance under the Commerce Clause. ""The Framers gave Congress the power to regulate commerce, not to compel it,"" he wrote.

Yet the Chief famously salvaged ObamaCare by unilaterally rewriting the mandate to be a ""tax"" that was within Congress's power. Never mind that Democrats had expressly said the penalty was not a tax. Majority Leader Roberts declared it to be so.

Enter Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, who argues in Texas v. U.S. that since Congress has repealed the mandate, the tax is no longer a tax, and ObamaCare is thus illegal. Judge O'Connor agreed with that logic, and he went further in ruling that since Congress said the mandate is crucial to the structure of ObamaCare, then all of ObamaCare must fall along with the mandate.

We'll admit to a certain satisfaction in seeing the Chief Justice hoist on his own logic. But his ruling in NFIB v. Sebelius was in 2012 and there is more at issue legally now than the ""tax"" issue in that opinion. One legal complication is that Congress in 2017 repealed the financial part of the individual mandate, not the structure of the mandate itself. Republicans used budget rules to pass tax reform so they couldn't repeal the mandate's express language.

The Affordable Care Act has also been up and running since 2014, which means so-called reliance interests come into play when considering a precedent. Millions of people now rely on ObamaCare's subsidies and rules, which argues against judges repealing the law by fiat.

Judge O'Connor breezes past this like a liberal Ninth Circuit appeals judge handling a Donald Trump appeal. He's right that Democrats claimed the individual mandate was essential to the Affordable Care Act. But when Congress killed the financial penalty in 2017 it left the rest of ObamaCare intact. When judging congressional intent, a judge must account for the amending Congress as well as the original Congress.

In any case, the Supreme Court's ""severability"" doctrine calls for restraint in declaring an entire law illegal merely because one part of it is. Our guess is that even the right-leaning Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals judges will overturn Judge O'Connor on this point.

As for the politics, Democrats claim to be alarmed by the ruling but the truth is they're elated. They want to use it to further pound Republicans for denying health insurance for pre-existing conditions if the law is overturned. Democrats campaigned across the country against Mr. Paxton's lawsuit to gain House and Senate seats in November, and they will now press votes in Congress so they can compound the gains in 2020.

President Trump hailed the ruling in a tweet, but he has never understood the Affordable Care Act. His Administration has done good work revising regulations to reduce health-care costs and increase access, but the risk is that the lawsuit will cause Republicans in Congress to panic politically and strike a deal with Democrats that reinforces ObamaCare. This is what happens when conservatives fall into the liberal trap of thinking they can use the courts to achieve policy goals that need to be won in Congress.

The Washington Post on withdrawing all 2,000 U.S. troops out of Syria:

PRESIDENT TRUMP'S sudden move to yank U.S. troops out of Syria undermined at a stroke several foreign policy goals he has championed. The president promised to finish the job of destroying the Islamic State, but the withdrawal will leave thousands of its fighters still in place. He vowed to roll back Iran's aggression across the Middle East, but his decision will allow its forces to entrench in the country that is the keystone of Tehran's ambitions. He promised to protect Israel, but that nation will now be left to face alone the buildup by Iran and its proxies along its northern border.

The president's top national security advisers had carefully developed and articulated a strategy of maintaining a U.S. presence in Syria until the Islamic State was beyond revival and Iran withdrew its forces -- a plan they were defending up until this week. Mr. Trump has again demonstrated, to them and to the world, that no U.S. policy or foreign commitment is immune from his whims.

Mr. Trump claimed the Islamic State had been defeated, but that is not the view of the Defense and State Departments. Thousands of jihadist fighters are still in Syria and control splotches of territory in the Euphrates Valley. A U.S. withdrawal will give the extremists an opportunity to reconstitute, as they did in Iraq following the premature U.S. withdrawal ordered by President Barack Obama.

Until Wednesday, a prime talking point of senior national security officials was that, ""if we've learned one thing over the years, (the) enduring defeat of a group like this means you can't just defeat their physical space and then leave,"" as the State Department's special envoy for the global campaign against the Islamic State, Brett McGurk, put it last week. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said it another way in September: ""Getting rid of the caliphate doesn't mean you then blindly say, 'Okay, we got rid of it,' march out, and then wonder why the caliphate comes back.""

Mr. Trump has justified some of his most controversial decisions, including his continued support for Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, as needed to contain Iran's threat to the United States and its allies. But the Syrian withdrawal hands Tehran and its ally Russia a windfall. Iran has deployed thousands of fighters and allied militiamen to Syria and aspires to create a corridor to Lebanon and the Mediterranean, as well as a new front against Israel along the Golan Heights. In reaction to that threat, Mr. Trump's national security adviser, John Bolton, announced Sept. 24 that ""We're not going to leave (Syria) as long as Iranian troops are outside Iranian borders, and that includes Iranian proxies and militias.""

U.S. ambitions in Syria have never been backed by adequate resources, and a case could be made that neither Congress nor the American public were prepared to support the mission suggested by Mr. Bolton. But Mr. Trump's decision appears to have been precipitated by the bellicose rhetoric of Turkey's Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who last week threatened -- not for the first time -- a military operation against Syrian Kurds, even though U.S. troops are positioned around them. The autocratic Turkish ruler appears to have extracted multiple favors from Mr. Trump in recent days, including the sale of U.S. Patriot missiles and a promise to reexamine the possible extradition of his rival, Fethullah Gulen, from Pennsylvania. If Mr. Trump received anything in return, he hasn't disclosed it.

The Syrian Kurdish forces, which have fought alongside the United States and played a crucial role in liberating most of eastern Syria from the jihadists, will be perhaps the foremost victims of Mr. Trump's decision. Betrayed by Washington, they will now be subject to a military offensive by Turkey. The stab in the back will send an unforgettable message to all who are asked to cooperate with the United States in the fight against terrorism: Washington is an unreliable and dangerous partner.

The Orange County (California) Register on Mick Mulvaney as Trump's choice for chief of staff:

President Trump has found a new chief of staff, albeit an interim one, in his director of the Office of Management and Budget, Mick Mulvaney.

That of chief is a terribly important post, perhaps government's most consequential aside from that of his boss. In theory, at least, the chief of staff is the gatekeeper for everything the president does, everyone he sees, everyone he talks to on the phone.

Perhaps, though few would expect this to be the case, the arbiter of every time he sends out a tweet, and of what it should say.

A Washington insider, a former congressman, Mulvaney is in many ways ideal for the job. He wants it, badly, whereas others with similarly impressive resumes touted for the job have indicated a strong desire to spend more time with their families, from Vice President Pence's staff chief Nick Ayers of Georgia to former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie.

Mulvaney shares the conservative values currently espoused by the president and was a founder of the House Freedom Caucus in 2013, the group that always taunted the Republican leadership, opposing much government funding, including debt limit increases and budget agreements made with the Democrats.

But he also, after Trump secured the Republican nomination in 2016, called the candidate ""a terrible human being"" who he only was voting for out of an even greater dislike of Hillary Clinton.

It's not as if other presidential allies of today haven't said bad things about him in the past. On the campaign trail, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz called his rival ""a narcissist at a level I don't think this country's ever seen,"" for instance.

But if you were the nation's chief executive -- or the CEO of a much smaller entity, for that matter -- could you hire as your top aide and work with a person who had once dubbed you ""terrible""?

Or does this kind of talk come with the territory in politics, where many strange bedfellows are made because of having to run in elections against once and perhaps future allies? Should Trump indeed elevate this practical choice for staff chief to permanent status immediately?

Los Angeles Times on banning bump stocks, which allow semi-automatic weapons to fire like machine guns:

The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives said Tuesday that it had finalized a rule reclassifying so-called bump stocks -- the devices that can make a semiautomatic rifle fire nearly as quickly a fully automatic weapon -- as machine guns, which makes it illegal to manufacture, sell or possess them. The agency said a year ago it had the authority to reclassify the devices, and President Trump -- in the wake of the Parkland, Fla., school shooting -- directed the ATF to speed up the process. Tuesday's announcement -- a rare bit of welcome news from the Trump administration -- makes it official; White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters that owners of the conversion devices will have until March 21 to destroy them or turn them in to the ATF.

This is a good step. Unfortunately, it's all but certain to be challenged in the courts, and it's on shaky legal ground because of the way the new rule evolved. The Obama administration determined that because bump stocks have ""no automatically functioning mechanical parts and (perform) no automated mechanical functions when installed,"" they did not fit the definition of a machine gun in federal law, which meant the ATF lacked the authority to regulate them. Tuesday's announcement, by contrast, hinges not on the technical specifications, but on the functionality. In essence, if it fires like a machine gun, it's a machine gun. Cue the lawyers.

We hope the administration prevails in whatever challenges emerge, but the sure-fire way to resolve this would be for Congress to legislate bump stocks and related gadgets out of existence. Such devices serve no function other than to evade the strict congressional limit on machine guns by, as the ATF said, harnessing ""the recoil energy of the semiautomatic firearm in a manner that allows the trigger to reset and continue firing"" without the shooter having to pull the trigger for each shot.

A mass shooter in Las Vegas used bump stocks affixed to semiautomatic rifles to fire more than 1,000 rounds in a matter of minutes from a 32nd-floor suite of the Mandalay Bay Hotel into a crowd of some 20,000 people, killing 58 concertgoers and injuring hundreds of others. It was the largest single mass shooting in the modern era, drawing attention to bump stocks and sparking outraged demands by many -- the Los Angeles Times included -- that the devices be banned.

As welcome as this new rule is, it will do little to corral our national problem with gun violence. The vast majority of gun deaths come in ones and twos, led by suicides. ...

But it is progress. And the president deserves credit for sticking with his promise to find a way to ban bump stocks. ...

China Daily says telecommunications giant Huawei is a victim of U.S. panic attacks:

This year has not been an annus mirabilis for China's Huawei Technologies Ltd, the world's largest supplier of telecommunications network equipment and second-biggest maker of smartphones.

Although it has been constantly in the news and it is said there is no such thing as bad publicity, it has been making headlines because of the spurious claims it somehow poses a threat to the West, even world peace. It has never been explained exactly how.

In fact it is not because of anything it has done, but because its success has brought it into the crosshairs of the United States' anxiety attacks against China.

Huawei is at the forefront of 5G technology. This latest generation mobile network technology promises to bring the much anticipated and heralded internet of things to life and the US is determined to be the 5G leader.

Not only because whichever country develops the technology that is adopted as standard will have a huge commercial advantage. But also because by setting the standard it will have a knowledge advantage.

As a result, first the US and then one after another its most obedient allies have blocked Huawei from entering their 5G markets on security grounds.

None of them have offered any specific justification for blocking Huawei. They just repeat their claim that the company poses a security risk. That is why objective observers have concluded that those countries are politicizing a commercial issue.

It sets a harmful precedent. What if other countries used the same excuse to block US companies (not confined to the telecom sector)? The US companies are very competitive in many fields, including those that could pose huge security risks, such as finance.

While Huawei will not go unscathed from being prevented from entering key markets, as a competitive player, it still has a vast market to access in other parts of the world. It has signed contracts to supply 5G equipment to 25 telecom carriers, and more than 10,000 5G base stations have been shipped.

In stark contrast to the US and its allies, India for instance, has invited Huawei to conduct 5G trials in the country and complimented it on the role it has played in helping to develop its telecom industry.

The efforts of the US and its allies to try to shield their companies against a Chinese competitor are politically motivated, not the result of a fact-based or transparent decision-making process. And they are counterproductive to the concerted efforts that are needed to ensure the security of 5G networks."

One Republican senator says he's offered President Donald Trump a possible solution, though it may just be wishful thinking.

Sen. Lindsey Graham is encouraging Trump to reopen government for several weeks to continue negotiating with Democrats over the border wall Trump wants to build on the U.S.-Mexico border. If there's no deal at the end of that time, Graham says Trump would be free to take the more dramatic step of declaring a national emergency to build it.

But the South Carolina Republican says Trump still wants a deal on funding for the wall before agreeing to reopen shuttered government departments. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat, insists Trump reopen the government first.

Their weeks-old standoff led to the partial government shutdown, now on day 24 without a clear end in sight.

""Before he pulls the plug on the legislative option, and I think we're almost there, I would urge him to open up the government for a short period of time, like three weeks, before he pulls the plug, see if we can get a deal,"" Graham said. ""If we can't at the end of three weeks, all bets are off.

""See if he can do it by himself through the emergency powers. That's my recommendation,"" added Graham, who has publicly pushed Trump to use his authority to declare a national emergency to build the wall. Such a step would allow Trump to bypass Congress and tap various pots of unspent federal money, including for military construction and disaster relief as well as from assets seized by law enforcement, to pay for the wall.

Trump has kept Washington on edge over whether he would resort to such a declaration, citing what he says is a ""crisis"" of drug smuggling and the trafficking of women and children at the border. The president initially sounded as though such a move was imminent, but then pulled back. He has said several times since he first mentioned the idea in public this month that he prefers a legislative solution.

A key question is how much more time is Trump willing to give lawmakers. Graham, who spoke with Trump by telephone on Sunday morning, said the legislative path ""is just about shut off"" and blamed intransigence by Pelosi.

The speaker's office had no immediate comment.

Democrats oppose an emergency declaration but may be powerless to block it. Some Republicans are wary, too, fearing how a future Democratic president might use that authority. Such a move, should Trump ultimately go that route, would almost certainly be challenged in the courts.

Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., called Graham's idea to reopen the government a ""great place to start.""

""I do think if we reopen the government, if the president ends this shutdown crisis, we have folks who can negotiate a responsible, modern investment in technology that will actually make us safer,"" Coons said.

Trump says technology is nice, but that the border can't be secured without a wall.

The White House has been laying the groundwork for an emergency declaration, which is feared by lawmakers in both parties.

Senate Homeland Security Committee Chairman Ron Johnson, R-Wis., said he'd ""hate to see"" a declaration issued because the wall wouldn't get built, presumably because of legal challenges. Democrats voted in the past for border security and should again, he said.

""I actually want to see this wall get built,"" Johnson said. ""I want to keep pressure on Democrats to actually come to the negotiating table in good faith and fund what they have supported in the past.""

Graham favors a declaration and said the time for talk is running out.

Darlene Superville, The Associated Press"
450,the tribune,https://www.sanluisobispo.com/news/business/article224126560.html,"The Latest on President Donald Trump and the partial government shutdown (all times local):

3:16 p.m.

Congressional leaders from both parties have returned to the White House for another round of negotiations with President Donald Trump on the ongoing partial government shutdown.

The two sides have made no apparent progress in the past week, with Trump sticking to his demand of $5.7 billion for a border barrier and Democrats insisting they won't give him the money.

Trump has been making a public case that there is a ""crisis"" at the southern border. And he's still threatening to declare a national emergency to circumvent Congress if he can't get the wall money from them.

He told reporters during a visit to the Capitol earlier Wednesday that he may turn to a declaration ""at some point"" if top Democrats Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi ""don't agree"" with his assessment about the problems at the border.

President Donald Trump says Republicans are ""totally unified"" in the shutdown standoff over his long-promised southern border wall, though some GOP lawmakers have been expressing concern about the 19-day partial government closure.

Trump traveled to Capitol Hill on Wednesday to meet with Senate Republicans. He says there was ""no discussion about anything other than solidarity.""

Trump has been considering a national emergency declaration to bypass Congress to build the wall. He says he ""may do that at some point"" if he can't get a deal with Democrats.

Trump also plans to meet with top congressional Democrats and Republicans at the White House on Wednesday.

President Donald Trump arrived on Capitol Hill claiming he has ""tremendous"" support as he headed into a meeting with Republican senators uneasy with the government shutdown over his border wall.

Asked how long the shutdown would last, Trump told reporters Wednesday ""whatever it takes.""

The partial shutdown is now in its 19th day, the second longest ever.

Trump and Vice President Mike Pence arrived for the private lunch meeting with the Senate GOP caucus to shore up support.

Several Republican senators have said the government should be re-opened while talks continue over border security and Trump's demand for money to build the wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.

President Donald Trump says he thinks he and the Democrats are ""getting closer"" to a deal to end the budget stalemate that has partially shut down the government despite no evidence that any progress has been made.

And he's suggesting the partial government shutdown could be ""a blessing in disguise"" because, he suggests, it could lead to a broader immigration deal.

Trump spoke Wednesday during an Oval Office bill signing on anti-human trafficking legislation. It's a day after he delivered a prime-time address trying to make the case for his long-stalled U.S.-Mexico border wall.

Trump says that he would like to see ""real immigration reform in this country because we need it."" He says, ""Everybody wants to see immigration reform,"" adding that perhaps the stalemate ""will turn out to be a blessing in disguise.""

Gone are the days when the U.S. and Mexican governments regularly exchanged statements over President Donald Trump's insistence on a border wall.

Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said Wednesday he won't be drawn into what he calls a U.S. internal dispute, an apparent reference to the 19-day-old partial U.S. government shutdown over a border barrier.

Lopez Obrador says, ""We are not going to respond to situations arising from internal affairs in the United States.""

Unlike his predecessor, the Mexican leader didn't have to respond to any specific aspersion about Mexico, because Trump didn't make any in his Tuesday night address to the American public. Relations between the two leaders have been surprisingly cordial, given their ideological differences.

Lopez Obrador said, ""Of course, there are those ... who want us to get into a confrontation. We always want a friendly relationship with the United States, a cooperative relationship.""

As a presidential candidate Trump promised Mexico would pay for a border wall, but Mexico refused.

President Donald Trump is using a bill signing focused on curbing human trafficking to push his case for a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border.

Trump says a southern border that is not secured exacerbates the incidents of human trafficking. He says, ""As long as we have a border that is not secure, we're going to suffer the consequences of that.""

Wednesday's bill signing came a day after Trump's prime-time speech designed to persuade Americans that illegal immigration and trafficking at the border are a crisis.

Democrats have called Trump's promised wall costly, ineffective and ""immoral"" and say he's ""manufacturing a crisis.""

The bill Trump signed is designed to enhance an annual State Department report that measures global efforts to eliminate human trafficking.

The White House says it's the fourth bipartisan bill the Republican president has signed in the last few weeks to prevent human trafficking.

Congressional Democrats say they'll head to the White House with the plan to reopen the government -- the same one they've been presenting. They're asking President Donald Trump to accept a bipartisan bill to fund border security without the wall.

Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Wednesday the president ""could end the Trump shutdown and re-open the government today, and he should.""

Pelosi and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer spoke at an event where they were flanked by federal workers going without pay during the shutdown, now in its 19th day.

Schumer called workers the ""collateral damage"" of Trump's ""temper tantrum."" He said the president failed to ""persuade a soul"" during his ""divisive"" prime-time address Tuesday night to the nation.

Trump meets with congressional leaders at the White House Wednesday afternoon. He rejected the Senate's bipartisan funding bill in December, sparking the shutdown.

The White House is trying to keep jittery congressional Republicans from defecting over the toll the partial government shutdown is taking in their states.

President Donald Trump and Democrats have been at an impasse over funding for his proposed border wall, which has led to a partial government shutdown, now in its 19th day.

Trump meets with Senate Republicans Wednesday on Capitol Hill just hours after he argued on national television that a border wall was needed to resolve a security and humanitarian ""crisis.""

Senators say the shutdown has led to disruptions in agricultural payments for farmers, as well as for home buyers trying to secure government-backed home loans. Lawmakers also are worried about missed paychecks for government workers Friday.

As many as half a dozen GOP senators have said the government should reopen while border security negotiations with Democrats continue.

President Donald Trump again linked illegal immigration along the southern border with drugs and violent crime as he urged Democratic lawmakers to fund his proposed border wall.

In his first national address from the Oval Office, the president gave no indication he was softening his stance that the partial government shutdown would continue without money for the wall.

Trump argued Tuesday night that the wall was needed to resolve what he called a security and humanitarian ""crisis.""

He addressed the nation as the shutdown stretched through its third week, with hundreds of thousands of federal workers going without pay and some congressional Republicans growing increasingly jittery about the impasse.

Trump plans to visit Senate Republicans at the Capitol on Wednesday before meeting with Democratic leaders at the White House."
451,the tribune,https://www.sanluisobispo.com/news/nation-world/national/article223193915.html,"White House digs in on border wall demand, risking shutdown

WASHINGTON (AP) -- The White House on Sunday pushed the federal government closer to the brink of a partial shutdown later this week, digging in on its demand for $5 billion to build a border wall as congressional Democrats stood firm against it.

""We're going to do whatever is necessary to build the border wall to stop this ongoing crisis of illegal immigration,"" said White House senior adviser Stephen Miller.

Asked if that meant having a government shutdown, he said: ""If it comes to it, absolutely.""

Trump said last week he would be ""proud"" to have a shutdown to get Congress to approve a $5 billion down payment to fulfill his campaign promise to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. But the president doesn't have the votes from the Republican-controlled Congress to support funding for the wall at that level.

Democratic congressional leaders, Sen. Chuck Schumer and Rep. Nancy Pelosi, have proposed no more than $1.6 billion, as outlined in a bipartisan Senate bill. The money would not go for the wall but for fencing upgrades and other border security. Democrats also offered to simply keep funding at its current level, $1.3 billion.

Trump lawyer Giuliani rules out Mueller interview with Trump

WASHINGTON (AP) -- With a number of probes moving closer to the Oval Office, President Donald Trump and his attorney unleashed a fresh series of attacks on the investigators, questioning their integrity while categorically ruling out the possibility of a presidential interview with the special counsel.

Trump and Rudy Giuliani used Twitter and television interviews Sunday to deliver a series of broadsides against special counsel Robert Mueller and federal prosecutors in New York. Giuliani said he was ""disgusted"" by the tactics used by Mueller in his probe into Russian election interference, including in securing guilty pleas from the president's former national security adviser Michael Flynn on a charge of lying to federal investigators.

Trump, Giuliani said, would not submit to an interview by Mueller's team.

""They're a joke,"" Giuliani told ""Fox News Sunday."" ''Over my dead body, but, you know, I could be dead.""

The special counsel, who is investigating possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russia, has continued to request an interview with the president. Last month, the White House sent written answers in response to the special counsel's questions about possible collusion. The White House has resisted answering questions on possible obstruction of justice.

Child's death highlights communication barriers on border

Shortly before a 7-year-old Guatemalan girl died in U.S. custody, her father signed a form stating that his daughter was in good health. But it's unclear how much the man understood on the form, which was written in English and read to him in Spanish by Border Patrol agents.

The death of Jakelin Caal highlights the communication challenges along the U.S.-Mexico border as agents come in contact with an increasing number of migrants who speak neither English nor Spanish.

Her father's native language is the Mayan tongue known as Q'eqchi'. His second language is Spanish. It's unclear whether something was lost in translation or whether it would have made a difference in saving Jakelin after the two were detained and underwent a health screening along a remote stretch of U.S.-Mexico border. But the case raises questions about the Border Patrol's use of English-only forms.

All agents are required to speak Spanish, and they receive formal Spanish training. Reading forms in Spanish is often enough to pose basic questions. But some other Spanish-speaking migrants reported signing paperwork that they later said they did not understand.

Scores of immigrant parents who were separated from their children after crossing the border in the spring said they signed forms agreeing to be deported with the understanding that their kids would be returning with them, only to find themselves deported without them. Many had to wait months before being reunited with them in their homelands.

Talks adopt 'rulebook' to put Paris climate deal into action

KATOWICE, Poland (AP) -- Almost 200 nations, including the world's top greenhouse gas producers, China and the United States, have adopted a set of rules meant to breathe life into the 2015 Paris climate accord by setting out how countries should report their emissions and efforts to reduce them.

But negotiators delayed other key decisions until next year -- a move that frustrated environmentalists and countries that wanted more ambitious goals in light of scientists' warnings that the world must shift sharply away from fossil fuels in the coming decade.

""The majority of the rulebook for the Paris agreement has been created, which is something to be thankful for,"" said Mohamed Adow, a climate policy expert at Christian Aid. ""But the fact countries had to be dragged kicking and screaming to the finish line shows that some nations have not woken up"" to the dire consequences of global warming as outlined in a report by the U.N Panel on Climate Change, or IPCC.

Officials at the talks, which ended late Saturday in the Polish city of Katowice, agreed upon universal rules on how nations can cut emissions. Poor countries secured assurances on financial support to help them reduce emissions, adapt to changes such as rising sea levels and pay for damage that has already happened.

""Through this package, you have made a thousand little steps forward together,"" said Michal Kurtyka, a senior Polish official who led the talks.

French city honors victims of Christmas market attack

PARIS (AP) -- People filled a square in the French city of Strasbourg on Sunday to show respect and sympathy for the victims of last week's shooting attack near a famous Christmas market as the death toll rose to five.

French authorities said a Polish man died in a Strasbourg hospital Sunday, one of a dozen people wounded in last Tuesday's attack. Poland's Foreign Ministry extended condolences Sunday on Twitter to his family.

According to the newspaper DNA, more than 1,000 people attended the memorial, which ended with a minute of applause and a rendition of France's national anthem, ""La Marseillaise.""

The hour-long ceremony took place in Kleber Square, not far from where a gunman opened fire on Tuesday evening. Strasbourg Mayor Roland Ries praised the city's resilience in the face of hardship.

The ""extremely large crowd in the Christmas market"" on Saturday ""was an illustration of our commitment to these values ??on which our living together is based, which we will continue to defend against all those who want to attack it,"" Ries said.

Not into bingo, 84-year-old Texas woman gets college degree

RICHARDSON, Texas (AP) -- After raising five kids and retiring at age 77 from her secretarial job, Janet Fein couldn't be blamed for finally relaxing, but that's not her.

Fein, now 84, went to back to school and will accomplish a long-held goal this week when she graduates from the University of Texas at Dallas with a bachelor's degree.

""I didn't have anything to do in retirement and I didn't think that playing bingo was up to my speed,"" said Fein, who majored in sociology because she felt it was ""substantial.""

She said she enjoyed all the reading and writing papers. ""With each class I already knew a lot, but then I also learned a lot. And that made me happy,"" she said.

People 65 and older make up less than one percent of U.S. college students. In 2015, they accounted for about 67,000 of about 20 million college students, according to the National Center for Education Statistics.

Next-generation of GPS satellites are headed to space

DENVER (AP) -- After months of delays, the U.S. Air Force is about to launch the first of a new generation of GPS satellites, designed to be more accurate, secure and versatile.

But some of their most highly touted features will not be fully available until 2022 or later because of problems in a companion program to develop a new ground control system for the satellites, government auditors said.

The satellite is scheduled to lift off Tuesday from Cape Canaveral, Florida, aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. It's the first of 32 planned GPS III satellites that will replace older ones now in orbit. Lockheed Martin is building the new satellites outside Denver.

GPS is best-known for its widespread civilian applications, from navigation to time-stamping bank transactions. The Air Force estimates that 4 billion people worldwide use the system.

But it was developed by the U.S. military, which still designs, launches and operates the system. The Air Force controls a constellation of 31 GPS satellites from a high-security complex at Schriever Air Force Base outside Colorado Springs.

After fraud probe, new primary may replace GOP candidate

RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- Legislation quickly passed by North Carolina's lawmakers this week would prepare a path for Republicans to dump their nominee in a still-undecided U.S. House race marred with ballot fraud allegations.

""I think (legislators are) worried that Mark Harris might be damaged goods and they want to have the opportunity to have a different Republican nominee,"" said Carter Wrenn, a Republican operative and consultant to former U.S. Sen. Jesse Helms and others for more than 40 years. ""That's how I read those tea leaves.""

If the state elections board decides ballot irregularities or other problems cast the true outcome into doubt and force a redo, the legislation -- if allowed to go into law by Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper -- would require new primary elections in the 9th Congressional District race, in addition to a new general election.

That would allow Republicans another look at Mark Harris, the Republican who led Democrat Dan McCready by 905 votes in unofficial results. Harris hasn't been certified the winner, and an investigation is looking into missing absentee ballots in rural Bladen County and whether unsealed ballots illegally handled by collection teams there could have been altered.

Bladen was the only county among the eight within the 9th District where Harris won a majority of mail-in absentee ballots over McCready.

Top of mind: 'Justice' is Merriam-Webster's word of the year

NEW YORK (AP) -- Racial justice. Obstruction of justice. Social justice. The Justice Department. Merriam-Webster has chosen ""justice"" as its 2018 word of the year, driven by the churning news cycle over months and months.

The word follows ""toxic,"" picked by Oxford Dictionaries, and ""misinformation,"" plucked by Dictonary.com.

Peter Sokolowski, Merriam-Webster's editor at large, told The Associated Press ahead of Monday's announcement that ""justice"" consistently bubbled into the top 20 or 30 lookups on the company's website, spiking at times due to specific events but also skating close to the surface for much of the year.

While it's one of those common words people likely know how to spell and use correctly in a sentence, Sokolowski pointed to other reasons that drive search traffic. Among them is an attempt to focus a train of thought around a philosophical problem, or to seek aspirational motivation. Such well-known words are often among the most looked up every year, including those that are slightly abstract, including ""love,"" he said.

The designation for ""justice"" came soon after President Trump's one-time fixer, Michael Cohen, was sentenced to three years in prison for crimes that included arranging the payment of hush money to conceal his boss' alleged sexual affairs. He told a judge he agreed time and again to cover up Trump's ""dirty deeds"" out of ""blind loyalty.""

'Spider-Verse' swings to the top; 'Mortal Engines' tanks

LOS ANGELES (AP) -- ""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse"" swung to the top of the domestic box office in its first weekend in theaters, proving that there is widespread audience interest in big screen animated versions of Marvel's marquee superheroes.

The film led a host of newcomers that debuted to varying success on this pre-Christmas holiday weekend, including Clint Eastwood's drug smuggling drama ""The Mule"" and the Peter Jackson-produced epic ""Mortal Engines"" which bombed in North American theaters.

""Into the Spider-Verse"" earned an estimated $35.4 million from 3,813 theaters against a $90 million production budget according to Sony Pictures on Sunday, which is a record for animated movies in December (although the hybrid ""Alvin and the Chipmunks"" movies were higher). The film features an innovative animation style -- both CGI and hand-drawn -- and focuses on the Miles Morales character as he learns to become the famed web-slinger. It's another financial win for the studio's latest ""expanded Spider-Man universe"" strategy following ""Venom"" and ""Spider-Man: Homecoming.""

And ""Spider-Verse"" has been very well-received among critics, and audiences in exit surveys gave it a rare A+ CinemaScore -- a first for a Spider-Man film. It's also been nominated for a Golden Globe award for best animated feature and picked up a few honors from critics' groups as well, including the New York Film Critics Circle.

""We are playing to both families and fanboys. We're an all-audience film,"" said Adrian Smith, Sony's president of domestic distribution."
452,the tribune,https://www.sanluisobispo.com/news/politics-government/national-politics/article224069750.html,"With illegal immigration at its lowest level in a decade, it's nothing short of stunning that the federal government is shut down over funding for a border wall.

Yet here we are, entering a third week of the shutdown because President Donald Trump has inexplicably chosen to dig his heels in on getting $5 billion to build a wall along stretches of the U.S. border with Mexico that do not already have such a barrier in place.

""As long as it takes,"" Trump said last week when asked how long he was willing to let the shutdown last. ""I mean, look, I'm prepared. I think the people of the country think I'm right. I think the people of this country think I'm right.""

Except, polling shows the opposite. Major polls conducted last month by Quinnipiac, Harvard, NPR and others all showed that a majority of Americans do not support the wall. And the number of wall supporters shrinks even more when asked if it is worth shutting down the government over.

The reality is that immigration from Mexico has been decreasing since 2007, and the number of unauthorized immigrants living in the U.S. is at its lowest level since 2004, according to the Pew Research Center.

Further, the majority of illegal immigration to the United States from Mexico occurs in and around heavily secured ports of entry like San Diego, El Paso and Brownsville, Texas, where 654 miles of wall, fencing and other barriers already exist. Spending billions to build a structure along vast, rural stretches of the border doesn't help with security at the sections of the border that most need help.

No one is arguing for unsecure borders. The newly installed Democratic Congress voted Thursday to approve a stopgap funding bill that would reopen the federal government and provide $1.3 billion for border security in the form of manpower and equipment but not a wall. Trump has said he won't sign it, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell refuses to let a bill come to the Senate floor that the president won't sign.

It's hard to know what the president's end game is. He couldn't get the border wall approved when Republicans controlled both the House and the Senate, so it seems odd to take this stance on the heels of a midterm election in which Democrats made their biggest gains in 40 years and took control of the House.

Trump may feel he is being true to his base of ardent supporters, among whom the border wall ranked high on their list of priorities. But his focus is sorely misplaced. Rather, his attention should be focused on the independent voters who took a chance on him in 2016 believing his style could prove effective at getting things done in Washington. Shutting down the federal government in an effort to get $5 billion for a wall that most Americans don't feel the country needs is the opposite of getting things done.

Laura Kelly is already on the case for Kansas kids with decision to name new DCF leader ' The Kansas City Star

This is why voters elected incoming Gov. Laura Kelly: Because we need to do so much better for Kansas children, because we badly need transparency in state government and because there is zero time to waste in recovering all that was lost under Governors Sam Brownback and Jeff Colyer.

So good for her for marching so briskly into 2019. On Thursday, Kelly announced that she will replace Gina Meier-Hummel as head of the state's child welfare system. The Kansas Department for Children and Families was on what seemed like permanent crisis footing long before Meier-Hummel got there in fall of 2017. But it has remained troubled under her sometimes questionable leadership, and a change was in order.

Meier-Hummel had a difficult job and did make some improvements, which began with a top-to-bottom audit.

But she talked about transparency and didn't show enough of it. She decided to hire inexperienced and unlicensed social workers to fill jobs investigating reports of abuse and neglect. And she replaced contracts for foster care, family preservation and other services with grants that got around rules on no-bid arrangements.

Kelly asked the Colyer administration that she'll soon supplant -- in 11 days, her announcement noted, and we're glad she's counting -- not to implement those grants at this point. Meier-Hummel immediately said she'd honor that request.

The governor-elect also said outright that the state's procurement process wasn't followed and that agency officials had tried to keep her from learning more about how the grantees were chosen.

We wanted Kelly to clean house and name names, for the sake of the state's struggling families, and she's already doing that.

As The Star has reported, the agency gave a major grant to a Florida nonprofit already facing heavy criticism for its foster care. An agency spokeswoman argued that they'd been hired to provide family preservation services, not foster care, but it's still the same nonprofit group.

Meier-Hummel will be succeeded on an interim basis by Laura Howard, who for now will head both the DCF and the Kansas Department for Aging and Disability Services. A former regional administrator in a federal agency overseeing substance abuse and mental health services, Howard is currently director of the Public Management Center in the School of Public Affairs and Administration at the University of Kansas.

Meier-Hummel responded to Kelly's no-nonsense announcement with a news release of her own. It listed her achievements, including starting a new Wichita abuse and neglect reporting line, ""changing key policies and procedures and implementing further mandated training"" and reducing the number of missing and runaway kids by just over a quarter. The suspended grants are in the ""absolute best interest"" of Kansas children and families, the DCF's announcement said.

That's a matter of opinion, but ours is that Kelly has done the right thing and is off to a promising start even before being sworn in as governor."
453,the tribune,https://www.sanluisobispo.com/news/politics-government/national-politics/article224499960.html,"Congress returns to Washington for its first full week of legislative business since control of the House reverted to Democrats, but lawmakers will be confronted with the same lingering question: When will the partial government shutdown end?

One Republican senator says he's offered President Donald Trump a possible solution, though it may just be wishful thinking.

Sen. Lindsey Graham is encouraging Trump to reopen government for several weeks to continue negotiating with Democrats over the border wall Trump wants to build on the U.S.-Mexico border. If there's no deal at the end of that time, Graham says Trump would be free to take the more dramatic step of declaring a national emergency to build it.

But the South Carolina Republican says Trump still wants a deal on funding for the wall before agreeing to reopen shuttered government departments. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat, insists Trump reopen the government first.

Their weeks-old standoff led to the partial government shutdown, now on day 24 without a clear end in sight.

""Before he pulls the plug on the legislative option, and I think we're almost there, I would urge him to open up the government for a short period of time, like three weeks, before he pulls the plug, see if we can get a deal,"" Graham said. ""If we can't at the end of three weeks, all bets are off.

""See if he can do it by himself through the emergency powers. That's my recommendation,"" added Graham, who has publicly pushed Trump to use his authority to declare a national emergency to build the wall. Such a step would allow Trump to bypass Congress and tap various pots of unspent federal money, including for military construction and disaster relief as well as from assets seized by law enforcement, to pay for the wall.

Trump has kept Washington on edge over whether he would resort to such a declaration, citing what he says is a ""crisis"" of drug smuggling and the trafficking of women and children at the border. The president initially sounded as though such a move was imminent, but then pulled back. He has said several times since he first mentioned the idea in public this month that he prefers a legislative solution.

A key question is how much more time is Trump willing to give lawmakers. Graham, who spoke with Trump by telephone on Sunday morning, said the legislative path ""is just about shut off"" and blamed intransigence by Pelosi.

The speaker's office had no immediate comment.

Democrats oppose an emergency declaration but may be powerless to block it. Some Republicans are wary, too, fearing how a future Democratic president might use that authority. Such a move, should Trump ultimately go that route, would almost certainly be challenged in the courts.

Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., called Graham's idea to reopen the government a ""great place to start.""

""I do think if we reopen the government, if the president ends this shutdown crisis, we have folks who can negotiate a responsible, modern investment in technology that will actually make us safer,"" Coons said.

Trump says technology is nice, but that the border can't be secured without a wall.

The White House has been laying the groundwork for an emergency declaration, which is feared by lawmakers in both parties.

Senate Homeland Security Committee Chairman Ron Johnson, R-Wis., said he'd ""hate to see"" a declaration issued because the wall wouldn't get built, presumably because of legal challenges. Democrats voted in the past for border security and should again, he said.

""I actually want to see this wall get built,"" Johnson said. ""I want to keep pressure on Democrats to actually come to the negotiating table in good faith and fund what they have supported in the past.""

Graham favors a declaration and said the time for talk is running out.

""It's the last option, not the first option, but we're pretty close to that being the only option,"" he said.

Graham and Coons spoke on ""Fox News Sunday"" and Johnson appeared on CNN's ""State of the Union."""

WASHINGTON (AP) -- The White House on Sunday pushed the federal government closer to the brink of a partial shutdown later this week, digging in on its demand for $5 billion to build a border wall as congressional Democrats stood firm against it.

""We're going to do whatever is necessary to build the border wall to stop this ongoing crisis of illegal immigration,"" said White House senior adviser Stephen Miller.

Asked if that meant having a government shutdown, he said: ""If it comes to it, absolutely.""

Trump said last week he would be ""proud"" to have a shutdown to get Congress to approve a $5 billion down payment to fulfil his campaign promise to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border. But the president doesn't have the votes from the Republican-controlled Congress to support funding for the wall at that level.

Democratic congressional leaders, Sen. Chuck Schumer and Rep. Nancy Pelosi, have proposed no more than $1.6 billion, as outlined in a bipartisan Senate bill. The money would not go for the wall but for fencing upgrades and other border security. Democrats also offered to simply keep funding at its current level, $1.3 billion.

Trump lawyer Giuliani rules out Mueller interview with Trump

WASHINGTON (AP) -- With a number of probes moving closer to the Oval Office, President Donald Trump and his attorney unleashed a fresh series of attacks on the investigators, questioning their integrity while categorically ruling out the possibility of a presidential interview with the special counsel.

Trump and Rudy Giuliani used Twitter and television interviews Sunday to deliver a series of broadsides against special counsel Robert Mueller and federal prosecutors in New York. Giuliani said he was ""disgusted"" by the tactics used by Mueller in his probe into Russian election interference, including in securing guilty pleas from the president's former national security adviser Michael Flynn on a charge of lying to federal investigators.

Trump, Giuliani said, would not submit to an interview by Mueller's team.

""They're a joke,"" Giuliani told ""Fox News Sunday."" ""Over my dead body, but, you know, I could be dead.""

The special counsel, who is investigating possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russia, has continued to request an interview with the president. Last month, the White House sent written answers in response to the special counsel's questions about possible collusion. The White House has resisted answering questions on possible obstruction of justice.

Child's death highlights communication barriers on border

Shortly before a 7-year-old Guatemalan girl died in U.S. custody, her father signed a form stating that his daughter was in good health. But it's unclear how much the man understood on the form, which was written in English and read to him in Spanish by Border Patrol agents.

The death of Jakelin Caal highlights the communication challenges along the U.S.-Mexico border as agents come in contact with an increasing number of migrants who speak neither English nor Spanish.

Her father's native language is the Mayan tongue known as Q'eqchi'. His second language is Spanish. It's unclear whether something was lost in translation or whether it would have made a difference in saving Jakelin after the two were detained and underwent a health screening along a remote stretch of U.S.-Mexico border. But the case raises questions about the Border Patrol's use of English-only forms.

All agents are required to speak Spanish, and they receive formal Spanish training. Reading forms in Spanish is often enough to pose basic questions. But some other Spanish-speaking migrants reported signing paperwork that they later said they did not understand.

Scores of immigrant parents who were separated from their children after crossing the border in the spring said they signed forms agreeing to be deported with the understanding that their kids would be returning with them, only to find themselves deported without them. Many had to wait months before being reunited with them in their homelands.

Talks adopt 'rulebook' to put Paris climate deal into action

KATOWICE, Poland (AP) -- Almost 200 nations, including the world's top greenhouse gas producers, China and the United States, have adopted a set of rules meant to breathe life into the 2015 Paris climate accord by setting out how countries should report their emissions and efforts to reduce them.

But negotiators delayed other key decisions until next year -- a move that frustrated environmentalists and countries that wanted more ambitious goals in light of scientists' warnings that the world must shift sharply away from fossil fuels in the coming decade.

""The majority of the rulebook for the Paris agreement has been created, which is something to be thankful for,"" said Mohamed Adow, a climate policy expert at Christian Aid. ""But the fact countries had to be dragged kicking and screaming to the finish line shows that some nations have not woken up"" to the dire consequences of global warming as outlined in a report by the U.N Panel on Climate Change, or IPCC.

Officials at the talks, which ended late Saturday in the Polish city of Katowice, agreed upon universal rules on how nations can cut emissions. Poor countries secured assurances on financial support to help them reduce emissions, adapt to changes such as rising sea levels and pay for damage that has already happened.

""Through this package, you have made a thousand little steps forward together,"" said Michal Kurtyka, a senior Polish official who led the talks.

French city honours victims of Christmas market attack

PARIS (AP) -- People filled a square in the French city of Strasbourg on Sunday to show respect and sympathy for the victims of last week's shooting attack near a famous Christmas market as the death toll rose to five.

French authorities said a Polish man died in a Strasbourg hospital Sunday, one of a dozen people wounded in last Tuesday's attack. Poland's Foreign Ministry extended condolences Sunday on Twitter to his family.

According to the newspaper DNA, more than 1,000 people attended the memorial, which ended with a minute of applause and a rendition of France's national anthem, ""La Marseillaise.""

The hour-long ceremony took place in Kleber Square, not far from where a gunman opened fire on Tuesday evening. Strasbourg Mayor Roland Ries praised the city's resilience in the face of hardship.

The ""extremely large crowd in the Christmas market"" on Saturday ""was an illustration of our commitment to these values ??on which our living together is based, which we will continue to defend against all those who want to attack it,"" Ries said.

Not into bingo, 84-year-old Texas woman gets college degree

RICHARDSON, Texas (AP) -- After raising five kids and retiring at age 77 from her secretarial job, Janet Fein couldn't be blamed for finally relaxing, but that's not her.

""I didn't have anything to do in retirement and I didn't think that playing bingo was up to my speed,"" said Fein, who majored in sociology because she felt it was ""substantial.""

She said she enjoyed all the reading and writing papers. ""With each class I already knew a lot, but then I also learned a lot. And that made me happy,"" she said.

Next-generation of GPS satellites are headed to space

DENVER (AP) -- After months of delays, the U.S. Air Force is about to launch the first of a new generation of GPS satellites, designed to be more accurate, secure and versatile.

But some of their most highly touted features will not be fully available until 2022 or later because of problems in a companion program to develop a new ground control system for the satellites, government auditors said.

The satellite is scheduled to lift off Tuesday from Cape Canaveral, Florida, aboard a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket. It's the first of 32 planned GPS III satellites that will replace older ones now in orbit. Lockheed Martin is building the new satellites outside Denver.

GPS is best-known for its widespread civilian applications, from navigation to time-stamping bank transactions. The Air Force estimates that 4 billion people worldwide use the system.

But it was developed by the U.S. military, which still designs, launches and operates the system. The Air Force controls a constellation of 31 GPS satellites from a high-security complex at Schriever Air Force Base outside Colorado Springs.

After fraud probe, new primary may replace GOP candidate

RALEIGH, N.C. (AP) -- Legislation quickly passed by North Carolina's lawmakers this week would prepare a path for Republicans to dump their nominee in a still-undecided U.S. House race marred with ballot fraud allegations.

""I think (legislators are) worried that Mark Harris might be damaged goods and they want to have the opportunity to have a different Republican nominee,"" said Carter Wrenn, a Republican operative and consultant to former U.S. Sen. Jesse Helms and others for more than 40 years. ""That's how I read those tea leaves.""

If the state elections board decides ballot irregularities or other problems cast the true outcome into doubt and force a redo, the legislation -- if allowed to go into law by Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper -- would require new primary elections in the 9th Congressional District race, in addition to a new general election.

That would allow Republicans another look at Mark Harris, the Republican who led Democrat Dan McCready by 905 votes in unofficial results. Harris hasn't been certified the winner, and an investigation is looking into missing absentee ballots in rural Bladen County and whether unsealed ballots illegally handled by collection teams there could have been altered.

Bladen was the only county among the eight within the 9th District where Harris won a majority of mail-in absentee ballots over McCready.

Top of mind: 'Justice' is Merriam-Webster's word of the year

NEW YORK (AP) -- Racial justice. Obstruction of justice. Social justice. The Justice Department. Merriam-Webster has chosen ""justice"" as its 2018 word of the year, driven by the churning news cycle over months and months.

The word follows ""toxic,"" picked by Oxford Dictionaries, and ""misinformation,"" plucked by Dictonary.com.

Peter Sokolowski, Merriam-Webster's editor at large, told The Associated Press ahead of Monday's announcement that ""justice"" consistently bubbled into the top 20 or 30 lookups on the company's website, spiking at times due to specific events but also skating close to the surface for much of the year.

While it's one of those common words people likely know how to spell and use correctly in a sentence, Sokolowski pointed to other reasons that drive search traffic. Among them is an attempt to focus a train of thought around a philosophical problem, or to seek aspirational motivation. Such well-known words are often among the most looked up every year, including those that are slightly abstract, including ""love,"" he said.

The designation for ""justice"" came soon after President Trump's one-time fixer, Michael Cohen, was sentenced to three years in prison for crimes that included arranging the payment of hush money to conceal his boss' alleged sexual affairs. He told a judge he agreed time and again to cover up Trump's ""dirty deeds"" out of ""blind loyalty.""

'Spider-Verse' swings to the top; 'Mortal Engines' tanks

LOS ANGELES (AP) -- ""Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse"" swung to the top of the domestic box office in its first weekend in theatres, proving that there is widespread audience interest in big screen animated versions of Marvel's marquee superheroes.

The film led a host of newcomers that debuted to varying success on this pre-Christmas holiday weekend, including Clint Eastwood's drug smuggling drama ""The Mule"" and the Peter Jackson-produced epic ""Mortal Engines"" which bombed in North American theatres.

""Into the Spider-Verse"" earned an estimated $35.4 million from 3,813 theatres against a $90 million production budget according to Sony Pictures on Sunday, which is a record for animated movies in December (although the hybrid ""Alvin and the Chipmunks"" movies were higher). The film features an innovative animation style -- both CGI and hand-drawn -- and focuses on the Miles Morales character as he learns to become the famed web-slinger. It's another financial win for the studio's latest ""expanded Spider-Man universe"" strategy following ""Venom"" and ""Spider-Man: Homecoming.""

And ""Spider-Verse"" has been very well-received among critics, and audiences in exit surveys gave it a rare A+ CinemaScore -- a first for a Spider-Man film. It's also been nominated for a Golden Globe award for best animated feature and picked up a few honours from critics' groups as well, including the New York Film Critics Circle.

""We are playing to both families and fanboys. We're an all-audience film,"" said Adrian Smith, Sony's president of domestic distribution.

Euro currency remains a work in progress on 20th birthday

FRANKFURT, Germany (AP) -- The euro is about to celebrate its 20th birthday, but the countries that use it are still wrestling with how the shared currency should work and how to fix flaws exposed by the debt crisis that marred its second decade.

The euro was launched on Jan. 1, 1999, when 10 countries fixed their exchange rates to it and handed decisions on interest rates to the newly-founded European Central Bank. Euro notes and coins went into circulation three years later.

The shared currency was seen as a solution to the constant quarrels over exchange rates that had marked European politics after World War II and as a logical extension of the European Union's tariff-free trade zone. Britain, notably, opted out, but 19 of 28 EU countries use the euro.

North Korea's 'Singapore shops' expose gap in sanctions push

The stores stock many of the very things United Nations' sanctions banning trade in luxury goods are intended to block and provide a nagging reminder that not all potential trade partners are lining up behind the U.N.'s pronouncements or the Trump administration's policy of maximum pressure on the North.

GOP and Democrats trade blame for shutdown, no deal in sight

WASHINGTON (AP) -- The partial government shutdown will almost certainly be handed off to a divided government to solve in the new year, as both parties traded blame Friday and President Donald Trump sought to raise the stakes in the weeklong impasse.

As agreement eludes Washington in the waning days of the Republican monopoly on power, it sets up the first big confrontation between Trump and newly empowered Democrats. Trump is sticking with his demand for money to build a border wall with Mexico, and Democrats, who take control of the House on Jan. 3, are refusing to give him what he wants.

Trump raised the stakes on Friday, reissuing threats to shut the U.S.-Mexico border to pressure Congress to fund the wall and to shut off aid to three Central American countries from which many migrants have fled.

Dec. 18

The New York Times on a judge's rebuke of Michael Flynn and President Donald Trump's charitable foundation:

A bit of common sense and common decency intruded on Tuesday into the crazy world of Donald Trump.

In New York, the state attorney general announced that the president had agreed that the ""charity"" he used as a piggy bank has no reason to exist.

In Washington, a federal judge let a former top presidential aide know that you can parrot political spin or you can tell the truth, but you can't do both to someone who can send you to prison.

Michael Flynn, Mr. Trump's former national security adviser, appeared before Judge Emmet Sullivan to be sentenced to what he expected would be a term of probation, after pleading guilty to lying to federal investigators about conversations with the Russian ambassador. The office of the special counsel, Robert Mueller, had earlier filed a memo that said it would be right for Mr. Flynn to avoid prison after his extensive co-operation in the investigation of Trump ties to Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential campaign and after.

Then last week, in a memo about their client's sentencing, Mr. Flynn's lawyers implied that he had been tricked into lying and that the F.B.I. acted improperly in interviewing him -- points raised by pro-Trump commentators elaborating on the president's claims of being victimized by a witch hunt.

Judge Sullivan was having none of it.

""I cannot recall an instance of a court ever accepting a guilty plea from someone who did not maintain he was guilty,"" Judge Sullivan said, ""and I do not intend to start today.""

Chastened, Mr. Flynn told the judge that nobody tricked him, that he lied and that he knew he shouldn't have.

The judge was not upset only about Mr. Flynn's sneaky prevarication. He said he felt ""disgust"" at Mr. Flynn's offences, that a retired three-star general would lie to the F.B.I. ""while on the physical premises of the White House,"" and, acting as an unregistered agent of a foreign country, Turkey, while he was an adviser to Mr. Trump (to which he admitted but was not charged). It was a bracing reminder of the brazenness of his misdeeds and of the standards the public should be able to expect of those who serve them.

Realizing that Judge Sullivan was considering a term of up to six months in prison, Mr. Flynn accepted his offer to delay the sentencing for 90 days until he has completed his co-operation with the special counsel.

""Good luck today in court to General Michael Flynn,"" Mr. Trump had tweeted first thing Tuesday morning.

""Thanks for nothing, Mr. President,"" Mr. Flynn might have thought as he left court.

Mr. Flynn should be grateful the judge offered him the chance to come clean. By contrast, the Donald J. Trump Foundation, a charity that provided no charity, quite properly received none from the New York attorney general's office.

Attorney General Barbara Underwood accused it of ""a shocking pattern of illegality"" that ""amounted to the Trump Foundation functioning as little more than a checkbook to serve Mr. Trump's business and political interests.""

Whatever money that remains will be disbursed under the supervision of Ms. Underwood's office and the judge overseeing the continuing lawsuit her office filed in June, seeking $2.8 million in restitution and a ban on Mr. Trump and his three oldest children serving on the boards of other non-profit organizations.

In a series of stories exposing the foundation's true nature, The Washington Post found that its largest donation was to fix a fountain in front of the Plaza Hotel in Manhattan, which Mr. Trump owned at the time, that its funds were used to buy a portrait of Mr. Trump, and that it illegally provided political donations and paid for personal legal settlements.

All this comes just days after prosecutors announced that they believed that Mr. Trump had conspired with the owner of The National Enquirer and his fixer Michael Cohen to violate campaign finance laws by paying hush money to two women who said they had affairs with him. It's also just been reported that prosecutors are investigating spending by the Trump inaugural committee. The president still faces lawsuits on the constitutionality of his enriching himself while in office. Meanwhile, the special counsel's inquiry may be expanding rather than winding down.

It's fitting that despite all his bluster and threats, a president who's demonstrated such contempt for the rule of law is finding it so formidable.

That this goes to the essence of American governance was best summed up by Paula Duncan, the Trump enthusiast who was among the jurors who found Mr. Trump's former campaign chief Paul Manafort guilty of fraud, even though she had hoped he wouldn't be convicted.

Explaining her decision after the verdict, she told Fox News, ""No one's above the law.""

Dec. 16

The Wall Street Journal on a judge's ruling on the Affordable Care Act's individual mandate:

No one opposes ObamaCare more than we do, and Democrats are now confirming that it was designed as a way-station to government-run health care. But a federal judge's ruling that the law is unconstitutional is likely to be overturned on appeal and may boomerang politically on Republicans.

Judge Reed O'Connor ruled for some 20 state plaintiffs that the Affordable Care Act's individual mandate is no longer legal because Republicans repealed its financial penalty as part of the 2017 tax reform. Recall that Chief Justice John Roberts joined four Justices to say ObamaCare's mandate was illegal as a command to individuals to buy insurance under the Commerce Clause. ""The Framers gave Congress the power to regulate commerce, not to compel it,"" he wrote.

Yet the Chief famously salvaged ObamaCare by unilaterally rewriting the mandate to be a ""tax"" that was within Congress's power. Never mind that Democrats had expressly said the penalty was not a tax. Majority Leader Roberts declared it to be so.

Enter Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, who argues in Texas v. U.S. that since Congress has repealed the mandate, the tax is no longer a tax, and ObamaCare is thus illegal. Judge O'Connor agreed with that logic, and he went further in ruling that since Congress said the mandate is crucial to the structure of ObamaCare, then all of ObamaCare must fall along with the mandate.

We'll admit to a certain satisfaction in seeing the Chief Justice hoist on his own logic. But his ruling in NFIB v. Sebelius was in 2012 and there is more at issue legally now than the ""tax"" issue in that opinion. One legal complication is that Congress in 2017 repealed the financial part of the individual mandate, not the structure of the mandate itself. Republicans used budget rules to pass tax reform so they couldn't repeal the mandate's express language.

The Affordable Care Act has also been up and running since 2014, which means so-called reliance interests come into play when considering a precedent. Millions of people now rely on ObamaCare's subsidies and rules, which argues against judges repealing the law by fiat.

Judge O'Connor breezes past this like a liberal Ninth Circuit appeals judge handling a Donald Trump appeal. He's right that Democrats claimed the individual mandate was essential to the Affordable Care Act. But when Congress killed the financial penalty in 2017 it left the rest of ObamaCare intact. When judging congressional intent, a judge must account for the amending Congress as well as the original Congress.

In any case, the Supreme Court's ""severability"" doctrine calls for restraint in declaring an entire law illegal merely because one part of it is. Our guess is that even the right-leaning Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals judges will overturn Judge O'Connor on this point.

As for the politics, Democrats claim to be alarmed by the ruling but the truth is they're elated. They want to use it to further pound Republicans for denying health insurance for pre-existing conditions if the law is overturned. Democrats campaigned across the country against Mr. Paxton's lawsuit to gain House and Senate seats in November, and they will now press votes in Congress so they can compound the gains in 2020.

President Trump hailed the ruling in a tweet, but he has never understood the Affordable Care Act. His Administration has done good work revising regulations to reduce health-care costs and increase access, but the risk is that the lawsuit will cause Republicans in Congress to panic politically and strike a deal with Democrats that reinforces ObamaCare. This is what happens when conservatives fall into the liberal trap of thinking they can use the courts to achieve policy goals that need to be won in Congress.

The Washington Post on withdrawing all 2,000 U.S. troops out of Syria:

PRESIDENT TRUMP'S sudden move to yank U.S. troops out of Syria undermined at a stroke several foreign policy goals he has championed. The president promised to finish the job of destroying the Islamic State, but the withdrawal will leave thousands of its fighters still in place. He vowed to roll back Iran's aggression across the Middle East, but his decision will allow its forces to entrench in the country that is the keystone of Tehran's ambitions. He promised to protect Israel, but that nation will now be left to face alone the buildup by Iran and its proxies along its northern border.

The president's top national security advisers had carefully developed and articulated a strategy of maintaining a U.S. presence in Syria until the Islamic State was beyond revival and Iran withdrew its forces -- a plan they were defending up until this week. Mr. Trump has again demonstrated, to them and to the world, that no U.S. policy or foreign commitment is immune from his whims.

Mr. Trump claimed the Islamic State had been defeated, but that is not the view of the Defence and State Departments. Thousands of jihadist fighters are still in Syria and control splotches of territory in the Euphrates Valley. A U.S. withdrawal will give the extremists an opportunity to reconstitute, as they did in Iraq following the premature U.S. withdrawal ordered by President Barack Obama.

Until Wednesday, a prime talking point of senior national security officials was that, ""if we've learned one thing over the years, (the) enduring defeat of a group like this means you can't just defeat their physical space and then leave,"" as the State Department's special envoy for the global campaign against the Islamic State, Brett McGurk, put it last week. Defence Secretary Jim Mattis said it another way in September: ""Getting rid of the caliphate doesn't mean you then blindly say, 'Okay, we got rid of it,' march out, and then wonder why the caliphate comes back.""

Mr. Trump has justified some of his most controversial decisions, including his continued support for Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, as needed to contain Iran's threat to the United States and its allies. But the Syrian withdrawal hands Tehran and its ally Russia a windfall. Iran has deployed thousands of fighters and allied militiamen to Syria and aspires to create a corridor to Lebanon and the Mediterranean, as well as a new front against Israel along the Golan Heights. In reaction to that threat, Mr. Trump's national security adviser, John Bolton, announced Sept. 24 that ""We're not going to leave (Syria) as long as Iranian troops are outside Iranian borders, and that includes Iranian proxies and militias.""

U.S. ambitions in Syria have never been backed by adequate resources, and a case could be made that neither Congress nor the American public were prepared to support the mission suggested by Mr. Bolton. But Mr. Trump's decision appears to have been precipitated by the bellicose rhetoric of Turkey's Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who last week threatened -- not for the first time -- a military operation against Syrian Kurds, even though U.S. troops are positioned around them. The autocratic Turkish ruler appears to have extracted multiple favours from Mr. Trump in recent days, including the sale of U.S. Patriot missiles and a promise to reexamine the possible extradition of his rival, Fethullah Gulen, from Pennsylvania. If Mr. Trump received anything in return, he hasn't disclosed it.

The Syrian Kurdish forces, which have fought alongside the United States and played a crucial role in liberating most of eastern Syria from the jihadists, will be perhaps the foremost victims of Mr. Trump's decision. Betrayed by Washington, they will now be subject to a military offensive by Turkey. The stab in the back will send an unforgettable message to all who are asked to co-operate with the United States in the fight against terrorism: Washington is an unreliable and dangerous partner.

The Orange County (California) Register on Mick Mulvaney as Trump's choice for chief of staff:

President Trump has found a new chief of staff, albeit an interim one, in his director of the Office of Management and Budget, Mick Mulvaney.

That of chief is a terribly important post, perhaps government's most consequential aside from that of his boss. In theory, at least, the chief of staff is the gatekeeper for everything the president does, everyone he sees, everyone he talks to on the phone.

Perhaps, though few would expect this to be the case, the arbiter of every time he sends out a tweet, and of what it should say.

A Washington insider, a former congressman, Mulvaney is in many ways ideal for the job. He wants it, badly, whereas others with similarly impressive resumes touted for the job have indicated a strong desire to spend more time with their families, from Vice-President Pence's staff chief Nick Ayers of Georgia to former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie.

Mulvaney shares the conservative values currently espoused by the president and was a founder of the House Freedom Caucus in 2013, the group that always taunted the Republican leadership, opposing much government funding, including debt limit increases and budget agreements made with the Democrats.

But he also, after Trump secured the Republican nomination in 2016, called the candidate ""a terrible human being"" who he only was voting for out of an even greater dislike of Hillary Clinton.

It's not as if other presidential allies of today haven't said bad things about him in the past. On the campaign trail, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz called his rival ""a narcissist at a level I don't think this country's ever seen,"" for instance.

But if you were the nation's chief executive -- or the CEO of a much smaller entity, for that matter -- could you hire as your top aide and work with a person who had once dubbed you ""terrible""?

Or does this kind of talk come with the territory in politics, where many strange bedfellows are made because of having to run in elections against once and perhaps future allies? Should Trump indeed elevate this practical choice for staff chief to permanent status immediately?

Los Angeles Times on banning bump stocks, which allow semi-automatic weapons to fire like machine-guns:

The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives said Tuesday that it had finalized a rule reclassifying so-called bump stocks -- the devices that can make a semiautomatic rifle fire nearly as quickly a fully automatic weapon -- as machine-guns, which makes it illegal to manufacture, sell or possess them. The agency said a year ago it had the authority to reclassify the devices, and President Trump -- in the wake of the Parkland, Fla., school shooting -- directed the ATF to speed up the process. Tuesday's announcement -- a rare bit of welcome news from the Trump administration -- makes it official; White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters that owners of the conversion devices will have until March 21 to destroy them or turn them in to the ATF.

This is a good step. Unfortunately, it's all but certain to be challenged in the courts, and it's on shaky legal ground because of the way the new rule evolved. The Obama administration determined that because bump stocks have ""no automatically functioning mechanical parts and (perform) no automated mechanical functions when installed,"" they did not fit the definition of a machine-gun in federal law, which meant the ATF lacked the authority to regulate them. Tuesday's announcement, by contrast, hinges not on the technical specifications, but on the functionality. In essence, if it fires like a machine-gun, it's a machine-gun. Cue the lawyers.

We hope the administration prevails in whatever challenges emerge, but the sure-fire way to resolve this would be for Congress to legislate bump stocks and related gadgets out of existence. Such devices serve no function other than to evade the strict congressional limit on machine-guns by, as the ATF said, harnessing ""the recoil energy of the semiautomatic firearm in a manner that allows the trigger to reset and continue firing"" without the shooter having to pull the trigger for each shot.

A mass shooter in Las Vegas used bump stocks affixed to semiautomatic rifles to fire more than 1,000 rounds in a matter of minutes from a 32nd-floor suite of the Mandalay Bay Hotel into a crowd of some 20,000 people, killing 58 concertgoers and injuring hundreds of others. It was the largest single mass shooting in the modern era, drawing attention to bump stocks and sparking outraged demands by many -- the Los Angeles Times included -- that the devices be banned.

As welcome as this new rule is, it will do little to corral our national problem with gun violence. The vast majority of gun deaths come in ones and twos, led by suicides. ...

But it is progress. And the president deserves credit for sticking with his promise to find a way to ban bump stocks. ...

China Daily says telecommunications giant Huawei is a victim of U.S. panic attacks:

This year has not been an annus mirabilis for China's Huawei Technologies Ltd, the world's largest supplier of telecommunications network equipment and second-biggest maker of smartphones.

Although it has been constantly in the news and it is said there is no such thing as bad publicity, it has been making headlines because of the spurious claims it somehow poses a threat to the West, even world peace. It has never been explained exactly how.

In fact it is not because of anything it has done, but because its success has brought it into the crosshairs of the United States' anxiety attacks against China.

Huawei is at the forefront of 5G technology. This latest generation mobile network technology promises to bring the much anticipated and heralded internet of things to life and the US is determined to be the 5G leader.

Not only because whichever country develops the technology that is adopted as standard will have a huge commercial advantage. But also because by setting the standard it will have a knowledge advantage.

As a result, first the US and then one after another its most obedient allies have blocked Huawei from entering their 5G markets on security grounds.

None of them have offered any specific justification for blocking Huawei. They just repeat their claim that the company poses a security risk. That is why objective observers have concluded that those countries are politicizing a commercial issue.

It sets a harmful precedent. What if other countries used the same excuse to block US companies (not confined to the telecom sector)? The US companies are very competitive in many fields, including those that could pose huge security risks, such as finance.

While Huawei will not go unscathed from being prevented from entering key markets, as a competitive player, it still has a vast market to access in other parts of the world. It has signed contracts to supply 5G equipment to 25 telecom carriers, and more than 10,000 5G base stations have been shipped.

In stark contrast to the US and its allies, India for instance, has invited Huawei to conduct 5G trials in the country and complimented it on the role it has played in helping to develop its telecom industry.

The efforts of the US and its allies to try to shield their companies against a Chinese competitor are politically motivated, not the result of a fact-based or transparent decision-making process. And they are counterproductive to the concerted efforts that are needed to ensure the security of 5G networks.

The Associated Press"
457,the tribune,https://www.sanluisobispo.com/news/state/california/article223445505.html,"President Trump traveled to the center of California's tragic wildfire on Nov. 17. He toured devastated areas with Gov. Jerry Brown and Gov.-elect Gavin Newsom. By

President Donald Trump signed an executive order on Friday that calls for expanding logging on millions of acres of federal forest lands as part of a plan to reduce wildfire risks.

""For decades, dense trees and undergrowth have amassed in these lands, fueling catastrophic wildfires,"" Trump wrote in the order, released as Congress haggled over funding for Trump's border wall with a government shutdown looming. ""These conditions, along with insect infestation, invasive species, disease, and drought, have weakened our forests, rangelands, and other federal lands, and have placed communities and homes at risk of damage from catastrophic wildfires. Active management of vegetation is needed to treat these dangerous conditions on Federal lands but is often delayed.""

Trump's order calls for easing regulatory burdens that would allow for the harvest of least 3.8 billion board feet of timber from lands managed by the U.S. Forest Service and another 600 million board feet of timber on Bureau of Land Management property.

Those figures represent a substantial increase in timber sales over recent years.

In 2017, the Forest Service harvested more than 2.9 billion board feet of timber, according to a summary the agency released last year. In 2016, the BLM had more than 233.2 million board feet of timber for sale.

Environmental groups blasted Trump's order.

Denise Boggs of the the Northern California environmental group Conservation Congress said it ignored climate change, and didn't address the need to thin areas directly around communities to prevent them from catching fire.

""It won't work, and we know that ... All the fire ecologists are saying the same thing: You can't log your way out of this situation,"" Boggs said. ""Logging in the back country is just a gift to the timber industry.""

Boggs said environmentalists will certainly sue if Trump tries to ramp up logging.

Since taking office, the Trump administration has advocated for more aggressive timber management to boost struggling rural economies and to proactively fight fires. This year, Northern California's devastating Carr and Camp fires became the backdrop as Trump and administration officials made their case.

""We have to do management, maintenance,"" Trump said while touring Camp Fire-scorched Paradise neighborhoods last month. ""We'll be working also with environmental groups. I think everybody's seen the light.""

He cited the ""forest nation"" of Finland, which Trump said spends ""a lot of time raking and cleaning and doing things, and they don't have any problem.""

Touring Redding neighborhoods burned by the Carr Fire this summer, Trump's outgoing Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke blamed ""special interest"" environmentalists for using the courts to block thinning projects that he said would reduce fire risk.

""We have been held hostage by these environmental terrorist groups ... that have refused to allow harvest of timber,"" Zinke earlier told conservative news outlet Breitbart News.

While state officials are less likely to use the word ""logging"" to describe the work, California has vowed to become more aggressive when it comes to forest management.

Democratic Gov. Jerry Brown secured $96 million from the Legislature this year to pay for more forest management projects.

He also signed Senate Bill 901, which attempts to shield electric utilities from certain wildfire costs but also relaxes logging restrictions for larger trees on small parcels of privately owned land.

The new law allocates $1 billion over five years, generated by proceeds from the state's ""cap and trade"" carbon emissions program, to ramp up forest thinning."
458,the tribune,https://www.sanluisobispo.com/news/business/article224277975.html,"The government shutdown has suspended federal cleanups at Superfund sites around the nation and forced the cancellation of public hearings, deepening the mistrust and resentment of surrounding residents who feel people in power long ago abandoned them to live among the toxic residue of the country's factories and mines.

""We are already hurting, and it's just adding more fuel to the fire,"" says 40-year-old Keisha Brown, whose wood-frame home is in a community nestled among coking plants and other factories on Birmingham's north side.

The mostly African-American community has been forced to cope with high levels of arsenic, lead and other contaminants in the soil that the Environmental Protection Agency has been scraping up and carting away, house by house.

As President Donald Trump and Congress battle over Trump's demand for a wall on the southern U.S. border, the nearly 3-week-old partial government shutdown has stopped federal work on Superfund sites except for cases where the administration deems ""there is an imminent threat to the safety of human life or to the protection of property.""

EPA's shutdown plans said the agency would evaluate about 800 Superfund sites to see how many could pose an immediate threat. As an example of that kind of threat, it cited an acid leak from a mine that could threaten the public water supply. That's the hazard at Northern California's Iron Mountain mine, where EPA workers help prevent an unending flow of lethally acidic runoff off the Superfund site from spilling into rivers downstream.

Practically speaking, said Bonnie Bellow, a former EPA official who worked on Superfund public outreach at the agency, the impact of the stoppage of work at sites across the nation ""wholly depends"" on the length of the shutdown.

""Unless there is immediate risk like a storm, a flood, a week or two of slowdowns is not going to very likely affect the cleanup at the site,"" Bellow said.

In north Birmingham, Brown said it's been a couple of weeks since she's spotted any EPA crews at people's houses. It wasn't clear if state workers or contractors were continuing work.

But long before the shutdown began, Brown harbored doubts the cleanup was working anyway. ""My main concern is the health of the people out here,"" said Brown, who has asthma. ""All of us are sick, and we've got to function on medicine every day.""

In terms of time, the federal government shutdown is a chronological blip in the long history of the site -- which includes ethics charges in a local bribery scandal to block federal cleanup efforts -- but adds to the uncertainty in an area where residents feel forgotten and betrayed.

At the EPA, the shutdown has furloughed the bulk of the agency's roughly 14,000 employees. It also means the EPA isn't getting most of the daily stream of environmental questions and tips from the public. Routine inspections aren't happening. State, local and private emails to EPA officials often get automated messages back promising a response when the shutdown ends.

In Montana, for instance, state officials this month found themselves fielding calls from a tribal member worried about drinking water with a funny look to it, said Kristi Ponozzo, public-policy director at that state's Department of Environmental Quality. The EPA normally provides tribes with technical assistance on water supplies.

With most EPA colleagues idled, Ponozzo said, her agency also had to call off an environmental review meeting for a mining project, potentially delaying the project.

But it's the agency's work at Superfund sites -- lessening the threat from old nuclear-weapons plants, chemical factories, mines and other entities -- that gets much of the attention.

Absent imminent peril, it would be up to state governments or contractors to continue any cleanup during the shutdown ""up to the point that additional EPA direction or funding is needed,"" the EPA said in a statement.

""Sites where cleanup activities have been stopped or shut down will be secured until cleanup activities are able to commence when the federal government reopens,"" the agency said.

For federal Superfund sites in Michigan, the shutdown means there are no EPA colleagues to consult, said Scott Dean, a spokesman for that state's Department of Environmental Quality.

At Michigan Superfund sites, day-to-day field operations were continuing since private contractors do most of the on-the-ground work, Dean said.

Bellow, the former EPA official, said the cancellation of hearings about Superfund sites posed immediate concerns.

In East Chicago, Indiana, for example, the EPA called off a planned public hearing set for last Wednesday to outline how the agency planned to clean up high levels of lead and arsenic in the soil.

The EPA has proposed a seven-month, $26.5 million cleanup that includes treating and removing tainted soil from the area, where a lead smelter previously was located.

During a public meeting Nov. 29, some residents complained that the EPA's approach would leave too much pollution in place. But others didn't get a chance to speak and were hoping to do so at the meeting this week, said Debbie Chizewer, a Northwestern University environmental attorney who represents community groups in the low-income area.

The EPA announced the cancellation in an online notice and gave no indication that it would be rescheduled.

Leaders of the East Chicago Calumet Community Advisory Group asked for a new hearing date and an extension of a Jan. 14 public comment deadline in a letter to the EPA's regional Superfund division.

Calls by The Associated Press to the agency's regional office in Chicago this week were not answered.

Local critics fear the EPA will use the delay caused by the shutdown as justification for pushing ahead with a cleanup strategy they consider flawed, Chizewer said, even though the agency has designated the affected area as an ""environmental justice community"" -- a low-income community of color that has been disproportionately harmed by pollution.

The EPA has a ""special obligation"" when dealing with such communities, Chizewer said. ""This would be an example of shutting them out for no good reason.""

In North Birmingham, former longtime neighborhood resident Charlie Powell said most of the people living in and around the Superfund site had already ""just got tired and fed up.""

Powell left the area but started a group called PANIC, People Against Neighborhood Industrial Contamination. He believes money would be better spent helping residents move away from the pollution.

""Can I say hell?"" Powell said when asked what residents have been through.

459,the tribune,https://www.sanluisobispo.com/news/nation-world/national/article223310670.html,"Don't answer that question ""No"" without visiting the fundraiser site first.

As President Donald Trump is said to be mulling ""other options"" for funding his border wall between the U.S. and Mexico, according to the Associated Press, a dark horse arises on the internet.

A GoFundMe campaign popped up Sunday, hoping to raise funds for Trump's proposed wall between the U.S. and Mexico, which isn't news in and of itself. There are plenty of those around.

But the organizers of this campaign are so encouraged that they've raised more-than $700,000 in just three days that they've bumped their original goal of $200 million up to a cool billion.

The GoFundMe organizer is listed as triple-amputee Air Force veteran Brian Kolfage, who lost both legs and his right arm in a blast at Balad Air Force Base in Iraq in 2004, according to the Arizona Daily Star. The fundraiser is titled, ""We the people will fund the wall.""

The contact listing for the organizer says ""The Wall Funding Team"" is located in Miramar, Fla.

""As a veteran who has given so much, 3 limbs, I feel deeply invested to this nation to ensure future generations have everything we have today,"" Kolfage wrote in the GoFundMe campaign description. ""Too many Americans have been murdered by illegal aliens and too many illegals are taking advantage of the United States taxpayers with no means of ever contributing to our society.

""I have grandparents who immigrated to America legally, they did it the correct way and it's time we uphold our laws, and get this wall BUILT! It's up to Americans to help out and pitch in to get this project rolling.""

Multiple studies and reports have shown, though, that illegal immigrants commit crime, violent or nonviolent, at lesser rates than do native-born Americans.

Kolfage's GoFundMe campaign was listed as the ""Top fundraiser"" on the front page of the crowd-sourced social fundraising website as of Wednesday afternoon, despite Kolfage's claims that the platform was trying to hide his fundraiser from potential donors.

Kolfage's Facebook page, where he posts content relevant to his conservative political beliefs, has more than 90,000 followers.

""We have contacted the Trump Administration to secure a point of contact where all funds will go upon completion,"" the campaign says. ""When get this information secured we will update. We have many very high level contacts already helping."""
460,the tribune,https://www.sanluisobispo.com/news/business/article223342450.html,"Excerpts from recent editorials in the United States and abroad:

The New York Times on a judge's rebuke of Michael Flynn and President Donald Trump's charitable foundation:

A bit of common sense and common decency intruded on Tuesday into the crazy world of Donald Trump.

In New York, the state attorney general announced that the president had agreed that the ""charity"" he used as a piggy bank has no reason to exist.

In Washington, a federal judge let a former top presidential aide know that you can parrot political spin or you can tell the truth, but you can't do both to someone who can send you to prison.

Michael Flynn, Mr. Trump's former national security adviser, appeared before Judge Emmet Sullivan to be sentenced to what he expected would be a term of probation, after pleading guilty to lying to federal investigators about conversations with the Russian ambassador. The office of the special counsel, Robert Mueller, had earlier filed a memo that said it would be right for Mr. Flynn to avoid prison after his extensive cooperation in the investigation of Trump ties to Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential campaign and after.

Then last week, in a memo about their client's sentencing, Mr. Flynn's lawyers implied that he had been tricked into lying and that the F.B.I. acted improperly in interviewing him -- points raised by pro-Trump commentators elaborating on the president's claims of being victimized by a witch hunt.

Judge Sullivan was having none of it.

""I cannot recall an instance of a court ever accepting a guilty plea from someone who did not maintain he was guilty,"" Judge Sullivan said, ""and I do not intend to start today.""

Chastened, Mr. Flynn told the judge that nobody tricked him, that he lied and that he knew he shouldn't have.

The judge was not upset only about Mr. Flynn's sneaky prevarication. He said he felt ""disgust"" at Mr. Flynn's offenses, that a retired three-star general would lie to the F.B.I. ""while on the physical premises of the White House,"" and, acting as an unregistered agent of a foreign country, Turkey, while he was an adviser to Mr. Trump (to which he admitted but was not charged). It was a bracing reminder of the brazenness of his misdeeds and of the standards the public should be able to expect of those who serve them.

Realizing that Judge Sullivan was considering a term of up to six months in prison, Mr. Flynn accepted his offer to delay the sentencing for 90 days until he has completed his cooperation with the special counsel.

""Good luck today in court to General Michael Flynn,"" Mr. Trump had tweeted first thing Tuesday morning.

""Thanks for nothing, Mr. President,"" Mr. Flynn might have thought as he left court.

Mr. Flynn should be grateful the judge offered him the chance to come clean. By contrast, the Donald J. Trump Foundation, a charity that provided no charity, quite properly received none from the New York attorney general's office.

Attorney General Barbara Underwood accused it of ""a shocking pattern of illegality"" that ""amounted to the Trump Foundation functioning as little more than a checkbook to serve Mr. Trump's business and political interests.""

Whatever money that remains will be disbursed under the supervision of Ms. Underwood's office and the judge overseeing the continuing lawsuit her office filed in June, seeking $2.8 million in restitution and a ban on Mr. Trump and his three oldest children serving on the boards of other nonprofit organizations.

In a series of stories exposing the foundation's true nature, The Washington Post found that its largest donation was to fix a fountain in front of the Plaza Hotel in Manhattan, which Mr. Trump owned at the time, that its funds were used to buy a portrait of Mr. Trump, and that it illegally provided political donations and paid for personal legal settlements.

All this comes just days after prosecutors announced that they believed that Mr. Trump had conspired with the owner of The National Enquirer and his fixer Michael Cohen to violate campaign finance laws by paying hush money to two women who said they had affairs with him. It's also just been reported that prosecutors are investigating spending by the Trump inaugural committee. The president still faces lawsuits on the constitutionality of his enriching himself while in office. Meanwhile, the special counsel's inquiry may be expanding rather than winding down.

It's fitting that despite all his bluster and threats, a president who's demonstrated such contempt for the rule of law is finding it so formidable.

That this goes to the essence of American governance was best summed up by Paula Duncan, the Trump enthusiast who was among the jurors who found Mr. Trump's former campaign chief Paul Manafort guilty of fraud, even though she had hoped he wouldn't be convicted.

Explaining her decision after the verdict, she told Fox News, ""No one's above the law.""

The Wall Street Journal on a judge's ruling on the Affordable Care Act's individual mandate:

No one opposes ObamaCare more than we do, and Democrats are now confirming that it was designed as a way-station to government-run health care. But a federal judge's ruling that the law is unconstitutional is likely to be overturned on appeal and may boomerang politically on Republicans.

Judge Reed O'Connor ruled for some 20 state plaintiffs that the Affordable Care Act's individual mandate is no longer legal because Republicans repealed its financial penalty as part of the 2017 tax reform. Recall that Chief Justice John Roberts joined four Justices to say ObamaCare's mandate was illegal as a command to individuals to buy insurance under the Commerce Clause. ""The Framers gave Congress the power to regulate commerce, not to compel it,"" he wrote.

Yet the Chief famously salvaged ObamaCare by unilaterally rewriting the mandate to be a ""tax"" that was within Congress's power. Never mind that Democrats had expressly said the penalty was not a tax. Majority Leader Roberts declared it to be so.

Enter Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, who argues in Texas v. U.S. that since Congress has repealed the mandate, the tax is no longer a tax, and ObamaCare is thus illegal. Judge O'Connor agreed with that logic, and he went further in ruling that since Congress said the mandate is crucial to the structure of ObamaCare, then all of ObamaCare must fall along with the mandate.

We'll admit to a certain satisfaction in seeing the Chief Justice hoist on his own logic. But his ruling in NFIB v. Sebelius was in 2012 and there is more at issue legally now than the ""tax"" issue in that opinion. One legal complication is that Congress in 2017 repealed the financial part of the individual mandate, not the structure of the mandate itself. Republicans used budget rules to pass tax reform so they couldn't repeal the mandate's express language.

The Affordable Care Act has also been up and running since 2014, which means so-called reliance interests come into play when considering a precedent. Millions of people now rely on ObamaCare's subsidies and rules, which argues against judges repealing the law by fiat.

Judge O'Connor breezes past this like a liberal Ninth Circuit appeals judge handling a Donald Trump appeal. He's right that Democrats claimed the individual mandate was essential to the Affordable Care Act. But when Congress killed the financial penalty in 2017 it left the rest of ObamaCare intact. When judging congressional intent, a judge must account for the amending Congress as well as the original Congress.

In any case, the Supreme Court's ""severability"" doctrine calls for restraint in declaring an entire law illegal merely because one part of it is. Our guess is that even the right-leaning Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals judges will overturn Judge O'Connor on this point.

As for the politics, Democrats claim to be alarmed by the ruling but the truth is they're elated. They want to use it to further pound Republicans for denying health insurance for pre-existing conditions if the law is overturned. Democrats campaigned across the country against Mr. Paxton's lawsuit to gain House and Senate seats in November, and they will now press votes in Congress so they can compound the gains in 2020.

President Trump hailed the ruling in a tweet, but he has never understood the Affordable Care Act. His Administration has done good work revising regulations to reduce health-care costs and increase access, but the risk is that the lawsuit will cause Republicans in Congress to panic politically and strike a deal with Democrats that reinforces ObamaCare. This is what happens when conservatives fall into the liberal trap of thinking they can use the courts to achieve policy goals that need to be won in Congress.

The Washington Post on withdrawing all 2,000 U.S. troops out of Syria:

PRESIDENT TRUMP'S sudden move to yank U.S. troops out of Syria undermined at a stroke several foreign policy goals he has championed. The president promised to finish the job of destroying the Islamic State, but the withdrawal will leave thousands of its fighters still in place. He vowed to roll back Iran's aggression across the Middle East, but his decision will allow its forces to entrench in the country that is the keystone of Tehran's ambitions. He promised to protect Israel, but that nation will now be left to face alone the buildup by Iran and its proxies along its northern border.

The president's top national security advisers had carefully developed and articulated a strategy of maintaining a U.S. presence in Syria until the Islamic State was beyond revival and Iran withdrew its forces -- a plan they were defending up until this week. Mr. Trump has again demonstrated, to them and to the world, that no U.S. policy or foreign commitment is immune from his whims.

Mr. Trump claimed the Islamic State had been defeated, but that is not the view of the Defense and State Departments. Thousands of jihadist fighters are still in Syria and control splotches of territory in the Euphrates Valley. A U.S. withdrawal will give the extremists an opportunity to reconstitute, as they did in Iraq following the premature U.S. withdrawal ordered by President Barack Obama.

Until Wednesday, a prime talking point of senior national security officials was that, ""if we've learned one thing over the years, (the) enduring defeat of a group like this means you can't just defeat their physical space and then leave,"" as the State Department's special envoy for the global campaign against the Islamic State, Brett McGurk, put it last week. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said it another way in September: ""Getting rid of the caliphate doesn't mean you then blindly say, 'Okay, we got rid of it,' march out, and then wonder why the caliphate comes back.""

Mr. Trump has justified some of his most controversial decisions, including his continued support for Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, as needed to contain Iran's threat to the United States and its allies. But the Syrian withdrawal hands Tehran and its ally Russia a windfall. Iran has deployed thousands of fighters and allied militiamen to Syria and aspires to create a corridor to Lebanon and the Mediterranean, as well as a new front against Israel along the Golan Heights. In reaction to that threat, Mr. Trump's national security adviser, John Bolton, announced Sept. 24 that ""We're not going to leave (Syria) as long as Iranian troops are outside Iranian borders, and that includes Iranian proxies and militias.""

U.S. ambitions in Syria have never been backed by adequate resources, and a case could be made that neither Congress nor the American public were prepared to support the mission suggested by Mr. Bolton. But Mr. Trump's decision appears to have been precipitated by the bellicose rhetoric of Turkey's Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who last week threatened -- not for the first time -- a military operation against Syrian Kurds, even though U.S. troops are positioned around them. The autocratic Turkish ruler appears to have extracted multiple favors from Mr. Trump in recent days, including the sale of U.S. Patriot missiles and a promise to reexamine the possible extradition of his rival, Fethullah Gulen, from Pennsylvania. If Mr. Trump received anything in return, he hasn't disclosed it.

The Syrian Kurdish forces, which have fought alongside the United States and played a crucial role in liberating most of eastern Syria from the jihadists, will be perhaps the foremost victims of Mr. Trump's decision. Betrayed by Washington, they will now be subject to a military offensive by Turkey. The stab in the back will send an unforgettable message to all who are asked to cooperate with the United States in the fight against terrorism: Washington is an unreliable and dangerous partner.

The Orange County (California) Register on Mick Mulvaney as Trump's choice for chief of staff:

President Trump has found a new chief of staff, albeit an interim one, in his director of the Office of Management and Budget, Mick Mulvaney.

That of chief is a terribly important post, perhaps government's most consequential aside from that of his boss. In theory, at least, the chief of staff is the gatekeeper for everything the president does, everyone he sees, everyone he talks to on the phone.

Perhaps, though few would expect this to be the case, the arbiter of every time he sends out a tweet, and of what it should say.

A Washington insider, a former congressman, Mulvaney is in many ways ideal for the job. He wants it, badly, whereas others with similarly impressive resumes touted for the job have indicated a strong desire to spend more time with their families, from Vice President Pence's staff chief Nick Ayers of Georgia to former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie.

Mulvaney shares the conservative values currently espoused by the president and was a founder of the House Freedom Caucus in 2013, the group that always taunted the Republican leadership, opposing much government funding, including debt limit increases and budget agreements made with the Democrats.

But he also, after Trump secured the Republican nomination in 2016, called the candidate ""a terrible human being"" who he only was voting for out of an even greater dislike of Hillary Clinton.

It's not as if other presidential allies of today haven't said bad things about him in the past. On the campaign trail, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz called his rival ""a narcissist at a level I don't think this country's ever seen,"" for instance.

But if you were the nation's chief executive -- or the CEO of a much smaller entity, for that matter -- could you hire as your top aide and work with a person who had once dubbed you ""terrible""?

Or does this kind of talk come with the territory in politics, where many strange bedfellows are made because of having to run in elections against once and perhaps future allies? Should Trump indeed elevate this practical choice for staff chief to permanent status immediately?

Los Angeles Times on banning bump stocks, which allow semi-automatic weapons to fire like machine guns:

The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives said Tuesday that it had finalized a rule reclassifying so-called bump stocks -- the devices that can make a semiautomatic rifle fire nearly as quickly a fully automatic weapon -- as machine guns, which makes it illegal to manufacture, sell or possess them. The agency said a year ago it had the authority to reclassify the devices, and President Trump -- in the wake of the Parkland, Fla., school shooting -- directed the ATF to speed up the process. Tuesday's announcement -- a rare bit of welcome news from the Trump administration -- makes it official; White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters that owners of the conversion devices will have until March 21 to destroy them or turn them in to the ATF.

This is a good step. Unfortunately, it's all but certain to be challenged in the courts, and it's on shaky legal ground because of the way the new rule evolved. The Obama administration determined that because bump stocks have ""no automatically functioning mechanical parts and (perform) no automated mechanical functions when installed,"" they did not fit the definition of a machine gun in federal law, which meant the ATF lacked the authority to regulate them. Tuesday's announcement, by contrast, hinges not on the technical specifications, but on the functionality. In essence, if it fires like a machine gun, it's a machine gun. Cue the lawyers.

We hope the administration prevails in whatever challenges emerge, but the sure-fire way to resolve this would be for Congress to legislate bump stocks and related gadgets out of existence. Such devices serve no function other than to evade the strict congressional limit on machine guns by, as the ATF said, harnessing ""the recoil energy of the semiautomatic firearm in a manner that allows the trigger to reset and continue firing"" without the shooter having to pull the trigger for each shot.

A mass shooter in Las Vegas used bump stocks affixed to semiautomatic rifles to fire more than 1,000 rounds in a matter of minutes from a 32nd-floor suite of the Mandalay Bay Hotel into a crowd of some 20,000 people, killing 58 concertgoers and injuring hundreds of others. It was the largest single mass shooting in the modern era, drawing attention to bump stocks and sparking outraged demands by many -- the Los Angeles Times included -- that the devices be banned.

As welcome as this new rule is, it will do little to corral our national problem with gun violence. The vast majority of gun deaths come in ones and twos, led by suicides. ...

But it is progress. And the president deserves credit for sticking with his promise to find a way to ban bump stocks. ...

China Daily says telecommunications giant Huawei is a victim of U.S. panic attacks:

This year has not been an annus mirabilis for China's Huawei Technologies Ltd, the world's largest supplier of telecommunications network equipment and second-biggest maker of smartphones.

Although it has been constantly in the news and it is said there is no such thing as bad publicity, it has been making headlines because of the spurious claims it somehow poses a threat to the West, even world peace. It has never been explained exactly how.

In fact it is not because of anything it has done, but because its success has brought it into the crosshairs of the United States' anxiety attacks against China.

Huawei is at the forefront of 5G technology. This latest generation mobile network technology promises to bring the much anticipated and heralded internet of things to life and the US is determined to be the 5G leader.

Not only because whichever country develops the technology that is adopted as standard will have a huge commercial advantage. But also because by setting the standard it will have a knowledge advantage.

As a result, first the US and then one after another its most obedient allies have blocked Huawei from entering their 5G markets on security grounds.

None of them have offered any specific justification for blocking Huawei. They just repeat their claim that the company poses a security risk. That is why objective observers have concluded that those countries are politicizing a commercial issue.

It sets a harmful precedent. What if other countries used the same excuse to block US companies (not confined to the telecom sector)? The US companies are very competitive in many fields, including those that could pose huge security risks, such as finance.

While Huawei will not go unscathed from being prevented from entering key markets, as a competitive player, it still has a vast market to access in other parts of the world. It has signed contracts to supply 5G equipment to 25 telecom carriers, and more than 10,000 5G base stations have been shipped.

In stark contrast to the US and its allies, India for instance, has invited Huawei to conduct 5G trials in the country and complimented it on the role it has played in helping to develop its telecom industry.

The efforts of the US and its allies to try to shield their companies against a Chinese competitor are politically motivated, not the result of a fact-based or transparent decision-making process. And they are counterproductive to the concerted efforts that are needed to ensure the security of 5G networks."
461,1310 news,https://www.1310news.com/2019/01/11/shutdown-suspends-federal-cleanups-at-us-superfund-sites/,"BIRMINGHAM, Ala. -- The government shutdown has suspended federal cleanups at Superfund sites around the nation and forced the cancellation of public hearings, deepening the mistrust and resentment of surrounding residents who feel people in power long ago abandoned them to live among the toxic residue of the country's factories and mines.

""We are already hurting, and it's just adding more fuel to the fire,"" says 40-year-old Keisha Brown, whose wood-frame home is in a community nestled among coking plants and other factories on Birmingham's north side.

The mostly African-American community has been forced to cope with high levels of arsenic, lead and other contaminants in the soil that the Environmental Protection Agency has been scraping up and carting away, house by house.

As President Donald Trump and Congress battle over Trump's demand for a wall on the southern U.S. border, the nearly 3-week-old partial government shutdown has stopped federal work on Superfund sites except for cases where the administration deems ""there is an imminent threat to the safety of human life or to the protection of property.""

EPA's shutdown plans said the agency would evaluate about 800 Superfund sites to see how many could pose an immediate threat. As an example of that kind of threat, it cited an acid leak from a mine that could threaten the public water supply. That's the hazard at Northern California's Iron Mountain mine, where EPA workers help prevent an unending flow of lethally acidic runoff off the Superfund site from spilling into rivers downstream.

Practically speaking, said Bonnie Bellow, a former EPA official who worked on Superfund public outreach at the agency, the impact of the stoppage of work at sites across the nation ""wholly depends"" on the length of the shutdown.

""Unless there is immediate risk like a storm, a flood, a week or two of slowdowns is not going to very likely affect the cleanup at the site,"" Bellow said.

In north Birmingham, Brown said it's been a couple of weeks since she's spotted any EPA crews at people's houses. It wasn't clear if state workers or contractors were continuing work.

But long before the shutdown began, Brown harboured doubts the cleanup was working anyway. ""My main concern is the health of the people out here,"" said Brown, who has asthma. ""All of us are sick, and we've got to function on medicine every day.""

In terms of time, the federal government shutdown is a chronological blip in the long history of the site -- which includes ethics charges in a local bribery scandal to block federal cleanup efforts -- but adds to the uncertainty in an area where residents feel forgotten and betrayed.

At the EPA, the shutdown has furloughed the bulk of the agency's roughly 14,000 employees. It also means the EPA isn't getting most of the daily stream of environmental questions and tips from the public. Routine inspections aren't happening. State, local and private emails to EPA officials often get automated messages back promising a response when the shutdown ends.

In Montana, for instance, state officials this month found themselves fielding calls from a tribal member worried about drinking water with a funny look to it, said Kristi Ponozzo, public-policy director at that state's Department of Environmental Quality. The EPA normally provides tribes with technical assistance on water supplies.

With most EPA colleagues idled, Ponozzo said, her agency also had to call off an environmental review meeting for a mining project, potentially delaying the project.

But it's the agency's work at Superfund sites -- lessening the threat from old nuclear-weapons plants, chemical factories, mines and other entities -- that gets much of the attention.

Absent imminent peril, it would be up to state governments or contractors to continue any cleanup during the shutdown ""up to the point that additional EPA direction or funding is needed,"" the EPA said in a statement.

""Sites where cleanup activities have been stopped or shut down will be secured until cleanup activities are able to commence when the federal government reopens,"" the agency said.

For federal Superfund sites in Michigan, the shutdown means there are no EPA colleagues to consult, said Scott Dean, a spokesman for that state's Department of Environmental Quality.

At Michigan Superfund sites, day-to-day field operations were continuing since private contractors do most of the on-the-ground work, Dean said.

Bellow, the former EPA official, said the cancellation of hearings about Superfund sites posed immediate concerns.

In East Chicago, Indiana, for example, the EPA called off a planned public hearing set for last Wednesday to outline how the agency planned to clean up high levels of lead and arsenic in the soil.

The EPA has proposed a seven-month, $26.5 million cleanup that includes treating and removing tainted soil from the area, where a lead smelter previously was located.

During a public meeting Nov. 29, some residents complained that the EPA's approach would leave too much pollution in place. But others didn't get a chance to speak and were hoping to do so at the meeting this week, said Debbie Chizewer, a Northwestern University environmental attorney who represents community groups in the low-income area.

The EPA announced the cancellation in an online notice and gave no indication that it would be rescheduled.

Leaders of the East Chicago Calumet Community Advisory Group asked for a new hearing date and an extension of a Jan. 14 public comment deadline in a letter to the EPA's regional Superfund division.

Calls by The Associated Press to the agency's regional office in Chicago this week were not answered.

Local critics fear the EPA will use the delay caused by the shutdown as justification for pushing ahead with a cleanup strategy they consider flawed, Chizewer said, even though the agency has designated the affected area as an ""environmental justice community"" -- a low-income community of colour that has been disproportionately harmed by pollution.

The EPA has a ""special obligation"" when dealing with such communities, Chizewer said. ""This would be an example of shutting them out for no good reason.""

In North Birmingham, former longtime neighbourhood resident Charlie Powell said most of the people living in and around the Superfund site had already ""just got tired and fed up.""

Powell left the area but started a group called PANIC, People Against Neighborhood Industrial Contamination. He believes money would be better spent helping residents move away from the pollution.

""Can I say hell?"" Powell said when asked what residents have been through.

463,the  olympian,https://www.theolympian.com/news/nation-world/national/article223310670.html,"Don't answer that question ""No"" without visiting the fundraiser site first.

As President Donald Trump is said to be mulling ""other options"" for funding his border wall between the U.S. and Mexico, according to the Associated Press, a dark horse arises on the internet.

A GoFundMe campaign popped up Sunday, hoping to raise funds for Trump's proposed wall between the U.S. and Mexico, which isn't news in and of itself. There are plenty of those around.

But the organizers of this campaign are so encouraged that they've raised more-than $700,000 in just three days that they've bumped their original goal of $200 million up to a cool billion.

The GoFundMe organizer is listed as triple-amputee Air Force veteran Brian Kolfage, who lost both legs and his right arm in a blast at Balad Air Force Base in Iraq in 2004, according to the Arizona Daily Star. The fundraiser is titled, ""We the people will fund the wall.""

The contact listing for the organizer says ""The Wall Funding Team"" is located in Miramar, Fla.

""As a veteran who has given so much, 3 limbs, I feel deeply invested to this nation to ensure future generations have everything we have today,"" Kolfage wrote in the GoFundMe campaign description. ""Too many Americans have been murdered by illegal aliens and too many illegals are taking advantage of the United States taxpayers with no means of ever contributing to our society.

""I have grandparents who immigrated to America legally, they did it the correct way and it's time we uphold our laws, and get this wall BUILT! It's up to Americans to help out and pitch in to get this project rolling.""

Multiple studies and reports have shown, though, that illegal immigrants commit crime, violent or nonviolent, at lesser rates than do native-born Americans.

Kolfage's GoFundMe campaign was listed as the ""Top fundraiser"" on the front page of the crowd-sourced social fundraising website as of Wednesday afternoon, despite Kolfage's claims that the platform was trying to hide his fundraiser from potential donors.

Kolfage's Facebook page, where he posts content relevant to his conservative political beliefs, has more than 90,000 followers.

""We have contacted the Trump Administration to secure a point of contact where all funds will go upon completion,"" the campaign says. ""When get this information secured we will update. We have many very high level contacts already helping."""
464,the  olympian,https://www.theolympian.com/news/politics-government/national-politics/article224069750.html,"With illegal immigration at its lowest level in a decade, it's nothing short of stunning that the federal government is shut down over funding for a border wall.

Yet here we are, entering a third week of the shutdown because President Donald Trump has inexplicably chosen to dig his heels in on getting $5 billion to build a wall along stretches of the U.S. border with Mexico that do not already have such a barrier in place.

""As long as it takes,"" Trump said last week when asked how long he was willing to let the shutdown last. ""I mean, look, I'm prepared. I think the people of the country think I'm right. I think the people of this country think I'm right.""

Except, polling shows the opposite. Major polls conducted last month by Quinnipiac, Harvard, NPR and others all showed that a majority of Americans do not support the wall. And the number of wall supporters shrinks even more when asked if it is worth shutting down the government over.

The reality is that immigration from Mexico has been decreasing since 2007, and the number of unauthorized immigrants living in the U.S. is at its lowest level since 2004, according to the Pew Research Center.

Further, the majority of illegal immigration to the United States from Mexico occurs in and around heavily secured ports of entry like San Diego, El Paso and Brownsville, Texas, where 654 miles of wall, fencing and other barriers already exist. Spending billions to build a structure along vast, rural stretches of the border doesn't help with security at the sections of the border that most need help.

No one is arguing for unsecure borders. The newly installed Democratic Congress voted Thursday to approve a stopgap funding bill that would reopen the federal government and provide $1.3 billion for border security in the form of manpower and equipment but not a wall. Trump has said he won't sign it, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell refuses to let a bill come to the Senate floor that the president won't sign.

It's hard to know what the president's end game is. He couldn't get the border wall approved when Republicans controlled both the House and the Senate, so it seems odd to take this stance on the heels of a midterm election in which Democrats made their biggest gains in 40 years and took control of the House.

Trump may feel he is being true to his base of ardent supporters, among whom the border wall ranked high on their list of priorities. But his focus is sorely misplaced. Rather, his attention should be focused on the independent voters who took a chance on him in 2016 believing his style could prove effective at getting things done in Washington. Shutting down the federal government in an effort to get $5 billion for a wall that most Americans don't feel the country needs is the opposite of getting things done.

Laura Kelly is already on the case for Kansas kids with decision to name new DCF leader ' The Kansas City Star

This is why voters elected incoming Gov. Laura Kelly: Because we need to do so much better for Kansas children, because we badly need transparency in state government and because there is zero time to waste in recovering all that was lost under Governors Sam Brownback and Jeff Colyer.

So good for her for marching so briskly into 2019. On Thursday, Kelly announced that she will replace Gina Meier-Hummel as head of the state's child welfare system. The Kansas Department for Children and Families was on what seemed like permanent crisis footing long before Meier-Hummel got there in fall of 2017. But it has remained troubled under her sometimes questionable leadership, and a change was in order.

Meier-Hummel had a difficult job and did make some improvements, which began with a top-to-bottom audit.

But she talked about transparency and didn't show enough of it. She decided to hire inexperienced and unlicensed social workers to fill jobs investigating reports of abuse and neglect. And she replaced contracts for foster care, family preservation and other services with grants that got around rules on no-bid arrangements.

Kelly asked the Colyer administration that she'll soon supplant -- in 11 days, her announcement noted, and we're glad she's counting -- not to implement those grants at this point. Meier-Hummel immediately said she'd honor that request.

The governor-elect also said outright that the state's procurement process wasn't followed and that agency officials had tried to keep her from learning more about how the grantees were chosen.

We wanted Kelly to clean house and name names, for the sake of the state's struggling families, and she's already doing that.

As The Star has reported, the agency gave a major grant to a Florida nonprofit already facing heavy criticism for its foster care. An agency spokeswoman argued that they'd been hired to provide family preservation services, not foster care, but it's still the same nonprofit group.

Meier-Hummel will be succeeded on an interim basis by Laura Howard, who for now will head both the DCF and the Kansas Department for Aging and Disability Services. A former regional administrator in a federal agency overseeing substance abuse and mental health services, Howard is currently director of the Public Management Center in the School of Public Affairs and Administration at the University of Kansas.

Meier-Hummel responded to Kelly's no-nonsense announcement with a news release of her own. It listed her achievements, including starting a new Wichita abuse and neglect reporting line, ""changing key policies and procedures and implementing further mandated training"" and reducing the number of missing and runaway kids by just over a quarter. The suspended grants are in the ""absolute best interest"" of Kansas children and families, the DCF's announcement said.

That's a matter of opinion, but ours is that Kelly has done the right thing and is off to a promising start even before being sworn in as governor."
465,the  olympian,https://www.theolympian.com/news/business/article224126560.html,"The Latest on President Donald Trump and the partial government shutdown (all times local):

3:16 p.m.

Congressional leaders from both parties have returned to the White House for another round of negotiations with President Donald Trump on the ongoing partial government shutdown.

The two sides have made no apparent progress in the past week, with Trump sticking to his demand of $5.7 billion for a border barrier and Democrats insisting they won't give him the money.

Trump has been making a public case that there is a ""crisis"" at the southern border. And he's still threatening to declare a national emergency to circumvent Congress if he can't get the wall money from them.

He told reporters during a visit to the Capitol earlier Wednesday that he may turn to a declaration ""at some point"" if top Democrats Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi ""don't agree"" with his assessment about the problems at the border.

President Donald Trump says Republicans are ""totally unified"" in the shutdown standoff over his long-promised southern border wall, though some GOP lawmakers have been expressing concern about the 19-day partial government closure.

Trump traveled to Capitol Hill on Wednesday to meet with Senate Republicans. He says there was ""no discussion about anything other than solidarity.""

Trump has been considering a national emergency declaration to bypass Congress to build the wall. He says he ""may do that at some point"" if he can't get a deal with Democrats.

Trump also plans to meet with top congressional Democrats and Republicans at the White House on Wednesday.

President Donald Trump arrived on Capitol Hill claiming he has ""tremendous"" support as he headed into a meeting with Republican senators uneasy with the government shutdown over his border wall.

Asked how long the shutdown would last, Trump told reporters Wednesday ""whatever it takes.""

The partial shutdown is now in its 19th day, the second longest ever.

Trump and Vice President Mike Pence arrived for the private lunch meeting with the Senate GOP caucus to shore up support.

Several Republican senators have said the government should be re-opened while talks continue over border security and Trump's demand for money to build the wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.

President Donald Trump says he thinks he and the Democrats are ""getting closer"" to a deal to end the budget stalemate that has partially shut down the government despite no evidence that any progress has been made.

And he's suggesting the partial government shutdown could be ""a blessing in disguise"" because, he suggests, it could lead to a broader immigration deal.

Trump spoke Wednesday during an Oval Office bill signing on anti-human trafficking legislation. It's a day after he delivered a prime-time address trying to make the case for his long-stalled U.S.-Mexico border wall.

Trump says that he would like to see ""real immigration reform in this country because we need it."" He says, ""Everybody wants to see immigration reform,"" adding that perhaps the stalemate ""will turn out to be a blessing in disguise.""

Gone are the days when the U.S. and Mexican governments regularly exchanged statements over President Donald Trump's insistence on a border wall.

Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said Wednesday he won't be drawn into what he calls a U.S. internal dispute, an apparent reference to the 19-day-old partial U.S. government shutdown over a border barrier.

Lopez Obrador says, ""We are not going to respond to situations arising from internal affairs in the United States.""

Unlike his predecessor, the Mexican leader didn't have to respond to any specific aspersion about Mexico, because Trump didn't make any in his Tuesday night address to the American public. Relations between the two leaders have been surprisingly cordial, given their ideological differences.

Lopez Obrador said, ""Of course, there are those ... who want us to get into a confrontation. We always want a friendly relationship with the United States, a cooperative relationship.""

As a presidential candidate Trump promised Mexico would pay for a border wall, but Mexico refused.

President Donald Trump is using a bill signing focused on curbing human trafficking to push his case for a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border.

Trump says a southern border that is not secured exacerbates the incidents of human trafficking. He says, ""As long as we have a border that is not secure, we're going to suffer the consequences of that.""

Wednesday's bill signing came a day after Trump's prime-time speech designed to persuade Americans that illegal immigration and trafficking at the border are a crisis.

Democrats have called Trump's promised wall costly, ineffective and ""immoral"" and say he's ""manufacturing a crisis.""

The bill Trump signed is designed to enhance an annual State Department report that measures global efforts to eliminate human trafficking.

The White House says it's the fourth bipartisan bill the Republican president has signed in the last few weeks to prevent human trafficking.

Congressional Democrats say they'll head to the White House with the plan to reopen the government -- the same one they've been presenting. They're asking President Donald Trump to accept a bipartisan bill to fund border security without the wall.

Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Wednesday the president ""could end the Trump shutdown and re-open the government today, and he should.""

Pelosi and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer spoke at an event where they were flanked by federal workers going without pay during the shutdown, now in its 19th day.

Schumer called workers the ""collateral damage"" of Trump's ""temper tantrum."" He said the president failed to ""persuade a soul"" during his ""divisive"" prime-time address Tuesday night to the nation.

Trump meets with congressional leaders at the White House Wednesday afternoon. He rejected the Senate's bipartisan funding bill in December, sparking the shutdown.

The White House is trying to keep jittery congressional Republicans from defecting over the toll the partial government shutdown is taking in their states.

President Donald Trump and Democrats have been at an impasse over funding for his proposed border wall, which has led to a partial government shutdown, now in its 19th day.

Trump meets with Senate Republicans Wednesday on Capitol Hill just hours after he argued on national television that a border wall was needed to resolve a security and humanitarian ""crisis.""

Senators say the shutdown has led to disruptions in agricultural payments for farmers, as well as for home buyers trying to secure government-backed home loans. Lawmakers also are worried about missed paychecks for government workers Friday.

As many as half a dozen GOP senators have said the government should reopen while border security negotiations with Democrats continue.

President Donald Trump again linked illegal immigration along the southern border with drugs and violent crime as he urged Democratic lawmakers to fund his proposed border wall.

In his first national address from the Oval Office, the president gave no indication he was softening his stance that the partial government shutdown would continue without money for the wall.

Trump argued Tuesday night that the wall was needed to resolve what he called a security and humanitarian ""crisis.""

He addressed the nation as the shutdown stretched through its third week, with hundreds of thousands of federal workers going without pay and some congressional Republicans growing increasingly jittery about the impasse.

Trump plans to visit Senate Republicans at the Capitol on Wednesday before meeting with Democratic leaders at the White House."
466,the  olympian,https://www.theolympian.com/news/nation-world/article224499960.html,"Congress returns to Washington for its first full week of legislative business since control of the House reverted to Democrats, but lawmakers will be confronted with the same lingering question: When will the partial government shutdown end?

One Republican senator says he's offered President Donald Trump a possible solution, though it may just be wishful thinking.

Sen. Lindsey Graham is encouraging Trump to reopen government for several weeks to continue negotiating with Democrats over the border wall Trump wants to build on the U.S.-Mexico border. If there's no deal at the end of that time, Graham says Trump would be free to take the more dramatic step of declaring a national emergency to build it.

But the South Carolina Republican says Trump still wants a deal on funding for the wall before agreeing to reopen shuttered government departments. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat, insists Trump reopen the government first.

Their weeks-old standoff led to the partial government shutdown, now on day 24 without a clear end in sight.

""Before he pulls the plug on the legislative option, and I think we're almost there, I would urge him to open up the government for a short period of time, like three weeks, before he pulls the plug, see if we can get a deal,"" Graham said. ""If we can't at the end of three weeks, all bets are off.

""See if he can do it by himself through the emergency powers. That's my recommendation,"" added Graham, who has publicly pushed Trump to use his authority to declare a national emergency to build the wall. Such a step would allow Trump to bypass Congress and tap various pots of unspent federal money, including for military construction and disaster relief as well as from assets seized by law enforcement, to pay for the wall.

Trump has kept Washington on edge over whether he would resort to such a declaration, citing what he says is a ""crisis"" of drug smuggling and the trafficking of women and children at the border. The president initially sounded as though such a move was imminent, but then pulled back. He has said several times since he first mentioned the idea in public this month that he prefers a legislative solution.

A key question is how much more time is Trump willing to give lawmakers. Graham, who spoke with Trump by telephone on Sunday morning, said the legislative path ""is just about shut off"" and blamed intransigence by Pelosi.

The speaker's office had no immediate comment.

Democrats oppose an emergency declaration but may be powerless to block it. Some Republicans are wary, too, fearing how a future Democratic president might use that authority. Such a move, should Trump ultimately go that route, would almost certainly be challenged in the courts.

Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., called Graham's idea to reopen the government a ""great place to start.""

""I do think if we reopen the government, if the president ends this shutdown crisis, we have folks who can negotiate a responsible, modern investment in technology that will actually make us safer,"" Coons said.

Trump says technology is nice, but that the border can't be secured without a wall.

The White House has been laying the groundwork for an emergency declaration, which is feared by lawmakers in both parties.

Senate Homeland Security Committee Chairman Ron Johnson, R-Wis., said he'd ""hate to see"" a declaration issued because the wall wouldn't get built, presumably because of legal challenges. Democrats voted in the past for border security and should again, he said.

""I actually want to see this wall get built,"" Johnson said. ""I want to keep pressure on Democrats to actually come to the negotiating table in good faith and fund what they have supported in the past.""

Graham favors a declaration and said the time for talk is running out.

""It's the last option, not the first option, but we're pretty close to that being the only option,"" he said.

Graham and Coons spoke on ""Fox News Sunday"" and Johnson appeared on CNN's ""State of the Union."""
467,the  olympian,https://www.theolympian.com/news/business/article224277975.html,"The government shutdown has suspended federal cleanups at Superfund sites around the nation and forced the cancellation of public hearings, deepening the mistrust and resentment of surrounding residents who feel people in power long ago abandoned them to live among the toxic residue of the country's factories and mines.

""We are already hurting, and it's just adding more fuel to the fire,"" says 40-year-old Keisha Brown, whose wood-frame home is in a community nestled among coking plants and other factories on Birmingham's north side.

The mostly African-American community has been forced to cope with high levels of arsenic, lead and other contaminants in the soil that the Environmental Protection Agency has been scraping up and carting away, house by house.

As President Donald Trump and Congress battle over Trump's demand for a wall on the southern U.S. border, the nearly 3-week-old partial government shutdown has stopped federal work on Superfund sites except for cases where the administration deems ""there is an imminent threat to the safety of human life or to the protection of property.""

EPA's shutdown plans said the agency would evaluate about 800 Superfund sites to see how many could pose an immediate threat. As an example of that kind of threat, it cited an acid leak from a mine that could threaten the public water supply. That's the hazard at Northern California's Iron Mountain mine, where EPA workers help prevent an unending flow of lethally acidic runoff off the Superfund site from spilling into rivers downstream.

Practically speaking, said Bonnie Bellow, a former EPA official who worked on Superfund public outreach at the agency, the impact of the stoppage of work at sites across the nation ""wholly depends"" on the length of the shutdown.

""Unless there is immediate risk like a storm, a flood, a week or two of slowdowns is not going to very likely affect the cleanup at the site,"" Bellow said.

In north Birmingham, Brown said it's been a couple of weeks since she's spotted any EPA crews at people's houses. It wasn't clear if state workers or contractors were continuing work.

But long before the shutdown began, Brown harbored doubts the cleanup was working anyway. ""My main concern is the health of the people out here,"" said Brown, who has asthma. ""All of us are sick, and we've got to function on medicine every day.""

In terms of time, the federal government shutdown is a chronological blip in the long history of the site -- which includes ethics charges in a local bribery scandal to block federal cleanup efforts -- but adds to the uncertainty in an area where residents feel forgotten and betrayed.

At the EPA, the shutdown has furloughed the bulk of the agency's roughly 14,000 employees. It also means the EPA isn't getting most of the daily stream of environmental questions and tips from the public. Routine inspections aren't happening. State, local and private emails to EPA officials often get automated messages back promising a response when the shutdown ends.

In Montana, for instance, state officials this month found themselves fielding calls from a tribal member worried about drinking water with a funny look to it, said Kristi Ponozzo, public-policy director at that state's Department of Environmental Quality. The EPA normally provides tribes with technical assistance on water supplies.

With most EPA colleagues idled, Ponozzo said, her agency also had to call off an environmental review meeting for a mining project, potentially delaying the project.

But it's the agency's work at Superfund sites -- lessening the threat from old nuclear-weapons plants, chemical factories, mines and other entities -- that gets much of the attention.

Absent imminent peril, it would be up to state governments or contractors to continue any cleanup during the shutdown ""up to the point that additional EPA direction or funding is needed,"" the EPA said in a statement.

""Sites where cleanup activities have been stopped or shut down will be secured until cleanup activities are able to commence when the federal government reopens,"" the agency said.

For federal Superfund sites in Michigan, the shutdown means there are no EPA colleagues to consult, said Scott Dean, a spokesman for that state's Department of Environmental Quality.

At Michigan Superfund sites, day-to-day field operations were continuing since private contractors do most of the on-the-ground work, Dean said.

Bellow, the former EPA official, said the cancellation of hearings about Superfund sites posed immediate concerns.

In East Chicago, Indiana, for example, the EPA called off a planned public hearing set for last Wednesday to outline how the agency planned to clean up high levels of lead and arsenic in the soil.

The EPA has proposed a seven-month, $26.5 million cleanup that includes treating and removing tainted soil from the area, where a lead smelter previously was located.

During a public meeting Nov. 29, some residents complained that the EPA's approach would leave too much pollution in place. But others didn't get a chance to speak and were hoping to do so at the meeting this week, said Debbie Chizewer, a Northwestern University environmental attorney who represents community groups in the low-income area.

The EPA announced the cancellation in an online notice and gave no indication that it would be rescheduled.

Leaders of the East Chicago Calumet Community Advisory Group asked for a new hearing date and an extension of a Jan. 14 public comment deadline in a letter to the EPA's regional Superfund division.

Calls by The Associated Press to the agency's regional office in Chicago this week were not answered.

Local critics fear the EPA will use the delay caused by the shutdown as justification for pushing ahead with a cleanup strategy they consider flawed, Chizewer said, even though the agency has designated the affected area as an ""environmental justice community"" -- a low-income community of color that has been disproportionately harmed by pollution.

The EPA has a ""special obligation"" when dealing with such communities, Chizewer said. ""This would be an example of shutting them out for no good reason.""

In North Birmingham, former longtime neighborhood resident Charlie Powell said most of the people living in and around the Superfund site had already ""just got tired and fed up.""

Powell left the area but started a group called PANIC, People Against Neighborhood Industrial Contamination. He believes money would be better spent helping residents move away from the pollution.

""Can I say hell?"" Powell said when asked what residents have been through.

468,business journal daily,https://businessjournaldaily.com/government-shutdown-not-yet-affecting-valley-economy/,"YOUNGSTOWN, Ohio - Most services, projects and businesses across the Mahoning Valley haven't yet felt the pinch of the partial shutdown of the federal government - now entering its third week with no resolution in sight.

That could change should the impasse continue through the month, possibly affecting tax filings, federal loan funding programs, subsidies for the agricultural community and even the introduction of new brands of beer on the market.

""Right now, we have more than $5 million in U.S. Small Business Administration lending activity in progress,"" said Michael Conway, executive director of the Mahoning Valley Economic Development Corp., or MVEDC. The organization administers the U.S. SBA 504 loan program to help provide money for new businesses or expansions of existing companies.

As of now, these projects are still going forward, Conway said, since they have secured bridge funding through local lenders and those lenders would be reimbursed through the SBA. Among the agency's current projects are ones for an auto dealership and a couple of manufacturers.

""The shutdown shouldn't slow down the projects, but getting the final piece of financing in place is predicated on this situation being resolved,"" he added. ""It definitely has an affect on the process.""

However, the establishment of any new loan funds through agencies such as the U.S. Department of Commerce's Economic Development Administration could not move ahead in the midst of a shutdown, he said.

""We have a couple of projects in process and we have to place those on hold,"" Conway said.

Congress and the White House have reached a stalemate in negotiations to fund the U.S. government, including the pay of more than 800,000 federal employees. At the heart of the matter is President Donald Trump's insistence that any spending bill include more than $5 billion to fund a wall across the border between the U.S. and Mexico.

Democrats, who now control the U.S. House of Representatives, have said they would not support a bill with such a provision.

Agencies such as the Social Security Administration and programs such as Medicare and Medicaid are not affected by the shutdown. Benefits for U.S. veterans would also continue unabated.

Yet federally funded operations such as the Transportation Security Administration, the National Park Service, museums, the Internal Revenue Service and the U.S. Department of Agriculture remain unfunded for this year.

That means important programs such as the Department of Agriculture's Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, could be in danger of running out of funds by the middle of February.

SNAP provides food stamps for 38 million low-income Americans that subsidize the cost of groceries. Reducing this benefit could impact retailers or grocers that accept these programs. The USDA has not released any information regarding the current funding level for the program.

Should the funding clamp on the USDA continue, it would likely jeopardize local soybean farmers' access to new programs initiated by the Trump administration to offset the sting of the nagging trade war between the U.S. and China.

""The Farm Service Agency is shut down and there are some deadlines looming,"" said Lee Beers, extension educator for agriculture and natural resources for the OSU Extension in Cortland.

Soybean farmers across the country who are negatively impacted by the trade conflict with China have until Jan. 15 to submit crop information to the USDA in order to qualify for payments intended to ease the impact of tariffs imposed by China.

Six months ago, China responded to the Trump Administration's 25% tariff it placed on $34 billion of Chinese goods with tariffs on commodities such as soybeans. In 2017, U.S. soybean exports to China amounted to more than $14 billion. Now, that market is compromised by the trade war.

The Trump Administration developed a new program that would provide payments to soybean farmers to help compensate them for losses incurred because of the trade war.

""My guess is that they'll extend the deadline,"" he predicted.

Moreover, should the government remained closed into February, the reserve funding for the Natural Resource Conservation Service will expire, rendering it inactive, Beers said. That agency helps with conservation and environmental safety initiatives in the region.

""These are the two biggest issues that I've been fielding questions about over the past week,"" Beers said. ""This has the potential of affecting a lot of the agricultural community, but I don't think we'll see any farms go out of business because of this.""

Even breweries could be impacted by the shutdown. Since the Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau remains closed, breweries are prohibited from introducing new beers across state lines without a label approval from the federal government.

""It doesn't affect us because we only distribute in the state of Ohio,"" said Josh Dunn, owner of Birdfish Beer Co. in Columbiana. ""It could affect someone waiting for a new license, though.""

Adam Keck, owner of Modern Methods Brewing Co. in Warren, said the government shutdown could hold up any new plans to obtain a license to start a local brewery. ""If we were in that position now, with the holidays and everything, it would have been really bad,"" he said.

U.S. Rep. Bill Johnson, a Republican who represents the 6 District of Ohio, which includes portions of the Mahoning Valley, said resolving the issue is simple.

""Senate Democrats and Nancy Pelosi need to come to the table, agree on the $5 billion and open the government,"" the congressmen said while touring Windsor House's skilled nursing center in Canfield Monday. ""My constituents are telling me that they want border security. Let's open the government with border security.""

U.S. Rep. Tim Ryan, D-13, Ohio, last week placed the blame squarely on the shoulders of Republicans and President Trump.

""The government shutdown is a crisis manufactured by President Trump and congressional Republicans. Their political game has put the lives of 800,000 dedicated public servants into uncertainty, many who live paycheck to paycheck,"" Ryan said Jan. 3, shortly after the House passed legislation that would restore government funding.

The Senate, however, refused to take up the legislation.

Meanwhile, the White House has ordered the IRS to process tax refunds through the course of the shutdown, while the federal courts are fully funded until at least next week.

""We are definitely good through Jan. 11, so right now we're not terribly affected,"" said Sandy Opacich, clerk of court for the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Ohio. The district, which includes Cleveland, Akron and Youngstown, employs between 250 and 300 people, all of whom are still being paid.

District courts across the country are being asked to examine their budgets in order to spread out their costs and extend funding for another week after Friday, Opacich said. Should that not happen, employees would either be furloughed or assigned work without regular pay.

""We're waiting on some guidance,"" she said.

Trump has expressed interest in a broader immigration overhaul, but says he first wants the Supreme Court to address the class of immigrants known as ""Dreamers."" Pelosi also has shown no interest in accepting a wall in exchange for immigration fixes.

And, Trump, who was holed up in the White House as snow blanketed Washington on Sunday, appeared to shoot down Graham's suggestion of a ""wall plus"" deal, saying on Twitter that even Democrats don't want to make ""Dreamers"" part of the negotiations.

WASHINGTON (AP) -- Pushing the government to the brink of a partial shutdown, the White House is insisting that Congress provide $5 billion to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border despite lawmaker resistance from both parties.

Without a resolution, parts of the federal government will shut down at midnight Friday.

""We're going to do whatever is necessary to build the border wall to stop this ongoing crisis of illegal immigration,"" White House senior adviser Stephen Miller said Sunday.

Asked if that meant having a government shutdown, he said: ""If it comes to it, absolutely.""

Child's death highlights communication barriers on border

Shortly before a 7-year-old Guatemalan girl died in U.S. custody, her father signed a form stating that his daughter was in good health. But it's unclear how much the man understood on the form, which was written in English and read to him in Spanish by Border Patrol agents.

The death of Jakelin Caal highlights the communication challenges along the U.S.-Mexico border as agents come in contact with an increasing number of migrants who speak neither English nor Spanish.

Her father's native language is the Mayan tongue known as Q'eqchi'. His second language is Spanish. It's unclear whether something was lost in translation or whether it would have made a difference in saving Jakelin after the two were detained and underwent a health screening along a remote stretch of U.S.-Mexico border. But the case raises questions about the Border Patrol's use of English-only forms.

All agents are required to speak Spanish, and they receive formal Spanish training. Reading forms in Spanish is often enough to pose basic questions. But some other Spanish-speaking migrants reported signing paperwork that they later said they did not understand.

Scores of immigrant parents who were separated from their children after crossing the border in the spring said they signed forms agreeing to be deported with the understanding that their kids would be returning with them, only to find themselves deported without them. Many had to wait months before being reunited with them in their homelands.

US conducts 6 airstrikes against Somalia extremists, 62 dead

JOHANNESBURG (AP) -- The U.S. military says it has carried out six airstrikes in the Gandarshe area of Somalia which killed a total of 62 al-Shabab extremist rebels.

In a statement issued Monday, the U.S. military's Africa Command said it carried out four strikes on Dec. 15 in which 34 people were killed and two more on Dec. 16 which killed 28. All the air attacks were in the Gandarshe coastal area south of the capital, Mogadishu, it said.

No civilians were injured or killed in the attacks, it said.

All six strikes were carried out in close co-ordination with Somalia's government, it said. The airstrikes were ""conducted to prevent al-Shabab from using remote areas as a safe haven to plot, direct, inspire, and recruit for future attacks,"" it said.

Al-Shabab uses parts of southern and central Somalia to plot and direct extremist attacks, steal humanitarian aid, extort the local populace to fund its operations, and shelter radicals, said the statement.

Saudi Arabia rejects US Senate's 'interference' in kingdom

RIYADH, Saudi Arabia (AP) -- Saudi Arabia issued an unusually strong rebuke of the U.S. Senate on Monday, rejecting a bipartisan resolution that put the blame for the killing of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi squarely on the Saudi crown prince and describing it as interference in the kingdom's affairs.

It's the latest sign of how the relationship between the royal court and Congress has deteriorated, more than two months after Khashoggi was killed and dismembered by Saudi agents inside the kingdom's consulate in Istanbul. The assassins have been linked to Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.

U.S. Senators last Thursday passed the measure that blamed the prince for Khashoggi's killing and called on Riyadh to ""ensure appropriate accountability."" Senators also passed a separate measure calling for the end of U.S. aid to the Saudi-led war in Yemen.

In a lengthy statement early Monday, Saudi Arabia said the Senate's resolution ""contained blatant interferences"" in the kingdom's internal affairs and undermines its regional and international role. The resolution was based on ""unsubstantiated claims and allegations,"" the statement also said.

""The kingdom categorically rejects any interference in its internal affairs, any and all accusations, in any manner, that disrespect its leadership ... and any attempts to undermine its sovereignty or diminish its stature,"" it said.

Most teen drug use is down, but officials fret vaping boom

NEW YORK (AP) -- Twice as many high school students used nicotine-tinged electronic cigarettes this year compared with last year, an unprecedented jump in a large annual survey of teen smoking, drinking and drug use.

It was the largest single-year increase in the survey's 44-year history, far surpassing a mid-1970s surge in marijuana smoking.

The findings, released Monday, echo those of a government survey earlier this year. That survey also found a dramatic rise in vaping among children and prompted federal regulators to press for measures that make it harder for kids to get them.

Experts attribute the jump to newer versions of e-cigarettes, like those by Juul Labs Inc. that resemble computer flash drives and can be used discreetly.

Trina Hale, a junior at South Charleston High School in West Virginia, said vaping -- specifically Juul -- exploded at her school this year.

That was August, 2017. By then, Atta and Amina Manaji, from the Muslim ethnic Uighur group native to Xinjiang, had been married for 14 years.

Atta is one of scores of Pakistani businessmen __ and he says there are more than 200 __ whose spouses have disappeared, taken to what Chinese authorities tell them are education centres.

Beijing has been accused of interning members of its Muslim population -- by some reports as many as 1 million -- to ""re-educate"" them away from their faith. It is seen as a response to riots and violent attacks that the government blamed on separatists.

Talks adopt 'rulebook' to put Paris climate deal into action

KATOWICE, Poland (AP) -- Almost 200 nations, including the world's top greenhouse gas producers, China and the United States, have adopted a set of rules meant to breathe life into the 2015 Paris climate accord by setting out how countries should report their emissions and efforts to reduce them.

But negotiators delayed other key decisions until next year -- a move that frustrated environmentalists and countries that wanted more ambitious goals in light of scientists' warnings that the world must shift sharply away from fossil fuels in the coming decade.

""The majority of the rulebook for the Paris agreement has been created, which is something to be thankful for,"" said Mohamed Adow, a climate policy expert at Christian Aid. ""But the fact countries had to be dragged kicking and screaming to the finish line shows that some nations have not woken up"" to the dire consequences of global warming as outlined in a report by the U.N Panel on Climate Change, or IPCC.

Officials at the talks, which ended late Saturday in the Polish city of Katowice, agreed upon universal rules on how nations can cut emissions. Poor countries secured assurances on financial support to help them reduce emissions, adapt to changes such as rising sea levels and pay for damage that has already happened.

""Through this package, you have made a thousand little steps forward together,"" said Michal Kurtyka, a senior Polish official who led the talks.

Nissan to replace rock-star chairman amid arrest scandal

TOKYO (AP) -- Nissan's board is meeting to pick a chairman to replace Carlos Ghosn, arrested last month on charges of violating financial regulations.

Monday's meeting comes amid an unfolding scandal that threatens the Japanese automaker's two-decade alliance with Renault SA of France and its global brand, as well as highlighting shoddy governance at the manufacturer of the Leaf electric car.

Ghosn and another board member Greg Kelly were formally charged last week with falsifying financial reports in underreporting Ghosn's income by about 5 billion yen ($44 million) between 2011 and 2015. They were arrested Nov. 19 by Tokyo prosecutors and remain in detention.

A source close to Ghosn's family says Ghosn is innocent as the alleged income was never decided upon or paid. Aubrey Harwell, the U.S. lawyer for Kelly, an American, says he is innocent, and that Nissan insiders and outside experts had advised him the financial reporting was proper.

The chairman must be selected from among the board members. Whether a decision will come Monday remains unclear. Three outside board members, racecar driver Keiko Ihara, Masakazu Toyoda, an academic, and Jean-Baptiste Duzan, formerly of Renault, are making that decision. There are nine board members, including Ghosn and Kelly.

Top of mind: 'Justice' is Merriam-Webster's word of the year

NEW YORK (AP) -- Racial justice. Obstruction of justice. Social justice. The Justice Department. Merriam-Webster has chosen ""justice"" as its 2018 word of the year, driven by the churning news cycle over months and months.

The word follows ""toxic,"" picked by Oxford Dictionaries, and ""misinformation,"" plucked by Dictonary.com.

Peter Sokolowski, Merriam-Webster's editor at large, told The Associated Press ahead of Monday's announcement that ""justice"" consistently bubbled into the top 20 or 30 lookups on the company's website, spiking at times due to specific events but also skating close to the surface for much of the year.

While it's one of those common words people likely know how to spell and use correctly in a sentence, Sokolowski pointed to other reasons that drive search traffic. Among them is an attempt to focus a train of thought around a philosophical problem, or to seek aspirational motivation. Such well-known words are often among the most looked up every year, including those that are slightly abstract, including ""love,"" he said.

The designation for ""justice"" came soon after President Trump's one-time fixer, Michael Cohen, was sentenced to three years in prison for crimes that included arranging the payment of hush money to conceal his boss' alleged sexual affairs. He told a judge he agreed time and again to cover up Trump's ""dirty deeds"" out of ""blind loyalty."""
472,brandon sun,https://www.brandonsun.com/world/breaking-news/federal-work-at-superfund-sites-suspended-during-shutdown-504238402.html,"BIRMINGHAM, Ala. - The government shutdown has suspended federal cleanups at Superfund sites around the nation and forced the cancellation of public hearings, deepening the mistrust and resentment of surrounding residents who feel people in power long ago abandoned them to live among the toxic residue of the country's factories and mines.

""We are already hurting, and it's just adding more fuel to the fire,"" says 40-year-old Keisha Brown. Her home is in a community nestled among plants that turn coal into carbon-rich fuel and other factories on Birmingham's north side.

The mostly African-American community has been forced to cope with high levels of arsenic, lead and other contaminants in the soil that the Environmental Protection Agency has been scraping up and carting away, house by house.

As President Donald Trump and Congress battle over Trump's demand for a wall on the southern U.S. border, the 3-week-old partial government shutdown has stopped federal work on Superfund sites except for cases where the administration deems ""there is an imminent threat to the safety of human life or to the protection of property.""

EPA's shutdown plans said the agency would evaluate about 800 Superfund sites to see how many could pose an immediate threat. As an example of that kind of threat, it cited an acid leak from a mine that could threaten the public water supply. That's the hazard at Northern California's Iron Mountain mine, where EPA workers help prevent an unending flow of lethally acidic runoff off the Superfund site from spilling into rivers downstream.

Practically speaking, said Bonnie Bellow, a former EPA official who worked on Superfund public outreach at the agency, the impact of the stoppage of work at sites across the nation ""wholly depends"" on the length of the shutdown.

""Unless there is immediate risk like a storm, a flood, a week or two of slowdowns is not going to very likely affect the cleanup at the site,"" Bellow said.

In north Birmingham, Brown said it's been a couple of weeks since she's spotted any EPA crews at people's houses. It was unclear if state workers or contractors were continuing work.

But long before the shutdown began, Brown harboured doubts the cleanup was working anyway.

""My main concern is the health of the people out here,"" said Brown, who has asthma. ""All of us are sick, and we've got to function on medicine every day.""

In terms of time, the federal government shutdown is a chronological blip in the long history of the site -- which includes ethics charges in a local bribery scandal to block federal cleanup efforts -- but adds to the uncertainty in an area where residents feel forgotten and betrayed.

At the EPA, the shutdown has furloughed the bulk of the agency's roughly 14,000 employees. It also means the EPA isn't getting most of the daily stream of environmental questions and tips from the public. Routine inspections aren't happening. State, local and private emails to EPA officials often get automated messages back promising a response when the shutdown ends.

In Montana, for instance, state officials this month found themselves fielding calls from a tribal member worried about drinking water with a funny look to it, said Kristi Ponozzo, public-policy director at that state's Department of Environmental Quality. The EPA normally provides tribes with technical assistance on water supplies.

With most EPA colleagues idled, Ponozzo said, her agency also had to call off an environmental review meeting for a mining project, potentially delaying the project.

But it's the agency's work at Superfund sites -- lessening the threat from old nuclear-weapons plants, chemical factories, mines and other entities -- that gets much of the attention.

Absent imminent peril, it would be up to state governments or contractors to continue any cleanup during the shutdown ""up to the point that additional EPA direction or funding is needed,"" the EPA said in a statement.

""Sites where cleanup activities have been stopped or shut down will be secured until cleanup activities are able to commence when the federal government reopens,"" the agency said.

For federal Superfund sites in Michigan, the shutdown means there are no EPA colleagues to consult, said Scott Dean, a spokesman for that state's Department of Environmental Quality.

At Michigan Superfund sites, day-to-day field operations were continuing since private contractors do most of the on-the-ground work, Dean said.

Bellow, the former EPA official, said the cancellation of hearings about Superfund sites posed immediate concerns.

In East Chicago, Indiana, for example, the EPA called off a planned public hearing set for last Wednesday to outline how the agency planned to clean up high levels of lead and arsenic in the soil.

The EPA has proposed a seven-month, $26.5 million cleanup that includes treating and removing tainted soil from the area, where a lead smelter was located.

During a public meeting Nov. 29, some residents complained that the EPA's approach would leave too much pollution in place. Others didn't get a chance to speak and were hoping to do so at the meeting this week, said Debbie Chizewer, a Northwestern University environmental attorney who represents community groups in the low-income area.

The EPA announced the cancellation in an online notice and gave no indication that it would be rescheduled.

Leaders of the East Chicago Calumet Community Advisory Group asked for a new hearing date and an extension of a Jan. 14 public comment deadline in a letter to the EPA's regional Superfund division.

Calls by The Associated Press to the agency's regional office in Chicago this week were not answered.

Local critics fear the EPA will use the delay caused by the shutdown as justification for pushing ahead with a cleanup strategy they consider flawed, Chizewer said, even though the agency has designated the affected area as an ""environmental justice community,"" a low-income community of colour that has been disproportionately harmed by pollution.

The EPA has a ""special obligation"" when dealing with such communities, Chizewer said. ""This would be an example of shutting them out for no good reason.""

In North Birmingham, former longtime neighbourhood resident Charlie Powell said most of the people living in and around the Superfund site had already ""just got tired and fed up.""

Powell left the area but started a group called PANIC, People Against Neighborhood Industrial Contamination. He said he believes money would be better spent helping residents move away from the pollution.

""Can I say hell?"" Powell said when asked what residents have been through.

473,people's pundit daily,https://www.peoplespunditdaily.com/news/politics/2019/01/07/doj-mexican-sex-trafficking-organization-smuggle-victims-southern-border/,"As the partial government shutdown over border security nears its 17th day, the Justice Department (DOJ) announced the sentences for members of a notorious Mexican sex trafficking organization that ""frequently"" relies on the U.S. southern border to smuggle their victims.

Last week -- and only two days after Democratic congressional leaders interrupted the presentation on border security in the Situation Room at the White House -- five members of a notorious Mexican sex trafficking organization were sentenced to prison terms ranging from 15 to 25 years.

The U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York and the Department of Justice's Civil Rights Division prosecuted the case, and said three more defendants are scheduled to be sentenced by District Court Judge Edward R. Korman on January 15.

""These well-deserved sentences reflect the gravity of the human trafficking crimes these defendants committed,"" said Acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker. ""The defendants operated an extensive sex trafficking enterprise that preyed on vulnerable young women and girls, deceiving them with false promises, coercing their compliance, and compelling them into submission through beatings, threats, isolation, and intimidation.""

For over a decade, the Rendon-Reyes Trafficking Organization, based in Tenancingo, Tlaxcala, Mexico, has used the insecurity and lawlessness at the southern border to smuggle young women and girls to the U.S. from Mexico and Central America.

Female victims, some as young as 14 years old, were often lured into fraudulent romantic relationships by male members falsely promising them love and marriage. In other cases, some victims were forcibly abducted and, on one such occasion, the victim's child was also taken.

Members of the Rendon-Reyes Trafficking Organization arranged for professional human smugglers known as coyotes to illegally smuggle the victims across the southern border.

Court documents show members illegally residing in the U.S. relied on various methods to force the victims comply and engage in prostitution, including severe and repeated beatings, sexual assaults, forced abortions, threats to the victims, their families and children, and psychological harm.

Victims were forced to perform as many as 45 sex acts a night without compensation. Members of the Organization took all of the criminal proceeds, and funneled that money back to Mexico.

The defendants, all of whom were illegally residing in the U.S., previously pled guilty to racketeering, sex trafficking, and other federal charges following their arrests in Mexico and the United States.

White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders announced President Donald Trump would visit the southern border on Thursday.

""President @realDonaldTrump will travel to the Southern border on Thursday to meet with those on the frontlines of the national security and humanitarian crisis,"" she tweeted. ""More details will be announced soon.""

The announcement indicates negotiations to reopen the government have been fruitless, even as the president revised his request in terms of both funding and the physical barrier, itself.

Initially, President Trump requested $5 billion to build a physical barrier made of concrete where border personnel argue it is needed on the southern border.

He privately cut the requested amount roughly in half and revised the material for the wall itself to steel.

But while Democrats contend to be in favor of border security, they have thus far refused each offer, opting instead to introduce a spending bill that is dead on arrival in the U.S. Senate.

""A wall, in my view, is an immorality. It's the least effective way to protect the border and the most costly,"" House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said in a recent interview with Elle. ""I can't think of any reason why anyone would think it's a good idea -- unless this has something to do with something else.""

Democrats have also claimed the wall would be ineffective, despite claims to the contrary from the heads of the Department of Homeland Security (DHS), Customs and Border Patrol (CBP), and the National Border Patrol Council.

""The Administration is committed to addressing the humanitarian and security crisis at our borders,"" DHS Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen recently tweeted. ""Business as usual and the status quo simply won't work in a crisis.""

The investigation of the Rendon-Reyes Trafficking Organization was led by Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) New York's Trafficking in Persons Unit, the U.S. Attorney's Office for the Eastern District of New York.

DOJ said Mexico's Procuraduría General de la República and Policía Federal ""played a prominent role"" in the investigation.

""These individuals will now face the consequences of their callous criminal actions exploiting women and girls whom they forced into sex slavery for profit. The investigation and prosecution that led to today's sentencings speak to the strong bilateral relationship between the United States and Mexico, in which both nations are committed to holding accountable those engaged in the ruthless act of human trafficking,""

The effort was coordinated through the U.S.-Mexico Bilateral Human Trafficking Enforcement Initiative, which was established in 2009 ""to more effectively dismantle human trafficking networks operating across the U.S.-Mexico border, bring human traffickers to justice, and restore the rights and dignity of human trafficking victims.""

As a result, U.S. federal prosecutors have brought cases against more than 170 defendants in New York, Georgia, Florida, and Texas.

The Eastern District of New York has to date indicted more than 80 defendants, assisted more than 150 victims, including 45 minors, reunited 19 victims' children with their mothers, and secured restitution orders of over $4 million on behalf of trafficking victims.

However, the White House maintains that prosecution is not prevention and, the success of federal prosecutors should serve as a sobering reminder of the severity of the humanitarian crisis on the U.S. southern border.

The defendants were sentenced to the following prison terms:

Severiano Martinez-Rojas was also sentenced in a related case in the Northern District of Georgia. Those proceedings were transferred to the Eastern District of New York for entry of the defendant's guilty plea last year, and the cases were consolidated for last week's sentencing.

Defendants Jose Rendon-Garcia, aka Gusano, 35, of Mexico, Guillermina Rendon-Reyes, 48, of Mexico, and Francisco Rendon-Reyes, aka Pancho, 30, of Mexico, will be sentenced on Jan. 15."
474,capitol hill blue,https://www.capitolhillblue.com/node/75965,"Their weeks-old standoff led to the partial government shutdown, now on day 24 without a clear end in sight.

Congress returns to Washington for its first full week of legislative business since control of the House reverted to Democrats, but lawmakers will be confronted with the same lingering question: When will the partial government shutdown end?

One Republican senator says he's offered President Donald Trump a possible solution, though it may just be wishful thinking.

Sen. Lindsey Graham is encouraging Trump to reopen government for several weeks to continue negotiating with Democrats over the border wall Trump wants to build on the U.S.-Mexico border. If there's no deal at the end of that time, Graham says Trump would be free to take the more dramatic step of declaring a national emergency to build it.

But the South Carolina Republican says Trump still wants a deal on funding for the wall before agreeing to reopen shuttered government departments. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat, insists Trump reopen the government first.

Their weeks-old standoff led to the partial government shutdown, now on day 24 without a clear end in sight.

Trump insisted on Twitter Monday that he wanted to deal, declaring: ""I've been waiting all weekend. Democrats must get to work now. Border must be secured!""

Targeting Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, Trump also argued that the shutdown ""has become their, and the Democrats, fault!"" Trump weeks ago asserted that he would ""own"" the shutdown and polls show that he is taking most of the blame.

Graham, who has publicly pushed Trump to use his authority to declare a national emergency to build the wall, is suggesting a short-term fix.

""Before he pulls the plug on the legislative option, and I think we're almost there, I would urge him to open up the government for a short period of time, like three weeks, before he pulls the plug, see if we can get a deal,"" Graham said. ""If we can't at the end of three weeks, all bets are off.

""See if he can do it by himself through the emergency powers. That's my recommendation,"" added Graham, who has publicly pushed Trump to use his authority to declare a national emergency to build the wall. Such a step would allow Trump to bypass Congress and tap various pots of unspent federal money, including for military construction and disaster relief as well as from assets seized by law enforcement, to pay for the wall.

Trump has kept Washington on edge over whether he would resort to such a declaration, citing what he says is a ""crisis"" of drug smuggling and the trafficking of women and children at the border. The president initially sounded as though such a move was imminent, but then pulled back. He has said several times since he first mentioned the idea in public this month that he prefers a legislative solution.

A key question is how much more time is Trump willing to give lawmakers. Graham, who spoke with Trump by telephone on Sunday morning, said the legislative path ""is just about shut off"" and blamed intransigence by Pelosi.

The speaker's office had no immediate comment.

Democrats oppose an emergency declaration but may be powerless to block it. Some Republicans are wary, too, fearing how a future Democratic president might use that authority. Such a move, should Trump ultimately go that route, would almost certainly be challenged in the courts.

Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., called Graham's idea to reopen the government a ""great place to start.""

""I do think if we reopen the government, if the president ends this shutdown crisis, we have folks who can negotiate a responsible, modern investment in technology that will actually make us safer,"" Coons said.

Trump says technology is nice, but that the border can't be secured without a wall.

The White House has been laying the groundwork for an emergency declaration, which is feared by lawmakers in both parties.

Senate Homeland Security Committee Chairman Ron Johnson, R-Wis., said he'd ""hate to see"" a declaration issued because the wall wouldn't get built, presumably because of legal challenges. Democrats voted in the past for border security and should again, he said.

""I actually want to see this wall get built,"" Johnson said. ""I want to keep pressure on Democrats to actually come to the negotiating table in good faith and fund what they have supported in the past.""

Graham favors a declaration and said the time for talk is running out.

""It's the last option, not the first option, but we're pretty close to that being the only option,"" he said.

Graham and Coons spoke on ""Fox News Sunday"" and Johnson appeared on CNN's ""State of the Union.""

Dec. 18

The New York Times on a judge's rebuke of Michael Flynn and President Donald Trump's charitable foundation:

A bit of common sense and common decency intruded on Tuesday into the crazy world of Donald Trump.

In New York, the state attorney general announced that the president had agreed that the ""charity"" he used as a piggy bank has no reason to exist.

In Washington, a federal judge let a former top presidential aide know that you can parrot political spin or you can tell the truth, but you can't do both to someone who can send you to prison.

Michael Flynn, Mr. Trump's former national security adviser, appeared before Judge Emmet Sullivan to be sentenced to what he expected would be a term of probation, after pleading guilty to lying to federal investigators about conversations with the Russian ambassador. The office of the special counsel, Robert Mueller, had earlier filed a memo that said it would be right for Mr. Flynn to avoid prison after his extensive co-operation in the investigation of Trump ties to Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential campaign and after.

Then last week, in a memo about their client's sentencing, Mr. Flynn's lawyers implied that he had been tricked into lying and that the F.B.I. acted improperly in interviewing him -- points raised by pro-Trump commentators elaborating on the president's claims of being victimized by a witch hunt.

Judge Sullivan was having none of it.

""I cannot recall an instance of a court ever accepting a guilty plea from someone who did not maintain he was guilty,"" Judge Sullivan said, ""and I do not intend to start today.""

Chastened, Mr. Flynn told the judge that nobody tricked him, that he lied and that he knew he shouldn't have.

The judge was not upset only about Mr. Flynn's sneaky prevarication. He said he felt ""disgust"" at Mr. Flynn's offences, that a retired three-star general would lie to the F.B.I. ""while on the physical premises of the White House,"" and, acting as an unregistered agent of a foreign country, Turkey, while he was an adviser to Mr. Trump (to which he admitted but was not charged). It was a bracing reminder of the brazenness of his misdeeds and of the standards the public should be able to expect of those who serve them.

Realizing that Judge Sullivan was considering a term of up to six months in prison, Mr. Flynn accepted his offer to delay the sentencing for 90 days until he has completed his co-operation with the special counsel.

""Good luck today in court to General Michael Flynn,"" Mr. Trump had tweeted first thing Tuesday morning.

""Thanks for nothing, Mr. President,"" Mr. Flynn might have thought as he left court.

Mr. Flynn should be grateful the judge offered him the chance to come clean. By contrast, the Donald J. Trump Foundation, a charity that provided no charity, quite properly received none from the New York attorney general's office.

Attorney General Barbara Underwood accused it of ""a shocking pattern of illegality"" that ""amounted to the Trump Foundation functioning as little more than a checkbook to serve Mr. Trump's business and political interests.""

Whatever money that remains will be disbursed under the supervision of Ms. Underwood's office and the judge overseeing the continuing lawsuit her office filed in June, seeking $2.8 million in restitution and a ban on Mr. Trump and his three oldest children serving on the boards of other non-profit organizations.

In a series of stories exposing the foundation's true nature, The Washington Post found that its largest donation was to fix a fountain in front of the Plaza Hotel in Manhattan, which Mr. Trump owned at the time, that its funds were used to buy a portrait of Mr. Trump, and that it illegally provided political donations and paid for personal legal settlements.

All this comes just days after prosecutors announced that they believed that Mr. Trump had conspired with the owner of The National Enquirer and his fixer Michael Cohen to violate campaign finance laws by paying hush money to two women who said they had affairs with him. It's also just been reported that prosecutors are investigating spending by the Trump inaugural committee. The president still faces lawsuits on the constitutionality of his enriching himself while in office. Meanwhile, the special counsel's inquiry may be expanding rather than winding down.

It's fitting that despite all his bluster and threats, a president who's demonstrated such contempt for the rule of law is finding it so formidable.

That this goes to the essence of American governance was best summed up by Paula Duncan, the Trump enthusiast who was among the jurors who found Mr. Trump's former campaign chief Paul Manafort guilty of fraud, even though she had hoped he wouldn't be convicted.

Explaining her decision after the verdict, she told Fox News, ""No one's above the law.""

The Wall Street Journal on a judge's ruling on the Affordable Care Act's individual mandate:

No one opposes ObamaCare more than we do, and Democrats are now confirming that it was designed as a way-station to government-run health care. But a federal judge's ruling that the law is unconstitutional is likely to be overturned on appeal and may boomerang politically on Republicans.

Judge Reed O'Connor ruled for some 20 state plaintiffs that the Affordable Care Act's individual mandate is no longer legal because Republicans repealed its financial penalty as part of the 2017 tax reform. Recall that Chief Justice John Roberts joined four Justices to say ObamaCare's mandate was illegal as a command to individuals to buy insurance under the Commerce Clause. ""The Framers gave Congress the power to regulate commerce, not to compel it,"" he wrote.

Yet the Chief famously salvaged ObamaCare by unilaterally rewriting the mandate to be a ""tax"" that was within Congress's power. Never mind that Democrats had expressly said the penalty was not a tax. Majority Leader Roberts declared it to be so.

Enter Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, who argues in Texas v. U.S. that since Congress has repealed the mandate, the tax is no longer a tax, and ObamaCare is thus illegal. Judge O'Connor agreed with that logic, and he went further in ruling that since Congress said the mandate is crucial to the structure of ObamaCare, then all of ObamaCare must fall along with the mandate.

We'll admit to a certain satisfaction in seeing the Chief Justice hoist on his own logic. But his ruling in NFIB v. Sebelius was in 2012 and there is more at issue legally now than the ""tax"" issue in that opinion. One legal complication is that Congress in 2017 repealed the financial part of the individual mandate, not the structure of the mandate itself. Republicans used budget rules to pass tax reform so they couldn't repeal the mandate's express language.

The Affordable Care Act has also been up and running since 2014, which means so-called reliance interests come into play when considering a precedent. Millions of people now rely on ObamaCare's subsidies and rules, which argues against judges repealing the law by fiat.

Judge O'Connor breezes past this like a liberal Ninth Circuit appeals judge handling a Donald Trump appeal. He's right that Democrats claimed the individual mandate was essential to the Affordable Care Act. But when Congress killed the financial penalty in 2017 it left the rest of ObamaCare intact. When judging congressional intent, a judge must account for the amending Congress as well as the original Congress.

In any case, the Supreme Court's ""severability"" doctrine calls for restraint in declaring an entire law illegal merely because one part of it is. Our guess is that even the right-leaning Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals judges will overturn Judge O'Connor on this point.

As for the politics, Democrats claim to be alarmed by the ruling but the truth is they're elated. They want to use it to further pound Republicans for denying health insurance for pre-existing conditions if the law is overturned. Democrats campaigned across the country against Mr. Paxton's lawsuit to gain House and Senate seats in November, and they will now press votes in Congress so they can compound the gains in 2020.

President Trump hailed the ruling in a tweet, but he has never understood the Affordable Care Act. His Administration has done good work revising regulations to reduce health-care costs and increase access, but the risk is that the lawsuit will cause Republicans in Congress to panic politically and strike a deal with Democrats that reinforces ObamaCare. This is what happens when conservatives fall into the liberal trap of thinking they can use the courts to achieve policy goals that need to be won in Congress.

The Washington Post on withdrawing all 2,000 U.S. troops out of Syria:

PRESIDENT TRUMP'S sudden move to yank U.S. troops out of Syria undermined at a stroke several foreign policy goals he has championed. The president promised to finish the job of destroying the Islamic State, but the withdrawal will leave thousands of its fighters still in place. He vowed to roll back Iran's aggression across the Middle East, but his decision will allow its forces to entrench in the country that is the keystone of Tehran's ambitions. He promised to protect Israel, but that nation will now be left to face alone the buildup by Iran and its proxies along its northern border.

The president's top national security advisers had carefully developed and articulated a strategy of maintaining a U.S. presence in Syria until the Islamic State was beyond revival and Iran withdrew its forces -- a plan they were defending up until this week. Mr. Trump has again demonstrated, to them and to the world, that no U.S. policy or foreign commitment is immune from his whims.

Mr. Trump claimed the Islamic State had been defeated, but that is not the view of the Defence and State Departments. Thousands of jihadist fighters are still in Syria and control splotches of territory in the Euphrates Valley. A U.S. withdrawal will give the extremists an opportunity to reconstitute, as they did in Iraq following the premature U.S. withdrawal ordered by President Barack Obama.

Until Wednesday, a prime talking point of senior national security officials was that, ""if we've learned one thing over the years, (the) enduring defeat of a group like this means you can't just defeat their physical space and then leave,"" as the State Department's special envoy for the global campaign against the Islamic State, Brett McGurk, put it last week. Defence Secretary Jim Mattis said it another way in September: ""Getting rid of the caliphate doesn't mean you then blindly say, 'Okay, we got rid of it,' march out, and then wonder why the caliphate comes back.""

Mr. Trump has justified some of his most controversial decisions, including his continued support for Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, as needed to contain Iran's threat to the United States and its allies. But the Syrian withdrawal hands Tehran and its ally Russia a windfall. Iran has deployed thousands of fighters and allied militiamen to Syria and aspires to create a corridor to Lebanon and the Mediterranean, as well as a new front against Israel along the Golan Heights. In reaction to that threat, Mr. Trump's national security adviser, John Bolton, announced Sept. 24 that ""We're not going to leave (Syria) as long as Iranian troops are outside Iranian borders, and that includes Iranian proxies and militias.""

U.S. ambitions in Syria have never been backed by adequate resources, and a case could be made that neither Congress nor the American public were prepared to support the mission suggested by Mr. Bolton. But Mr. Trump's decision appears to have been precipitated by the bellicose rhetoric of Turkey's Recep Tayyip Erdogan, who last week threatened -- not for the first time -- a military operation against Syrian Kurds, even though U.S. troops are positioned around them. The autocratic Turkish ruler appears to have extracted multiple favours from Mr. Trump in recent days, including the sale of U.S. Patriot missiles and a promise to reexamine the possible extradition of his rival, Fethullah Gulen, from Pennsylvania. If Mr. Trump received anything in return, he hasn't disclosed it.

The Syrian Kurdish forces, which have fought alongside the United States and played a crucial role in liberating most of eastern Syria from the jihadists, will be perhaps the foremost victims of Mr. Trump's decision. Betrayed by Washington, they will now be subject to a military offensive by Turkey. The stab in the back will send an unforgettable message to all who are asked to co-operate with the United States in the fight against terrorism: Washington is an unreliable and dangerous partner.

The Orange County (California) Register on Mick Mulvaney as Trump's choice for chief of staff:

President Trump has found a new chief of staff, albeit an interim one, in his director of the Office of Management and Budget, Mick Mulvaney.

That of chief is a terribly important post, perhaps government's most consequential aside from that of his boss. In theory, at least, the chief of staff is the gatekeeper for everything the president does, everyone he sees, everyone he talks to on the phone.

Perhaps, though few would expect this to be the case, the arbiter of every time he sends out a tweet, and of what it should say.

A Washington insider, a former congressman, Mulvaney is in many ways ideal for the job. He wants it, badly, whereas others with similarly impressive resumes touted for the job have indicated a strong desire to spend more time with their families, from Vice-President Pence's staff chief Nick Ayers of Georgia to former New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie.

Mulvaney shares the conservative values currently espoused by the president and was a founder of the House Freedom Caucus in 2013, the group that always taunted the Republican leadership, opposing much government funding, including debt limit increases and budget agreements made with the Democrats.

But he also, after Trump secured the Republican nomination in 2016, called the candidate ""a terrible human being"" who he only was voting for out of an even greater dislike of Hillary Clinton.

It's not as if other presidential allies of today haven't said bad things about him in the past. On the campaign trail, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz called his rival ""a narcissist at a level I don't think this country's ever seen,"" for instance.

But if you were the nation's chief executive -- or the CEO of a much smaller entity, for that matter -- could you hire as your top aide and work with a person who had once dubbed you ""terrible""?

Or does this kind of talk come with the territory in politics, where many strange bedfellows are made because of having to run in elections against once and perhaps future allies? Should Trump indeed elevate this practical choice for staff chief to permanent status immediately?

Los Angeles Times on banning bump stocks, which allow semi-automatic weapons to fire like machine-guns:

The Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives said Tuesday that it had finalized a rule reclassifying so-called bump stocks -- the devices that can make a semiautomatic rifle fire nearly as quickly a fully automatic weapon -- as machine-guns, which makes it illegal to manufacture, sell or possess them. The agency said a year ago it had the authority to reclassify the devices, and President Trump -- in the wake of the Parkland, Fla., school shooting -- directed the ATF to speed up the process. Tuesday's announcement -- a rare bit of welcome news from the Trump administration -- makes it official; White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters that owners of the conversion devices will have until March 21 to destroy them or turn them in to the ATF.

This is a good step. Unfortunately, it's all but certain to be challenged in the courts, and it's on shaky legal ground because of the way the new rule evolved. The Obama administration determined that because bump stocks have ""no automatically functioning mechanical parts and (perform) no automated mechanical functions when installed,"" they did not fit the definition of a machine-gun in federal law, which meant the ATF lacked the authority to regulate them. Tuesday's announcement, by contrast, hinges not on the technical specifications, but on the functionality. In essence, if it fires like a machine-gun, it's a machine-gun. Cue the lawyers.

We hope the administration prevails in whatever challenges emerge, but the sure-fire way to resolve this would be for Congress to legislate bump stocks and related gadgets out of existence. Such devices serve no function other than to evade the strict congressional limit on machine-guns by, as the ATF said, harnessing ""the recoil energy of the semiautomatic firearm in a manner that allows the trigger to reset and continue firing"" without the shooter having to pull the trigger for each shot.

A mass shooter in Las Vegas used bump stocks affixed to semiautomatic rifles to fire more than 1,000 rounds in a matter of minutes from a 32nd-floor suite of the Mandalay Bay Hotel into a crowd of some 20,000 people, killing 58 concertgoers and injuring hundreds of others. It was the largest single mass shooting in the modern era, drawing attention to bump stocks and sparking outraged demands by many -- the Los Angeles Times included -- that the devices be banned.

As welcome as this new rule is, it will do little to corral our national problem with gun violence. The vast majority of gun deaths come in ones and twos, led by suicides. ...

But it is progress. And the president deserves credit for sticking with his promise to find a way to ban bump stocks. ...

China Daily says telecommunications giant Huawei is a victim of U.S. panic attacks:

This year has not been an annus mirabilis for China's Huawei Technologies Ltd, the world's largest supplier of telecommunications network equipment and second-biggest maker of smartphones.

Although it has been constantly in the news and it is said there is no such thing as bad publicity, it has been making headlines because of the spurious claims it somehow poses a threat to the West, even world peace. It has never been explained exactly how.

In fact it is not because of anything it has done, but because its success has brought it into the crosshairs of the United States' anxiety attacks against China.

Huawei is at the forefront of 5G technology. This latest generation mobile network technology promises to bring the much anticipated and heralded internet of things to life and the US is determined to be the 5G leader.

Not only because whichever country develops the technology that is adopted as standard will have a huge commercial advantage. But also because by setting the standard it will have a knowledge advantage.

As a result, first the US and then one after another its most obedient allies have blocked Huawei from entering their 5G markets on security grounds.

None of them have offered any specific justification for blocking Huawei. They just repeat their claim that the company poses a security risk. That is why objective observers have concluded that those countries are politicizing a commercial issue.

It sets a harmful precedent. What if other countries used the same excuse to block US companies (not confined to the telecom sector)? The US companies are very competitive in many fields, including those that could pose huge security risks, such as finance.

While Huawei will not go unscathed from being prevented from entering key markets, as a competitive player, it still has a vast market to access in other parts of the world. It has signed contracts to supply 5G equipment to 25 telecom carriers, and more than 10,000 5G base stations have been shipped.

In stark contrast to the US and its allies, India for instance, has invited Huawei to conduct 5G trials in the country and complimented it on the role it has played in helping to develop its telecom industry.

The efforts of the US and its allies to try to shield their companies against a Chinese competitor are politically motivated, not the result of a fact-based or transparent decision-making process. And they are counterproductive to the concerted efforts that are needed to ensure the security of 5G networks."

But that may be wishful thinking, given that Sen. Lindsey Graham also says Trump still wants to reach a deal for the wall before agreeing to reopen shuttered government departments. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a leading Democratic negotiator, insists that Trump reopen the government first.

The weeks-old standoff over funding led to the partial government shutdown that hit day 23 on Sunday without an end in sight.

""Before he pulls the plug on the legislative option, and I think we're almost there, I would urge him to open up the government for a short period of time, like three weeks, before he pulls the plug, see if we can get a deal,"" said Graham, a South Carolina Republican. ""If we can't at the end of three weeks, all bets are off.""

""See if he can do it by himself through the emergency powers. That's my recommendation,"" added Graham, who has publicly pushed Trump to use his authority to declare a national emergency to build the wall. Such a step would allow Trump to bypass Congress and tap various pots of unspent federal money, including for military construction and disaster relief and from asset seized by law enforcement, to pay for the wall.

Trump has kept Washington on edge over whether he would resort to such a declaration, citing what he says is a ""crisis"" of drug smuggling and the trafficking of women and children at the border. The president initially sounded as though such a move was imminent, but then pulled back. He has said several times since he first mentioned the idea in public earlier this month that he prefers to try to reach a deal with Congress.

A key question is how much more time is Trump willing to give lawmakers. Graham, who said he and Trump talked by telephone on Sunday morning, said the legislative path ""is just about shut off"" and blamed Pelosi.

The speaker's office had no immediate comment.

Democrats oppose an emergency declaration but may be powerless to block it. Some Republicans are wary, too, fearing how a future Democratic president might use that authority. Such a move, should Trump ultimately go that route, would almost certainly be challenged in the courts.

Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., called Graham's idea to reopen the government a ""great place to start.""

""I do think if we reopen the government, if the president ends this shutdown crisis, we have folks who can negotiate a responsible, modern investment in technology that will actually make us safer,"" Coons said.

Trump has maintained that the border cannot be secured without a wall.

Graham said he thinks Trump is willing to accept the $5.7 billion he has insisted on for the wall, along with some immigration measures Democrats might find acceptable, such as helping immigrants who were illegally brought to the U.S. as children.

Trump has expressed interest in a broader immigration overhaul, but says he first wants the Supreme Court to address the class of immigrants known as ""Dreamers."" Pelosi also has shown no interest in accepting a wall -- she has called it an ""immorality"" -- in exchange for immigration fixes.

And, Trump, who was holed up in the White House as snow blanketed Washington on Sunday, appeared to shoot down Graham's suggestion of a ""wall plus"" deal, saying on Twitter that even Democrats don't want to make ""Dreamers"" part of the negotiations.

""The damage done to our Country from a badly broken Border - Drugs, Crime and so much that is bad - is far greater than a Shutdown, which the Dems can easily fix as soon as they come back to Washington!"" Trump said in a separate tweet.

The White House has been laying the groundwork for an emergency declaration, feared by members of both parties.

Senate Homeland Security Committee Chairman Ron Johnson, R-Wis., said he would ""hate to see"" a declaration because then the wall wouldn't get built, presumably because of legal challenges. Democrats voted in the past for border security and should again, he said.

""I actually want to see this wall get built,"" Johnson said. ""I want to keep pressure on Democrats to actually come to the negotiating table in good faith and fund what they have supported in the past.""

But Graham, who favors a presidential declaration, said the time for talk is running out.

""It's the last option, not the first option, but we're pretty close to that being the only option,"" he said.

Graham and Coons spoke on ""Fox News Sunday."" Johnson appeared on CNN's ""State of the Union.""

One Republican senator says he's offered President Donald Trump a possible solution, though it may just be wishful thinking.

Sen. Lindsey Graham is encouraging Trump to reopen government for several weeks to continue negotiating with Democrats over the border wall Trump wants to build on the U.S.-Mexico border.

478,fitsnews.com,https://www.fitsnews.com/2018/12/21/donald-trump-re-reverses-position-on-border-security/,"After appearing to cave (again) to liberal Democrats and vacillating Republicans earlier this week, U.S. president Donald Trump reverted back to his prior position on border security Thursday afternoon - setting the stage for a potential partial shutdown of the federal government at the stroke of midnight tonight (Friday).

Facing withering criticism from his conservative base, Trump informed outgoing U.S. speaker of the House Paul Ryan on Thursday that he would not sign the latest stopgap spending resolution in Washington, D.C. unless it contained $5 billion in funding for ""comprehensive border security"" measures - including sections of his long-promised wall on the border between the United States and Mexico.

That amount equates to roughly one-fifth of the estimated $25 billion necessary to build the border wall, which was the centerpiece of Trump's insurgent 2016 GOP primary campaign.

Since taking office last January, though, Trump has bailed twice on securing federal funding for his wall - and conservatives made it clear that folding again on the issue would cost him dearly. Ann Coulter - a longtime Trump apologist - told The Daily Caller that if Trump caved (again) on wall funding that he ""will just have been a joke presidency who scammed the American people.""

She later referred to the president as ""gutless"" for his ongoing willingness to surrender to Democrats.

House Republicans - who are two weeks away from ceding power to Democrats - approved the appropriation, but Trump appears to be well short of the sixty votes he needs in the U.S. Senate (which approved $1 billion for border security - but no wall - in its version of the stopgap spending plan).

As recently as this summer, Trump was still insisting that Mexico would pay for the wall.

""The wall will be paid for very easily, by Mexico,"" Trump said after concluding a new North American trade deal. ""It will ultimately be paid for by Mexico.""

This news outlet endorsed Trump (twice) during the 2016 election, in part because of his commitment to ending America's economically disastrous and unsustainable open borders policy. While he has done little of late to earn our continued support, we do believe the construction of a border wall - combined with a ramp-up of personnel and technology along the U.S.-Mexican-border - is a core (and critical) function of government.

Unlike many ""conservatives"" (whatever that means anymore), this news outlet has never breathed fire on the issue of immigration - we simply want our nation's borders to be secured and for pathways to ""status"" (not citizenship) for illegal aliens to be rigorously enforced.

Why? Because like it or not, the American lifeboat is full.

Anyway, stay tuned ... we will keep an eye on the clock as the countdown to a partial shutdown is now very much underway."
479,winston-salem journal,https://www.journalnow.com/news/nation_world_ap/shutdown-suspends-federal-cleanups-at-us-superfund-sites/article_927f3226-a6cc-58f8-8cc3-f3a9321e2d41.html,"BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) -- The government shutdown has suspended federal cleanups at Superfund sites around the nation and forced the cancellation of public hearings, deepening the mistrust and resentment of surrounding residents who feel people in power long ago abandoned them to live among the toxic residue of the country's factories and mines.

""We are already hurting, and it's just adding more fuel to the fire,"" says 40-year-old Keisha Brown, whose wood-frame home is in a community nestled among coking plants and other factories on Birmingham's north side.

The mostly African-American community has been forced to cope with high levels of arsenic, lead and other contaminants in the soil that the Environmental Protection Agency has been scraping up and carting away, house by house.

As President Donald Trump and Congress battle over Trump's demand for a wall on the southern U.S. border, the nearly 3-week-old partial government shutdown has stopped federal work on Superfund sites except for cases where the administration deems ""there is an imminent threat to the safety of human life or to the protection of property.""

EPA's shutdown plans said the agency would evaluate about 800 Superfund sites to see how many could pose an immediate threat. As an example of that kind of threat, it cited an acid leak from a mine that could threaten the public water supply. That's the hazard at Northern California's Iron Mountain mine, where EPA workers help prevent an unending flow of lethally acidic runoff off the Superfund site from spilling into rivers downstream.

Practically speaking, said Bonnie Bellow, a former EPA official who worked on Superfund public outreach at the agency, the impact of the stoppage of work at sites across the nation ""wholly depends"" on the length of the shutdown.

""Unless there is immediate risk like a storm, a flood, a week or two of slowdowns is not going to very likely affect the cleanup at the site,"" Bellow said.

In north Birmingham, Brown said it's been a couple of weeks since she's spotted any EPA crews at people's houses. It wasn't clear if state workers or contractors were continuing work.

But long before the shutdown began, Brown harbored doubts the cleanup was working anyway. ""My main concern is the health of the people out here,"" said Brown, who has asthma. ""All of us are sick, and we've got to function on medicine every day.""

In terms of time, the federal government shutdown is a chronological blip in the long history of the site -- which includes ethics charges in a local bribery scandal to block federal cleanup efforts -- but adds to the uncertainty in an area where residents feel forgotten and betrayed.

At the EPA, the shutdown has furloughed the bulk of the agency's roughly 14,000 employees. It also means the EPA isn't getting most of the daily stream of environmental questions and tips from the public. Routine inspections aren't happening. State, local and private emails to EPA officials often get automated messages back promising a response when the shutdown ends.

In Montana, for instance, state officials this month found themselves fielding calls from a tribal member worried about drinking water with a funny look to it, said Kristi Ponozzo, public-policy director at that state's Department of Environmental Quality. The EPA normally provides tribes with technical assistance on water supplies.

With most EPA colleagues idled, Ponozzo said, her agency also had to call off an environmental review meeting for a mining project, potentially delaying the project.

But it's the agency's work at Superfund sites -- lessening the threat from old nuclear-weapons plants, chemical factories, mines and other entities -- that gets much of the attention.

Absent imminent peril, it would be up to state governments or contractors to continue any cleanup during the shutdown ""up to the point that additional EPA direction or funding is needed,"" the EPA said in a statement.

""Sites where cleanup activities have been stopped or shut down will be secured until cleanup activities are able to commence when the federal government reopens,"" the agency said.

For federal Superfund sites in Michigan, the shutdown means there are no EPA colleagues to consult, said Scott Dean, a spokesman for that state's Department of Environmental Quality.

At Michigan Superfund sites, day-to-day field operations were continuing since private contractors do most of the on-the-ground work, Dean said.

Bellow, the former EPA official, said the cancellation of hearings about Superfund sites posed immediate concerns.

In East Chicago, Indiana, for example, the EPA called off a planned public hearing set for last Wednesday to outline how the agency planned to clean up high levels of lead and arsenic in the soil.

The EPA has proposed a seven-month, $26.5 million cleanup that includes treating and removing tainted soil from the area, where a lead smelter previously was located.

During a public meeting Nov. 29, some residents complained that the EPA's approach would leave too much pollution in place. But others didn't get a chance to speak and were hoping to do so at the meeting this week, said Debbie Chizewer, a Northwestern University environmental attorney who represents community groups in the low-income area.

The EPA announced the cancellation in an online notice and gave no indication that it would be rescheduled.

Leaders of the East Chicago Calumet Community Advisory Group asked for a new hearing date and an extension of a Jan. 14 public comment deadline in a letter to the EPA's regional Superfund division.

Calls by The Associated Press to the agency's regional office in Chicago this week were not answered.

Local critics fear the EPA will use the delay caused by the shutdown as justification for pushing ahead with a cleanup strategy they consider flawed, Chizewer said, even though the agency has designated the affected area as an ""environmental justice community"" -- a low-income community of color that has been disproportionately harmed by pollution.

The EPA has a ""special obligation"" when dealing with such communities, Chizewer said. ""This would be an example of shutting them out for no good reason.""

In North Birmingham, former longtime neighborhood resident Charlie Powell said most of the people living in and around the Superfund site had already ""just got tired and fed up.""

Powell left the area but started a group called PANIC, People Against Neighborhood Industrial Contamination. He believes money would be better spent helping residents move away from the pollution.

""Can I say hell?"" Powell said when asked what residents have been through.

4 p.m.

Vice President Mike Pence says Democrats were ""unwilling to even negotiate"" an end to the partial government shutdown and the standoff over President Donald Trump's desire for a border barrier.

Pence spoke outside the West Wing after a contentious meeting Wednesday between Trump and congressional leaders.

Pence says, ""I think the president made his position very clear today that there will be no deal without a wall.""

Pence says Trump asked House Speaker Nancy Pelosi whether she would be willing to agree to funding for a wall or a barrier on the southern border if he re-opened the government quickly.

Pence says, ""When she said 'No,' the president said 'Goodbye.""

Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said Trump had a ""temper tantrum."" Pence says of the president, ""I don't recall him ever raising his voice.""

-- --

3:45 p.m.

Top Democrats say President Donald Trump walked out of a meeting with congressional leaders as talks to end the partial government shutdown remain at an impasse.

Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said Trump asked House Speaker Nancy Pelosi at Wednesday's White House meeting whether she would agree to fund his wall.

When she said ""no,"" Schumer says, Trump got up and said, ""Then we have nothing to discuss."" Schumer says, ""And he just walked out.""

Schumer is calling Trump's actions ""really, really unfortunate.""

Trump is also weighing in on the meeting by tweet, calling it ""a total waste of time.""

He tweets that once Pelosi rejected his long-stalled border wall, he ""said bye-bye, nothing else works!""

3:15 p.m.

Congressional leaders from both parties have returned to the White House for another round of negotiations with President Donald Trump on the ongoing partial government shutdown.

The two sides have made no apparent progress in the past week, with Trump sticking to his demand of $5.7 billion for a border barrier and Democrats insisting they won't give him the money.

Trump has been making a public case that there is a ""crisis"" at the southern border. And he's still threatening to declare a national emergency to circumvent Congress if he can't get the wall money from them.

He told reporters during a visit to the Capitol earlier Wednesday that he may turn to a declaration ""at some point"" if top Democrats Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi ""don't agree"" with his assessment about the problems at the border.

-- --

3 p.m.

President Donald Trump says Republicans are ""totally unified"" in the shutdown standoff over his long-promised southern border wall, though some GOP lawmakers have been expressing concern about the 19-day partial government closure.

Trump traveled to Capitol Hill on Wednesday to meet with Senate Republicans. He says there was ""no discussion about anything other than solidarity.""

Trump has been considering a national emergency declaration to bypass Congress to build the wall. He says he ""may do that at some point"" if he can't get a deal with Democrats.

Trump also plans to meet with top congressional Democrats and Republicans at the White House on Wednesday.

1:20 p.m.

President Donald Trump arrived on Capitol Hill claiming he has ""tremendous"" support as he headed into a meeting with Republican senators uneasy with the government shutdown over his border wall.

Asked how long the shutdown would last, Trump told reporters Wednesday ""whatever it takes.""

The partial shutdown is now in its 19th day, the second longest ever.

Trump and Vice President Mike Pence arrived for the private lunch meeting with the Senate GOP caucus to shore up support.

Several Republican senators have said the government should be re-opened while talks continue over border security and Trump's demand for money to build the wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.

12:40 p.m.

President Donald Trump says he thinks he and the Democrats are ""getting closer"" to a deal to end the budget stalemate that has partially shut down the government despite no evidence that any progress has been made.

And he's suggesting the partial government shutdown could be ""a blessing in disguise"" because, he suggests, it could lead to a broader immigration deal.

Trump spoke Wednesday during an Oval Office bill signing on anti-human trafficking legislation. It's a day after he delivered a prime-time address trying to make the case for his long-stalled U.S.-Mexico border wall.

Trump says that he would like to see ""real immigration reform in this country because we need it."" He says, ""Everybody wants to see immigration reform,"" adding that perhaps the stalemate ""will turn out to be a blessing in disguise.""

Democrats have blamed Trump for the shutdown.

12:35 p.m.

Gone are the days when the U.S. and Mexican governments regularly exchanged statements over President Donald Trump's insistence on a border wall.

Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said Wednesday he won't be drawn into what he calls a U.S. internal dispute, an apparent reference to the 19-day-old partial U.S. government shutdown over a border barrier.

Lopez Obrador says, ""We are not going to respond to situations arising from internal affairs in the United States.""

Unlike his predecessor, the Mexican leader didn't have to respond to any specific aspersion about Mexico, because Trump didn't make any in his Tuesday night address to the American public. Relations between the two leaders have been surprisingly cordial, given their ideological differences.

Lopez Obrador said, ""Of course, there are those ... who want us to get into a confrontation. We always want a friendly relationship with the United States, a cooperative relationship.""

As a presidential candidate Trump promised Mexico would pay for a border wall, but Mexico refused.

12:25 p.m.

President Donald Trump is using a bill signing focused on curbing human trafficking to push his case for a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border.

Trump says a southern border that is not secured exacerbates the incidents of human trafficking. He says, ""As long as we have a border that is not secure, we're going to suffer the consequences of that.""

Wednesday's bill signing came a day after Trump's prime-time speech designed to persuade Americans that illegal immigration and trafficking at the border are a crisis.

Democrats have called Trump's promised wall costly, ineffective and ""immoral"" and say he's ""manufacturing a crisis.""

The bill Trump signed is designed to enhance an annual State Department report that measures global efforts to eliminate human trafficking.

The White House says it's the fourth bipartisan bill the Republican president has signed in the last few weeks to prevent human trafficking.

11:30 a.m.

Congressional Democrats say they'll head to the White House with the plan to reopen the government -- the same one they've been presenting. They're asking President Donald Trump to accept a bipartisan bill to fund border security without the wall.

Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Wednesday the president ""could end the Trump shutdown and re-open the government today, and he should.""

Pelosi and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer spoke at an event where they were flanked by federal workers going without pay during the shutdown, now in its 19th day.

Schumer called workers the ""collateral damage"" of Trump's ""temper tantrum."" He said the president failed to ""persuade a soul"" during his ""divisive"" prime-time address Tuesday night to the nation.

Trump meets with congressional leaders at the White House Wednesday afternoon. He rejected the Senate's bipartisan funding bill in December, sparking the shutdown.

10 a.m.

The White House is trying to keep jittery congressional Republicans from defecting over the toll the partial government shutdown is taking in their states.

President Donald Trump and Democrats have been at an impasse over funding for his proposed border wall, which has led to a partial government shutdown, now in its 19th day.

Trump meets with Senate Republicans Wednesday on Capitol Hill just hours after he argued on national television that a border wall was needed to resolve a security and humanitarian ""crisis.""

Senators say the shutdown has led to disruptions in agricultural payments for farmers, as well as for home buyers trying to secure government-backed home loans. Lawmakers also are worried about missed paychecks for government workers Friday.

As many as half a dozen GOP senators have said the government should reopen while border security negotiations with Democrats continue.

1:25 a.m.

President Donald Trump again linked illegal immigration along the southern border with drugs and violent crime as he urged Democratic lawmakers to fund his proposed border wall.

In his first national address from the Oval Office, the president gave no indication he was softening his stance that the partial government shutdown would continue without money for the wall.

Trump argued Tuesday night that the wall was needed to resolve what he called a security and humanitarian ""crisis.""

3:16 p.m.

Congressional leaders from both parties have returned to the White House for another round of negotiations with President Donald Trump on the ongoing partial government shutdown.

The two sides have made no apparent progress in the past week, with Trump sticking to his demand of $5.7 billion for a border barrier and Democrats insisting they won't give him the money.

Trump has been making a public case that there is a ""crisis"" at the southern border. And he's still threatening to declare a national emergency to circumvent Congress if he can't get the wall money from them.

He told reporters during a visit to the Capitol earlier Wednesday that he may turn to a declaration ""at some point"" if top Democrats Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi ""don't agree"" with his assessment about the problems at the border.

3 p.m.

President Donald Trump says Republicans are ""totally unified"" in the shutdown standoff over his long-promised southern border wall, though some GOP lawmakers have been expressing concern about the 19-day partial government closure.

Trump traveled to Capitol Hill on Wednesday to meet with Senate Republicans. He says there was ""no discussion about anything other than solidarity.""

Trump has been considering a national emergency declaration to bypass Congress to build the wall. He says he ""may do that at some point"" if he can't get a deal with Democrats.

Trump also plans to meet with top congressional Democrats and Republicans at the White House on Wednesday.

1:20 p.m.

President Donald Trump arrived on Capitol Hill claiming he has ""tremendous"" support as he headed into a meeting with Republican senators uneasy with the government shutdown over his border wall.

Asked how long the shutdown would last, Trump told reporters Wednesday ""whatever it takes.""

The partial shutdown is now in its 19th day, the second longest ever.

Trump and Vice President Mike Pence arrived for the private lunch meeting with the Senate GOP caucus to shore up support.

Several Republican senators have said the government should be re-opened while talks continue over border security and Trump's demand for money to build the wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.

12:40 p.m.

President Donald Trump says he thinks he and the Democrats are ""getting closer"" to a deal to end the budget stalemate that has partially shut down the government despite no evidence that any progress has been made.

And he's suggesting the partial government shutdown could be ""a blessing in disguise"" because, he suggests, it could lead to a broader immigration deal.

Trump spoke Wednesday during an Oval Office bill signing on anti-human trafficking legislation. It's a day after he delivered a prime-time address trying to make the case for his long-stalled U.S.-Mexico border wall.

Trump says that he would like to see ""real immigration reform in this country because we need it."" He says, ""Everybody wants to see immigration reform,"" adding that perhaps the stalemate ""will turn out to be a blessing in disguise.""

Democrats have blamed Trump for the shutdown.

12:35 p.m.

Gone are the days when the U.S. and Mexican governments regularly exchanged statements over President Donald Trump's insistence on a border wall.

Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador said Wednesday he won't be drawn into what he calls a U.S. internal dispute, an apparent reference to the 19-day-old partial U.S. government shutdown over a border barrier.

Lopez Obrador says, ""We are not going to respond to situations arising from internal affairs in the United States.""

Unlike his predecessor, the Mexican leader didn't have to respond to any specific aspersion about Mexico, because Trump didn't make any in his Tuesday night address to the American public. Relations between the two leaders have been surprisingly cordial, given their ideological differences.

Lopez Obrador said, ""Of course, there are those ... who want us to get into a confrontation. We always want a friendly relationship with the United States, a cooperative relationship.""

As a presidential candidate Trump promised Mexico would pay for a border wall, but Mexico refused.

12:25 p.m.

President Donald Trump is using a bill signing focused on curbing human trafficking to push his case for a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border.

Trump says a southern border that is not secured exacerbates the incidents of human trafficking. He says, ""As long as we have a border that is not secure, we're going to suffer the consequences of that.""

Wednesday's bill signing came a day after Trump's prime-time speech designed to persuade Americans that illegal immigration and trafficking at the border are a crisis.

Democrats have called Trump's promised wall costly, ineffective and ""immoral"" and say he's ""manufacturing a crisis.""

The bill Trump signed is designed to enhance an annual State Department report that measures global efforts to eliminate human trafficking.

The White House says it's the fourth bipartisan bill the Republican president has signed in the last few weeks to prevent human trafficking.

11:30 a.m.

Congressional Democrats say they'll head to the White House with the plan to reopen the government -- the same one they've been presenting. They're asking President Donald Trump to accept a bipartisan bill to fund border security without the wall.

Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Wednesday the president ""could end the Trump shutdown and re-open the government today, and he should.""

Pelosi and Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer spoke at an event where they were flanked by federal workers going without pay during the shutdown, now in its 19th day.

Schumer called workers the ""collateral damage"" of Trump's ""temper tantrum."" He said the president failed to ""persuade a soul"" during his ""divisive"" prime-time address Tuesday night to the nation.

Trump meets with congressional leaders at the White House Wednesday afternoon. He rejected the Senate's bipartisan funding bill in December, sparking the shutdown.

10 a.m.

The White House is trying to keep jittery congressional Republicans from defecting over the toll the partial government shutdown is taking in their states.

President Donald Trump and Democrats have been at an impasse over funding for his proposed border wall, which has led to a partial government shutdown, now in its 19th day.

Trump meets with Senate Republicans Wednesday on Capitol Hill just hours after he argued on national television that a border wall was needed to resolve a security and humanitarian ""crisis.""

Senators say the shutdown has led to disruptions in agricultural payments for farmers, as well as for home buyers trying to secure government-backed home loans. Lawmakers also are worried about missed paychecks for government workers Friday.

As many as half a dozen GOP senators have said the government should reopen while border security negotiations with Democrats continue.

1:25 a.m.

President Donald Trump again linked illegal immigration along the southern border with drugs and violent crime as he urged Democratic lawmakers to fund his proposed border wall.

In his first national address from the Oval Office, the president gave no indication he was softening his stance that the partial government shutdown would continue without money for the wall.

483,the herald-news,https://www.theherald-news.com/2019/01/14/graham-urging-trump-to-reopen-government-for-a-few-weeks/ax2vxt9/,"WASHINGTON - A Republican lawmaker advising President Donald Trump said he is encouraging the president to reopen the government for several weeks to continue negotiating with Democrats over funding for a U.S.-Mexico border wall before the president takes the more drastic step of declaring a national emergency.

But that may be wishful thinking, given that Sen. Lindsey Graham also says Trump still wants to reach a deal for the wall before agreeing to reopen shuttered government departments. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a leading Democratic negotiator, insists that Trump reopen the government first.

The weeks-old standoff over funding led to the partial government shutdown that hit day 23 on Sunday without an end in sight.

""Before he pulls the plug on the legislative option, and I think we're almost there, I would urge him to open up the government for a short period of time, like three weeks, before he pulls the plug, see if we can get a deal,"" said Graham, a South Carolina Republican. ""If we can't at the end of three weeks, all bets are off.""

""See if he can do it by himself through the emergency powers. That's my recommendation,"" added Graham, who has publicly pushed Trump to use his authority to declare a national emergency to build the wall. Such a step would allow Trump to bypass Congress and tap various pots of unspent federal money, including for military construction and disaster relief and from asset seized by law enforcement, to pay for the wall.

Trump has kept Washington on edge over whether he would resort to such a declaration, citing what he says is a ""crisis"" of drug smuggling and the trafficking of women and children at the border. The president initially sounded as though such a move was imminent, but then pulled back. He has said several times since he first mentioned the idea in public earlier this month that he prefers to try to reach a deal with Congress.

A key question is how much more time is Trump willing to give lawmakers. Graham, who said he and Trump talked by telephone on Sunday morning, said the legislative path ""is just about shut off"" and blamed Pelosi.

The speaker's office had no immediate comment.

Democrats oppose an emergency declaration but may be powerless to block it. Some Republicans are wary, too, fearing how a future Democratic president might use that authority. Such a move, should Trump ultimately go that route, would almost certainly be challenged in the courts.

Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., called Graham's idea to reopen the government a ""great place to start.""

""I do think if we reopen the government, if the president ends this shutdown crisis, we have folks who can negotiate a responsible, modern investment in technology that will actually make us safer,"" Coons said.

Trump has maintained that the border cannot be secured without a wall.

Graham said he thinks Trump is willing to accept the $5.7 billion he has insisted on for the wall, along with some immigration measures Democrats might find acceptable, such as helping immigrants who were illegally brought to the U.S. as children.

Trump has expressed interest in a broader immigration overhaul, but says he first wants the Supreme Court to address the class of immigrants known as ""Dreamers."" Pelosi also has shown no interest in accepting a wall - she has called it an ""immorality"" - in exchange for immigration fixes.

And, Trump, who was holed up in the White House as snow blanketed Washington on Sunday, appeared to shoot down Graham's suggestion of a ""wall plus"" deal, saying on Twitter that even Democrats don't want to make ""Dreamers"" part of the negotiations.

""The damage done to our Country from a badly broken Border - Drugs, Crime and so much that is bad - is far greater than a Shutdown, which the Dems can easily fix as soon as they come back to Washington!"" Trump said in a separate tweet.

The White House has been laying the groundwork for an emergency declaration, feared by members of both parties.

Senate Homeland Security Committee Chairman Ron Johnson, R-Wis., said he would ""hate to see"" a declaration because then the wall wouldn't get built, presumably because of legal challenges. Democrats voted in the past for border security and should again, he said.

""I actually want to see this wall get built,"" Johnson said. ""I want to keep pressure on Democrats to actually come to the negotiating table in good faith and fund what they have supported in the past.""

But Graham, who favors a presidential declaration, said the time for talk is running out.

""It's the last option, not the first option, but we're pretty close to that being the only option,"" he said.

Graham and Coons spoke on ""Fox News Sunday."" Johnson appeared on CNN's ""State of the Union."""
484,the daily reporter - wi construction news & bids,https://dailyreporter.com/2019/01/11/federal-work-at-superfund-sites-suspended-during-shutdown/,"By ELLEN KNICKMEYER and KIM CHANDLER, Associated Press

BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) -- The government shutdown has suspended federal cleanups at Superfund sites around the country and forced the cancellation of public hearings, deepening mistrust and resentment among those who feel people in power long ago abandoned them to living among the toxic residue of the country's factories and mines.

""We are already hurting, and it's just adding more fuel to the fire,"" said the 40-year-old Keisha Brown. Her home lies among plants that turn coal into carbon-rich fuel on Birmingham's north side.

Residents there, most of whom are black, have had to cope with high levels of arsenic, lead and other contaminants in soil that the Environmental Protection Agency has been scraping up and carting away, house by house.

As President Donald Trump and Congress battle over Trump's demand for a wall on the southern U.S. border, the 3-week-old partial government shutdown has stopped federal work on many Superfund sites. The only exception is for sites where the administration has found there is ""an imminent threat to the safety of human life or to the protection of property.""

During the shutdown, the EPA plans to evaluate about 800 Superfund sites to see how many of them could pose an immediate threat. The agency said such a threat could come, for instance, from a mine that's leaking acid into a local water supply. Just such a hazard exists at Northern California's Iron Mountain mine, where EPA workers have helped prevent an unending flow of lethally acidic runoff coming from a Superfund site from spilling into rivers downstream.

Practically speaking, said Bonnie Bellow, a former EPA official who had worked on Superfund public outreach at the agency, the effect of stopping work at sites throughout the country ""wholly depends"" on the length of the shutdown.

""Unless there is immediate risk like a storm, a flood, a week or two of slowdowns is not going to very likely affect the cleanup at the site,"" Bellow said.

In north Birmingham, Brown said it's been a couple of weeks since she has spotted any EPA crews at people's houses. It was unclear if state workers or contractors were continuing to work.

But long before the shutdown began, Brown harbored doubts the cleanup was succeeding.

""My main concern is the health of the people out here,"" said Brown, who has asthma. ""All of us are sick, and we've got to function on medicine every day.""

At the EPA, the shutdown has put the bulk of the roughly 14,000 employees there on furlough. It also means the EPA isn't getting many environmental questions and tips from the public. Routine inspections aren't happening. State, local and private emails to EPA officials are often being responded to with automated messages promising an answer when the shutdown ends.

In Montana, for instance, state officials this month found themselves fielding calls from a tribal member worried about drinking water, said Kristi Ponozzo, public-policy director at that state's Department of Environmental Quality. The EPA normally provides tribes with technical assistance on water supplies.

With most EPA employees idled, Ponozzo said her agency also had to call off an environmental-review meeting for a mining project, possibly delaying the work.

But it's the agency's work at Superfund sites -- lessening the threat from old nuclear-weapons plants, chemical factories, mines and other entities -- that gets much of the attention.

Absent any imminent peril, state governments or contractors will have to decide whether they want to continue any cleanup work during the shutdown ""up to the point that additional EPA direction or funding is needed,"" the EPA said in a statement.

""Sites where cleanup activities have been stopped or shut down will be secured until cleanup activities are able to commence when the federal government reopens,"" the agency said.

For federal Superfund sites in Michigan, the shutdown means there are no EPA colleagues to consult, said Scott Dean, a spokesman for that state's Department of Environmental Quality.

At Michigan Superfund sites, day-to-day field operations were continuing since private contractors do most of the on-the-ground work, Dean said.

Bellow, the former EPA official, said the cancellation of hearings about Superfund sites was posing immediate concerns.

In East Chicago, Indiana, for example, the EPA called off a public hearing that was originally scheduled for last Wednesday. The goal of the meeting was to outline how the agency planned to clean up high levels of lead and arsenic in the soil.

The EPA has proposed a seven-month, $26.5 million cleanup project calling for the treatment and removal of tainted soil from the area, where a lead smelter had once operated.

Local critics fear the EPA will use the delay caused by the shutdown as justification for pushing ahead with a cleanup plan they consider flawed, Chizewer said."
485,warwick daily news,https://www.warwickdailynews.com.au/news/tv-host-katy-tur-unleashes-on-donald-trump-over-mi/3611272/,"Donald Trump has been skewered on TV after he was caught telling a humiliating ""lie"" to American soldiers.

The controversy began during Donald and Melania Trump's surprise Christmastime visit to Al Asad Air Base in Iraq this week.

The President received a warm welcome from the US forces stationed there. But his speech to the troops was criticised for being too political - and one line in particular stood out.

Mr Trump told the servicemen and women he had secured a 10 per cent pay rise on their behalf - and claimed it was their first raise in more than a decade.

""You protect us. We are always going to protect you. And you just saw that, 'cause you just got one of the biggest pay raises you've ever received,"" Mr Trump said.

""You haven't gotten one in more than 10 years. More than 10 years. And we got you a big one. I got you a big one. I got you a big one.

""They had plenty of people that came up, they said, 'You know, we could make it smaller. We could make it 3 per cent, we could make it 2 per cent, we could make it 4 per cent.

""I said, 'No. Make it 10 per cent. Make it more than 10 per cent.' Cause it's been a long time, it's been more than 10 years. Been more than 10 years, that's a long time.""

There was only one problem - it was all false.

American military personnel have received a pay rise every year since 1983.

The increase was 2.4 per cent this year - less than a quarter of the '10 percent' Mr Trump claimed to have secured - and will be 2.6 per cent in 2019.

The whopping fib didn't go unnoticed.

It caught the attention of TV reporter Katy Tur, who unleashed on Mr Trump while guest hosting MSNBC's MTP: Daily program.

The 35-year-old anchor, who penned the book Unbelievable: My Front-Row Seat to the Craziest Campaign in American History about her time reporting on Mr Trump's presidential campaign, accused the leader of deliberately spreading misinformation.

""God, he's just full of it,"" Ms Tur said after watching a clip of the president sharing the incorrect news.

""None of that is true.

""Charitably speaking, could the President have just gotten his numbers confused? Is he just that bad at numbers? Or is he deliberately lying?""

She didn't stop there, repeatedly returning to the President's claim even after her show's guests went off on tangents.

""If you told me I'm getting a 10 per cent raise, and I'm only getting a 2.6 per cent raise, I'd be pretty pissed off. Especially if I was in war zone risking my life every day,"" she said.

""To hear that I'm getting a 10 per cent raise from the commander-in-chief? The top of my echelon? I would be kinda bummed, a little angrier if I found out that's not the case.""

The Trumps' Iraq visit was their first to a war zone during Mr Trump's presidency, and surprised critics who were in the process of roasting him for failing to visit US forces over Christmas.

The President used his visit to defend his decision to withdraw US forces from Syria, which was slammed by members of his own party and led Defence Secretary James Mattis to resign in protest.

""We're no longer the suckers, folks,"" he told the troops, having been greeted by chants of ""USA! USA!"".

""The reason I'm here today is to personally thank you and every service member throughout this region for the near-elimination of the ISIS territorial caliphate in Iraq and Syria.

""Two years ago, when I became President, they were a very dominant group. They were very dominant. Today they're not so dominant anymore.

""Great job. I looked at a map and two years ago it was a lot of red all over, and now you have a couple of little spots, and that's happening very quickly.""

The troops cheered in response, and many later posed for smiling photographs with the President.

In a particularly touching moment, one of them told Mr Trump he had inspired him to return to the military.

""And I am here because of you,"" Mr Trump replied.

This all comes amid a partial government shutdown in the United States, sparked by a stoush over funding for Mr Trump's border wall with Mexico.

The stalemate is continuing with no resolution in sight, and today Mr Trump further inflamed the situation by threatening to close the entire border between the two countries in a trademark tweet.

""We will be forced to close the Southern Border entirely if the Obstructionist Democrats do not give us the money to finish the Wall & also change the ridiculous immigration laws that our Country is saddled with,"" he posted."
486,chinadaily.com.cn,http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/201812/31/WS5c2956d6a310d91214051cfd.html,"WASHINGTON, Dec 30 -- US Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Richard Shelby said Sunday that the White House and congressional lawmakers are still ""at a standoff"" as the partial government shutdown entered the second week, urging both sides to find a way out.

""Our negotiations are at an impasse at the moment,"" Shelby said, according to a report by Politico. ""I wish it were not so, but we've got to move away from the blame game - blaming the president, blaming the Democrats, (Nancy) Pelosi and (Chuck) Schumer and others - and get back to doing what we're sent there to do: to fund the government.""

The shutdown began at midnight on Dec. 22 when the Congress failed to agree to a funding bill to keep a portion of federal agencies operational, with the sticking point being whether to include in the budget package 5 billion US dollars for constructing a wall on the US-Mexico Border. President Donald Trump has promised the wall and requested for the money.

""Right now, we're at a standoff, and I think that's not good for the Senate, the House, or America,"" Shelby said. ""Nobody wins in a shutdown. We all lose and we kind of look silly.""

Shelby said he tried to broker a compromise deal in which 2.5 billion dollars of border security funding is secured for the current fiscal year and the other 2.5 billion dollars will be appropriated next year. This proposal, however, ""didn't work out.""

Trump showed little sign of backing off, as White House Counselor Kellyanne Conway said Sunday that the president may veto the funding bill depending on ""what's in it.""

""It depends on what's in it. What is it going to say? They (the Democrats) are not even discussing it over the Christmas and New Year's break what could possibly be in that package,"" Conway said on CNN's ""State of the Union."""
487,politico,https://www.politico.eu/article/trump-shutdown-is-democrats-attempt-to-take-the-presidency/,"'The Shutdown is only because of the 2020 Presidential Election,' said Trump

President Donald Trump again sought to wash his hands of responsibility for the partial government shutdown on Thursday, dismissing it as a ploy by Democrats to take the presidency in 2020.

""The Shutdown is only because of the 2020 Presidential Election. The Democrats know they can't win based on all of the achievements of 'Trump,' so they are going all out on the desperately needed Wall and Border Security -- and Presidential Harassment. For them, strictly politics!"" Trump wrote on Twitter.

Trump's references to the approaching presidential election reflect the growing Democratic field to vie for the presidency in 2020. Trump launched his reelection campaign in January 2017 -- extraordinarily early for an incumbent president -- and broke convention by fundraising for himself during the 2018 midterms. Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) was the first major Democratic to announce the early stages of a presidential campaign, launching an exploratory committee on New Year's Eve.

Other Democrats who have announced campaigns or exploratory committees include Rep. John Delaney (D-Md.), former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development Julián Castro and West Virginia state Sen. Richard Ojeda. The list of potential Democratic challengers runs the gamut from established party figured like former Secretary of State John Kerry and former Vice President Joe Biden, to progressives and fresh faces, including Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) and outgoing Rep. Beto O'Rourke (D-Texas).

Large portions of the government have been shut down for nearly two weeks after Trump and lawmakers on Capitol Hill failed to compromise over spending on a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. Trump said he would shutter the government if he didn't get $5 billion in funding specifically for a southern border wall -- his longstanding and largely unfulfilled campaign promise.

During a meeting with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi on December 11, Trump asserted his desire for a wall above all else, declaring that ""I am proud to shut down the government for border security."" Schumer could be seen suppressing a smile as the president promised responsibility for any closure of the government.

But shortly after, Trump threw blame back across the aisle.

""The Democrats now own the shutdown!"" Trump wrote on Twitter just a few days before Christmas.

Though several portions of the government had secured funding before the shutdown was announced, government functions continue to deteriorate under skeletal funding and oversight. Thousands of federal workers continue to work without pay while others have been furloughed.

Pelosi is expected to introduce measures to reopen the government when the House comes back in session on Thursday with a Democratic majority."

Good New Year's Eve morning. This is Charlie Cooper, POLITICO's Brexit correspondent. Jack Blanchard is taking a break.

SAJ'S BACK IN TOWN: Home Secretary Sajid Javid will this morning chair a meeting of the U.K. Border Force, National Crime Agency and senior Whitehall officials in what you can expect to be a very public demonstration that he's getting to grips with the growing numbers of migrant and refugee boats crossing the Channel from France.

'No easy answers:' Javid, fresh (or not-so-fresh) from a curtailed safari holiday in South Africa, has written a piece in today's Daily Telegraph arguing the reasons for the spike in arrivals are ""complicated, and in many cases - outside of our control"" and there are ""no easy answers."" Unfortunately for him, this is 2018, and nuance will not do. The piece will do little to raise his stock among some vocal Tory MPs calling for more tangible action. Dover MP Charlie Elphicke tells the paper Javid's response ""falls short"" while home affairs committee member Tim Loughton blasts the home secretary for lacking ""urgency.""

What are the options? MPs want two of the Border Force's boats brought back from the Mediterranean to patrol the Channel, while Defense Secretary Gavin Williamson has said the Navy is prepared to help. But there's no mention of either plan in Javid's article.

What the papers say: In its editorial, the Times agrees that sending in the Navy will do nothing, but calls for the Home Office to ""send the right message"" to anyone contemplating the crossing by quickly sending back any arrivals found not to have legitimate asylum claims. The Sun calls on Javid to ""stem the tide"" to avoid a tragedy in the Channel.

Now read this: Ian Birrell doesn't pull punches in his i newspaper column on the Channel boats saga. ""The numbers are minuscule compared with, say, the 3.6 million Syrians in Turkey or more than 1 million refugees in struggling Uganda. But it is much easier to blame 'ruthless' smugglers rather than face up to complex problems in a globalized world, one in which Britons believe it is their birthright to live, travel and work anywhere while denying such freedoms to people from poorer places.""

Why it's happening: The BBC has a good explainer, written last month before the spike in numbers, on why so many of those attempting the crossing are Iranians.

Stay classy: A story about desperate people in a dire situation is, of course, merely fodder for some MPs to play out their weird Westminster power struggles. One ""ally"" of a Tory leadership rival summed up the smug mood among Javid's enemies to the Mail on Sunday: ""Poor old Safari Sajid is not very lucky with his holiday timings is he?"" In the Telegraph today, Javid's own ""allies"" claim the home secretary has been the victim of a No. 10 ""stitch up"" and that someone in Downing Street leaked details of his holiday for maximum embarrassment.

Honestly ... do these people not have anything better to do between Christmas and New Year?

PLANS TONIGHT? The prime minister will be spending New Year's Eve at Chequers, while Jeremy Corbyn will, as he told the Independent, enjoy a quiet New Year with his family. Maybe with ""a particularly good apple juice."" Vince Cable will be celebrating with wife Rachel and son Hugo and his wife Laura, who have flown in from California. The Lib Dem leader tells Playbook he intends to toast the New Year with ""a customary rum and coke.""

NEW YEAR MESSAGES: We're expecting Theresa May's New Year's message tomorrow evening. This time last year she said Britons would feel ""confidence and pride"" in 2018. Which worked out well.

Jeremy Corbyn: The Labour leader's message was released overnight. It begins cheerily with a good old moan about how the Tories have ""plunged the country into crisis over the complete mess they've made of Brexit,"" goes on to channel 2010 election-era David Cameron by observing ""we cannot go on like this,"" and concludes with a promise to create a society where ""the talent of everyone is unleashed.""

What a difference a year makes: In his New Year's message a year ago, Corbyn didn't mention Brexit once.

Nicola Sturgeon: The first minister is a little cheerier, hailing Scotland's warm welcome for all at Hogmanay. Her message directly addresses the country's EU citizens in light of Brexit -- ""I know that this is a deeply uncertain time for you. But I also want you to know that your contribution to our national life ... is hugely valued"" -- and optimistically predicts that ""2019 will not simply be about Brexit."" Let's face it, it probably will.

Vince Cable: The Lib Dem leader bills the start of 2019 as ""90 days to change the course of this country,"" warning that the ""history books"" will regard the next three months as ""critical."" He takes credit on behalf of his party for starting the campaign for a second referendum. Which, it must be said, looks like a much more realistic possibility now than it did the last time Cable delivered one of these messages.

ABOUT THOSE FERRIES: Great BBC scoop last night, revealing that one of the firms handed a £14-million contract to deliver emergency freight ferry services in the event of a no-deal Brexit has never run a ferry service and won't say what ships it actually owns.

Come again? Seaborne Freight was one of three firms to win a no-deal contract, according to papers slipped out by Chris Grayling's transport department on Christmas Eve (for maximum transparency, of course). The details of the story are pretty astonishing. Kent Council Tory Paul Messenger described Seaborne as a ""shell company."" Tory MPs Heidi Allen and Anna Soubry have already criticized the decision to hand over millions in taxpayers' money. Expect questions in parliament next week.

Responses: Seaborne Chief Executive Ben Sharp told the BBC it would be commercially sensitive to name the ships the company intends to use, and insisted it would be ready to deliver a Ramsgate-to-Ostend service to take pressure off Dover in the event of no deal. The government has said it signed the contract with Seaborne (which according to the BBC will be able to keep some of the cash even if its services are not needed) ""in the full knowledge that Seaborne is a new shipping provider."" Which is reassuring.

CIVIL UNREST WARNING: Communities Secretary James Brokenshire has warned Chancellor Philip Hammond that councils need more funding to cope with a no-deal Brexit, warning of ""disruption"" and noting that one thing so-called local resilience forums might need to deal with in the event of no deal is ""civil unrest."" The Telegraph's Steven Swinford has the scoop.

Pity the poor bankers: Meanwhile, in the City of London, four major U.S. firms are warning their staff that commuting from London to other European financial centers will not be a long-term option if jobs are moved out of the U.K. after Brexit.

Tiny violins at the ready: According to the FT (in a story that will be catnip to Remoaner-bashing Brexiteers), many executives ""daunted by the prospect of quitting London's cultural and shopping attractions ... had hoped they could keep their families in the U.K. capital and commute weekly to wherever their job was moved."" But while it's easy (and somewhat enjoyable) to scoff at the troubles of the 1 percent, an exodus of executives could mean a lot of money and taxes that will no longer be pumped into the U.K.

BENEFIT OF HINDSIGHT: A year ago while covering for Jack, your Playbook author asked 11 politicos for their Brexit predictions for 2018. Now the year is ending, how have they held up? Well, former Vote Leave chief Matthew Elliott was right that there would be an ""11th hour"" deal with Brussels, but so was former Downing Street aide Matthew O'Toole when he warned, a year ago, that ""the implications of the government's pledges on the Irish border are not yet fully understood among Brexiteers"" and that this was the issue that would blow up.

Win some lose some: Lib Dem Leader Vince Cable was right that the movement for a second referendum would grow in strength, and Tory MP Bernard Jenkin will feel vindicated in his prediction that ""most of those who are campaigning for 'a meaningful vote' on the final deal"" actually wanted to stop Brexit altogether. Fellow Tory Peter Bone will, however, wonder whether he was a touch optimistic with his prediction that ""by the end of the year [Theresa May] will be on the way to being a national hero!""

Paddy's prediction: Someone who is sadly no longer with us as we gaze into the mists of the new year, former Lib Dem leader Paddy Ashdown predicted that in 2018 ""Brexit will not lose its ability to break hearts and blow up careers."" He wasn't wrong. Although even he probably couldn't have predicted that we'd see *two* Brexit secretaries resign.

PARLIAMENT: In recess until Monday, January 7.

LOBBY: Westminster journalists will get a lobby briefing from Downing Street at 11 a.m. Expect lines on the situation in the Channel, no-deal ferries and much else.

Gove's new food czar: An eye-catching appointment at the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs. Environment Secretary Michael Gove has hired Ben Elliot, the Eton-educated founder of a ""luxury concierge service"" catering to the whims of the super-rich, to spearhead government efforts to, er, cut down on food waste. Elliot is a nephew of Camilla Parker Bowles and co-founder of Quintessentially, which offers members bespoke luxury services, including in one instance, arranging a £31-million marriage proposal. Elliot becomes the government's food surplus and waste champion, an unpaid role.

Credentials: Elliot also runs the firm's charitable wing, which has worked with the Felix Project, a charity that collects surplus food and redistributes it to those who need it. So he isn't completely new to the territory. In a statement issued by Defra, Elliot said he was determined to combat ""morally deplorable and largely avoidable"" food waste.

BEIS OF THE MACHINES: Meanwhile Greg Clark's Department for Business Innovation and Industrial Strategy (BEIS) has announced a £27-million investment for researchers to build 1-centimeter-long robots that could one day be used to patrol the water network, fixing cracked pipes and avoiding the need for digging up roads. Frankly it sounds brilliant, but don't get too excited -- the team behind it is called Twenty65 because the timeframe they're working within is up to, you guessed it, 2065. The technology itself could be up and running sooner than that though, in around five years, according to the Telegraph.

489,warwick daily news,https://www.warwickdailynews.com.au/news/donald-trumps-defence-secretary-james-mattis-quits/3607106/,"Another senior member of Donald Trump's administration is quitting.

Defence Secretary James Mattis, widely seen as a stabilising influence on Mr Trump, has announced he will resign on February 28, giving the President time to find and nominate a successor.

In his resignation letter, General Mattis told Mr Trump he had ""the right to have a Secretary of Defence whose views are better aligned with yours"".

He cited disagreements with Mr Trump on the treatment of America's allies - and its adversaries.

""While the US remains the indispensable nation in the free world, we cannot protect our interests or serve that role effectively without maintaining strong alliances and showing respect to those allies,"" Gen Mattis said.

He pointedly mentioned the 74-nation coalition against Islamic State as an example of that principle at work.

Yesterday Mr Trump announced his decision to withdraw US forces from Syria and declared Islamic State had been defeated.

He was subsequently slammed by members of his own party, who called the decision a ""betrayal"" of America's allies in the region, the Kurds.

Gen Mattis also implied Mr Trump had been too soft on Russia, whose influence in the Middle East will grow as a result of the withdrawal.

""I believe we must be resolute and unambiguous in our approach to those countries whose strategic interests are increasingly in tension with ours,"" he said.

""It is clear that China and Russia, for example, want to shape a world consistent with their authoritarian model.

""That is why we must use all the tools of American power to provide for the common defence.

""My views on treating allies with respect and also being clear-eyed about both malign actors and strategic competitors are strongly held and informed by over four decades of immersion in these issues.""

Mr Trump has frequently been accused of being too friendly towards Russian President Vladimir Putin, particularly in response to Russia's meddling in the 2016 presidential election.

His critics have also taken issue with his praise for North Korean dictator Kim Jong-un in the wake of their summit in Singapore.

Overnight North Korea said it would not denuclearise until the US eliminated its own ""nuclear threat"", undermining Mr Trump's claims he had secured a denuclearisation deal at the summit.

Gen Mattis' letter did not contain a single word of praise for Mr Trump.

CNN reports he ""vehemently opposed"" to the withdrawal from Syria, and was ""livid"" today after reading a report that the Turkish Minister of Defence threatened to kill the Kurds and dump them ""in ditches"" after America leaves.

Gen Mattis then visited the White House and tried to change the President's mind, and quit when Mr Trump refused to budge.

He is merely the latest in a long line of top officials who have departed the administration.

Last month Attorney General Jeff Sessions was forced out by Mr Trump, who resented his decision to recuse himself from overseeing Robert Mueller's Russia investigation.

The President had repeatedly unleashed humiliating criticism of Mr Sessions in public.

Mr Trump is about to move on to his third White House chief of staff following the resignation of Reince Priebus in 2017 and the recent news that John Kelly will leave by the end of this year.

He has been through multiple press secretaries, including Sean Spicer and Anthony Scaramucci, who famously lasted only 11 days in the job.

Chief Economic Adviser Gary Cohn quit after clashing with Mr Trump on trade policy.

Communications Director Hope Hicks, one of the President's most trusted staffers, resigned in February. She was the fourth person to hold that role.

Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price was forced out after his costly use of private charter planes for government business blew up into a public scandal.

Mr Trump's chief political strategist Steve Bannon was fired in August of last year.

National Security Adviser H.R. McMaster left in March, having succeeded Michael Flynn, who was fired just weeks after Mr Trump took office for lying about his contacts with the Russian ambassador.

General McMaster's deputy K.T. McFarland lasted a matter of months before quitting.

Deputy Chief of Staff Katie Walsh's tenure was even shorter. She was gone after 70 days.

That's a lot of people. But Gen Mattis' resignation could be one of the most critical.

""There are no more grown-ups in the room. You know? There is H.R. McMaster too. McMaster's gone. And Kelly's gone. And now Mattis is gone. And we'll see who is in charge now,"" CNN analyst Jeffrey Toobin said.

Former diplomat Nicholas Burns said Gen Mattis' exit would weaken the administration's credibility with its allies and foes, and his ""restraining influence on an unpredictable"" President would be a huge loss.

It has been a dramatic week for Mr Trump, with a government shutdown looming amid his struggle to secure funding for a wall on the Mexican border, and the stock market plunging.

But his decision to withdraw from Syria is the biggest controversy.

""That is something that Mattis opposed. It is something that all of the top leaders here in the Pentagon, as well as US Central Command generals, opposed,"" Fox News reporter Jennifer Griffin said.

""I was told by a very well placed source here in the Pentagon that morale has never been lower at meetings of the top brass in the last few days to discuss the pullout of troops.""

Republicans who usually defend the President have publicly blasted the withdrawal.

Senator Lindsey Graham said he was ""blindsided"" by Mr Trump's decision and called it a ""huge Obama-like mistake"".

""With all due respect, ISIS is not defeated in Syria, Iraq, and after just returning from visiting there, certainly not Afghanistan,"" Mr Graham said.

""An American withdrawal will put the Kurds and all those who came to America's aid in destroying ISIS at tremendous risk. It will make it more difficult to recruit future partners willing to confront radical Islam.

""If Obama had done this, all of us would be furious. If Obama had done this, we'd be going nuts right now.""

Congressman Adam Kinzinger said he was ""blown away"" by the withdrawal and it would be a ""devastating blow"" in the war against Islamic State.

""I want to support President Trump in every way I can. But on something like this, you have to look at this and go, 'This is going to be devastating for foreign policy.' And I don't even think we begin to know the ramifications,"" he said.

""They're celebrating in Moscow and Tehran right now. They're trembling in Tel Aviv. And in Washington we're confused, because nobody saw this coming.""

Another critic was Senator Marco Rubio, who renewed his argument in the wake of Gen Mattis's resignation.

Meanwhile, CNN and the Wall Street Journal both report administration officials are bracing for Mr Trump to announce a similar withdrawal from Afghanistan, where 14,000 troops are currently stationed."
490,jamestown sun,https://www.jamestownsun.com/news/government-and-politics/4546960-partial-government-shutdown-assured-after-lawmakers-leave,"WASHINGTON - Large parts of the federal government are shutting down overnight after President Donald Trump torpedoed a bipartisan spending deal because it lacked the money he demanded for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.

Funding for numerous agencies, including those that operate parks, homeland security, law enforcement, tax collection and transportation, was set to expire at midnight. Close to 400,000 federal workers are expected to be sent home without pay until a deal is reached, and numerous services will be halted in that time, with the impacts broadening the longer the funding lapse lasts.

The shutdown intensifies a standoff between Trump, who is demanding $5.7 billion for a border wall, and congressional Democrats, who have vowed to block any wall funding and have the votes to do so. It marks a deflating final chapter for Republicans as they complete two years of unified GOP control in Washington - as well as an acrimonious prelude to the upcoming era of divided government, after Democrats take the House in January.

Trump saw the final days of this year as his last chance to try to extract funding for the wall, while Democrats, united against the wall and buttressed by big wins in the midterm elections, showed no signs of buckling to his demands amid a flurry of attacks this week.

The White House and congressional leaders continued negotiations late Friday, but by 8:30 p.m., the House and the Senate had adjourned for the night. That made it impossible to vote on any spending agreement until Saturday, and it remained unclear whether any deal would materialize by then.

It is unclear how long a shutdown might last. Trump predicted earlier Friday that it could drag on for a ""very long time.""

The Senate on Friday considered legislation that would fund the government agencies through Feb. 8 and appropriate $5.7 billion for the erection of 215 miles of wall structures along the Mexico border.

The House passed that legislation Thursday evening, but Senate Democrats successfully unified on Friday and refused to back that measure.

Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said Friday that Democrats were open to discussions with the White House and Republicans but would not agree to any measure that funded the construction of a new border wall.

Schumer said Friday that the Senate had unanimously agreed to a spending bill earlier in the week and accused Trump of having a ""temper tantrum"" because he wasn't getting money for the wall.

""President Trump, you will not get your wall,"" Schumer said. ""You're not getting your wall today, next week or on Jan. 3 when Democrats take control of the House.""

Democrats tried to make clear to the White House for weeks that they had the votes to block any measure that contained money for the wall.

As their power became clear to White House officials, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders signaled Tuesday that Trump was planning to withdraw his request for the funds in an effort to keep the government open.

But he received a torrent of criticism from conservative lawmakers and commentators following this decision, and he reversed course on Thursday, scuttling a temporary, bipartisan spending bill that would have extended funding through Feb. 8 but did not contain wall money.

Trump on Friday urged Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., to change long-standing Senate rules to pass the House's measure providing $5.7 billion for the wall.

McConnell refused, making it impossible for Senate Republicans to marshal the measure through because Democrats control 49 seats in the 100-member chamber.

""We're going to be working very hard to get something passed in the Senate,"" Trump said earlier Friday in the Oval Office. ""Now it's up to the Democrats as to whether or not we have a shutdown tonight. I hope we don't, but we're very much prepared for a long shutdown.""

Republicans were frustrated by the reversal, and Democrats warned Friday that the president's erratic and unvetted decisions in recent days were unsettling financial markets, foreign allies and even members of his Cabinet.

""This is tyranny of talk radio hosts, right? And so, how do you deal with that?"" said Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn. ""You have two talk radio hosts who completely flipped the president. And so, do we succumb to tyranny of talk radio hosts?""

Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis announced his resignation Thursday. The Dow Jones industrial average had one of its worst weeks in recent decades and has fallen almost 4,400 points, or 16 percent, since October.

Multiple federal parks and monuments are slated to close, some as soon as Saturday morning. The Securities and Exchange Commission posted a list of the services it will soon suspend, including the processing of certain business records. The Justice Department, Commerce Department and Internal Revenue Service are preparing to send thousands of workers home without pay.

And Trump's prediction that a shutdown would last ""for a very long time"" meant that hundreds of thousands of federal employees risk missing at least one paycheck. Even the Border Patrol agents and Transportation Security Administration officials who are directed to continue working during the shutdown will not be paid until Congress funds their agencies.

About 400,000 federal workers would be furloughed, according to a Washington Post projection. But a number of federal agencies, including the Pentagon, will not be directly affected, because Congress already passed multiple other spending bills this year that secured funding through September.

As the funding lapse lengthens, the negotiations will prove to be a major test for Trump, Schumer, McConnell and House conservatives as they jostle for footing in Washington's new power structure.

Friday afternoon saw a flurry of discussions begin in the afternoon when McConnell, Democrats and Vice President Mike Pence began huddling separately in the Capitol.

Pence separately joined Trump adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner and White House budget director Mick Mulvaney for a meeting with House conservatives. But the talks yielded no clear evidence of progress, and eventually, Pence and his entourage left the Capitol.

""We don't have a deal,"" Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Richard Shelby, R-Ala., told reporters after emerging from a late meeting with the vice president. ""There are a lot of moving parts, and we're trying to get them moving together.""

The construction of a wall along the border with Mexico was one of Trump's top campaign promises in 2016, and he had promised that Mexico would finance the entire project. But since taking office, he has demanded the money from Congress.

Senate Democrats have blocked every attempt so far. Trump has also threatened to shut the government down numerous times if he doesn't receive money for the border wall, but before Friday night, he had backed down every time.

In recent days, Trump has tried a number of different tactics to try to secure the money. He called on Cabinet secretaries to search their budgets for extra funds, and on Wednesday, he said the entire project would be built by the military. But by Thursday he was back to demanding that Congress provide the funding, leaving many GOP lawmakers scrambling to accede to his demands.

The shutdown followed a day of posturing and unsuccessful negotiations in the Senate on Friday.

After meeting with Trump at the White House, McConnell called a vote aimed at advancing the bill with $5.7 billion for the border wall, saying the legislation would not be considered controversial in more normal times.

""I'm proud to vote for it,"" McConnell said.

But after hours of maneuvering, it became clear that the legislation would not command the support needed to pass, although the Senate advanced it on a procedural vote - with Pence breaking a tie - to keep a legislative vehicle alive in case a deal does emerge.

Trump, meanwhile, ratcheted up public pressure on Democrats to cave on the wall.

In a spate of morning Twitter posts, Trump sought to pin blame on Democrats for a potential shutdown, even though he said last week that he would accept responsibility for a shutdown.

But Democrats showed no signs of relenting, and on Friday night, they continued to blame Trump and the Republicans for the partial shutdown.

""I think we ought to make it clear that it's the president's abrupt change in position and refusal to accept the deal he's already told his leadership he'd accept,"" said Sen. Christopher Coons, D-Del.

""Look, this is the last week we have a Republican-controlled Senate and House and White House - they've got to work this out."""
491,jamestown sun,https://www.jamestownsun.com/news/government-and-politics/4549208-trump-threatens-shut-down-border-government-funding-stalemate,"WASHINGTON - With the partial government shutdown headed toward its second week and no resolution in sight, President Donald Trump on Friday issued a string of tweets in which he once again vowed to close the entire U.S. border with Mexico and halt aid to several Latin American countries unless Democrats agree to his demand for billions of dollars in wall funding.

Trump is also canceling plans to visit his Florida resort, Mar-a-Lago, and will remain in Washington over the New Year holiday, Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney said.

About 25 percent of the federal government has been shut down since Saturday, with roughly 800,000 workers affected, including an estimated 350,000 who are on furlough at home.

""We will be forced to close the Southern Border entirely if the Obstructionist Democrats do not give us the money to finish the Wall & also change the ridiculous immigration laws that our Country is saddled with,"" Trump said in a morning tweet.

In a reprise of his threat before the midterm elections to cut off aid to Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador as a caravan of migrants was making its way toward the United States, Trump said that those three countries ""are doing nothing for the United States but taking our money.""

""Word is that a new Caravan is forming in Honduras and they are doing nothing about it,"" he said, without providing further details. ""We will be cutting off all aid to these 3 countries - taking advantage of U.S. for years!""

Despite Trump's threat, the United States this month announced a new collaboration with Mexico on a program to curb migration from Central American countries, with much of the $10.6 billion U.S. contribution to be drawn from existing aid programs.

Trump's tweets come as Congress has effectively given up on breaking the impasse over the president's demands for border-wall funding, all but ensuring that the partial government shutdown will stretch into at least the start of the new year.

The House and the Senate convened for just minutes on Thursday before gaveling closed until next week. During the brief session in the House, Republicans shot down a Democratic attempt to vote on legislation to reopen the government.

As he did Thursday, Trump remained out of public view on Friday. In an appearance on Fox News, Mulvaney said that the president had ""canceled his plans for Christmas, and now he's canceled his plan for New Year's.""

""He's staying in Washington, D.C., over New Year's,"" said Mulvaney, who is set to become Trump's acting chief of staff next month.

Even though Trump will be in town and Republicans control both chambers of Congress, Mulvaney acknowledged that little progress on a deal is expected until the start of the new Congress on Jan. 3, when Democrats will retake the House. Contending that Democrats ""have simply shut down the discussions,"" he sought to place the blame on House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., who is expected to be elected speaker in the new Congress.

""Nancy Pelosi, in fairness, does not have the votes for the speakership yet,"" Mulvaney said. ""She cannot be seen by her party as being weak on negotiating with Donald Trump. So we fully expect that until she is elected speaker and has locked that vote up, we don't expect to hear from the Democrats again.""

According to a Washington Post tally, Pelosi, who won the Democratic caucus's nomination for the speakership in late November, appears to have secured enough support to be elected speaker in January.

Pelosi's spokesman, Drew Hammill, said in a statement Friday that Democrats ""are united against the President's immoral, ineffective and expensive wall - the wall that he specifically promised that Mexico would pay for.""

Democrats will not consider any offers that have not been publicly endorsed by Trump himself, he said.

""While we await the president's public proposal, Democrats have made it clear that, under a House Democratic majority, we will vote swiftly to reopen government on Day One,"" Hammill said.

At the heart of the stalemate is Trump's demand for $5 billion in funding for his proposed wall at the U.S.-Mexico border. Congressional Democrats have rejected that figure and in recent weeks have refused to publicly endorse a figure above $1.3 billion, which continues existing funding levels and includes money for new border fencing and levee walls, but not the concrete wall Trump once demanded before he started more recently talking about ""steel slats.""

Mulvaney said Friday that ""some folks use the term 'wall' and they mean different things.""

""Everyone agrees that what we can and should be building on that southern border is that steel barrier that the president tweeted out. That's what he wants to build. The Democrats, believe it or not, don't call that a wall,"" he said.

---"
492,the recorder,https://www.recordernews.com/news/nationworld/143176,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- A Republican lawmaker advising President Donald Trump said he is encouraging the president to reopen the government for several weeks to continue negotiating with Democrats over funding for a U.S.-Mexico border wall before the president takes the more drastic step of declaring a national emergency.

But that may be wishful thinking, given that Sen. Lindsey Graham also says Trump still wants to reach a deal for the wall before agreeing to reopen shuttered government departments. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a leading Democratic negotiator, insists that Trump reopen the government first.

The weeks-old standoff over funding led to the partial government shutdown that hit day 23 on Sunday without an end in sight.

""Before he pulls the plug on the legislative option, and I think we're almost there, I would urge him to open up the government for a short period of time, like three weeks, before he pulls the plug, see if we can get a deal,"" said Graham, a South Carolina Republican. ""If we can't at the end of three weeks, all bets are off.""

""See if he can do it by himself through the emergency powers. That's my recommendation,"" added Graham, who has publicly pushed Trump to use his authority to declare a national emergency to build the wall. Such a step would allow Trump to bypass Congress and tap various pots of unspent federal money, including for military construction and disaster relief and from asset seized by law enforcement, to pay for the wall.

Trump has kept Washington on edge over whether he would resort to such a declaration, citing what he says is a ""crisis"" of drug smuggling and the trafficking of women and children at the border. The president initially sounded as though such a move was imminent, but then pulled back. He has said several times since he first mentioned the idea in public earlier this month that he prefers to try to reach a deal with Congress.

A key question is how much more time is Trump willing to give lawmakers. Graham, who said he and Trump talked by telephone on Sunday morning, said the legislative path ""is just about shut off"" and blamed Pelosi.

The speaker's office had no immediate comment.

Democrats oppose an emergency declaration but may be powerless to block it. Some Republicans are wary, too, fearing how a future Democratic president might use that authority. Such a move, should Trump ultimately go that route, would almost certainly be challenged in the courts.

Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., called Graham's idea to reopen the government a ""great place to start.""

""I do think if we reopen the government, if the president ends this shutdown crisis, we have folks who can negotiate a responsible, modern investment in technology that will actually make us safer,"" Coons said.

Trump has maintained that the border cannot be secured without a wall.

Graham said he thinks Trump is willing to accept the $5.7 billion he has insisted on for the wall, along with some immigration measures Democrats might find acceptable, such as helping immigrants who were illegally brought to the U.S. as children.

Trump has expressed interest in a broader immigration overhaul, but says he first wants the Supreme Court to address the class of immigrants known as ""Dreamers."" Pelosi also has shown no interest in accepting a wall -- she has called it an ""immorality"" -- in exchange for immigration fixes.

And, Trump, who was holed up in the White House as snow blanketed Washington on Sunday, appeared to shoot down Graham's suggestion of a ""wall plus"" deal, saying on Twitter that even Democrats don't want to make ""Dreamers"" part of the negotiations.

""The damage done to our Country from a badly broken Border - Drugs, Crime and so much that is bad - is far greater than a Shutdown, which the Dems can easily fix as soon as they come back to Washington!"" Trump said in a separate tweet.

The White House has been laying the groundwork for an emergency declaration, feared by members of both parties.

Senate Homeland Security Committee Chairman Ron Johnson, R-Wis., said he would ""hate to see"" a declaration because then the wall wouldn't get built, presumably because of legal challenges. Democrats voted in the past for border security and should again, he said.

""I actually want to see this wall get built,"" Johnson said. ""I want to keep pressure on Democrats to actually come to the negotiating table in good faith and fund what they have supported in the past.""

But Graham, who favors a presidential declaration, said the time for talk is running out.

""It's the last option, not the first option, but we're pretty close to that being the only option,"" he said.

Graham and Coons spoke on ""Fox News Sunday."" Johnson appeared on CNN's ""State of the Union.""

For AP's complete coverage of the U.S. government shutdown: https://apnews.com/GovernmentShutdown"
493,west central tribune,https://www.wctrib.com/news/government-and-politics/4546960-partial-government-shutdown-assured-after-lawmakers-leave,"WASHINGTON - Large parts of the federal government are shutting down overnight after President Donald Trump torpedoed a bipartisan spending deal because it lacked the money he demanded for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.

Funding for numerous agencies, including those that operate parks, homeland security, law enforcement, tax collection and transportation, was set to expire at midnight. Close to 400,000 federal workers are expected to be sent home without pay until a deal is reached, and numerous services will be halted in that time, with the impacts broadening the longer the funding lapse lasts.

The shutdown intensifies a standoff between Trump, who is demanding $5.7 billion for a border wall, and congressional Democrats, who have vowed to block any wall funding and have the votes to do so. It marks a deflating final chapter for Republicans as they complete two years of unified GOP control in Washington - as well as an acrimonious prelude to the upcoming era of divided government, after Democrats take the House in January.

Trump saw the final days of this year as his last chance to try to extract funding for the wall, while Democrats, united against the wall and buttressed by big wins in the midterm elections, showed no signs of buckling to his demands amid a flurry of attacks this week.

The White House and congressional leaders continued negotiations late Friday, but by 8:30 p.m., the House and the Senate had adjourned for the night. That made it impossible to vote on any spending agreement until Saturday, and it remained unclear whether any deal would materialize by then.

It is unclear how long a shutdown might last. Trump predicted earlier Friday that it could drag on for a ""very long time.""

The Senate on Friday considered legislation that would fund the government agencies through Feb. 8 and appropriate $5.7 billion for the erection of 215 miles of wall structures along the Mexico border.

The House passed that legislation Thursday evening, but Senate Democrats successfully unified on Friday and refused to back that measure.

Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said Friday that Democrats were open to discussions with the White House and Republicans but would not agree to any measure that funded the construction of a new border wall.

Schumer said Friday that the Senate had unanimously agreed to a spending bill earlier in the week and accused Trump of having a ""temper tantrum"" because he wasn't getting money for the wall.

""President Trump, you will not get your wall,"" Schumer said. ""You're not getting your wall today, next week or on Jan. 3 when Democrats take control of the House.""

Democrats tried to make clear to the White House for weeks that they had the votes to block any measure that contained money for the wall.

As their power became clear to White House officials, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders signaled Tuesday that Trump was planning to withdraw his request for the funds in an effort to keep the government open.

But he received a torrent of criticism from conservative lawmakers and commentators following this decision, and he reversed course on Thursday, scuttling a temporary, bipartisan spending bill that would have extended funding through Feb. 8 but did not contain wall money.

Trump on Friday urged Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., to change long-standing Senate rules to pass the House's measure providing $5.7 billion for the wall.

McConnell refused, making it impossible for Senate Republicans to marshal the measure through because Democrats control 49 seats in the 100-member chamber.

""We're going to be working very hard to get something passed in the Senate,"" Trump said earlier Friday in the Oval Office. ""Now it's up to the Democrats as to whether or not we have a shutdown tonight. I hope we don't, but we're very much prepared for a long shutdown.""

Republicans were frustrated by the reversal, and Democrats warned Friday that the president's erratic and unvetted decisions in recent days were unsettling financial markets, foreign allies and even members of his Cabinet.

""This is tyranny of talk radio hosts, right? And so, how do you deal with that?"" said Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn. ""You have two talk radio hosts who completely flipped the president. And so, do we succumb to tyranny of talk radio hosts?""

Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis announced his resignation Thursday. The Dow Jones industrial average had one of its worst weeks in recent decades and has fallen almost 4,400 points, or 16 percent, since October.

Multiple federal parks and monuments are slated to close, some as soon as Saturday morning. The Securities and Exchange Commission posted a list of the services it will soon suspend, including the processing of certain business records. The Justice Department, Commerce Department and Internal Revenue Service are preparing to send thousands of workers home without pay.

And Trump's prediction that a shutdown would last ""for a very long time"" meant that hundreds of thousands of federal employees risk missing at least one paycheck. Even the Border Patrol agents and Transportation Security Administration officials who are directed to continue working during the shutdown will not be paid until Congress funds their agencies.

About 400,000 federal workers would be furloughed, according to a Washington Post projection. But a number of federal agencies, including the Pentagon, will not be directly affected, because Congress already passed multiple other spending bills this year that secured funding through September.

As the funding lapse lengthens, the negotiations will prove to be a major test for Trump, Schumer, McConnell and House conservatives as they jostle for footing in Washington's new power structure.

Friday afternoon saw a flurry of discussions begin in the afternoon when McConnell, Democrats and Vice President Mike Pence began huddling separately in the Capitol.

Pence separately joined Trump adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner and White House budget director Mick Mulvaney for a meeting with House conservatives. But the talks yielded no clear evidence of progress, and eventually, Pence and his entourage left the Capitol.

""We don't have a deal,"" Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Richard Shelby, R-Ala., told reporters after emerging from a late meeting with the vice president. ""There are a lot of moving parts, and we're trying to get them moving together.""

The construction of a wall along the border with Mexico was one of Trump's top campaign promises in 2016, and he had promised that Mexico would finance the entire project. But since taking office, he has demanded the money from Congress.

Senate Democrats have blocked every attempt so far. Trump has also threatened to shut the government down numerous times if he doesn't receive money for the border wall, but before Friday night, he had backed down every time.

In recent days, Trump has tried a number of different tactics to try to secure the money. He called on Cabinet secretaries to search their budgets for extra funds, and on Wednesday, he said the entire project would be built by the military. But by Thursday he was back to demanding that Congress provide the funding, leaving many GOP lawmakers scrambling to accede to his demands.

The shutdown followed a day of posturing and unsuccessful negotiations in the Senate on Friday.

After meeting with Trump at the White House, McConnell called a vote aimed at advancing the bill with $5.7 billion for the border wall, saying the legislation would not be considered controversial in more normal times.

""I'm proud to vote for it,"" McConnell said.

But after hours of maneuvering, it became clear that the legislation would not command the support needed to pass, although the Senate advanced it on a procedural vote - with Pence breaking a tie - to keep a legislative vehicle alive in case a deal does emerge.

Trump, meanwhile, ratcheted up public pressure on Democrats to cave on the wall.

In a spate of morning Twitter posts, Trump sought to pin blame on Democrats for a potential shutdown, even though he said last week that he would accept responsibility for a shutdown.

But Democrats showed no signs of relenting, and on Friday night, they continued to blame Trump and the Republicans for the partial shutdown.

""I think we ought to make it clear that it's the president's abrupt change in position and refusal to accept the deal he's already told his leadership he'd accept,"" said Sen. Christopher Coons, D-Del.

""Look, this is the last week we have a Republican-controlled Senate and House and White House - they've got to work this out."""
494,postbulletin.com,https://www.postbulletin.com/news/business/shutdown-suspends-federal-cleanups-at-us-superfund-sites/article_7c1bef99-5826-54bc-ac23-e94da86f6740.html,"BIRMINGHAM, Ala. (AP) -- The government shutdown has suspended federal cleanups at Superfund sites around the nation and forced the cancellation of public hearings, deepening the mistrust and resentment of surrounding residents who feel people in power long ago abandoned them to live among the toxic residue of the country's factories and mines.

""We are already hurting, and it's just adding more fuel to the fire,"" says 40-year-old Keisha Brown, whose wood-frame home is in a community nestled among coking plants and other factories on Birmingham's north side.

The mostly African-American community has been forced to cope with high levels of arsenic, lead and other contaminants in the soil that the Environmental Protection Agency has been scraping up and carting away, house by house.

As President Donald Trump and Congress battle over Trump's demand for a wall on the southern U.S. border, the nearly 3-week-old partial government shutdown has stopped federal work on Superfund sites except for cases where the administration deems ""there is an imminent threat to the safety of human life or to the protection of property.""

EPA's shutdown plans said the agency would evaluate about 800 Superfund sites to see how many could pose an immediate threat. As an example of that kind of threat, it cited an acid leak from a mine that could threaten the public water supply. That's the hazard at Northern California's Iron Mountain mine, where EPA workers help prevent an unending flow of lethally acidic runoff off the Superfund site from spilling into rivers downstream.

Practically speaking, said Bonnie Bellow, a former EPA official who worked on Superfund public outreach at the agency, the impact of the stoppage of work at sites across the nation ""wholly depends"" on the length of the shutdown.

""Unless there is immediate risk like a storm, a flood, a week or two of slowdowns is not going to very likely affect the cleanup at the site,"" Bellow said.

In north Birmingham, Brown said it's been a couple of weeks since she's spotted any EPA crews at people's houses. It wasn't clear if state workers or contractors were continuing work.

But long before the shutdown began, Brown harbored doubts the cleanup was working anyway. ""My main concern is the health of the people out here,"" said Brown, who has asthma. ""All of us are sick, and we've got to function on medicine every day.""

In terms of time, the federal government shutdown is a chronological blip in the long history of the site -- which includes ethics charges in a local bribery scandal to block federal cleanup efforts -- but adds to the uncertainty in an area where residents feel forgotten and betrayed.

At the EPA, the shutdown has furloughed the bulk of the agency's roughly 14,000 employees. It also means the EPA isn't getting most of the daily stream of environmental questions and tips from the public. Routine inspections aren't happening. State, local and private emails to EPA officials often get automated messages back promising a response when the shutdown ends.

In Montana, for instance, state officials this month found themselves fielding calls from a tribal member worried about drinking water with a funny look to it, said Kristi Ponozzo, public-policy director at that state's Department of Environmental Quality. The EPA normally provides tribes with technical assistance on water supplies.

With most EPA colleagues idled, Ponozzo said, her agency also had to call off an environmental review meeting for a mining project, potentially delaying the project.

But it's the agency's work at Superfund sites -- lessening the threat from old nuclear-weapons plants, chemical factories, mines and other entities -- that gets much of the attention.

Absent imminent peril, it would be up to state governments or contractors to continue any cleanup during the shutdown ""up to the point that additional EPA direction or funding is needed,"" the EPA said in a statement.

""Sites where cleanup activities have been stopped or shut down will be secured until cleanup activities are able to commence when the federal government reopens,"" the agency said.

For federal Superfund sites in Michigan, the shutdown means there are no EPA colleagues to consult, said Scott Dean, a spokesman for that state's Department of Environmental Quality.

At Michigan Superfund sites, day-to-day field operations were continuing since private contractors do most of the on-the-ground work, Dean said.

Bellow, the former EPA official, said the cancellation of hearings about Superfund sites posed immediate concerns.

In East Chicago, Indiana, for example, the EPA called off a planned public hearing set for last Wednesday to outline how the agency planned to clean up high levels of lead and arsenic in the soil.

The EPA has proposed a seven-month, $26.5 million cleanup that includes treating and removing tainted soil from the area, where a lead smelter previously was located.

During a public meeting Nov. 29, some residents complained that the EPA's approach would leave too much pollution in place. But others didn't get a chance to speak and were hoping to do so at the meeting this week, said Debbie Chizewer, a Northwestern University environmental attorney who represents community groups in the low-income area.

The EPA announced the cancellation in an online notice and gave no indication that it would be rescheduled.

Leaders of the East Chicago Calumet Community Advisory Group asked for a new hearing date and an extension of a Jan. 14 public comment deadline in a letter to the EPA's regional Superfund division.

Calls by The Associated Press to the agency's regional office in Chicago this week were not answered.

Local critics fear the EPA will use the delay caused by the shutdown as justification for pushing ahead with a cleanup strategy they consider flawed, Chizewer said, even though the agency has designated the affected area as an ""environmental justice community"" -- a low-income community of color that has been disproportionately harmed by pollution.

The EPA has a ""special obligation"" when dealing with such communities, Chizewer said. ""This would be an example of shutting them out for no good reason.""

In North Birmingham, former longtime neighborhood resident Charlie Powell said most of people living in and around the Superfund site had already ""just got tired and fed up.""

Powell left the area but started a group called PANIC, People Against Neighborhood Industrial Contamination. He believes money would be better spent helping residents move away from the pollution.

""Can I say hell?"" Powell said when asked what residents have been through.

For AP's complete coverage of the U.S. government shutdown: https://apnews.com/GovernmentShutdown"
495,west central tribune,https://www.wctrib.com/news/government-and-politics/4549208-trump-threatens-shut-down-border-government-funding-stalemate,"WASHINGTON - With the partial government shutdown headed toward its second week and no resolution in sight, President Donald Trump on Friday issued a string of tweets in which he once again vowed to close the entire U.S. border with Mexico and halt aid to several Latin American countries unless Democrats agree to his demand for billions of dollars in wall funding.

Trump is also canceling plans to visit his Florida resort, Mar-a-Lago, and will remain in Washington over the New Year holiday, Office of Management and Budget Director Mick Mulvaney said.

About 25 percent of the federal government has been shut down since Saturday, with roughly 800,000 workers affected, including an estimated 350,000 who are on furlough at home.

""We will be forced to close the Southern Border entirely if the Obstructionist Democrats do not give us the money to finish the Wall & also change the ridiculous immigration laws that our Country is saddled with,"" Trump said in a morning tweet.

In a reprise of his threat before the midterm elections to cut off aid to Honduras, Guatemala and El Salvador as a caravan of migrants was making its way toward the United States, Trump said that those three countries ""are doing nothing for the United States but taking our money.""

""Word is that a new Caravan is forming in Honduras and they are doing nothing about it,"" he said, without providing further details. ""We will be cutting off all aid to these 3 countries - taking advantage of U.S. for years!""

Despite Trump's threat, the United States this month announced a new collaboration with Mexico on a program to curb migration from Central American countries, with much of the $10.6 billion U.S. contribution to be drawn from existing aid programs.

Trump's tweets come as Congress has effectively given up on breaking the impasse over the president's demands for border-wall funding, all but ensuring that the partial government shutdown will stretch into at least the start of the new year.

The House and the Senate convened for just minutes on Thursday before gaveling closed until next week. During the brief session in the House, Republicans shot down a Democratic attempt to vote on legislation to reopen the government.

As he did Thursday, Trump remained out of public view on Friday. In an appearance on Fox News, Mulvaney said that the president had ""canceled his plans for Christmas, and now he's canceled his plan for New Year's.""

""He's staying in Washington, D.C., over New Year's,"" said Mulvaney, who is set to become Trump's acting chief of staff next month.

Even though Trump will be in town and Republicans control both chambers of Congress, Mulvaney acknowledged that little progress on a deal is expected until the start of the new Congress on Jan. 3, when Democrats will retake the House. Contending that Democrats ""have simply shut down the discussions,"" he sought to place the blame on House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., who is expected to be elected speaker in the new Congress.

""Nancy Pelosi, in fairness, does not have the votes for the speakership yet,"" Mulvaney said. ""She cannot be seen by her party as being weak on negotiating with Donald Trump. So we fully expect that until she is elected speaker and has locked that vote up, we don't expect to hear from the Democrats again.""

According to a Washington Post tally, Pelosi, who won the Democratic caucus's nomination for the speakership in late November, appears to have secured enough support to be elected speaker in January.

Pelosi's spokesman, Drew Hammill, said in a statement Friday that Democrats ""are united against the President's immoral, ineffective and expensive wall - the wall that he specifically promised that Mexico would pay for.""

Democrats will not consider any offers that have not been publicly endorsed by Trump himself, he said.

""While we await the president's public proposal, Democrats have made it clear that, under a House Democratic majority, we will vote swiftly to reopen government on Day One,"" Hammill said.

At the heart of the stalemate is Trump's demand for $5 billion in funding for his proposed wall at the U.S.-Mexico border. Congressional Democrats have rejected that figure and in recent weeks have refused to publicly endorse a figure above $1.3 billion, which continues existing funding levels and includes money for new border fencing and levee walls, but not the concrete wall Trump once demanded before he started more recently talking about ""steel slats.""

Mulvaney said Friday that ""some folks use the term 'wall' and they mean different things.""

""Everyone agrees that what we can and should be building on that southern border is that steel barrier that the president tweeted out. That's what he wants to build. The Democrats, believe it or not, don't call that a wall,"" he said.

496,investing.com,https://www.investing.com/analysis/5-top-shutdownproof-stocks-to-buy-in-2019-200375972,"Republicans and Democrats are in no mood to settle their divide over funding a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border. Thus, the government closure has now become the longest in U.S. history and such a shutdown is expected to impede growth.

But, there are certain stocks that are likely to do well amid the funding lapse and political squabbling. Investing in them, for now, doesn't seem like a bad proposition.

Longest Ever US Government Shutdown Explained

The partial U.S. government shutdown stretched for the 25th day on Jan 15. Conversations between the Trump administration and congressional Democrats remained inconclusive even though Trump's colleagues urged him to strike a deal. Trump, however, was unyielding and criticized House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumerfor not being willing to negotiate with him over funding a border wall with neighboring state Mexico.

Trump had tweeted ""I've been waiting all weekend. Democrats must get to work now. Border must be secured!"" He added that ""Nancy and Cryin' Chuck can end the Shutdown in 15 minutes. At this point it has become their, and the Democrats, fault!""

Democrats have, rather unfortunately, overruled Trump's demand for $5.7 billion for the border wall. This has resulted in about one-quarter of the U.S. government to shut down last month. Trump now has to win approvals from the Democrats after they won the U.S. House of Representatives recently following November's election. The President also needs to win over much of the Senate Democrats to secure nearly 60 votes to pass the funding legislation.

Investors are now feeling the pinch of the government shutdown. Around 800,000 federal employees across the United States missed their first paycheck, leaving several of them unable to pay mortgages and other liabilities. At the same time, lapse in paychecks means that almost four of five U.S. workers will be living without a savings safety net.

In fact, JPMorgan Chase (NYSE:JPM) CEO Jamie Dimon warned that the U.S. GDP may get reduced to zero in the first quarter of this year if the partial shutdown lingers. He believes that consumers are in a pretty good shape and wages are also going up. But, shutdown can push the economy into a recession.

Regrettably, there doesn't seem to be any end to this record-long shutdown. And even if a short-term bill manages to provide funding, traditionally these political fights more or less continue on a regular basis and another shutdown is in the offing instead of a long-term solution.

How to Make Your Portfolio Shutdown-Proof?

As the government shutdown looks like its here to stay, raising doubts over economic growth, investors might be pondering how to make their portfolio shutdown-proof. Military spending is an essential part of the U.S. government. Defense stocks, hence, aren't tied to U.S. federal spending trends and are unperturbed by any political impasse.

The fiscal 2018 federal budget saw massive increase in military spending through 2020. Trump himself assured that despite high profile troop withdrawal by the end of last year, he won't be curtailing military outlays. Rather, he promised to increase spending during a visit to Iraq after Christmas season.

With such unrest shrouding the investment scenario, rising sales of arms is but obvious. Sales of guns have risen considerably, helping shares of stocks like Sturm Ruger & Company (NYSE:RGR) , Vista Outdoor (NYSE:VSTO) and American Outdoor Brands (NASDAQ:AOBC) move north. Having said that, it's definitely not good for the society and it's a sad development. Then again, purely from an investment stand point, publicly-traded gun stocks look alluring amid a government shutdown.

In North Birmingham, former longtime neighborhood resident Charlie Powell said most of people living in and around the Superfund site had already ""just got tired and fed up.""

Powell left the area but started a group called PANIC, People Against Neighborhood Industrial Contamination. He believes money would be better spent helping residents move away from the pollution.

""Can I say hell?"" Powell said when asked what residents have been through."
498,investing.com,https://www.investing.com/news/politics-news/us-government-shutdown-drags-into-fourth-week-amid-stalemate-1746087,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A partial government shutdown entered its 24th day on Monday as talks between U.S. President Donald Trump and congressional Democrats remained stalled even as some of Trump's fellow Republicans called on the president to cut a deal and strains mounted nationwide.

Trump appeared unmoved to act, however, retweeting criticism of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer that urged the top Democratic leaders to negotiate with him over funding for his long-promised wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.

""I've been waiting all weekend. Democrats must get to work now. Border must be secured!"" Trump wrote in an early morning Tweet on Monday.

Democrats have rejected Trump's demand for $5.7 billion for the border wall in addition to other border funds but have said they would support $1.3 billion to bolster border security, including beefing up the number of Border Patrol agents and increasing surveillance.

About one-quarter of the U.S. government shut down last month as Republicans controlled both chambers of Congress as well as the White House. Trump must now win concessions from the Democrats, who took over the U.S. House of Representatives this month following November's elections. He must also win over enough Senate Democrats to secure the 60 votes needed to pass funding legislation there.

The stress from the shutdown became more visible as 800,000 federal employees across the United States missed their first paychecks on Friday. The cut government services also affected travelers as a jump in unscheduled absences among federal airport security screeners forced closures in Houston and Miami airports.

Republican U.S. Senator Lindsey Graham, who last week had called on Trump to declare a national emergency as a way to get money to build his wall, on Sunday urged the president to instead reopen the government for a short period of time in an effort to restart talks before taking such action.

Declaring a national emergency over ongoing immigration issues is fiercely opposed by Democrats and remains unpopular with some other Republicans. It would also likely face an immediate legal challenge.

Trump had said in a televised meeting with Pelosi and Schumer that he would be ""proud"" to shut down the government but has since blamed the Democrats, reportedly storming out of a White House meeting with them last week.

""Nancy and Cryin' Chuck can end the Shutdown in 15 minutes. At this point it has become their, and the Democrats, fault!"" he tweeted on Monday.

Representatives for Pelosi and Schumer could not be immediately reached for comment on Monday.

U.S. Senator Chris Coons on Monday reiterated fellow Democrats' call for Trump to reopen the government while negotiations over the wall and larger immigration issues continue.

He acknowledged efforts by Graham and other Republicans to forge a temporary solution but said Trump has been unpredictable even among fellow conservatives and keeps shifting positions.

""Every time they make progress, the president throws cold water on it,"" Coons told CNN in an interview."
499,naples herald,https://naplesherald.com/2019/01/14/congress-to-face-same-question-when-will-shutdown-end/,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- Congress returns to Washington for its first full week of legislative business since control of the House reverted to Democrats, but lawmakers will be confronted with the same lingering question: When will the partial government shutdown end?

One Republican senator says he's offered President Donald Trump a possible solution, though it may just be wishful thinking.

Sen. Lindsey Graham is encouraging Trump to reopen government for several weeks to continue negotiating with Democrats over the border wall Trump wants to build on the U.S.-Mexico border. If there's no deal at the end of that time, Graham says Trump would be free to take the more dramatic step of declaring a national emergency to build it.

But the South Carolina Republican says Trump still wants a deal on funding for the wall before agreeing to reopen shuttered government departments. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat, insists Trump reopen the government first.

Their weeks-old standoff led to the partial government shutdown, now on day 24 without a clear end in sight.

Trump insisted on Twitter Monday that he wanted to deal, declaring: ""I've been waiting all weekend. Democrats must get to work now. Border must be secured!""

Targeting Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, Trump also argued that the shutdown ""has become their, and the Democrats, fault!"" Trump weeks ago asserted that he would ""own"" the shutdown and polls show that he is taking most of the blame.

Graham, who has publicly pushed Trump to use his authority to declare a national emergency to build the wall, is suggesting a short-term fix.

""Before he pulls the plug on the legislative option, and I think we're almost there, I would urge him to open up the government for a short period of time, like three weeks, before he pulls the plug, see if we can get a deal,"" Graham said. ""If we can't at the end of three weeks, all bets are off.

""See if he can do it by himself through the emergency powers. That's my recommendation,"" added Graham, who has publicly pushed Trump to use his authority to declare a national emergency to build the wall. Such a step would allow Trump to bypass Congress and tap various pots of unspent federal money, including for military construction and disaster relief as well as from assets seized by law enforcement, to pay for the wall.

Trump has kept Washington on edge over whether he would resort to such a declaration, citing what he says is a ""crisis"" of drug smuggling and the trafficking of women and children at the border. The president initially sounded as though such a move was imminent, but then pulled back. He has said several times since he first mentioned the idea in public this month that he prefers a legislative solution.

A key question is how much more time is Trump willing to give lawmakers. Graham, who spoke with Trump by telephone on Sunday morning, said the legislative path ""is just about shut off"" and blamed intransigence by Pelosi.

The speaker's office had no immediate comment.

Democrats oppose an emergency declaration but may be powerless to block it. Some Republicans are wary, too, fearing how a future Democratic president might use that authority. Such a move, should Trump ultimately go that route, would almost certainly be challenged in the courts.

Sen. Chris Coons, D-Del., called Graham's idea to reopen the government a ""great place to start.""

""I do think if we reopen the government, if the president ends this shutdown crisis, we have folks who can negotiate a responsible, modern investment in technology that will actually make us safer,"" Coons said.

Trump says technology is nice, but that the border can't be secured without a wall.

The White House has been laying the groundwork for an emergency declaration, which is feared by lawmakers in both parties.

Senate Homeland Security Committee Chairman Ron Johnson, R-Wis., said he'd ""hate to see"" a declaration issued because the wall wouldn't get built, presumably because of legal challenges. Democrats voted in the past for border security and should again, he said.

""I actually want to see this wall get built,"" Johnson said. ""I want to keep pressure on Democrats to actually come to the negotiating table in good faith and fund what they have supported in the past.""

Graham favors a declaration and said the time for talk is running out.

""It's the last option, not the first option, but we're pretty close to that being the only option,"" he said.

Graham and Coons spoke on ""Fox News Sunday"" and Johnson appeared on CNN's ""State of the Union.""
