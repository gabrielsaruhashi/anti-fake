0,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/21/business/media/fox-news-trump.html,"Whenever President Trump is in a tight spot, things get tricky for Fox News.

The cable network's most popular hosts have largely supported Mr. Trump and his agenda. The network's highest-rated host, Sean Hannity, took the stage with him at a rally in Missouri last month. Mr. Trump even hired the former Fox News co-president, Bill Shine, as the head of his communications team, and he has made no secret of the fact that he likes to start the day with the show ""Fox & Friends.""

On Thursday night and Friday morning, they faced the challenge of filling airtime with talk about the president just as he found himself in the middle of a crisis. And while the nighttime hosts tiptoed around a president in trouble, the morning anchor Brian Kilmeade was bluntly critical. In not toeing the White House line, he was following the lead of the firebrand writer Ann Coulter and the radio host Rush Limbaugh.

The conservative media stars had a lot to work with. On Thursday Jim Mattis, the defense secretary, resigned in protest over the president's decision to pull American forces out of Syria -- a move followed by news of a troop drawdown in Afghanistan.

The governmental drama also included Mr. Trump's blowing up a deal that would have allowed the government to avoid a shutdown over his demand of $5 billion for a border wall.

On the Thursday edition of his 8 p.m. show, the Fox News host Tucker Carlson opened with his favorite topic, immigration. He was digging in, although his show had lost more than 20 advertisers since he said on the air last week that allowing certain immigrants into the United States would make the country ""dirtier.""

""Killing the wall would be a big political win for the left,"" Mr. Carlson said on Thursday, ""but there are other considerations, too, like, what about America?""

At the bottom of the screen flashed a chryon: ""Dems Walk Away From Sensible Wall Debate.""

With the sudden departure of the nation's military chief having alarmed leaders of both parties -- Senator Marco Rubio, Republican of Florida, said the loss of Mr. Mattis meant the country was ""headed toward a series of grave policy errors which will endanger our nation"" -- Fox News devoted much of its coverage in prime time to what it called, in large onscreen type, the ""Wall Fight.""

As the House of Representatives voted in favor of legislation that added $5.7 billion for a border wall -- a bill unlikely to pass the Senate -- Mr. Carlson parried with the Democratic strategist Julian Epstein about immigration. That was followed by a segment on a murder in California committed by an immigrant. After that, the host got around to addressing Syria and Mr. Mattis. And when he did, he echoed Mr. Trump's spin.

""It may seem surprising that the president is breaking with one of his top advisers, but there's another way to look at it,"" Mr. Carlson said. ""President Trump was told the U.S. could defeat ISIS and then leave Syria once it did. The U.S. did that. Now everyone in Washington is demanding he stay in Syria to counterbalance Russia and Iran.""

Critics, Republicans among them, have strongly disputed the claim that ISIS has been contained or that the United States should leave the region. ""I disagree w removing US troops from Syria,"" Ari Fleischer, the former White House press secretary under George W. Bush, said on Twitter.

But the wall was the main story of the night at Fox News.

Substituting for a vacationing Sean Hannity was Dan Bongino, a former Secret Service agent who was until recently a host on the National Rifle Association's media outlet, NRATV, a streaming service available through Apple, Amazon and Roku. On Fox News, Mr. Bongino, who has been praised by Mr. Trump, spent most of the hour talking through the legislative hurdles for potential wall funding.

Guests on Mr. Bongino's edition of ""Hannity"" included Representative Jody Hice, Republican of Georgia, who labeled the potential government shutdown a ""Schumer shutdown"" in reference to Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader. Representative Tom Garrett, a Republican from Virginia, offered this: ""If the clowns on the other side of the building want to fail, let them.""

""Thanks for fighting the good fight, guys,"" Mr. Bongino said.

Conservative media had lasered in on the wall in the days leading up to the Congressional vote on the spending bill, and it seemed to have had a potent effect.

Earlier in the week, Mr. Trump appeared willing to sign a continuing resolution that would have kept the government operating through late February, even without money for the wall. But by the middle of the week, the president had to confront a backlash from a few of his most influential supporters.

Among the conservative commentators pushing Mr. Trump to hold the line was Steve Doocy, a co-host of ""Fox & Friends."" He rooted against the possible passage of a bill that did not include money for the wall. ""He loses, and the Democrats will win everything they want,"" Mr. Doocy said on Wednesday morning.

Ms. Coulter published a blistering column on her website with the headline ""Gutless President in a Wall-Less Country."" In it, she called Mr. Trump a ""gigantic douchebag."" The president appeared to have taken notice. He unfollowed Ms. Coulter on Twitter, according to @TrumpsAlert, a Twitter account that tracks the activity of the Trump family. Mr. Trump follows 45 people on the social network.

On his radio show Thursday afternoon, Mr. Limbaugh -- who also appeared at the Missouri rally with Mr. Trump -- pressured the president to veto any bill that did not include wall funding. But he was more politic in his language than Ms. Coulter.

""Veto this thing and then head down to Mar-a-Lago,"" Mr. Limbaugh said, referring to the president's club in Palm Beach, Fla.

After advising Mr. Trump from behind the microphone, the host let his listeners know he had just received word from the White House that the president would indeed stick to his guns. At around that time, Mr. Trump told a gathering of House Republicans that he would not sign a spending measure that did not include the funding.

On Friday morning, there was more tough talk from one of Mr. Trump's media allies.

After noting the fall in the stock market and the threat of a government shutdown, Mr. Kilmeade said, ""It was as crazy as any day -- and when James Mattis walks in with that three-page resignation letter with subtle shots at the president, you got to wonder where we go on day two.""

Mr. Kilmeade didn't hold back when he addressed the topic that had been played down on Fox News the night before: the president's decision to take troops out of Syria and Afghanistan.

""He's giving Russia a big win,"" Mr. Kilmeade said during a back-and-forth with the White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders. ""Vladimir Putin praised him. He also is doing exactly what he criticized President Obama for doing -- he said President Obama is the founder of ISIS. He just re-founded ISIS! He's really on the griddle with this."""
1,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/02/travel/national-parks-smithsonian-shutdown.html,"With much of the federal government closed because of the budget standoff, museums are shuttered, tour guides are unavailable and trash is piling up.

For the last month, Marci T. House has had the perfect plan for the first week of the year: She would spend it in Washington's museums and galleries, with her wife beside her. The first day was to be spent in the National Museum of African-American History and Culture; the second day at the National Portrait Gallery, taking photos in front of the Obamas' portraits; the third day was for getting on tour buses and seeing outdoor monuments.

But that plan was ruined before it even began when Ms. House learned, after arriving in Washington on Tuesday, that the Smithsonian Institution's museums, along with many other federally funded tourist attractions, were closing because of the government shutdown. The Smithsonian's museums and the National Zoo initially remained open when the shutdown began on Dec. 22, but closed on Wednesday.

""We literally flew all day from Vancouver, British Columbia, to D.C. to see the museums and galleries,"" said Ms. House, an actress. ""Disappointed is putting it mildly.""

She and her wife now plan on spending their trip exploring the city's monuments, like the National Mall, which is open, and are keeping their fingers crossed that the museums will open before the end of the week.

Here's what travelers to Washington and other cities can expect during the shutdown.

Airports remain open

Transportation Security Administration employees are working without pay, but so far no major delays have been reported because of the shutdown.

How about National Parks?

The answer differs by state. Some states have stepped up to keep parks and monuments functioning: New York state is spending $65,000 a day to operate the Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island; Arizona is paying to keep the Grand Canyon open, Puerto Rico agreed to provide up to $80,000 for two weeks of services at the San Juan National Historic Site; Utah has kept visitors' centers open at Arches, Bryce Canyon and Zion national parks.

At the Grand Canyon, the state of Arizona is paying for trash collection, custodial services for bathrooms and snow removal from sidewalks and trails. Stores and restaurants that aren't run by the government are open. Campgrounds are open, but there is no reservation and check-in and check out process.

At Mount Rainier National Park in Washington state, the gate remained open, but officials cautioned that ""entry during the federal shutdown is at visitors' sole risk.""

In California, at Yosemite National Park, trash collection, along with visitors' centers and the park's restrooms have been closed since the shutdown began. Park officials closed two campgrounds and a redwood grove after finding human feces and urine on the park's roads. Joshua Tree has been operating with some staff, but beginning Wednesday afternoon, is not allowing camping because of health concerns about near-capacity toilets.

Elizabeth Harris, a retired doctor who lives in San Rafael, Calif., arrived at Joshua Tree on Wednesday morning, and her son flew from Maryland to visit the park with his mother. ""People plan their family vacations far ahead and our president doesn't seem to care about that,"" she said. ""I'm so disappointed."" Campgrounds closed at noon, and Indian Cove and Black Rock campgrounds remained open for day-use only, sunrise to sunset.

The bright side for Ms. Harris: ""We're lucky to not be government employees, working and not getting paid.""

When it comes to National Parks, how closed is closed?

During the 2013 shutdown, the Obama administration ordered that the national park system completely close. The current administration opted to leave parks open, but unstaffed, frustrating park advocates and enthusiasts who believe the parks are unsafe without staff.

""We're deeply concerned about the approach the administration has taken,"" said John Garder, the senior budget director at the nonprofit National Parks Conservation Association. ""Keeping the parks open is clearly causing threats to health and safety of visitors as well as wildlife and natural and cultural resources. We are worried about parks themselves, about park rangers who are demoralized, and the many businesses that depend on visitors.""

Frustrated by Shutdown, States Spend to Keep National Parks OpenDec. 24, 2018What about Smithsonian museums outside Washington?

There are three: the Air and Space Museum Udvar-Hazy Center in Chantilly, Va., and the Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum and the American Indian Museum Heye Center in New York. They are also closed.

So what's open in Washington?

In addition to any open-air monuments, any privately owned museum or attraction or one run by the District of Columbia is operating, which includes the Washington National Cathedral; the National Building Museum; Artechouse, a gallery that focuses on the intersection of art and technology; the Kreeger Museum, a museum at the former home of philanthropists David Lloyd Kreeger and Carmen Kreeger; and the Hillwood Estate, Museum and Garden, a decorative arts museum.

Park ranger-led tours and memorial shops are closed. And White House tours are suspended for the duration of the shutdown.

2,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/02/us/politics/trump-mattis-defense-secretary-generals.html,"President Trump said on Wednesday that he had ""essentially"" fired Defense Secretary Jim Mattis last month because he was dissatisfied with the retired Marine general's performance in the top civilian job at the Pentagon.

Mr. Mattis resigned on Dec. 20 after failing to persuade Mr. Trump to change his mind about withdrawing the 2,000 American troops now in Syria.

In a stunning letter of resignation, Mr. Mattis outlined his own views about the value of alliances and wrote that the president was entitled to have a defense secretary whose views were ""better aligned with yours.""

Mr. Mattis said he planned to remain at the Pentagon through February to allow for an orderly transition. But after his letter received intense media coverage, Mr. Trump abruptly ordered him to leave the job as of Jan. 1.

Mr. Trump's latest broadside against Mr. Mattis came at a Cabinet meeting that turned into an extended question-and-answer session with reporters.

""What's he done for me? How has he done in Afghanistan? Not too good,"" Mr. Trump said of Mr. Mattis. ""I'm not happy with what he's done in Afghanistan and I shouldn't be happy.""

He went on: ""As you know, President Obama fired him, and essentially so did I."" Mr. Mattis served as commander of the military's Central Command under Mr. Obama, but retired a few months earlier than expected in 2013 after repeatedly clashing with Mr. Obama's national security team over policy in the region, especially regarding Iran.

Mr. Trump praised himself for providing money for soldiers in Afghanistan, and said that Mr. Mattis was ""thrilled"" when it happened.

Mr. Trump said that he himself ""would've been a good general, but who knows."""

By Lisa Friedman

Happy 2019, everyone! While many of us are back to work, parts of the federal government are still closed.

The shutdown has not affected the Energy Department, since that agency's funding has already been approved by Congress. But the Interior Department is struggling with mounting garbage and dirty bathrooms at national parks that are being kept open with minimal staffing. And the Environmental Protection Agency, which had been operating through Friday, has now furloughed thousands of workers.

Just before the furloughs, the E.P.A. issued a major regulatory announcement: a plan to weaken standards that were designed to keep mercury pollution from coal-fired power plants out of the atmosphere. The proposal could also hamper the government's ability to enact future pollution regulations.

And what about the effects that the Trump administration's policies are already having? I hope you made some time over the holidays to read this tremendous investigation by my colleagues Eric Lipton, Steve Eder and John Branch detailing the impacts on communities across the country as the administration eliminates dozens of Obama-era environmental rules.

Meanwhile, Representative Nancy Pelosi, expected to be sworn in as speaker of the House this week, has appointed Kathy Castor, a Florida Democrat, to lead a new select committee on climate change. Ms. Castor said in a statement that Congress must reduce carbon pollution ""by unleashing American ingenuity and creating clean energy jobs to power our future.""

The committee has its critics, including incoming Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, who has championed the idea of a ""Green New Deal"" that would, among other things, transition the country to 100 percent renewable energy and provide a universal jobs guarantee. In a tweet this week, Ms. Ocasio-Cortez commended the creation of the select committee but she said the panel would be weakened without subpoena power or a mandate to develop Green New Deal legislation. ""There is still time to strengthen it,"" she wrote.

Notably, one solution that doesn't seem to be up for serious consideration from the panel is a carbon tax. That could be because, as Justin Gillis asserts in this thought-provoking opinion column, it's too politically toxic at the moment. On the other hand, the idea is getting new traction in some quarters, including from Senator Jeff Flake, Republican of Arizona, who co-sponsored legislation at the end of 2018 with Senator Chris Coons, Democrat of Delaware, to tax emissions and return the proceeds to American households as a dividend.

Expect this issue to heat up in the next Congress.

One thing you can do: New Year's resolutions edition

By Kendra Pierre-Louis

A new year is a time to look back and to look forward. So, in that spirit of reflection, we reviewed our ""One Thing You Can Do"" series, looking for some New Year's resolutions. These individual actions are not a substitute for broader systemic change, but they can still help you lower your personal contribution to global warming.

New Year's resolutions often mean doing more, like working out more or saving more for retirement. But one common thread we found was that if you want to lower your climate footprint, you can find some success in simply consuming less. And it will save you money, too.

Hang onto your phone

Take, for example, your cellphone. Most of us hold onto them for only two years, but as we noted in November, producing a common smartphone released the equivalent of 178 pounds of carbon dioxide, about as much running a modern refrigerator for a year. That is one of the biggest reasons that the global carbon footprint of smartphones is projected to increase by 730 percent this decade.

While some companies are making strides in reducing the environmental impact associated with producing our favorite mobile devices, hanging onto your phone for longer than two years is one way to make a difference.

Buy less clothing

Another thing that's helpful to hold onto? Your old clothes. The amount of textile waste in the United States increased by more than 800 percent from 1960 to 2015, according to the Environmental Protection Agency. (The population grew by about 78 percent during that period.)

The process of creating all of that fabric has a significant environmental impact, including on the climate. One thing you can do is to buy less clothing; spend the new year shopping in your closet instead.

Reduce food waste

Also spend more time searching through your cupboard this year. January is a great time to use up the contents of your fridge and cabinets before food spoils and you have to throw it out.

Globally, we throw out about a third of the food we buy, and if food waste were its own country it would be the third-largest greenhouse gas emitter behind China and the United States, according to the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization.

Reducing food waste is a great way to cut your greenhouse gas emissions, and it can help reduce your grocery bill at the same time.

But while you're thinking about the best ways to cook up holiday leftovers, don't do it in front of the refrigerator. Make sure to shut the fridge door when you're not pulling things out -- keeping the door shut is the most effective thing you can do to lower your fridge's energy consumption.

4,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/29/opinion/tech-2018-trends-2019-predictions.html,"If you thought 2018 was a bad year for tech, 2019 might turn out to be even worse. This year was filled with revelations about privacy, security and cyberwarfare. Next year, the consequences of those revelations will unfold. And we should be very worried about what the future holds.

Privacy Is Dead

In 2018, it became very clear that Americans have no control over their digital information. We discovered that our cellphones could be monitored, and many of the apps on our phones are tracking us. We found out that Facebook shared our private messages with third parties and let developers using its platform harvest and exploit our data in order to influence political elections. Our data is perpetually being gathered, leaked, exploited, breached and sold.

And perhaps worse is what the future holds. We most likely aren't aware of all the companies that hold our personal data and what they are doing with it: the social media companies that know us as well as our friends do, the financial technology companies that sell our bank account transaction data, the messaging apps that hold our private photos and texts.

But 2018 was also the first year of privacy protection in Europe: The General Data Protection Regulation went into effect in May. Despite the protestations of those who complain that G.D.P.R. places an undue organizational burden on start-ups, it could return privacy to millions of people living in the European Union.

But those of us in the United States have no similar privacy protections. There is no way for us to know which companies have our data, and I don't think that will change in 2019. I'm also not very optimistic that any significant legislation will be passed, especially given the relationships between some members of Congress and Silicon Valley companies. The only people who have a chance to hold tech companies accountable and demand better protections are ordinary people like you and me. And I think that we will fail.

Many of us will delete apps. We will disable as much tracking as we can on our phones. We will delete our Facebook accounts. We will delete our social media histories and old emails and text messages. But it won't be enough because most people will not care: The trade-off between privacy and convenience will be worth it to them, because the loss of their privacy will have little to no impact on their day-to-day life. Most people will read (or perhaps ignore) the news stories about every new privacy scandal, and they will then go back to their phones.

The End of Security

There were some very large and frightening data breaches this year. Quora was hacked, and 100 million user accounts were compromised. Facebook was hacked, and 50 million users were affected. Google+ was hacked, and Facebook was hacked again, disclosing that it gave developers access to photos that users had uploaded but never posted. Then we learned that the Google+ hack was worse than we initially knew. And then Marriott realized it had been hacked, exposing the personal data of 500 million people.

The knee-jerk response this year has been to say that these companies need stronger punishments for security breaches, or that we need to regulate tech companies. This response is appropriate in cases where the breach is a result of poor security practices, as appears to have been the case in the 2017 Equifax breach. But some of this year's breaches were different: The Marriott and Quora hacks seem to have been the work of malicious hackers, and in the case of Marriott, the hackers are reported to have been Chinese government spies.

It's not clear that these breaches were a result of poor security practices or corporate negligence. The truth is -- and I say this as someone who has worked in Silicon Valley as an engineer -- the security teams and security practices at Google and Facebook are among the best in the world. It's not clear that stronger punishments or more regulation will fix the problem or prevent these kinds of data breaches from happening.

Being the best in the world when it comes to security and following the best security practices have not protected these companies, and, ultimately, they have not kept our data safe. We will see more of these breaches in the coming year, at large companies, and our data will be exploited in ways we never could have dreamed of. Preventing these companies from storing our data would, ultimately, protect it, but the chances that will happen are slim to none. Instead, as these security breaches become routine, engineers and their employers will accept them as an inevitability and treat them (at least internally) as a nonevent -- much the same as credit card companies and credit card users treat credit card fraud today.

There's a lot at stake. The spies from foreign governments hacking into American companies aren't trying to destroy you, me or any specific individuals living in the United States -- they are trying to destroy the country that we live in.

Tech's Anti-Government Stance

Employees at tech companies like Amazon, Google and Microsoft have begun to organize. In response to an employee walkout at Google, the company changed the way it enforces forced arbitration agreements in sexual harassment cases. The company also dropped out of a competition to provide cloud computing services to the Pentagon after employees protested the company's involvement.

Some of the internal protests at these companies centered on civil rights issues, such as the way that victims of sexual harassment are treated. Others, like the outcry about Google's Project Dragonfly (a censored search engine Google was building for China), were related to freedom of expression. However, a majority of the employee protests and complaints seem to have been about government-related projects. At Salesforce, hundreds of employees signed a petition asking the company to cease working with United States Customs and Border Protection. At Microsoft, employees circulated an open letter urging the company to stop working with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, and also complained about the company's bid for the Pentagon's cloud computing contract -- the very same one that Google employees pressured their employer about. And, at Amazon, employees protested the company selling its Amazon Web Services products to the United States government.

It's not entirely clear if these employees are opposed to working with the government in general, reflecting Silicon Valley's strong libertarian leanings, or if they are only opposed to working with the government under the Trump administration. As the historian Margaret O'Mara has argued, Silicon Valley has long been in the business of war. Amazon, Google and Microsoft were selling their commercial services to (and building customized services for) the United States government long before Donald Trump took office. But I don't recall any open letters, protests or walkouts being staged during the Obama administration.

The United States is under siege from foreign governments and malicious hackers. And Silicon Valley's products are the battlefields where the war is being fought. The Russian government influenced elections in the United States through misinformation that was spread on social media, and foreign hackers phished government officials in order to gain access to their email accounts. An investigation by Politico Magazine found that Chinese and Russian spies are working at Silicon Valley companies, where they were planted to ""steal U.S. technology secrets"" and to engage in ""traditional political intelligence gathering, influence and perception-management operations in California."" And it's not just professional spies who are doing the spying: The same investigation by Politico found that Chinese nationals working in Silicon Valley are often threatened by the Chinese government and coerced into providing their government with this information.

The United States is engaged in cyberwarfare with China and Russia, in which tech companies are inevitably involved. Employees of these same tech companies are pushing their employers to drop contracts with the United States government. If they succeed, who is going to win the war?

5,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/01/us/native-american-government-shutdown.html,"SAULT STE. MARIE, Mich. -- For one tribe of Chippewa Indians in Michigan's Upper Peninsula, the government shutdown comes with a price tag: about $100,000, every day, of federal money that does not arrive to keep health clinics staffed, food pantry shelves full and employees paid.

The tribe is using its own funds to cover the shortfalls for now. But if the standoff in Washington continues much longer, that stopgap money will be depleted. Later this month, workers could be furloughed and health services could be pared back. ""Everything,"" said Aaron Payment, the chairman of the Sault Ste. Marie Tribe, ""is on the table.""

For many Americans who are not federal workers or contractors, a shutdown is a minor inconvenience. A trip to a national park may be canceled. A call to a government office may go unanswered. But for Native American tribes, which rely heavily on federal money to operate, a shutdown can cripple their most basic functions.

All across Indian Country, the federal shutdown slices deep. Generations ago, tribes negotiated treaties with the United States government guaranteeing funds for services like health care and education in exchange for huge swaths of territory.

""The federal government owes us this: We prepaid with millions of acres of land,"" said Mr. Payment, who also criticized the shutdown on Monday from the stage at his tribe's New Year's powwow. ""We don't have the right to take back that land, so we expect the federal government to fulfill its treaty and trust responsibility.""

On the Navajo Nation, a mostly rural reservation of red rock canyon that spans parts of New Mexico, Arizona and Utah, the government shutdown has already been difficult, said Russell Begaye, the Navajo Nation's president.

A blanket of snow has covered the region, but roads are unplowed because federal maintenance has stopped. Many people are now trapped in their homes, unable to make the 20- or 50-mile journey to buy water, groceries and medicine, said Mr. Begaye.

The Interior Department's Indian Affairs bureau provides basic services to about 1.9 million American Indians and Alaska Natives, often by funneling funds to the tribes to administer the services themselves or by employing federal workers to run the programs. This means that services from law enforcement to tribal courts, disaster relief and road maintenance are often completed by tribal employees whose salaries rely on federal funding -- or by federal workers, some of whom are tribal citizens.

The Bureau of Indian Affairs was set to furlough 2,662 of 4,490 employees during a shutdown, meaning at least some of those services and salaries will be slowed or stopped.

Because the federal government contributes to the salaries of many members of the Navajo Nation, Mr. Begaye said the lack of paywould hurt families on the reservation, where a single salary can support a family of six, 10 or even 12 people. Mr. Begaye said loan sharks have started circling, leaving fliers on cars and doorsteps.

""It just kind of snowballs into our people doing things that they know they shouldn't do and further financially obligating themselves,"" Mr. Begaye said. ""They have to keep their heater going. They have to keep their water on.""

On the Bois Forte Indian Reservation in northern Minnesota, tribal officials have instituted a hiring freeze and are planning to meet later this week to discuss budget cuts. Cathy Chavers, the tribe's chairwoman, said tribal functions were continuing for now, but ""it will probably come down to minimal, minimal basic services"" if the shutdown lasts another month.

Already, police officers on her reservation, who are employees of the federal government and not the tribe, were being forced to work without pay.

""These officers are putting their lives on the line,"" Ms. Chavers said, ""and they don't know if they're going to get a paycheck or not.""

Tribes are making plans for how much longer they can operate, while not knowing whether they will be reimbursed for shutdown-related expenses. Officials with the Oneida Nation of Wisconsin said that they had made contingency plans but that they could manage at least another month without any cuts. The Shoshone-Bannock Tribes in Idaho posted on Facebook that they had enough money to operate at full strength through Saturday, but would then have to re-evaluate.

""Things do grind to a halt,"" said Kevin Washburn, who served as the assistant secretary for Indian Affairs under President Barack Obama. ""Indian Country stops moving forward"" during a shutdown, Mr. Washburn said, ""and starts moving backward.""

A spokesman for the Interior Department, reached on New Year's Eve, said so many people were out of the office for the holiday, or furloughed, that he had no information about the way the shutdown was playing out in Indian Country.

""Literally, there's a handful of people that are currently excepted and able to work,"" said the spokesman, John Bockmier, about his office. ""I just don't have any details from around the country to give you,"" he went on, ""because there is no one out there that is currently able to provide that information for me.""

For tribes, this has become a familiar, painful scenario. In 2013, during Mr. Obama's presidency, a lengthy shutdown forced a California tribe to close its child care program. In Minnesota, a tribe postponed nonemergency medical procedures. And the Sault Ste. Marie Chippewa in Michigan lost several employees to layoffs, including hard-to-replace medical staff who did not return after that shutdown ended.

With those bad memories in mind, the Sault Chippewa tribal council approved a resolution last month (on the same day President Trump sparred with Democratic leaders about a border wall on television) that allowed leaders to shuffle funds if federal money stopped flowing. That step has delayed the worst of the pain, but it can help only for so long. Already, tribal officials have sent a memo encouraging frugality and canceled the purchase of a new computer server.

""We're not going to collapse. We may have to decide, 'What we can do with our own funding?'"" said Christine McPherson, the Sault Chippewa Tribe's executive director. ""But we'll never close.""

There have been some efforts to limit the impact. Representative Markwayne Mullin, Republican of Oklahoma, introduced a bill last month that would have maintained funding for the Indian Health Service during a shutdown. His proposal did not make it to a vote, but Mr. Mullin, who said ""I have no read on how long"" the shutdown would last, said he hoped his idea would gain bipartisan traction if the broader impasse stretches on.

""This is a true federal obligation to treaties to Native Americans,"" said Mr. Mullin, who is a citizen of the Cherokee Nation and who received health care at an Indian Health Service facility while growing up. ""This is different than really any other government agency.""

The shutdown also curtailed a Department of Agriculture food program that helped feed about 90,000 Native American people in fiscal year 2017. Chairman Joseph Rupnick of the Prairie Band Potawatomi Nation, headquartered in northeast Kansas, said he feared the impact that this would have on his members.

""Those stores will be depleted,"" Mr. Rupnick said of the tribe's food distribution center. ""When they're going through a shutdown, they're thinking: 'I need five billion for a wall. I need dollars for this or that.' The bottom line is it always impacts the neediest people in the country.""

The shutdown has further eroded many Native Americans' confidence in the federal government, which they said has never lived up to lofty promises made in long-ago treaties. ""I believe very strongly that it adversely affects a population that is already adversely affected by the United States government,"" said Harry Barnes, a former chairman of Montana's 17,000-member Blackfeet Nation."
6,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/03/us/politics/federal-workers-government-shutdown.html,"WASHINGTON -- He has talked about the need for ""protection"" along the country's southern border. He has said he is willing to keep the government shut down indefinitely to ensure the funding of the wall he says will provide that protection. And he has complained about spending the holidays alone in the White House, with no one around with whom he could negotiate.

The one thing President Trump has not talked about publicly during 13 days of the partial government shutdown is the 800,000 federal workers who are not being paid because of it.

Mr. Trump's apparent indifference to the Transportation Security Administration agents, correctional officers, scientists and other federal employees caught in the cross hairs of a political standoff presents a remarkable contrast with how other presidents have made a point of trying to demonstrate their empathy during other shutdowns. In 2013, for instance, President Barack Obama wrote an open letter to the workers affected when the government was closed.

""None of this is fair to you,"" he wrote, adding, ""You and your families remain at the front of my mind.""

Even Ronald Reagan, the president best known for taking on government unions, acknowledged during a 1981 shutdown the ""temporary hardship"" it caused for government workers. But so far, Mr. Trump has not publicly recognized even that.

""It reflects something broader,"" said Stuart Appelbaum, the executive vice president of the United Food and Commercial Workers International Union, which represents 1.3 million members. ""A lack of comprehension of what everyday Americans go through to survive.""

Mr. Trump's one mention of government employees in his daily Twitter blasts in recent weeks made it clear that he viewed many of them as a hostile force, part of the ""deep state"" he and his supporters mistrust.

""Do the Dems realize that most of the people not getting paid are Democrats?"" Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter last week.

Mr. Trump's view of a predominantly Democratic work force, however, is an ""unproven statement,"" according to Paul Light, a professor at New York University's Wagner Graduate School of Public Service. ""The inference is because federal employee unions have a large foothold in the federal work force, and unions are Democratic. But I've never seen a survey that asks that question.""

Bill Samuel, the director of government affairs for the A.F.L.-C.I.O., said the political breakdown of his 12.5 million members is bipartisan and mirrors that of any large cross-section of America. ""He seems to see them as well-paid professionals working in downtown Washington, D.C.,"" Mr. Samuel said. ""But on average, politically, we're like the rest of the country."" About 79 percent of federal employees work outside the Washington area, with Texas, Virginia, California and Maryland having the largest number of government workers.

But Mr. Trump has little sense of the life of a typical government employee, and views them negatively overall, according to former White House officials. One former official said Mr. Trump saw government workers as part of the bureaucracy, and some as part of the deep state.

A second former official said the idea of federal workers toiling without pay left Mr. Trump unmoved.

Hogan Gidley, a White House spokesman, disputed that notion.

""The president cares about the future of all American workers in the public and private sector that have been forgotten by phony politicians for decades, and he wants to ensure their safety and security, which is why he continues to fight for border security,"" Mr. Gidley said.

Marc Short, the former White House director of legislative affairs, pointed out the vocal support Mr. Trump had received from some federal employees. ""I think it's fair to say he's cherished the support he's gotten from federal unions and the National Border Patrol Council,"" he said. ""And I never heard him harbor any ill will toward government workers.""

On Thursday afternoon, in a surprise appearance in the White House briefing room, Mr. Trump appeared with a group of Border Patrol and Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, government workers who enthusiastically endorsed his fight for a wall.

But the impression Mr. Trump has left on union members who do not work directly on national security issues appears to be much different.

""He hasn't shown any respect for what these workers do,"" said Paul Shearon, the president of the International Federation of Professional and Technical Engineers, which represents about 80,000 workers across the country. ""People are truly disheartened. Unfortunately, it doesn't just affect the relationship between Donald Trump and the work force. It affects the relationship between the United States government and the work force.""

Mr. Trump's views about government employees appear to be an outgrowth of how he viewed city workers when he was making a name for himself as a builder in Manhattan.

In his 2000 book, ""The America We Deserve,"" Mr. Trump wrote about his decision to take over the construction of Wollman Rink in Central Park. ""I think there's something else that encourages city construction workers in New York to kill time while my casino workers in New Jersey generally work their tails off: self-interest,"" Mr. Trump wrote.

In his book, Mr. Trump recalled being appalled by a city worker on the job who ""seemed to be on break.""

""In the afternoon he was also on break, and it looked as though it was the same long break he'd begun in the morning,"" he wrote.

At the same time, working in real estate in Manhattan and Atlantic City, Mr. Trump developed a reputation for how he treated workers on his projects.

""He has a dispensable attitude about the replaceability of people,"" said Jack O'Donnell, a former president of the Trump Plaza Hotel and Casino in Atlantic City who has become a critic of his former boss. ""The whole concept that it's a privilege to do business with him, that was absolutely a theme he talked about all the time in terms of negotiating contracts. That was the leverage he wanted us to use.""

In Atlantic City, where he at one point ran three casinos, Mr. Trump famously stiffed blue collar vendors, failing to pay plumbers, waiters and subcontractors. A USA Today analysis published in 2016 discovered at least 60 lawsuits filed by people accusing Mr. Trump and his business of not paying them for work completed. The trail of unpaid bills has followed him to his golf courses, where in 2016 a Florida-based contractor took Mr. Trump to court, claiming that he did not get paid for a $30,000 paint job at the Trump National Doral Miami golf course.

As president, he has signed executive orders to freeze the pay of federal workers this year, and to make it easier to fire them, an attempt that was struck down in court. Mr. Trump has defended ICE agents, the military and Border Patrol officers, but he has also said that the government has ""plenty of rogue employees"" and that he liked the idea of federal workers signing nondisclosure agreements.

At the July swearing-in of Robert Wilkie, the secretary of veterans affairs, Mr. Trump bragged that he had removed ""federal employees who mistreat our veterans, of which, unfortunately and incredibly, there were plenty.""

Three months into his presidency, Mr. Trump extolled President Andrew Jackson, noting that ""to clean out the bureaucracy, Jackson removed 10 percent of the federal work force."" And in his first address in front of a joint session of Congress in 2017, Mr. Trump ticked off a list of his accomplishments, noting with pride that he had ""placed a hiring freeze on nonmilitary and nonessential federal workers."""
7,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/01/us/politics/joe-biden-presidential-campaign-2020.html,"When officials at the University of Utah invited Joseph R. Biden Jr. to speak there in December, Mr. Biden's representatives listed a number of requirements for the appearance. His booking firm, Creative Artists Agency, said the school would need to fly Mr. Biden and his aides to Salt Lake City by private plane. It would have to buy 1,000 copies of his recent memoir for distribution to the audience. There would be no insertion of the word ""former"" before ""vice president"" in social media promotions. And the speaking fee would be $100,000 -- ""a reduced rate,"" it was explained, for colleges and universities.

But three days before the event, Mr. Biden's aides learned that the public university would be using state funds to pay his fee. They already had a policy against taking tuition dollars, and decided that accepting taxpayer dollars for such a windfall might appear just as politically distasteful. Mr. Biden made the trip anyway but declined to take a check.

That costly last-minute reversal exposes the complicated balance Mr. Biden has attempted since leaving the vice presidency two years ago: between earning substantial wealth for the first time and maintaining viability as a potential 2020 presidential contender.

He has done so while building a network of nonprofits and academic centers that are staffed by his closest strategists and advisers, many making six figures while working on the issues most closely identified with him. It has effectively become a campaign-in-waiting, poised to metamorphose if the 76-year-old Mr. Biden announces his third bid for the presidency.

Mr. Biden is expected to reveal his plans early this year, after consulting with his family over the holidays. Having skipped the 2016 race after the grueling death of his elder son, Beau, from brain cancer, he would enter the coming Democratic contest as an early front-runner. With his political self-branding as ""Middle-Class Joe,"" he is seen by Democratic strategists as well equipped to make inroads into President Trump's base of blue-collar white voters.

By The New York Times

So long as a campaign remains possible, Mr. Biden has appeared mindful of the political backlash against the last Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton, for earning millions by speaking to private interests in the run-up to 2016, and for her family foundation's acceptance of huge sums from corporate and foreign donors.

He has imposed telling restrictions on his moneymaking and fund-raising activities: Mr. Biden does not speak for pay to corporate, advocacy or foreign groups and does not consult or sit on boards, said Bill Russo, his spokesman. His nonprofits do not accept contributions from abroad, and the Biden Cancer Initiative does not take money from drug companies, he said.

Yet Mr. Biden, whose blue-collar roots have been central to his political persona through six terms in the Senate and two as vice president, has accumulated millions of dollars through a lucrative book deal and selective paid speaking.

He also has helped to start three foundations, a political action committee and academic centers at the Universities of Delaware and Pennsylvania. At least 49 staff or board members of the various Biden entities worked previously as aides or advisers to Mr. Biden, or held other positions in the Obama-Biden administration or campaigns. Their salaries and stipends consume a substantial share of the budgets of the six groups, including the philanthropic ones.

The list includes Mr. Biden's sister and longtime campaign manager, Valerie Biden Owens, who is vice chairwoman of both the Biden Institute at the University of Delaware and the Biden Foundation, as well as a paid consultant to the institute; Mike Donilon, his strategist across four decades and now the managing director of the institute and a consultant for Mr. Biden's PAC; and Steve Ricchetti, his vice-presidential chief of staff and now the managing director of the Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement. Another longtime Biden operative, Joshua Alcorn, has been paid by Mr. Biden's PAC while serving as an executive at the Beau Biden Foundation for the Protection of Children.

The top compensation, as far as can be determined from Internal Revenue Service records, belongs to Gregory C. Simon, who was projected in a tax exemption application to receive $552,500 a year to run the cancer initiative. Mr. Biden selected Mr. Simon in the final year of the Obama administration to lead the White House Cancer Moonshot Task Force for less than 40 percent of that amount.

Mr. Biden declined through his spokesman to be interviewed about his post-vice-presidency. But several people close to him emphasized that he had built his mini-empire not to prepare for 2020 but to make a continuing contribution on matters of longstanding concern.

""They planned a lot of this under the assumption that Hillary Clinton would be president of the United States,"" said Sarah Bianchi, a former Biden policy aide who is now a paid senior adviser to the institute.

That said, some top staff members will undoubtedly decamp for a campaign if there is one, several advisers said. Whether all the groups could sustain operations is unclear, given that Mr. Biden could face pressure to suspend fund-raising to avoid improper influence.

During the 2018 cycle, Mr. Biden maintained visibility with campaign visits to 24 states and at least 135 other speaking engagements, giving him a platform whenever he wanted. At a book-related talk in Missoula, Mont., in early December, he fueled coast-to-coast speculation about his plans by declaring himself ""the most qualified person in the country to be president.""

Sources of Wealth

Mr. Biden has long been self-deprecating about his relative lack of wealth, compared with some politicians. He and his wife, Dr. Jill Biden, left office with assets worth between $277,000 and $955,000 (not including their house near Wilmington, Del.), as well as a mortgage of $500,000 to $1 million and other smaller loans, according to a 2015 federal disclosure. The report gives values in ranges.

But they have very likely earned more in the two years since leaving office than in the prior two decades, thanks largely to a three-book deal with Flatiron Books reported to be worth $8 million (a figure unconfirmed by the publisher). Two months after the contract was announced, they bought a six-bedroom vacation house in Rehoboth Beach, Del. -- off the water -- for $2.7 million. No mortgage was recorded.

Mr. Biden's only salaried work, according to Mr. Russo, is a Penn professorship that occupies about one day a week. Dr. Biden -- who is writing one of the three books -- earns $99,398 as an English professor at Northern Virginia Community College, state records show. Mr. Biden, who earned $230,700 a year as vice president, receives a hefty federal pension after 44 years of public service. The couple's last public tax return, from 2015, shows they receive about $66,000 a year in Social Security and other pension benefits.

Mr. Russo said Mr. Biden would be transparent about his finances if he ran. ""He will make available his tax returns, financial interests and other information that used to be -- and should once again become -- commonplace,"" he said, referring to Mr. Trump's defiance of a four-decade tradition of voluntary disclosure by presidents and many candidates.

Mr. Biden has restricted his paid speeches to about 40 ticketed shows and campus appearances, according to Mr. Russo. Most of have been shaped around a yearlong tour to promote his 2017 book ""Promise Me, Dad,"" a plain-spoken account of the final year of Beau Biden's life. It spent 11 weeks on the New York Times nonfiction best-seller list and has sold more than 300,000 copies, according to NPD PubTrack Digital.

Mr. Biden did make at least two corporate speeches, to conferences held by a financial services company and by the hedge fund led by Anthony Scaramucci, Mr. Trump's brief-tenured communications director. But he donated the fees to charity and passed on future corporate events, said a person close to him who was not authorized to speak by name.

Mr. Biden has spoken subsequently at events for advocacy and partisan groups or underwritten by corporations -- health care conferences; a banquet for the Charleston, S.C., branch of the N.A.A.C.P.; the Human Rights Campaign's national dinner -- but not for pay, Mr. Russo said.

Open records requests to public universities revealed that Mr. Biden had appeared at some without charge -- Rutgers in October 2017 and the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, last month. The Nevada school paid $225,000 to the Clinton Foundation for a speech by Mrs. Clinton in 2014.

Mr. Russo and Mr. Biden's representatives at Creative Artists declined to disclose his usual fees. But his contract with the University of Utah, obtained through the state's freedom of information act, was for $100,000, plus $10,000 for the private plane. In an October email between university officials, one told the other that an agent for Mr. Biden had described that as a discount.

The book events feature Mr. Biden being interviewed for an hour by another prominent figure, like the screenwriter Aaron Sorkin or the philanthropist Melinda Gates. Tickets for a recent appearance, in Burlington, Vt., cost $45 to $90, with a meet-and-greet package going for $375.

The Bidens pay a staff of five to handle scheduling, media and advance work through a Delaware firm they incorporated called CelticCapri, after his and her Secret Service code names.

Staffs of Allies

Nearly all of the former vice president's closest advisers are attached to one of his centers, full or part time.

Mr. Ricchetti, who has been gauging donor support for a Biden candidacy, is at the Penn Biden Center, a foreign policy think tank intended to give the university a higher profile in Washington. Others on the staff include Antony J. Blinken, who was Mr. Biden's national security adviser, and several regional policy experts.

At the Biden Institute at Mr. Biden's alma mater, the focus is on domestic issues including strengthening the middle class, gay and civil rights, and violence against women. It is housed within the school of public policy, which was recently renamed for him as well.

Administrators at both universities declined to provide budgets or salaries. Their presidents called Mr. Biden's contributions invaluable, particularly in luring dignitaries to their campuses. ""Among our strategic priorities is bringing Penn to the world and the world to Penn, and who better to do that?"" said Amy Gutmann, Penn's president.

Mr. Biden's PAC, American Possibilities, is led by Greg Schultz, a political operative who served as his senior White House adviser. The committee paid him $225,000 over 18 months, records show.

The PAC raised $2.5 million during the 2018 midterm cycle from contributors who included the technology entrepreneur Sean Parker and the Hollywood producers Steven Spielberg and Jeffrey Katzenberg. But only 21 percent of its spending was distributed to Democratic candidates and committees -- more than 120 in all -- while the rest went to salaries and expenses like Mr. Biden's travel.

There is modest overlap between Mr. Biden's political donors and the benefactors of the Biden Foundation, the only of his nonprofits that has voluntarily disclosed its donors. Notable is Tim Gill, a Colorado software entrepreneur and influential gay-rights activist, who, with his husband, is listed as giving at least $1 million to the foundation, as well as the maximum $10,000 each to the PAC.

The foundation is chaired by Ted Kaufman, Mr. Biden's chief of staff in the Senate and appointed successor after the 2008 election. With Mr. Biden's help, it raised $6.6 million in its first two years, including seven gifts of at least $500,000. The Bidens pitched in $100,000, according to Mr. Kaufman.

Staff compensation accounted for 42 percent of the foundation's $2.6 million in spending in 2017. That included $256,000 for the executive director, Louisa Terrell, who was deputy chief of Mr. Biden's Senate staff. The foundation's website now lists 16 staff members, including policy experts in areas like military families and violence against women.

""These are people who have been with him doing these kinds of things throughout his career,"" Mr. Russo said.

The Biden nonprofits are not traditional grant-makers, and the only one made by the Biden Foundation was nearly $500,000 to spin off the cancer initiative. That group took in $3.9 million in 2017, including three gifts from undisclosed donors worth at least $1 million, according to tax filings.

It spent $1.8 million, more than three-fourths of it on salaries and other compensation. That included Mr. Simon's package and a projected $292,500 for the vice president, Danielle Carnival, who had worked on cancer policy in the Obama White House.

At the Beau Biden Foundation, based in Wilmington, Del., salaries accounted for 45 percent of spending in 2016 and 2017, while grants accounted for less than 1 percent.

Those around Mr. Biden would not speculate about what might happen to the groups if he entered the 2020 race. But at least one set of plans has already been shelved.

When the Biden Foundation applied to the I.R.S. for tax-exempt status in February 2016, it stated that one mission would be to ""educate the public regarding Vice President Biden's career in public service"" by building ""a first-of-its-kind vice-presidential library and museum for the study of the vice presidency.""

Then Donald J. Trump was elected, perversely reviving Mr. Biden's three-decade dream of winning the presidency, a job that comes with its own library. ""Since that time,"" said Mark Gitenstein, the foundation's president, ""the board of the Biden Foundation determined that was no longer a relevant objective."""

David Chmielewski, age 16: ""An Exercise in Genius Stupidity""

There's a new major force in hip-hop: mumble rap, a subgenre of rap that is characterized by songs with intense bases and little lyricism, performed by rappers with rowdy personalities. And if mumble rap were a feudal kingdom, Gazzy Garcia, more commonly known as the rapper Lil Pump, would be one of its most important lords. Pump released his first commercial album, the cleverly titled ""Lil Pump,"" in October of 2017. Now, much like most mumble rap, two things are true about ""Lil Pump"": it is exceedingly stupid and yet, at the same time, worth listening to.

Lil Pump once tweeted, ""I REALLY DID DROP OUT OF HARVARD TO SAVE THE RAP GAME."" Unfortunately, none of the genius that earned him Harvard acceptance shines through in his lyrics. If you're the type of person who wants music that gives complex commentary on race, love or other intellectual topics, ""Lil Pump"" isn't for you. If you instead happen to love songs with uncreative and repetitive verses about Pump's wealth and fame, this is the perfect album for you. Perhaps no track exemplifies this more than the infamous ""Gucci Gang,"" where Pump repeats the phrase ""Gucci gang"" fifty-three times while bragging about his wealth.

That said, while the nutrition label on a jar of mayonnaise may be more clever than this album, it's still an enjoyable listen. And therein lies the true genius of Lil Pump and other rappers of his ilk; their lyricism may not be amazing, but their tracks are downright fun. On ""Lil Pump,"" that shines through in the energy of the beats and delivery of every track. The song ""Youngest Flexer"" is a perfect example of this. Every line features Pump bragging about his ability to afford expensive brands, but the partnership of Pump's passionate delivery and an energetic beat featuring laser noises and xylophones will make you incapable of getting the phrase ""I'm the Youngest Flexer"" out of your head. This trend continues on every track, with the repetition, catchy beats and Pump's intense delivery combining to make songs that you will inevitably end up guiltily enjoying.

Ultimately, the jury for the Pulitzer for Music probably shouldn't be putting ""Lil Pump"" on their shortlist anytime soon. But that doesn't mean the album is inherently bad; it's just the musical equivalent of a stupid action movie. Sometimes, it's okay to set aside complex dramas and watch a brainless but enjoyable movie where the Rock jumps out of a helicopter as his muscles bulge. Similarly, sometimes you need to ignore the more artistic side of the music industry and listen to a teenager who claims he went to Harvard say ""Gucci gang"" fifty-three times.

Helen Deng, age 14: ""'The Good Place': Astute, Heartwarming and Relevant All at Once""

I have a notoriously short attention span. See: the fact that I never watched the cult-popular ""Stranger Things"" -- the first minute bored me. But sitcom ""The Good Place"" somehow immediately piqued my interest -- with its unnaturally cheery lighting and intriguing premise, it practically screams a promise of a good time. To devout Christians and Buddhists and atheists alike, it sums up the afterlife into the Good Place ... and the ominous, self-explanatory Bad Place.

It seems simple. After death, humans go to either place based on the balance between good and bad actions during their time on Earth. Eleanor Shellstrop (Kristen Bell) wakes up in the Good Place, but soon realizes that she most certainly does not belong in this land of philanthropic frozen-yogurt enthusiasts. Throughout the characters' hilarious antics, you may begin to think ""The Good Place"" will get predictable ... spoiler alert: It never does!

With startling self-awareness, the twists of this utopia-turned-dystopia are riddled with wittily delivered jabs at the tendencies of human nature, as seen when Michael (Ted Danson) declares, ""Now we're going to do the most human thing of all: attempt something futile with a ton of unearned confidence and fail spectacularly!"" While Eleanor endeavors to improve from her corrupt life of telemarketing drugs to the elderly, viewers become enthralled in this exploration of what it really means to be a good person. Is it holding the door open for others? Is it ignoring the selfish urge to steal all the cocktail shrimps? Is it reading all of Immanuel Kant's philosophical theories?

Through existential crises and unexpected revelations, viewers are increasingly shown that nothing is black-and-white -- this world even features a literal Middle Place. The plot may be unpredictable, but its overarching theme of ethics becomes consistently more important and insightful in this age. As our current nation confirms a man onto the Supreme Court because he sexually assaulted a woman while only being ""a boy in college"" and school shootings continue due to contentious beliefs around our ""right to bear arms,"" the ethical battle between the overall good versus personal values rages on.

""The Good Place,"" an unexpectedly profound sitcom, does a remarkable job of not only compellingly discussing morality, but also the persistence of human nature; all of this is accomplished while remaining both tasteful and immensely entertaining, leaving viewers wanting more. Take it from Eleanor: Striving to become a better person is what matters most -- preferably before death. To quote Eleanor's ethics teacher, Chidi Anagonye (William Jackson Harper): ""I argue that we choose to be good because of our bonds with other people and our innate desire to treat them with dignity. Simply put, we are not in this alone.""

Crystal Foretia, age 17: ""'Counting Descent': A Post-Mortem on Black America""

Imagine you were a black fifteen-year-old on Nov. 9, 2016. You woke up, having gone to bed before the election results came out. Your phone was buzzing all night with people reacting to the results on Twitter. You finally saw the headline: ""Donald Trump wins 2016 Presidential Election."" Meanwhile, you heard reports documenting numerous incidents of vandalism. The one that hit home is graffiti reading, ""Black Lives Don't Matter And Neither Does Your Votes."" Despair, confusion, and fear creeped in and then crashed down all at once. If there was a book capturing the strife and anxiety that you felt in that moment, it would be ""Counting Descent"" by Clint Smith.

Smith's poetry, published that same year, transcends the boundary between personal and universal by imbuing his parables with the realities of Black America through creative poetic form. If you've ever felt frustrated trying to uncover the literary purpose of a sestina or sonnet, don't fret: Each poem's unique structure directly feeds into its narrative. ""Playground Elegy"" resembles a slide as the act of having your hands up, which conveys a sense of freedom, shifts to a similar, but more desperate connotation in police confrontations. ""For the Boys Who Never Learned How to Swim"" extended the spacing between the final two words to symbolize a black man's final breath prior to being killed, mimicking a fish's dying gasp. The numbered format and blank space at the end of ""How to Make an Empty Cardboard Box Disappear in 10 Steps"" highlights the frequency and lack of progress made on police brutality; it warns that inaction will guarantee another Tamir Rice or Philando Castile incident.

The influences of Ralph Ellison and James Baldwin reflect heavily in Smith's work. ""Counting Descent"" echoes ""Invisible Man"" through its ideas on identity and power, as each poem strains against unfair expectations, violence and self-doubt that plague Black youth, despite the progress made since the 20th century. The epigraph from Ellison also introduces the relationship between protest and artistic expression. Smith explores this dichotomy in two poems alluding to Baldwin's ""Everybody's Protest Novel,"" ultimately concluding that we cannot separate literature from political advocacy. This theme brilliantly unifies the collection, as Smith critiques the lionization of slave-owning presidents, microaggressions middle-class black students receive and the criminalization of black bodies.

Bottom line: If you loved ""The Hate U Give,"" ""The New Jim Crow"" or any work detailing modern-day struggles African-Americans face, then read this. ""Counting Descent"" lambasts the notion of ""post-racial society,"" which washed over the American populace after Obama's triumph in 2008. The collection serves as a cathartic read for those who lost their innocence to systemic discrimination. ""Counting Descent"" is a poignant addition to the Black literary canon.

Simon Levien, age 18: ""The Functional Art at Your Fingertips""

Sixty keys. No number pad, no arrows, no function row. The spots where the control keys should be are blocked off. Instead, control takes caps lock's place. Backspace is where backslash was. Right shift is cut short; its rightmost part becoming an ""Fn"" key. This was Professor Eiiti Wada's peculiar new design for a computer keyboard. Later, Fujitsu would market it as the ""Happy Hacking Keyboard"" or HHKB, which would pick up steam in mechanical keyboard circles, hobbyist communities of writers and programmers. Within, the HHKB is nothing short of a controversial icon, both vilified and lauded by typists. It's noted for underwhelming construction: creaky plastic and flimsy flip-out feet. So, what could possibly justify a $200 price-tag on a keyboard?

Consider this: When was the last time you needed to hit Pause/Break? This and many other keys are rarely touched by most users. Wada then asks: Why have unused keys occupy desk space? The HHKB eliminates them. A smaller keyboard means your mouse and keyboard are closer together, leading to less arm strain. Similarly, the nearby placements of control and backspace are godsends in reducing awkward finger placement.

Like how holding shift enables uppercase, pressing the Fn key in combination with others enables a second ""layer"" of functionality: Fn + various keys accesses arrows, function keys, etc. There's no longer a need to take your hands off the home row because full functionality is within pinkie's reach. I'll admit; it's intimidating at first, but the learning curve is gentle. Rather than slow me down, these layout tweaks have increased my speed from word processing to webpage navigation, all while minimizing repetitive muscle strain for long computer sessions.

Fujitsu went with Topre key switches, lightly tactile rubber domes making each key a cushion. Typing is like pleasing pitter-patter, a sound fondly dubbed the Topre ""thick-thock."" I'd say it feels like punching a pillow, soft but quick -- perfect to add some oomph to your typing speed and stamina.

Topre switches can withstand 30 million keystrokes -- virtually a lifetime. Add this on top of the lightly-textured keycaps which won't fade, yellow or wear, and you have what enthusiasts call the sought-after ""endgame"" keyboard. For me, the HHKB's lightweight longevity has made it my go-to, to-go laptop accompaniment.

For some, the HHKB is a canvas. There are forums dedicated to colorful keycaps, case painting and stickering, Bluetooth adaptation -- you name it -- all for the little keyboard I'm typing on right now. Wada's thoughtful design is so popular because it's ergonomic; it's aesthetically pleasing; it's customizable yet streamlined and minimalist. It turns a mundane input device into a personal piece of expression most comfortable and enjoyable by you, the user. In Wada's own words, HHKBs are not keyboards, but ""important interfaces"" of ""functional beauty.""

Isabella Levine, age 17: ""Dazed and Confused: Millennial Fetishization of Flower Power Forgets the Meaning of Freedom""

The bluesy riffs and screeching vocals of Greta Van Fleet, a young four-piece from Michigan, were compared to that of Led Zeppelin after their 2017 double EP topped rock charts. However, the group's debut album, ""Anthem of the Peaceful Army,"" shows that while lead singer Josh Kiazka's best howl may land in the realm of Zeppelin vocalist Robert Plant's, the likeness stops there. The seeds of a potential rock revival are chewed up and spit out in an overproduced bastardization of rock that romanticizes the hippie era without any of its relevance or defiance.

Packaged in vagueness, themes about love or peace simply lack resonance for a modern audience. Climate change is touched upon in ""Watching Over"" when Kiazka sings, ""And it's our demise/With the water rising,"" but the overtness found here is the exception rather than the rule. A more typical lyric borders on the ridiculous, like, ""March to the anthem of the heart,"" found on the album's opener, ""Age of Man."" Or try, ""And every glow in the twilight knows/That the world is only what the world is made of,"" the fluff of the acoustic tune ""Anthem,"" a song that might have been their ""Dust in the Wind"" or ""Tangerine"" but instead, devoid of nuance, falls flat. The track titles alone make Greta Van Fleet's Achilles' heel painfully clear: They are too unqualified to address these themes comprehensively yet not self-aware enough to realize it.

Occasionally, songs like ""Brave New World"" will border on well-realized emotion, but then Kiazka screeches, ""Kill fear, the power of lies,"" and we remember that the band doesn't know what they're talking about. Even looser romps like ""The Cold Wind"" feature riffs too safe to be exciting, padded with store brand hippie lyrics about this flower child or that Tolkienesque landscape.

Despite the lack of innovation, the band is at its best tackling lighter fare. ""Mountain of the Sun,"" a textured reprieve from cloying talk of apocalypse, builds the energy expected from a few twenty-somethings. Where much of the album is weighed down by too many instrumental tracks and postulations on the meaning of love and pain, this song soars in its simplicity. For a while, the Michigan boys don't bite off more than they can chew, and artist and listener alike can finally enjoy themselves.

Greta Van Fleet has one foot in each time period, an imitation of flower power twisted in a how-many-Spotify-playlists-can-we-slide-into kind of way. Their sound is manufactured to be clickable. And when moments like ""Mountain of the Sun"" show that they don't lack talent, just authenticity, we can only hope that the group will eventually find their own stairway to heaven.

Clara Martin, age 16: ""Can You Stomach the Stories?""

I'm not scared of clowns or ghosts or sharks, but author Amelia Gray utterly terrifies me. Her 2015 short story collection ""Gutshot"" is provocative and unsettling. This hauntingly original collection pushes the boundaries of what a story can be, leaving readers unnerved along the way.

""Gutshot"" is an apt name for the collection. It contains 38 densely packed short stories, each one stranger than the last. The stories gently coax the reader, only to pummel their mind with unnerving concepts and scenarios, and spit them back out, frazzled and tumbling into the next one. Thematically, they bring to mind Flannery O'Connor's characteristic gothic stories.

Dissimilar to O'Connor's, they truly are short stories. Some of the stories span only one or two pages and there's an enthralling power to these shorter stories. Gray serves a strange scenario, lets the reader take a nibble, then pulls back the plate abruptly. There's ""Fifty Ways to Eat Your Lover"" which embodies Gray's flair for the macabre juxtaposed with the sentimental. One line reads, ""When he takes you to meet his parents, smother him with a pillow and eat his middle finger."" Gray doesn't apologize for violent sentences like these. Neither do her characters for their strange behaviors, and neither do her concepts. They simply exist. Gray challenges us to read her stories without recoiling.

However, at times the especially short stories left me unsatisfied. Their images were compelling, but they lacked the deeper exploration I craved. The concepts felt half-baked or abandoned. Most often, I enjoyed the longer stories where Gray's strange concepts are given space to breathe and develop. In ""House Heart,"" a couple keeps a girl locked in the claustrophobic vents of their house. In ""The Lives of Ghosts"" a woman is haunted by the ghost of her dead mother who has taken residence in a pimple on her face. The lengths of these stories allow for more development of the narrator's voice while still experimenting with other untraditional elements. Sometimes the stories talk to each other. In ""Precious Katherine,"" a sparrow speaks using lines from a previous story, giving both stories additional dimensions.

""Gutshot"" is an intense collection of fearless tales. Each one containing a small festering chunk of this thing we call life. In reading ""Gutshot,"" one enters the peculiar mind of Amelia Gray and reflects on what can disturb, what can provoke, and what that says about ourselves. The collection gives us an excuse to explore the grotesque and dare to call it beautiful. To read one of Gray's stories, you must have a tough stomach. Because you will be gutshot. Multiple times over.

Luke Park, age 14: ""'All The Light We Cannot See': A Story of Friendship""

Late at night I opened Anthony Doerr's ""All the Light We Cannot See."" The night wore on, the hours passed, and so too did the pages. I was brought back to familiar places: Paris on the eve of the German invasion. There, while looking down a cobblestone street lined with quaint houses, I could smell the warm pastries escaping bakeries. Next, I was in an orphanage in the German coal-mining city of Zollverein, rundown and rampant with poverty. Many war novels had taken me to similar settings (though few so vividly realized), but Doerr's novel confronted me with something different, an earnest tale of friendship and peace that escapes the over-trod good vs. evil that dominates World War II books.

Doerr's novel centers on a young French girl, Marie-Laure, and Werner Pfennig, a German teenage boy. Werner and Marie's conflict is timeless, a story about two individuals who could not possibly be more different coming together, but Doerr keeps the reader on edge because Marie and Werner are such effective foils. Marie is a blind French girl attempting to survive advancing German soldiers, while Werner lives on the opposite side hunting, alongside his fellow countrymen, elements of the French Resistance. Marie desperately tries to hide, while Werner and the rest of the imposing German army hunt her and other elements of the resistance.

The kinetic pace of Doerr's novel makes this well-worn trope work. Flipping back and forth between Werner and Marie in short two- to three-page long chapters may create a whiplash effect for some readers, but it animates the stories central tangle. Moreover, it forces the reader to reflect upon the occurring events. The chapters are brief but effective, allowing the story's events and themes to seep in before the reader is catapulted into the next segment.

""All the Light We Cannot See"" amply demonstrates what it means to be on opposite poles of a conflict and yet share the same tragedy. It evades the clichéd conclusions about good vs. evil that plague so many World War II novels and does so all at a brisk clip. It neither validates the righteous nor condemns the wrong but rather sews the two together. ""All the Light We Cannot See"" is different, and its captivating story kept me turning its pages all night until the book lay face down on my nightstand finished.

Kyle Sabin, age 16: ""'Reputation' by Taylor Swift: The Uncovered Side of a Superstar""

After the undeniable success of ""1989,"" Taylor Swift's fifth studio album, it was difficult to imagine the artist producing another album of its caliber, especially following a two-year hiatus from music-making. Yet with the release of ""Reputation,"" a darker, moodier version of ""1989"" that draws on the electronica tracks currently ruling the airwaves, Ms. Swift managed to create an album that, while showing more vulnerability than her previous work, still captures the essence of what makes her music stand out -- catchy hooks, powerful melodies and rich lyrics.

In the album's lead single, ""Look What You Made Me Do,"" Ms. Swift declares her old self dead, and she is right: ""Reputation"" pushes past the standards that she set for pop music with her previous album by mixing themes from other genres. This is evident from the album's first track, "" ... Ready For It?"", a provocative synthesizer-heavy piece in which Ms. Swift plays around with new lyrical topics and a strident bass. This pattern of trying new sounds is mirrored in tracks like ""I Did Something Bad"" and ""This Is Why We Can't Have Nice Things,"" two tracks full of stabs at Ms. Swift's foes. In these cases a common occurrence, though, is that you either love the new sounds or hate it.

It is evident, however, that there are elements of the old Ms. Swift in ""Reputation."" The musical style of past albums can be noticed in tracks such as ""Gorgeous"" and ""Getaway Car""; both feature sounds and melodies that fans of Ms. Swift's prior work will appreciate. Both songs' lyrics reflect a recurring theme in the album -- the implications of a romance in the public eye. This motif can also be seen in ""Don't Blame Me,"" a gospel-inspired track with a thundering chorus reminiscent of ""Wonderland"" from ""1989."" There are also tender moments -- ""Delicate"" and the ballad ""New Year's Day,"" a personal favorite, showcase a more mature Ms. Swift, replacing the lively singer of years past with a woman who acknowledges the criticism thrown her way. These themes are uncharted territory for Ms. Swift, but she charges through with heavy bass and soft-spoken melodies, leading to songs worthy of being played on repeat.

""Reputation"" was a risk for Ms. Swift; passive-aggressiveness and fragility are not elements of her previous music, but she ably succeeds in analyzing the impact of superstardom and reputation on a personal basis, her stated intent. The album has a duality that some of Ms. Swift's past work lacks -- it's bold but subdued, brash but beautiful, deliciously fierce but equally vulnerable. Despite the album's occasionally questionable choices, it was certainly enjoyable and I believe it is a worthy addition to Ms. Swift's discography. Look what you made her do, indeed.

Sydney Sullivan, age 17: ""Poetry Regarding Poetry""

It is no mystery why Billy Collins has earned the title of Poet Laureate not once but twice. His diction is spectacular in its simplicity, as is the content he delves into. He provokes reflection in his contemplation of everyday objects: a window, a statue, a notebook. Never a pedant, he speaks to whomever dives into his work. The beauty in his poetry lies in its duality. Sparse yet elegant, succinct yet rich, and humorous yet sobering. In his collection, ""The Trouble with Poetry and other Poems,"" he tackles his identity as a writer of poetry while inspiring new poets with every stanza.

Collins discusses sorrow, nostalgia and gloom in an often lighthearted and ironic tone. In ""The Revenant,"" he writes from the perspective of a euthanized dog, redefining a heartbreaking concept as a comedic one. ""When I licked your face, I thought of biting your nose,"" he teases. And with that phrase the theme of grief is replaced by playful taunting. His ability to find humor in tragedy demonstrates the diverse lenses from which he observes the world.

A talented poet abides by no rules, and Collins flaunts this in ""The Student."" He commences this piece with a laundry list of rules regarding poetic structure, and closes with his prompt defiance of the final rule: ""always keep your poem in one season."" His grand finale frolics from summer to fall to winter, exemplifying his belief that guidelines are not applicable to poetry. In a whimsical rather than scornful tone, he denounces the rule makers attempting to constrain his mind.

The reader only learns the ""trouble with poetry"" in Collins's final poem, where it is finally revealed that there is no true trouble with poetry at all. ""The trouble with poetry is,"" Collins writes, ""that it encourages the writing of more poetry, more guppies crowding the fish tank, more baby rabbits hopping out of their mothers into the dewy grass."" In these fleeting phrases, Collins answers the question posed by every reader as they gaze down upon his latest collection: How can a poet find flaws in his passion? It turns out that the ""trouble"" is not a trouble at all, but rather a complexity that defines poetry as art instead of mere words. Poetry is a gateway to infinite observations and realizations. This language will discontinue only when ""we have compared everything in the world to everything else in the world"" which clearly will never occur. With these words Billy Collins challenges every reader, regardless of age, class or education, to commence their comparisons of worldly objects.

Emily Tian, age 17: ""China Canteen: A Humble Shrine to the Sichuan Kitchen""

China Canteen, off Hungerford Drive in Rockville, Maryland, is known to its Chinese customers as 老四川: Old Sichuan. The restaurant has planted itself on the border of a nondescript strip mall for eighteen years -- old indeed for an area where restaurants surface and sink in droves.

Between the inked horse paintings and specials handwritten in sloping green Expo, the restaurant wears its age plainly. Chinese parents and kids are seated in cracked maroon booths, deftly breaking apart bamboo chopsticks and pouring steaming cups of tea. Even our broad-shouldered Hispanic server has waited tables here for over a decade. He takes our party's orders in Mandarin.

We first try a traditional dish, 夫妻肺片, which translates literally to husband-wife-lung-slices. It's not really lung, the menu coaches us, but the marriage of thinly sliced beef tendon and chili oil, constellated with peanuts, is nevertheless a breathless one.

The Sichuan fish is electric. Filleted tilapia simmers under a blistery rain of peppers. Its spice-bombed fragrance, lightened by bean sprouts, infuses the room; our neighbors turn to ask us what we ordered.

To the chef's credit, milder dishes don't erode against the numbing ones. I find myself reaching again for the pi pa tofu: silken tofu beaten with shrimp then gently fried. The size of a toddler's fist, each ball is soaked in a delicate broth of shiitake mushrooms and bok choy. For $17.99, we share a platter of tea-smoked duck, which arrives wreathed by sprigs of green onion and airy buns painted with sweet bean paste.

As with many Chinese joints, however, the bowls of white rice have become something of a chef's shrug. And skip the scallion pancakes: the cumbersome dough all but smothers the pale ringlets of scallion. Lunch specials will set customers back $7.99, but they sport none of the traditional plates that charge the rest of the menu.

The restaurant is run by two brothers and their father, all from the Sichuan Province. Mr. Yu, the younger brother, who greets regulars and recommends dishes to new diners with a Buddha-like warmth, says they have no plans for renovations. Every three years, they've renewed their license; if business is decent, they see no reason to change.

Of course, it might not be so simple: Along Rockville Pike alone, China Canteen must train its steady firepower against nearly-translucent soup dumplings, A&J's dense, chewy noodles, and sunny, Instagram-happy newcomers like the pan-Asian food hall, The Spot.

But the Yu brothers brush those thoughts aside. For now, they're most comfortable in the kitchen, braising fish, cubing duck blood, dicing chicken, slicking the wok with red oil and peppercorns.

And I, for one, am not looking for anything else."
9,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/19/sports/mone-davis-little-league-hampton.html,"PHILADELPHIA -- The point guard with familiar braids stole the ball once, twice, three times in succession. She scooped in a shot, then twirled a layup over her head while facing away from the basket.

""Sweet!"" a friend yelled at a recent high school game.

This is the future Mo'ne Davis imagined for herself four summers ago, when she became the first girl to pitch a shutout at the Little League World Series and, apparently, was the first African-American girl to participate in the tournament.

She spoke then of wanting to play college basketball at powerhouse Connecticut and professionally in the W.N.B.A. But circumstances change, teenage interests diverge, horizons broaden.

Now 17 and a senior at Springside Chestnut Hill Academy in Philadelphia, Davis continues to excel in multiple sports. But an ankle injury last summer required an extended recovery and, she said, dampened the interest of basketball recruiters from midmajor colleges.

Instead, Davis has committed to playing softball -- she is a shortstop -- at Hampton University in Virginia, with an opportunity to explore basketball there if her first love blooms anew.

Her decision to attend a historically black university was partly inspired by the positive experiences of older friends. It also reflected a social awakening informed, among other things, by meeting President Barack Obama and Michelle Obama at the White House in 2014; an incident in 2015 that victimized her on social media; and a bus trip through the South that year with her rec-center baseball team to visit landmarks of the civil rights era.

After attending the predominantly white Springside Chestnut Hill Academy since second grade, Davis said, ""I just thought it was a perfect fit to be able to play with other girls who look like me or perhaps grew up kind of the same way I grew up.""

That eye-opening 2015 trip through the South began with wonder and horror.

On June 17, 2015, as Davis and her teammates departed by bus from Philadelphia to Washington, the white supremacist Dylann Roof shot to death nine parishioners, all African-Americans, in a massacre at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church in Charleston, S.C.

Until then, Davis said, she had paid little or no attention to the news beyond sports. But the next morning, as she and her teammates ate breakfast in their hotel in Washington, she said they watched television, stunned and afraid. News reports suggested the gunman, whose arrest had not yet been announced, might be headed northward as they headed southward.

""It showed that there was still hate in the country,"" Davis said. ""It changed the way I started to see things.""

Later that day came another significant moment for Davis, this one affirming and uplifting. She and her teammates met Representative John Lewis of Georgia, a towering activist in the civil rights movement who helped lead the marches from Selma to Montgomery, Ala., in 1965 to promote black voter registration and the Freedom Rides that challenged segregation of public buses.

For months before the trip, the teenage athletes studied the country's black history, from slavery through the civil rights era. They had seen the movie ""Selma"" and videos of Lewis and other demonstrators being clubbed by Alabama state troopers at the foot of the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma on March 7, 1965, in what became known as Bloody Sunday.

When Davis met him in person, she said Lewis's stature left her breathless.

""You see him in these movies and videos, and he doesn't seem like a human being after everything he's gone through,"" Davis said.

Lewis told the players a well-known story about forgiveness and reconciliation. In 2009, he received a visit on Capitol Hill from a former supporter of the Ku Klux Klan. Decades earlier, the man and others had attacked and bloodied Lewis when he tried to enter a waiting room for whites at a bus station in Rock Hill, S.C.

""Mr. Lewis, I'm one of the people that beat you,"" Elwin Wilson, the former Klan supporter, then in his 70s, and who died in 2013, told the congressman. ""I want to apologize. Will you forgive me?""

Wilson began crying.

""I forgive you,"" Lewis said.

The men hugged.

Recounting the story, Davis said: ""I thought that was one of the coolest things ever. This world is already full of hate. You can't just keep putting hate out there.""

Lewis's compassion validated for Davis a gesture of tolerance she had made three months earlier, in March 2015. A baseball player named Joey Casselberry at Bloomsburg University in Pennsylvania wrote dismissively on Twitter about Davis's accomplishments in the 2014 Little League World Series and called her a ""slut.""

His odious remarks resulted in his suspension for the 2015 season, but Davis asked that Casselberry be reinstated, saying at the time, ""Everyone makes mistakes and everyone deserves a second chance.""

Casselberry was permitted back on the Bloomsburg team in 2016. A university spokesman said Davis's request did not play a role in that decision. But she remains assured that absolution was the correct response. ""We decided to take the high road and be the bigger person,"" she said.

Now, as in Little League, Davis seems to possess a preternatural calm and poise on the court and the playing field. Her basketball coach, Florence Hagains, described her as a player who phones at night to discuss ways to improve, eagerly credits her teammates and encourages the uncertain eighth-grader on Springside Chestnut Hill's varsity roster.

Emily McNesby, a former high school soccer teammate of Davis's who now plays at Maryland, said, ""She's not one of these people who's like, 'I'm already famous so I don't have to work hard.' She always picked up everyone's mood. She brought a happy spirit to the team.""

In an age of specialization, Davis has followed her own path, playing as many sports as she can squeeze into her calendar. She has won state championships in soccer and softball among Pennsylvania's independent high schools. And she continues to pitch in the summers, throwing from a major league distance of 60 feet 6 inches.

In 2017, her Philadelphia team, which included seven members of the Little League World Series squad, won a national competition called the Reviving Baseball in Inner Cities World Series.

Davis pitched nine and a third innings in the tournament, allowing only two earned runs. She threw a gem in the semifinals, retiring eight of the first 12 batters she faced, spotting her fastball at a speed in the mid-70s and sprinkling her curve and changeup to keep hitters off balance.

""I go more for command of my pitches now than overpowering people,"" the 5-foot-5 Davis said. ""I know that's not going to work.""

She has lived her sports career in reverse, appearing on the cover of Sports Illustrated and pitching before a television audience of millions before eighth grade, then adjusting to becoming a high school athlete in much less visible circumstances.

During the Little League World Series, Davis pulled a hoodie tight over her head one night to be able to walk anonymously around the ballpark in Williamsport, Pa. Otherwise, she needed security and a golf cart to get around, such was the crush of interest.

Four months later, her pioneering effort was celebrated by the Obamas, who invited her to the White House. She said she was inspired by their counsel: ""You changed the sports world. Keep going. Don't let anyone stop you.""

At times, though, Davis said, the attention became overwhelming. (""I was a kid; I wasn't prepared for this."") Now, she gets requests for the occasional autograph and photograph but no longer plays in a spotlight that was both illuminating and claustrophobic.

She is expansive and funny during interviews and plans to major in communications at Hampton, hoping to become a motivational speaker for children and to host her own television sports show.

Around friends, she is known simply as Mo, and she demurs when they teasingly call her ""Big Time"" and ""Superstar.""

""She's a novelty in the white community, a celebrity you want to take a picture with, but in the black community, she's more of a cultural icon,"" said Steve Bandura, 57, Davis's longtime rec-center coach and mentor, who is white. ""Little League baseball is a white suburban sport. Mo'ne is an African-American girl. She crossed every barrier.""

It was Bandura's idea for the 2015 tour of civil rights landmarks. Years ago, he gave up a sales and marketing career to work with disadvantaged youth. In 1995, at the Marian Anderson Recreation Center, in South Philadelphia, he formed a youth sports development organization called the Anderson Monarchs -- named after the celebrated African-American singer and the famed Negro League baseball team, the Kansas City Monarchs.

To understand the present, Bandura told Davis and her teammates, they must understand the past. So the Monarchs departed in June 2015 on a 23-day tour of playing games and gaining a firsthand appreciation of the courage and struggle of black history in America.

They traveled in a 1947 Flxible Clipper bus, signifying the year that Jackie Robinson broke the color barrier in Major League Baseball.

On June 24, Davis's 14th birthday, the Monarchs visited the 16th Street Baptist Church in Birmingham. In 1963, four black girls -- three of them age 14 -- were killed at the church in a bombing by white supremacists.

""We walked past where the bomb was placed; I still don't have words for it,"" Davis said. ""What could those girls have done in their lives? They could have changed the world.""

In Selma, after the Monarchs walked across the Edmund Pettus Bridge and saw murals and artifacts that included a hooded Klan outfit, Davis and her stepfather consoled a white teammate, Carter Davis, who said he grew emotional and began expressing guilt about the historical outrages committed against blacks.

""He was 13 at the time; he was torn apart,"" Mo'ne Davis said. She and her stepfather, Mark Williams, invited Carter Davis to stay with them that night and played the card game Uno to lighten the mood.

""They were like, 'You're one of us, you're not at fault, you shouldn't feel bad,'"" Carter Davis said.

The most unnerving moment of the trip for her, Mo'ne Davis said, came at the Center for Civil and Human Rights in Atlanta. An exhibit there provided a stark simulation of a lunch counter sit-in, with visitors feeling jostled and hearing threats and the sounds of objects being thrown and broken.

""I couldn't sit through the whole thing,"" Davis said. ""I got up and thought I was going to cry. It scared me so bad.""

The trip, she said, made her realize that ""being African-American, not everything is going to be the same as it is for my friend who is white."" But it also left her thankful ""for all the people who fought for the freedom we now have.""

Next fall, Davis will head off to college to study and play softball. She looks forward to playing in the infield and getting a chance to bat. But she does not plan to pitch. The whipping motion of pitching a softball underhand is nothing like throwing a baseball overhand.

She laughed. ""I know the mechanics,"" she said, ""but for some reason the ball just doesn't reach home plate."""
10,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/01/technology/artificial-intelligence-export-restrictions.html,"SAN FRANCISCO -- A common belief among tech industry insiders is that Silicon Valley has dominated the internet because much of the worldwide network was designed and built by Americans.

Now a growing number of those insiders are worried that proposed export restrictions could short-circuit the pre-eminence of American companies in the next big thing to hit their industry, artificial intelligence.

In November, the Commerce Department released a list of technologies, including artificial intelligence, that are under consideration for new export rules because of their importance to national security.

Technology experts worry that blocking the export of A.I. to other countries, or tying it up in red tape, will help A.I. industries flourish in those nations -- China, in particular -- and compete with American companies.

""The number of cases where exports can be sufficiently controlled are very, very, very small, and the chance of making an error is quite large,"" said Jack Clark, head of policy at OpenAI, an artificial intelligence lab in San Francisco. ""If this goes wrong, it could do real damage to the A.I. community.""

The export controls are being considered as the United States and China engage in a trade war. The Trump administration has been critical of the way China negotiates deals with American companies, often requiring the transfer of technology to Chinese partners as the cost of doing business in the country. And federal officials are making an aggressive argument that China has stolen American technology through hacking and industrial espionage.

Tech companies, academics and policymakers are calling on the Commerce Department to take a light hand with A.I. export rules ahead of a Jan. 10 deadline for public comment. Their argument has three main points: Restrictions could harm companies in the United States and help international competitors. They could stifle technology improvements. And they may not make much of a difference.

In August, Congress passed the Export Controls Act of 2018, which added export restrictions to ""emerging and foundational technologies."" In mid-November, the Commerce Department, tasked with overseeing the restrictions, published a list of technologies for consideration, including several categories of A.I. like computer vision, speech recognition and natural language understanding.

The restrictions would affect the export of technology to certain countries. Though it does not specify which ones, the Commerce Department proposal points to countries that have faced trade and arms embargoes in the past. Those include China, Russia and Iran.

The Commerce Department declined to comment on the proposed restrictions. After taking public comments, the department will draft a formal plan. It could result in anything from new licensing rules for A.I. exports to outright bans.

Artificial intelligence could be as vital to the tech industry as the World Wide Web was 25 years ago.

It is easy to forget that before the mid-1990s, the tech industry in the United States was in a slump and the consumer electronics giants of Japan looked unbeatable. That changed as Silicon Valley companies popularized innovations like the web browser and e-commerce. Today, the likes of Google, Apple and Facebook dominate tech all over the world.

But American dominion in artificial intelligence is far from guaranteed. China is investing billions in A.I. for both commercial and military use. And the expertise that has flooded to Silicon Valley over the years is starting to stay home, partly because of immigration restrictions. Centers for A.I. research are popping up all over the world, from Toronto to Cambridge, England, and Beijing.

Enforcing export controls on artificial intelligence would present an unusual challenge for regulators.

A.I. is something policymakers call a dual-use technology. It has innocuous commercial applications, like helping to steer your car or ask your phone a question. It also has important military uses, like helping a weaponized drone find its targets.

Defense planners believe A.I. represents the next notable change in military weapons, akin to the tactical targeting of so-called smart bombs a generation ago or nuclear weapons before that. A.I. can also aid surveillance systems and even disinformation campaigns through software that can produce fake photos and videos.

But ""trying to draw a line between what is military and what is commercial is exceedingly difficult,"" said R. David Edelman, a technology policy researcher at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. ""It may be impossible.""

It is difficult to put a ""made in America"" label on artificial intelligence. Research on the technology is often done collaboratively by scientists and engineers all over the world.

Companies rarely hold on to the details of their A.I. work, as if it were a secret recipe. Instead, they share what they learn, in hopes that other researchers can build on it. One company's ""breakthrough"" is often the latest iteration of what many researchers at private companies and universities have been working on.

A lot of the computer code for A.I. is published on sites like Arxiv.org, a repository of academic and corporate research. So, many policy experts believe that if the United States restricts the export of A.I. products and services, it will have little effect on the progress of A.I. in China and other countries.

""The core of these technologies is international and freely available,"" said Mr. Edelman, who was a special assistant for economic and technology policy under President Barack Obama. ""No country -- the U.S. or China -- has a monopoly on that.""

Federal regulations exempt publicly available information from export control. That means that the government is unlikely to bar companies and universities from publishing fundamental A.I. research. But it could establish controls that restrict foreign access to that information, said Greg Jaeger, a lawyer at the law firm Stroock & Stroock & Lavan who deals with export controls.

The Commerce Department could also restrict the export of cloud-computing technology and computer chips related to artificial intelligence. The export restrictions memo mentions both.

Amazon and Microsoft already operate cloud computing businesses in China through local partners, and Google has long hoped to do the same thing. Amazon, Google and Microsoft declined to comment.

Overly restrictive rules that prevent foreign nationals from working on certain technologies in the United States could also push researchers and companies into other countries.

""It might be easier for people to just do this stuff in Europe,"" said Jason Waite, a lawyer with the firm Alston & Bird who specializes in international trade."
11,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/19/opinion/trump-syria-islamic-state.html,"Mr. Geltzer and Mr. Costa served as senior directors for counterterrorism under President Trump and President Obama.

The United States is at risk of another ""Mission Accomplished"" moment. On Wednesday, President Trump declared by tweet, ""We have defeated ISIS in Syria, my only reason for being there during the Trump presidency."" President Trump is right that the United States has made tremendous progress against the Islamic State, and we've been honored to support that mission from the White House across two administrations as senior counterterrorism officials. But the Islamic State has not been ""defeated"" -- and our mission in Syria has not been fully accomplished.

The recent Christmas market terrorist attack in Strasbourg that left five dead and at least a dozen injured serves as an all-too-vivid reminder that the threat posed by the Islamic State persists. With the attacker dead, the Islamic State has now claimed the attack as its own. Thankfully, these types of jihadist terrorist attacks in the West have become notably rarer and smaller in scale than they were even just three years ago, when horrific attacks in Paris and San Bernardino, Calif., cast a pall over the 2015 holiday season.

There's been remarkable progress against the Islamic State in those three years, but perhaps the hardest part is yet to come: addressing the remnants of the group's core in Iraq and Syria. Indeed, for all of the counterterrorism successes the United States has achieved since Sept. 11 -- and there have been many -- we've yet to figure out fully how to turn the corner from degrading groups like Al Qaeda and the Islamic State to actually defeating them.

Failing to do so can prove deadly: It was, after all, the seemingly dying embers of Al Qaeda in Iraq that rose from the ashes to become the Islamic State and control a territory the size of Britain. Ultimately, it's vital to remember that groups like the Islamic State and Al Qaeda think of themselves as sublime movements, and thus their ideologues are convinced that they went to war to fulfill divine obligations, making setbacks merely temporary -- with remnants sure to carry on the fight.

So, as we look to 2019, it's important to stay focused on landing a body blow against the Islamic State's remnants in Iraq and Syria. That includes eradicating the last vestiges of the group's network of fighters, supporting resurgent governance in the areas the group once held, developing sustainable intelligence sources and law enforcement options for the group's terrorist network, and increasing the pressure against the group in what remains a virtual safe haven: the internet.

Defeating the Islamic State, at least in Iraq and Syria, begins with eradicating the group's remaining fighters. (Its fighters elsewhere, such as in Libya and West Africa, will pose a considerable challenge for the foreseeable future, even as important American counterterrorism efforts against them continue.) Finding and targeting the Islamic State's fighters is a considerable challenge, as they've largely been driven into an area of Syria where United States intelligence collection may have fewer inroads, where our main partners on the ground -- the Syrian Kurds -- have chosen not to follow, and where some local refuge may be available.

The areas successfully cleared of the Islamic State demand continued attention, too. It's the absence and inadequacies of local governance that often allow terrorists to carve out a foothold in the first place; and the deadly civil war consuming Syria threatens to leave large swaths of the country effectively ungoverned. Working with international partners to provide the resources, training and diplomatic support needed for at least a bare minimum of governance to take root -- a Sunni alternative to the horrific brand of governance offered by the Islamic State -- is an urgent priority not just for counterterrorism but also for humanitarian reasons. And cutting such resources at this juncture is a dangerous recipe for a resurgent terrorist threat that plays into the Islamic State's own narratives that only it is capable of governing, as the group indeed tried to do for a time.

The Islamic State has already adapted to its shrinking territorial control by putting in place an underground network that, from the shadows, can inflict destabilizing violence in Syria and Iraq, and potentially throughout the region. This is the same retreat from terrorist insurgency to terrorist network that we saw from Al Qaeda in Iraq; and it demands building U.S., Iraqi, and other partners' intelligence capabilities to penetrate this network by disrupting its attacks, seizing funds, and detaining those sustaining the network.

Even with diminished territorial holdings, the Islamic State will still be able to radicalize and mobilize followers so long as the group retains a virtual safe haven online. Leading technology companies have stepped up their efforts to contest terrorists' presence on their platforms, but terrorist groups have adapted, altering their content and regenerating accounts in ways that challenge the companies' approaches and that connect with would-be followers just long enough to shift those followers into end-to-end encrypted chats to avoid detection. The United States must lead the way by sharing, to the maximum extent classification permits, the latest information on terrorist trends and tactics online with companies so they can use new and emerging tools to contest terrorists' online foothold.

Stripping the Islamic State of territory and even fighters is not the same as achieving the group's defeat. Forced from one redoubt, it will reappear in other territories, potentially even in less detectable -- but more lethal -- forms. It's not the time to end the mission, lest we soon find ourselves facing a resurgent adversary.

AN UNLIKELY JOURNEY

Waking Up From My American Dream

By Julián Castro

225 pp. Little, Brown & Company. $30.

Julián Castro's story, as he tells it, began in 1922, when his grandmother Victoriana, known to him as Mamo, crossed over the Mexico-United States border as a little girl and planted herself in this country. Mamo and her sister, María, were orphaned during the Mexican Revolution and distant relatives in San Antonio took them in. Mamo had one child, Castro's mother, Rosie, who was the first in her family to go to college and became a civil rights activist. Later, Castro and his twin brother, Joaquín, would tread almost identical paths: from public schools in San Antonio to Stanford University, then from Harvard Law School into politics. Julián eventually served as Barack Obama's secretary of housing and urban development. (Joaquín represents Texas' 20th District in Congress.)

Castro's memoir, ""An Unlikely Journey: Waking Up From My American Dream,"" traces this arc, a part of which he first shared in a 2012 Democratic National Convention speech that put him on the public's radar. Last week, he announced that he was exploring a bid for the presidency in 2020. So far, he is the only potential Latino contender.

There is much more to Mamo's story than Castro could reasonably share in speeches. Her guardians pulled her out of school in the third grade so she could help out at home, and she entered the work force soon after. She suffered from diabetes and depression, and even attempted suicide once. Mamo ""was a constant"" in Castro's life, his caregiver while his mother worked. He describes the emergence of his mother's political activism, as well. Growing up in the 1950s and '60s, she was ""aware of the different levels of racism in society and felt the subtle social pressure of the times holding her back."" In college, she formed a Young Democrats club and continued doing social advocacy work after she graduated.

Castro's own life was more privileged, though certainly not gilded. His mother made sure he and his brother got a quality education. They played tennis and excelled at academics, graduating a year early from high school. Castro shares stories of the childhood competitiveness and physical fights that marked his relationship with his brother. His own political awakening came later, in college, when he began to see the inequity in students' paths to Stanford and started going by Julián instead of Julian. The second half of the book takes the reader through his postgraduation journey, studying at Harvard Law, running for City Council and mayor of San Antonio and, finally, being appointed to Obama's cabinet in 2014.

There are many interesting threads in Castro's book, but little in the way of introspection. In the first half, especially, which covers his childhood, many anecdotes seem presented for dramatic effect, and their purpose in the larger story never becomes clear. For instance, a single paragraph is dedicated to describing a relationship with a favorite teacher who was later accused of indecency with a child. Other traumas are stepped over just as quickly and without much insight. His mother seemed to struggle with alcohol, but is ""somehow able to give that up for her kids."" When his parents separate, Castro writes that he, his brother and his mom were ""about to become Dad's second 'other' family,"" but never reckons with the effect of this dynamic.

Castro is a third-generation Mexican-American, and it's significant that the story he tells here does not begin in Mexico, where Mamo was born, but at the moment of her crossing. He emphasizes that it is ""because of that long, dusty walk into the United States in 1922"" that he and his brother attended Stanford. He calls his college acceptance ""a collective victory, a family achievement,"" but one gets the sense that Castro is deliberately telling a very American story, placing himself squarely within this country's history and, specifically, its struggles with inequality.

His campaign's central promise is equal education for all -- his own access to quality schooling transformed his life. Yet as he writes in the latter part of his book: ""I used to think that if everyone worked hard things would work out O.K. for them. But that wasn't true anymore."" How he resolves his vision of education as an equalizer with barriers like structural racism remains unclear. He acknowledges some of his own advantages, among them a supportive mother who graduated from college, but as in the rest of the book, he stops short of confronting root issues. As such, Castro's memoir raises more questions than answers. Does he embrace a minority and immigrant identity, or hope to ""transcend"" it in favor of something more vaguely universal? Does a presidential story need to start in America to be valid? And most important, has he truly woken up from the American dream of meritocracy?"
13,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/20/briefing/syria-federal-reserve-gatwick-airport.html,"Good morning,

We start with the U.S. withdrawal from Syria, what rising interest rates mean for you, and the Senate vote to avert a government shutdown.

President Trump orders a full withdrawal from Syria

In announcing the return of 2,000 American troops, the president brought a sudden end to the U.S. military campaign in Syria, declaring that it had ""defeated ISIS"" there.

The decision, announced on Wednesday over the objections of Mr. Trump's military and civilian advisers, fulfills the president's frequently expressed desire to bring troops home. But it also cedes control of Syria to Russia and Iran, and it abandons America's Kurdish allies.

News analysis: Mr. Trump doesn't believe that U.S. forces can alter the strategic balance in the Middle East, a view shared by his immediate predecessor, Barack Obama, our national security correspondent writes.

From Opinion: ""The Islamic State has not been 'defeated' -- and our mission in Syria has not been fully accomplished,"" two counterterrorism officials in the Trump and Obama administrations write.

Congress moves to avert a shutdown

Senators approved a spending bill Wednesday night that would keep the government funded through Feb. 8 and leave the question of funding President Trump's southern border wall for the new year.

The bill is expected to pass the House today and to be sent to Mr. Trump before the deadline of midnight Friday. It was unclear, however, if the president would sign the measure, which doesn't include the $5 billion he has demanded for a wall.

If you missed it: In a farewell speech to Congress on Wednesday, Speaker Paul Ryan said that politics in America is ""broken."" A former rising star in the Republican Party, Mr. Ryan oversaw the enactment of a tax overhaul that many welcomed but that has also contributed to a growing federal deficit.

Fed raises interest rates, saying the economy is healthy

The Federal Reserve raised its benchmark interest rate for the fifth consecutive quarter on Wednesday, as expected, emphasizing continued economic growth.

The benchmark rate will now sit in a range of 2.25 percent to 2.5 percent, near the lower end of what the central bank considers the neutral zone, in which rates neither stimulate nor restrain the economy.

President Trump has repeatedly urged the central bank to keep rates low.

Watch: The Fed's chairman, Jerome Powell, said political considerations played ""no role"" in the decision.

For you: Rising interest rates affect both savers and spenders.

A list of accused priests omitted names, Illinois says

The Roman Catholic Church in the state withheld the names of at least 500 priests who were accused of the sexual abuse of minors, Illinois' attorney general said on Wednesday in a report that also accused the church of neglecting to investigate victims' allegations.

The report by Attorney General Lisa Madigan said 690 priests had been accused of abuse, but only 185 names were made public.

Why it matters: The report is the latest effort by state prosecutors to hold the Catholic Church accountable. At least 16 states have opened investigations since August, after a grand jury report in Pennsylvania accused more than 300 priests of sexual abuse over 50 years.

Yesterday: Pope Francis accepted the resignation of an auxiliary bishop of Los Angeles accused of sexual misconduct with a minor.

Relief for Russian oligarch: The Trump administration plans to lift sanctions against the business empire of Oleg Deripaska, one of Russia's most influential businessmen, after lobbying by his companies.

And now for the Back Story on ...When Christmas went electric

Clare Macdonald, a reader from Keene, N.H., asked us when electric lights were first used on a Christmas tree.

It was in 1882, just three years after Thomas Edison filed a patent for his light bulb. The tree became a fixture in the experiment-filled home of an executive at his company.

Eighty walnut-size red, white and blue bulbs covered the tree, which sat on a revolving box. A newspaper article described it: ""As the tree turned, the colors alternated, all the lamps going out and being relit at every revolution. The result was a continuous twinkling of dancing colors, red, white, blue, white, red, blue, all evening.""

President Grover Cleveland popularized electric Christmas lights in the 1890s by installing them on the White House tree.

But it wasn't until (relatively) inexpensive strings of Christmas lights became available a few years later that the tradition really caught on.

That's it for Thursday's briefing. If, like Clare, you have an idea for a Back Story, email us. We prefer light(ish) subjects that can be described succinctly.

See you next time.

14,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/20/opinion/trump-race-immigration-democrats.html,"Mr. Edsall contributes a weekly column from Washington, D.C. on politics, demographics and inequality.

For 50 years Republicans have battered the Democratic coalition, wielding the so-called southern strategy -- built on racism and overlaid with opposition to immigration -- to win control of the White House and one or both chambers of Congress.

At the same time, Democrats have struggled to piece together a coalition strong enough to deliver an Election Day majority. In the 1950s, the Democratic coalition was 87 percent white and 13 percent minority, according to the American National Election Studies; it is now 59 percent white and 41 percent minority, according to Pew Research.

As the Democratic Party has evolved from an overwhelmingly white party to a party with a huge minority base, the dominant strategic problem has become the tenuous balance between the priorities of its now equally indispensable white and minority wings.

President Trump has aggressively exploited Democratic vulnerabilities as no previous Republican candidate had dared to do. The frontal attack Trump has engineered -- in part by stigmatizing ""political correctness"" -- has had a dual effect, throwing Democrats back on their heels while simultaneously whetting their appetite for a fight.

For Democrats to counter Trump effectively, a number of scholars believe it is essential to understand the motivations -- the needs, beliefs and agendas -- of those whites who have moved into the Trump camp. Only armed with that information, the way these scholars see it, can the left recapture enough of those voters to regain majority status on a more permanent basis, both in its battles for Congress and for the White House.

In her forthcoming book, ""White Identity Politics,"" Ashley Jardina, a political scientist at Duke, describes three groups of whites who generally fall on the right side of the political spectrum.

The first is made up of those for whom their white ""identity is extremely or very important"" to them. Surveys taken from 2012 to 2016, according to Jardina, show that the percentage of whites who say their white identity is very or extremely important ranges from 28 to 42 percent.

According to Jardina, ""higher levels of white identity are somewhat linked to higher levels of racial animosity."" At the same time, she contends in her book:

A small percentage of white identifiers score quite high on measures of racial prejudice or resentment, but many more white identifiers possess average and even low levels of racial prejudice. In other words, white identity is not defined by racial animus, and whites who identify with their racial group are not simply reducible to bigots.

The second group comprises those who rank high on a test of ""white consciousness."" The difference between white identity and white consciousness, Jardina argues, is that those in the latter category believe that ""many whites are unable to find jobs because employers are hiring minorities."" Jardina reports that they also stress ""the importance of whites working together to change laws that are unfair to whites.""

The third constituency is made up of whites high in ""racial resentment.""

This is based, Jardina writes, on

responses to four survey items, with response options ranging from strongly agree to strongly disagree for each. The survey items ask respondents if they agree/disagree that (1) blacks should work their way up without any special favors; (2) generations of slavery and discrimination make it difficult for blacks to work their way out of the lower class; (3) blacks have gotten less than they deserve; (4) blacks must try harder to get ahead. The index is scaled to range from 0 (least resentful) to 1 (most resentful).

On average, the level of racial resentment among whites is high, Jardina found: ""Among all whites in the 2012 ANES face-to-face study, the mean level of racial resentment is 0.68 on a zero to one scale.""

Jardina argues in her book that the racial resentment scale reveals a

new type of racial prejudice -- one that is a subtle combination of anti-black affect and the belief that blacks do not adhere to traditional American values associated with the Protestant work ethic.

Racial resentment

predicts whites' opinions toward a wide range of racialized political policies and has a profound impact on political candidate evaluations. It is, quite clearly, a central component to the way in which whites interpret the political and social world.

There is an ongoing dispute over the use of such questions to measure racial resentment. Jardina acknowledges that ""some scholars are critical of this framework"" and ""argue that racial resentment entangles conservative principles, like individualism, with racial prejudice.""

Most recently, Riley Carney and Ryan Enos, political scientists at Harvard, have sought to assess the validity of racial resentment questions in their working paper, ""Conservatism and Fairness in Contemporary Politics: Unpacking the Psychological Underpinnings of Modern Racism.""

In survey experiments, Carney and Enos substituted Lithuanians and other nationalities for African-Americans so that the first resentment question would ask for agreement or disagreement with the statement: ""Lithuanians should work their way up without any special favors."" Their conclusion:

The results obtained using groups other than blacks are substantively indistinguishable from those measured when blacks are the target group. Decomposing this measure further, we find that political conservatives express only minor differences in resentment across target groups. Far greater differences in resentment toward blacks and other groups can be found among racially sympathetic liberals. In short, we find that modern racism questions appear to measure attitudes toward any group, rather than African-Americans alone.

Carney and Enos conclude that the ""modern racism scales"" fail to

capture attitudes specific to African-Americans. However, the scales do capture a form of racism, both a general resentment that applies to many groups and a specific failure to recognize the unique historical plight of African-Americans.

Jardina, whose work I have written about before, agrees that ""some of this backlash"" -- including the election of Donald Trump and the opposition to immigration -- ""is rooted in prejudice, racism, and ethnocentrism.""

But, she adds,

many whites' reactions to our country's changing racial landscape do not simply manifest in outward hostility. Amidst these changes, many whites have described themselves as outnumbered, disadvantaged, and even oppressed. They have voiced their anxiety over America's waning numerical majority, and have questioned what this means for the future of the nation. They have worried that soon they may face discrimination based on their own race, if they do not already.

Such fears, in Jardina's view, drive the emergence of white identity as a political issue:

These threats, both real and perceived, have, as I will demonstrate, brought to the fore, for many whites, a sense of commonality, attachment, and solidarity with their racial group. They have led a sizable proportion of whites to believe that their racial group, and the benefits that group enjoys, are endangered.

The result?

This racial solidarity now plays a central role in the way many whites orient themselves to the political and social world.

Central to Jardina's argument is the contention that some whites ""identify with their racial group without feeling prejudice toward racial and ethnic minorities,"" while others do ""possess some degree of negative affect toward racial and ethnic minorities without also identifying with their racial group.""

For example, in the case of support or opposition to domestic spending programs, she writes, ""Higher levels of white identity and consciousness are actually associated with greater support for spending."" By comparison, she continued, ""racial resentment is associated with support for decreasing spending on all groups, including whites.""

This finding leads, in turn, to another Jardina assertion:

Many whites are not motivated to oppose immigration because they dislike Latinos. They are also not inclined to support Donald Trump because they feel negatively about people of color in the United States.

Rather, Jardina puts forward the argument that

these whites feel, to some extent, that the rug is being pulled out from under them -- that the benefits they have enjoyed because of their race, their groups' advantages, and their status atop the racial hierarchy are all in jeopardy.

Put another way, she makes the case that

white identity is not synonymous with racial prejudice. White racial solidarity provides a lens through which whites interpret the political and social world that is inward looking.

According to Jardina, whites, to a certain extent, are deliberately claiming victimhood:

White identifiers have co-opted the language of racial discrimination and oppression. Put bluntly, the politics of white identity is marked by an insidious illusion, one in which whites claim their group experiences discrimination in an effort to reinforce and maintain a system of racial inequality where whites are the dominant group with the lion's share of power and privileges.

Because for many whites ""identifying with their group and protecting its status hardly seems problematic, especially compared to racism,"" it's difficult to ""convince some whites that there's something normatively objectionable about identifying with one's racial group and wanting to protect its interests.""

Eric Kaufmann, in his forthcoming book ""Whiteshift: Populism, Immigration, and the Future of White Majorities,"" addresses similar racial and ethnic tensions. Kaufmann writes:

As the urban West gets more diverse, the finger increasingly points to the white majority as the engine of segregation. White majorities are retreating towards places where they are relatively concentrated.

Kaufmann, a political scientist at the University of London, argues provocatively in an email that a strategic shift to compromise on the most divisive issues, including immigration, could work to Democrats' advantage:

The right's problem in America is more its doctrinaire tax-cutting, suspicion of government and international institutions. If the left didn't give it so much domestic cultural ammunition, the right would face defeat and have to adjust.

Kaufmann argues that there is a structural dilemma posed by the multiracial nature of the left coalition: he views what he calls ""the institutionalization of multiculturalism/diversity/equity"" and of ""high immigration"" as fueling the rightward direction of recent political movements in the United States and Europe. He believes that it would benefit progressive groups, ""in the interests of harmony,"" for liberals to ""argue their case for diversity"" but that they should ""tolerate difference of opinion and accept compromise.""

Kaufmann's strategic approach and suggestions run counter to the thinking of many others.

In an essay published in Time in September, ""Don't Let the Loud Bigots Distract You. America's Real Problem With Race Cuts Far Deeper,"" Eddie S. Glaude, Jr., a professor of religion and African-American studies at Princeton, argued that the media and many political analysts reached the wrong conclusion after the 2016 election by claiming:

that more attention needed to be given to the dire circumstances of working white men and women, that Trump's election was a white, working-class, often rural backlash and what was needed was a focus on Middle America. This criticism coalesced with an ongoing obsession about what suburban white America was thinking.

It felt, Glaude wrote, ""like folks weren't fighting the true problem. They were, in fact, protecting it.""

Lynn Vavreck -- a political scientist at U.C.L.A. and one of the authors of one of the most influential books on the 2016 election, ""Identity Crisis: The 2016 Presidential Campaign and the Battle for the Meaning of America"" -- is also looking at the recent rightward drift in the United States. She believes that developments in contemporary politics are not in any sense racially neutral but instead amount to ""hostility or fear of outgroups.""

One of the key attitudes revealed in survey data linked to support for Trump has been the ""fear of losing your job to a minority,"" Vavreck wrote me by email. In addition, 64 percent of Trump voters believed that ""average Americans"" have gotten ""less than they deserve"" but ""only 12 percent said black Americans have gotten less than they deserve.""

Vavreck argues

that whatever identity exists at present among whites as a group is largely based on ideas about deservingness, and centers on outgroups getting too much or taking too much that is not due to them.

Lawrence Bobo, the W.E.B. Du Bois professor of social science at Harvard, is also far from agreeing that more accommodation should be granted to the white working class, arguing that intractable racism, in one form or another, continues to pervade American politics.

In a 2017 paper, ""Racism in Trump's America: Reflections on Culture, Sociology, and the 2016 US Presidential Election,"" he suggests that contemporary racial conflict can be described as ""laissez-faire racism.""

Laissez-faire racism, he argues,

identifies this new era as one where longstanding values of meritocracy, individualism, majority rule and competition in a free marketplace weave together as rationalization for persistent racial inequality in a putatively anti-discrimination, race-neutral democratic state.

In a 2018 paper, ""Immigration and Redistribution,"" Alberto Alesina, Armando Miano and Stefanie Stantcheva, who are all economists at Harvard, point to the costs of ignoring majority opinion on public policy matters that affect redistribution -- policies that arguably have a disproportionate ethnic or racial impact. The three authors found that merely prompting ""respondents to think about immigration and immigrants' characteristics generates a significant negative effect on support for redistribution.""

They surveyed 22,500 people in France, Germany, Italy, Sweden, Britain and the United States and found that

respondents greatly overestimate the total number of immigrants, think immigrants are culturally and religiously more distant from them, and are economically weaker -- less educated, more unemployed, poorer, and more reliant on government transfers -- than is the case.

When shown more accurate -- and more positive -- information about the hard work performed by immigrants, respondents ""become significantly more favorable to redistribution."" But that did not last long:

If respondents are also first prompted to think in detail about immigrants' number and composition, then none of the favorable information treatments is able to compensate for the negative priors that resurface and that lower support for redistribution.

In other words, pro-immigration, pro-diversity Democrats face clear obstacles breaking the Republican hold on white voters -- and a challenge in repelling Trump's race-and-immigration-focused offensive. Still, the accumulating insights on how and where Republicans have successfully worked these levers may help demonstrate -- as President Barack Obama, President Bill Clinton and the results of this year's midterm elections prove -- that these obstacles are not insuperable and that they can be overcome.

15,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/20/world/middleeast/egypt-democracy-groups-acquittal.html,"CAIRO -- An Egyptian court acquitted 41 American, European and Egyptian employees of groups that promoted democracy and media freedom on Thursday, bringing an end to a seven-year case that was a thorn in relations with the United States and had become emblematic of the official backlash against civil society following the Arab Spring protests of 2011.

The defendants were convicted in 2013 on administrative charges relating to financing and official permits that nonetheless carried a criminal penalty. Some received sentences of five years, angering the government in Washington and becoming a source of tension with both the Obama and Trump administrations. Among the groups affected were the National Democratic Institute, the International Republican Institute and the Konrad Adenauer Foundation, a German organization.

Many of those convicted were sentenced in absentia after fleeing Egypt. None served any jail time. But the case underscored official Egyptian sensitivity, and what many viewed as paranoia, about the role of foreign organizations at a delicate moment following the upheaval of the Arab Spring.

""After six years of interrogations, court cases, cages, lawyers, and looking over my shoulder I can finally say: it's over,"" Hafsa Halawa, one of those acquitted, wrote on Twitter.

Lawyers for the defendants said that 41 of the 43 people convicted in the case were acquitted on Thursday. The other two names appeared to have been overlooked, they said.

The acquittal drew attention to the wider crackdown on civil society in Egypt under President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, who has imprisoned journalists and rights activists, muzzled the free press, and introduced harsh laws regulating nongovernmental organizations.

On Wednesday a Cairo court ordered the release of Amal Fathy, an actor and former activist who was jailed for two years in September after she spoke on Facebook about her experience of sexual harassment in Egypt. Her husband, Mohamed Lotfy, said Thursday that she was expected to be released in coming days.

The crackdown stems from the events of 2011, when the wave of street protests that ousted President Hosni Mubarak was soon followed by restrictions on civil society. The prosecution late in that year of the American and European democracy groups, as well as the International Center for Journalists, was an early sign of the backlash.

Among those charged was Sam LaHood, son of Ray LaHood, the United States transportation secretary at the time, who worked with the Republican Institute and was briefly barred from leaving Egypt in early 2012. The 43 rights workers were convicted on charges that included operating without a permit and using illegal foreign funds, and were given sentences of up to five years' imprisonment in June 2013.

By then, many of the accused had already fled Egypt, and the case became a source of tension between Washington and Cairo.

Senator John McCain, Republican of Arizona, who died in August, campaigned vociferously to have the verdict overturned. The case resurfaced in August 2017 when Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson froze $290 million in aid to Egypt, citing a range of concerns that included rights abuses and the crackdown on civil society.

Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany also exerted pressure on Mr. Sisi as part an effort to lift a ban on the Konrad Adenauer Foundation in Egypt.

In December 2017, four months after American aid was suspended, an Egyptian court reopened Case 173, as it is officially known, and in April it was referred to a retrial. Welcoming Thursday's verdict, Sam LaHood said he hoped it would be ""the first step reversing the damage done by Case 173 to Egypt and her great people."""
16,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/27/us/politics/trump-syria-afghanistan-withdraw.html,"WASHINGTON -- President Trump managed to do something remarkable with his abrupt order last week to withdraw all American troops from Syria and half from Afghanistan: unite the left and right against a plan to extract the United States from two long, costly and increasingly futile conflicts.

So chaotic was Mr. Trump's decision-making process; so transparent his appeal to his political base; and so lacking in a cogent explanation to allies or the public that the president's move short-circuited a much-needed national debate about the future of America's wars.

The case for pulling out, military analysts and diplomats said, is stronger in Afghanistan than in Syria, where the United States is abandoning its Kurdish allies, leaving a vacuum that could allow the Islamic State to regroup, and ceding a strategically vital country to Iran and Russia.

Yet even in Afghanistan, where American troops have fought a pitched battle for 17 years, those who believe the United States should get out are not speaking up. With the exception of a few vocal isolationists like Senator Rand Paul, the Kentucky Republican, Mr. Trump's handling of the issue has been condemned across the ideological spectrum.

Mr. Trump issued the order to withdraw over the objections of military and civilian leaders, precipitating the resignations of Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and the special envoy to the coalition fighting the Islamic State, Brett H. McGurk.

On a visit to the troops in Iraq on Wednesday, his first as president, Mr. Trump insisted that people ""are going to come around to my way of thinking."" And he boasted of denying requests by United States military officials to remain in Syria for an additional six months to help defeat the Islamic State, saying American troops had been there long enough.

But the president's crude defense of the decision -- ""we're no longer the suckers, folks,"" he told the troops at an air base in Iraq -- seemed unlikely to provoke a serious debate over difficult questions like how best to combat terrorist threats in distant lands or the proper limits of America's role as a global guarantor of security.

""I hate to ever feel like I'm in the company of neocons, and I'm no proponent of a forever war in Afghanistan, but pulling troops out in this way is completely irresponsible and nonstrategic,"" said Daniel F. Feldman, who served as special representative to Afghanistan and Pakistan when President Barack Obama ordered a troop drawdown.

Some analysts said they believed Mr. Trump's orders would not even be carried out -- at least not on the 30-day timetable he imposed for Syria. The Pentagon has slow-walked his orders before, and already there is talk of a more gradual withdrawal given the complications that would probably arise from a hasty pullout.

Some former Trump advisers attributed the sudden nature of the announcement to Mr. Trump's frustration with generals who resisted him at every turn when he tried to set a timetable for getting out of Syria and Afghanistan -- something, his supporters point out, that he had promised to do during the 2016 campaign.

""The apparatus slow-rolled him until he just said enough and did it himself,"" said Stephen K. Bannon, who clashed with the generals over Afghanistan when he served as the president's chief strategist in 2017. ""Not pretty, but at least done.""

Mr. Trump, he said, wanted to end these military campaigns so he could focus on the economic and geopolitical contest with China, which he views as America's biggest foreign threat. ""This is not about a return to isolationism,"" Mr. Bannon said. ""It's the pivot away from the humanitarian expeditionary mentality of the internationalists.""

While Mr. Trump's critics would shrink from that language, military analysts, former officials and diplomats acknowledge there is a case for withdrawing from both conflicts.

Open-ended but limited troop deployments are not likely to alter the battlefield in either Afghanistan, where the Taliban now holds more ground than at any other time since 2001, or in Syria, where the Islamic State's territorial grip has been broken and President Bashar al-Assad, with the help of Russia and Iran, has largely stymied the rebellion.

Announcing troop withdrawals will force the United States to rethink long-term military commitments that have little public support and are no longer effective. It could also force the Afghans and Syrians to confront their own deep-rooted problems, without the presence of foreign soldiers who often delay the day of reckoning.

""I, for one, think the decision to withdraw is sound and wise,"" Robert S. Ford, the last American ambassador to Syria.

Keeping 2,000 Special Operations troops in eastern Syria, Mr. Ford said, will not prevent Russia and Iran from exerting influence. It will not stabilize or rebuild the parts of the country once held by Islamic State fighters. And it will do little to end Syria's six-and-a-half-year civil war. The presence of American troops has not made Mr. Assad any more amenable to a settlement than he was before the campaign against the Islamic State began in 2014.

""Despite holding most of eastern Syria for two years, including the oil-fields, the U.S. and its Syrian allies have extracted exactly zero political concessions from Assad,"" said Mr. Ford, who now teaches at Yale and is a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute. ""Assad will wait us out.""

The situation is even starker in Afghanistan. Last month, a year after Mr. Trump grudgingly authorized the deployment of nearly 4,000 troops, bringing the total number there to 14,000, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., admitted that the Taliban ""are not losing.""

""If someone has a better idea than we have right now, which is to support the Afghans and put pressure on the terrorist groups in the region, I'm certainly open to dialogue on that,"" General Dunford said at a panel sponsored by The Washington Post earlier this month.

Mr. Trump has ordered the number of troops cut in half, to roughly 7,000, which could be the precursor to a full withdrawal. His decision contributed to the resignation of Mr. Mattis, who told the president he deserved someone whose ""views are better aligned with yours on these and other subjects.""

Mr. Trump's views, however, were hardly a mystery. ""It is time to get out of Afghanistan,"" he wrote on Twitter on Feb. 27, 2012, when he was already thinking about running for president. ""We are building roads and schools for people that hate us. It is not in our national interests.""

During a meeting in the Situation Room in July 2017, when Mr. Mattis and other advisers were pitching their plan to deploy more troops, an angry Mr. Trump lashed out. ""We're losing,"" he declared, according to a person in the room.

Those frustrations are widely held by NATO allies who have been America's partners in Afghanistan.

""It's been getting increasingly harder to explain to European publics why we need to stay there,"" said Tomas Valasek, a former NATO ambassador from Slovakia who is the director of Carnegie Europe. ""Perhaps Trump's tendency to disrupt things, including by withdrawing from Afghanistan, may not be such a bad idea after all.""

In Afghanistan, the inevitability of an American withdrawal has been in the air since at least 2014, when Mr. Obama ordered a major troop reduction. Haroun Mir, an Afghan analyst, said it was understandable that Mr. Trump would be fed up, given the chaos on the ground and lack of progress in negotiating a political settlement.

Afghanistan's leaders, mired in political infighting and corruption, need to see the partial pullout as a sign that they don't have much time, he said.

But that is not without risk, Mr. Mir warned, because if the Taliban returned, it would haunt the Americans ""that they were defeated by a ragtag force after 17 years of fighting them.""

However precipitously Mr. Trump acted, he was channeling the same reservations that Mr. Obama had. Both presidents questioned the open-ended nature of these campaigns, pressed their advisers to define success, and faced the problem of ""mission creep."" Mr. Trump's national security adviser, John R. Bolton, recently vowed that the United States would not leave Syria as long as Iran, or its proxies, were active there.

""Suggesting they stay until Iranian influence was gone was an unachievable goal and a recipe for potential escalation for a deployment that the Trump people have never been particularly transparent about,"" said Benjamin J. Rhodes, a former deputy national security adviser to Mr. Obama.

Expanding the mission to resisting Iran, he pointed out, also ""has no distinct congressional authorization.""

Mr. Rhodes said he supported the withdrawal of troops from Afghanistan and Syria. But like many former officials, from Democratic and Republican administrations, he harshly criticized how Mr. Trump made the decision, without consulting allies or Congress, or even warning his generals.

""The whiplash of the decision, and total lack of clarity around U.S. objectives in Syria, is more problematic than the underlying notion of drawing down forces,"" he said. ""I'd say the same thing about Afghanistan, where it's clear that an increased U.S. presence over the last year hasn't reduced violence.""

Mr. Feldman said the timing of Mr. Trump's announcement, a few months before a presidential election in Afghanistan, would be deeply destabilizing. It would undermine Mr. Trump's recently appointed special envoy, Zalmay Khalilzad, whom he said had shown signs of modest progress in reconciliation efforts with the Taliban.

Even the president's supporters did not defend him. James Jay Carafano, a national security expert at the Heritage Foundation who worked on Mr. Trump's transition, said he gave the president credit for not just accepting the status quo.

But he added, ""It's not really clear what the plan is in Syria. It's not clear how we protect our interests after we leave, and it's not clear how it fits into our regional strategy."""

Good morning.

Thank you for reading this edition of the Morning Briefing. And special thanks to those of you who wrote in with comments and ideas on improving it. We're taking a break next week, and we'll be back on Jan. 3 with an even better briefing.

Now, back to the news: Vladimir Putin's approval of Donald Trump, #MeToo in Australia and a look at the year in news. Here's the latest.

* ""Donald's right, and I agree with him.""

President Vladimir Putin, above, welcomed President Trump's decision to withdraw American troops from Syria, calling it ""the right decision.""

But at home, Mr. Trump was defending the withdrawal from bipartisan criticism, not least for leaving Syria open territory for the geopolitical ambitions of Russia and Iran. America's Kurdish allies in Syria discussed releasing 3,200 Islamic State prisoners in response. And analysts called the decision an abandonment of key allies and a boon for ISIS.

→ Go deeper: Mr. Trump doesn't believe U.S. forces can alter the strategic balance in the Middle East, a view shared by Barack Obama, our national security correspondent writes in an analysis.

* Will the U.S. government shut down?

A deal to avert a U.S. government shutdown was teetering as the White House called an emergency meeting with House Republicans and President Trump fumed over not getting border-wall funding in a bill passed by the Senate late Wednesday.

Separately, Mr. Trump's nominee for attorney general, William Barr, criticized the investigation by the special counsel, Robert Mueller, in a memo to top Justice Department officials in June. He objected to the notion that the president may have obstructed justice.

If you missed it: In a farewell speech to Congress on Wednesday, Speaker Paul Ryan said American politics were ""broken."" A former rising star in the Republican Party, Mr. Ryan, above, oversaw the enactment of a tax overhaul that many welcomed -- but that also contributed to a growing deficit.

* Tensions with China grow.

China acknowledged that it had detained a third Canadian citizen, a teacher from Alberta, making her the most recent casualty in a diplomatic standoff between the two countries. The three detentions appear to be in retaliation for Canada's arrest of Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer of Huawei, the giant Chinese technology company.

And in a wide-ranging indictment, the U.S. Justice Department described what it called a yearslong campaign by Beijing to steal American technological secrets, to allow Chinese companies to undercut competitors and to help bolster its military.

And North Korea said it would not dismantle its nuclear weapons program until the U.S. lessened its military capacity, confirming that the North's position on denuclearization remains unchanged despite President Trump and Kim Jong-un's meeting in Singapore in June.

* #MeToo in Australia

The actress Yael Stone's allegations of sexual misconduct against Geoffrey Rush were widely discussed because of her story's complexity of complicity -- and because of strict Australian libel laws that keep many victims silent.

Ms. Stone, above, confided in our Op-Ed editor and writer Bari Weiss. Join Ms. Weiss and our Australia bureau chief, Damien Cave, from 10-10:45 a.m. Sydney time for a phone conversation about the case.

The Year in News

Our Australia bureau chief takes a look back at the events that shaped a year of revolving political doors, and gender, tech and climate challenges.

Our Year in Pictures takes you around the world, month by month.

Our list of most-read stories provides another kind of map of the major themes of the year.

Below are some of the story lines your Morning Briefing has followed -- and will be following -- most closely.

* Climate change: Wildfires, hurricanes, drenching rains -- as in India, above -- and drought ravaged communities around the world. Temperatures reached new highs (check the change in your own area). Arctic ice melted more rapidly than ever. Will nations follow through on a global climate framework agreed upon in Poland?

* Trade: The U.S. and China, two of the world's largest economies, spent the year engaged in a tit-for-tat trade war. The global economy appears to be slowing down, and rising U.S. interest rates are worrying markets.

* Privacy: A Times investigation revealed that a consulting firm, Cambridge Analytica, used private Facebook data to help President Trump's campaign, raising alarming questions about Silicon Valley's privacy practices. Months later, we found that the social network gave Microsoft, Amazon, Spotify and others far greater access to people's data than it had disclosed. And we learned that location data pulled from your phone apps is more personal (and public) than companies say it is.

* Migration: A record 68.5 million people, including people fleeing war in Syria and persecution in Myanmar, were forcibly displaced by the end of 2017. Venezuela's misery is causing a refugee crisis in South America, above, and migrants are piling up at the U.S. border with Mexico. Migration may increase with climate change, and migrants are the targets of anti-immigration rhetoric around the world.

* President Trump's legal troubles: getting more serious. Many of the investigations into Mr. Trump's business dealings, potential campaign finance violations and whether his campaign had connections to Russia could come to a head in the new year, particularly with Democrats taking control of the House.

* Russia: The country's increasingly aggressive behavior, including the attempted assassination of a former Russian spy, Sergei Skripal, and his daughter on British soil, worsened relations between the Kremlin and many Western allies.

* Saudi Arabia: The brutal killing of a dissident journalist, Jamal Khashoggi, shone a harsh light on Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who is believed to have ordered the assassination, and also on Saudi Arabia's broader human rights abuses, particularly in the Yemen war. None of this was good optics for the prince's plans to engage international investors and move the Saudi economy away from oil.

* Brexit: Prime Minister Theresa May tried to steer Britain through one of its biggest political crises, but Parliament still has to vote on the deal she struck with the E.U. on the country's planned departure from the bloc in March. The throughline is ""uncertainty.""

* North Korea: This year saw the first one-on-one between a sitting U.S. president and a leader of North Korea, at a splashy summit meeting in Singapore. But progress toward the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula has since stalled.

* Nationalism: From Hungary to Brazil, the march of nationalism and populism continued. But in some arenas -- Canada, for instance, and much of the business world -- affirmations of global engagement countered the narrative.

#MeToo: The testimonies of Judge Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, who accused the U.S. Supreme Court nominee of sexual assault, along with Judge Kavanaugh's subsequent confirmation, highlighted the country's deep, lingering gender divide.

Back Story

Today is the Northern Hemisphere's winter solstice, also known as the shortest day of the year -- shorthand for the day that gets the least sunlight.

Some of us earthlings may grumble about the darkness. But without it, we might not be alive.

Seasons occur because most planets do not spin perfectly upright like a top. The earth's ""axial tilt"" is a jaunty 23.5 degrees, for example, while Uranus, above, spins at 98 degrees, or nearly sideways.

The earth's tilt is good for humans because it helps to moderate our sun exposure. Our four seasons are comparatively mild and, thanks to our proximity to the sun, fairly brief.

Much of Uranus, by contrast, spends winters in permanent darkness and summers under constant sunlight. And those seasons last decades in Earth years.

""If there were creatures on Uranus -- and I don't think there are -- seasonal affective disorder would be a lifetime thing,"" the planetary scientist Heidi Hammel told The Times.

Mike Ives, a reporter in our Hong Kong office, wrote today's Back Story.

On a muggy afternoon in October 2017, Jamie Tillman walked into the public library in Corinth, Miss., and slumped down at one of the computers on the ground floor. In recent years, Tillman, who is slight and freckled, with reddish blond hair that she often wears piled atop her head, had been drifting from her hometown, Nashville -- first to southern Tennessee, to be with a boyfriend and their infant son, and then, after she and the boyfriend split, across the state border to Corinth to look for work.The town, to Tillman, represented a chance for a turnaround. If she was able to get a part-time job at a big-box store, she could put a deposit on a rental apartment and see a psychiatrist for what she suspected was bipolar disorder. She could take steps toward regaining custody of her son from her boyfriend's mother. ""I needed to support myself,"" she told me recently. But potential employers weren't calling her back, and Tillman was exhausted. In the hushed calm of the library, she closed her eyes and fell asleep.

When she awoke, a pair of uniformed police officers were standing over her. ""I was terrified,"" she recalled. ""I couldn't figure out what was happening."" (Library patrons had complained about her behavior.) Ignoring Tillman's protests that she wasn't drunk -- she was just scared and tired, she remembers saying -- the officers handcuffed her wrists behind her back and took her to the jail in Corinth to await a hearing on a misdemeanor charge of public intoxication. Five days later, clad in an orange jumpsuit, her wrists again cuffed, Tillman found herself sitting in the gallery of the local courthouse, staring up at the municipal judge, John C. Ross.

Tillman did her best to stay calm. She had been arrested on misdemeanor charges before -- most recently for drug possession -- and in her experience, the court either provided defendants with a public defender or gave them the option to apply for a cash bond and return later for a second hearing. ""But there was no lawyer in this courtroom,"" Tillman says. ""There was no one to help me."" Instead, one after another, the defendants were summoned to the bench to enter their pleas and exchange a few terse words with Ross, a white-haired, pink-cheeked Corinth native who dismissed most of them with the same four words: ""Good luck to you."" Many of the defendants were being led back out the way they came, in the direction of the jail.

Around 11 a.m., the judge read Tillman's name. She stood. ""Ms. Tillman, you're here on a public drunk charge,"" Ross said. ""Do you admit that charge or deny it?""

Tillman told me that she thought she had no choice but to plead guilty -- it was unlikely, she believed, that the judge would take her word over that of the arresting officers. ""I admit, your honor,"" she said. ""I just want to get me out of here as soon as possible."" Under Mississippi state law, public intoxication is punishable by a $100 fine or up to 30 days in jail. Ross opted for the maximum fine. Tillman began to cry.

The Federal Reserve Board has estimated that 40 percent of Americans don't have enough money in their bank accounts to cover an emergency expense of $400. Tillman didn't even have $10. She couldn't call her family for help. She was estranged from her father and from her mother, who had custody of Tillman's two young daughters from a previous relationship.

""I can't -- "" Tillman stammered to Ross. ""I can't -- ""

Ross explained the system in his court: For every day a defendant stayed in the Alcorn County jail, $25 was knocked off his or her fine. Tillman had been locked up for five days as she awaited her hearing, meaning she had accumulated a credit of $125 toward the overall fine of $255. (The extra $155 was a processing fee.) Her balance on the fine was now $130. Was Tillman able to produce that or call someone who could?

""I can't,"" Tillman responded, so softly that the court recorder entered her response as ""inaudible."" She tried to summon something more coherent, but it was too late: The bailiff was tugging at her sleeve. She would be returned to the jail until Oct. 14, she was informed, at which point Ross would consider the fine paid and the matter settled.

That night, Tillman says, she conducted an informal poll of the 20 or so women in her pod at the Alcorn County jail. A majority, she says, were incarcerated for the same reason she was: an inability to pay a fine. Some had been languishing in jail for weeks. The inmates even had a phrase for it: ""sitting it out."" Tillman's face crumpled. ""I thought, Because we're poor, because we're of a lower class, we aren't allowed real freedom,"" she recalled. ""And it was the worst feeling in the world.""

No government agency comprehensively tracks the extent of criminal-justice debt owed by poor defendants, but experts estimate that those fines and fees total tens of billions of dollars. That number is likely to grow in coming years, and significantly: National Public Radio, in a survey conducted with the Brennan Center for Justice and the National Center for State Courts, found that 48 states increased their civil and criminal court fees from 2010 to 2014. And because wealthy and middle-class Americans can typically afford either the initial fee or the services of an attorney, it will be the poor who shoulder the bulk of the burden.

""You think about what we want to define us as Americans: equal opportunity, equal protection under the law,"" Mitali Nagrecha, the director of Harvard's National Criminal Justice Debt Initiative, told me. ""But what we're seeing in these situations is that not only are the poor in the United States treated differently than people with means, but that the courts are actually aggravating and perpetuating poverty.""

Why they do so is in part a matter of economic reality: In areas hit by recession or falling tax revenue, fines and fees help pay the bills. (The costs of housing and feeding inmates can be subsidized by the state.) As the Fines and Fees Justice Center, an advocacy organization based in New York, has documented, financial penalties on the poor are now a leading source of revenue for municipalities around the country. In Alabama, for example, the Southern Poverty Law Center took up the case of a woman who was jailed for missing a court date related to an unpaid utility bill. In Oregon, courts have issued hefty fines to the parents of truant schoolchildren. Many counties around the country engage in civil forfeiture, the seizure of vehicles and cash from people suspected (but not necessarily proven in court) of having broken the law. In Louisiana, pretrial diversion laws empower the police to offer traffic offenders a choice: Pay up quickly, and the ticket won't go on your record; fight the ticket in court, and you'll face additional fees.

[Read how thousands of innocent people are sent to jail only because they can't afford to post bail.]

""What we've seen in our research is that the mechanisms vary, depending on the region,"" says Joanna Weiss, co-director of the Fines and Fees Justice Center. ""But they have one thing in common: They use the justice system to wring revenue out of the poorest Americans -- the people who can afford it the least."" Aside from taxes, she says, ""criminal-justice debt is now a de facto way of funding a lot of American cities.""

The jailing of poor defendants who cannot pay fines -- a particularly insidious version of this revenue machine -- has been ruled unconstitutional since a trio of Supreme Court cases spanning the 1970s and early 1980s. The first, Williams v. Illinois, involved a petty thief who was forced to remain in prison to pay off a fine, even after he had served his term. The second, Tate v. Short, hinged on a man in Texas named Preston Tate, who was assessed $425 in fines for several traffic violations. Because Tate couldn't make the payments, a judge sentenced him to 85 days in jail -- the amount of time it would take him, at a rate of $5 a day, to pay his entire fine. Tate took his case to the Supreme Court, which found that the punishment violated the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment to the Constitution, which requires that the government not discriminate on criteria like race or background. The court found that Tate was imprisoned ""solely because of his indigency.""

In a majority opinion for an analogous case from 1983, Bearden v. Georgia, in which a man received probation and a fine when he pleaded guilty to burglary and theft, Justice Sandra Day O'Connor called it ""fundamentally unfair"" to send him to prison for nonpayment without ""considering whether adequate alternative methods of punish[ment]"" -- like community service or a payment plan -- were available. To do otherwise was to deprive a person of his freedom simply because he happened to be poor.

Still, decades after those cases were decided, the practice of jailing people who cannot pay persists, not least because Supreme Court decisions do not always make their way to local courts. ""Precedent is one thing,"" says Alec Karakatsanis, executive director of Civil Rights Corps, a Washington-based nonprofit. ""The way a law is written is one thing. The way a law is actually experienced by poor people and people of color is another.""

Moreover, Karakatsanis argues, jailing poor defendants has proved to be an effective way of raising money. By threatening a defendant with incarceration, a judge is often able to extract cash from a person's family that might otherwise be difficult to touch. ""A typical creditor,"" he says, ""can't put you in a steel cage if you can't come up with the money.""

In 2010, the American Civil Liberties Union detailed evidence of what it calls ""modern-day 'debtors' prisons' "" -- essentially, courts operating in the same way as Judge Ross's in Corinth -- in Georgia, Michigan, Louisiana, Ohio and Washington State. ""If you spent a few weeks driving from coast to coast, you might not find similar policies in place in every single county,"" Sam Brooke, the deputy legal director of the Southern Poverty Law Center's economic-justice program, told me. ""But every other county? Probably. This is a massive problem, and it's not confined to the South. It's national.""

In 2014, in the wake of the fatal shooting of an unarmed black teenager named Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo., President Barack Obama's Justice Department opened two investigations into policing in the city. Among the findings, released the following spring, was evidence that the city had been routinely jailing residents for failure to pay criminal-justice-related debt and that ""the court's practices impose unnecessary harm, overwhelmingly on African-American individuals."" In 2016, the Justice Department issued what is known as a ""dear colleague"" letter, reminding courts that they are obligated to take into consideration a defendant's financial standing before levying fines. Although not legally binding, the letter was met with approval from many civil rights activists, as was the willingness of states including New Hampshire and Illinois to proactively train judges and clerks on the pertinent legal precedents.

The ""dear colleague"" letter, along with two dozen others, has since been rescinded by former Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who argued that his predecessors overstepped their bounds and that it should be left to Congress to arrive at solutions through legislation. ""Last month, I ended the longstanding abuse of issuing rules by simply publishing a letter or posting a web page,"" Sessions said in a statement in December 2017. Any guidance, he went on, that ""improperly goes beyond what is provided for in statutes or regulation should not be given effect.""

But Congress has been slow to act -- no current major bill addresses the jailing of poor defendants. ""At this point, I'm convinced that sunlight -- a lot of it -- is going to have to be the solution,"" Brooke told me.

In recent years, the Southern Poverty Law Center and other organizations, including the A.C.L.U. and Karakatsanis's Civil Rights Corps, have been filing class-action lawsuits against dozens of courts across the South and Midwest and West, arguing that local courts, in jailing indigent defendants, are violating the Supreme Court rulings laid down in Williams, Tate and Bearden. The lawsuits work: As a settlement is negotiated, a judge typically agrees to stop jailing new inmates for unpaid fines or fees. ""No one wants to admit they've knowingly acted in this manner,"" says Brooke, who partnered with Karakatsanis on lawsuits in Alabama and filed several elsewhere in the South. ""So they tend to settle quickly."" The trouble is locating the offending courts.

In January 2017, two S.P.L.C. staff members, Micah West, a senior staff attorney, and Sara Wood, a senior paralegal, drove from the organization's headquarters in Montgomery, Ala., to Southern Mississippi, to look into claims that the state was suspending -- without due process -- the licenses of thousands of residents for failure to pay overdue traffic tickets. For a couple of days, West and Wood made visits to various D.M.V.s and court offices. But even when they could get someone to talk to them, the clerk was sometimes unable or unwilling to share any details of individual suspensions. ""Eventually, I was like, 'All right, let's save ourselves some time,' "" West recalled. ""So we got out a map, and we started calling every place on it."" One morning, his finger landed on the city of Corinth.

A Municipal Court staff member picked up on the third ring. ""Could you answer a question for me?"" West asked the woman. ""I'm wondering what would happen if I was unable to pay a speeding ticket. Would I lose my driving license?""

""What do you mean?"" she responded. And then: ""You'd go to jail.""

Corinth occupies an important place in Mississippi history. During the Civil War, the South lost two bloody battles trying to defend the rail lines that bisected the city, which Confederate leaders regarded as second only to Richmond, their capital, in terms of strategic importance. Today the rails remain, as do the battlefield and a handful of grand antebellum homes, but driving around the area, you get a sense that the place has been hollowed out. As of 2016, a quarter of the 14,600 residents, 70 percent of whom are white, lived at or below the federal poverty line (about $12,000 in annual income for an individual).

Drug use is endemic -- primarily opioids and methamphetamine. So, too, are the hallmarks of a specific kind of rural, Southern poverty: stray dogs in the streets, sun-blasted trailers that seem to be sinking back into the earth, yards occupied by rusting school buses and old sedans. ""You grow up around here, and you have two options,"" one resident told me. ""You can either get the hell out, go on up to Tupelo or wherever. Or you stay and try to figure out a way to live without having the cops on you all the time. Which sure ain't easy.""

Corinth's infrastructure runs so leanly as to be almost invisible: There are no public buses, and Alcorn County recently announced that it would stop funding the local railroad museum. Tax rates in Corinth have dropped slightly in recent years, while the percentage of revenue generated by criminal-justice-related debt has grown. According to the annual audit submitted by Corinth to the state, in fiscal year 2017, the year Jamie Tillman was arrested for public intoxication, general fund revenues for the city were just $10.8 million. Total revenue for the year was $20.3 million, half of which came from taxes; close to $7 million came from ""intergovernmental revenue,"" or grants and funds from the state and federal authorities. And approximately $623,000 came from what the city defines as ""fines and forfeitures.""

The Corinth city clerk declined to answer questions about the breakdown of the budget or how the revenue from fines compares with those of neighboring towns, referring questions to the city attorney, Wendell Trapp, who did not respond to emails seeking comment. But a report completed in 2017 by the U.S. Commission on Civil Rights offers some answers. Combing Census Bureau data and city audit documents, the commission noted that of nearly 4,600 American municipalities with populations above 5,000, the median received less than 1 percent of their revenue from fines and fees. But a sizable number of cities, like Doraville, Ga., or Saint Ann, Mo., a suburb of St. Louis, have reported fines-and-fees revenue amounting to 10 percent or more of total municipal income.

Corinth's revenue from fines in 2017 was 5.7 percent of its general fund revenues, putting it -- if not quite at the Saint Ann level -- at the high end when compared with the municipalities in the Commission on Civil Rights's report. When I sent Joanna Weiss, of the Fines and Fees Justice Center, a copy of the 2017 Corinth audit, she noted that this would be dismaying enough in itself. ""But you can also see,"" she added, ""that the biggest expenditure, by far, for the city of Corinth is public safety"" -- including court and police services, or the very people extracting the fines.

In 2017, Micah West and Sara Wood of the S.P.L.C. drove to Corinth to open an investigation into the Municipal Court, with an eye toward later filing a lawsuit -- the most effective way, they believed, to halt Judge John C. Ross's jailing of low-income defendants. During court sessions, they would often walk down the hall to the clerk's office, where defendants were permitted to use a landline phone to make a final plea for the cash that would set them free. The space amounted to an earthly purgatory: Secure the money, and you were saved. Fail, and you'd be sent to jail. ""All around us, people would be crying or yelling, getting more and more desperate,"" Wood recalled.

That October, she watched a 59-year-old man named Kenneth Lindsey enter the office, his lean arms hanging lank by his side, his face gaunt and pale. Lindsey had been in court for driving with an expired registration, but he hadn't been able to afford the fines: He was suffering from hepatitis C and liver cancer, and he had spent the very last of his savings on travel to Tupelo for a round of chemotherapy. Until his next state disability check arrived, he was broke. ""Can you help?"" Lindsey whispered into the phone.

A few seconds of silence passed. ""All right, then. Thanks anyway.""

Finally, around 1:45 p.m., Lindsey managed to get through to his sister. She barely had $100 herself, but she promised to drive it over after her shift was through.

Wood caught up with Lindsey in the parking lot later that day, and after identifying herself, asked if he would consider being interviewed by the S.P.L.C. ""I don't know,"" Lindsey said, studying the ground. But soon enough, he called Wood to say he had changed his mind. ""I've been paying these sons of bitches all my life,"" he told her. ""It's time someone did something about it.""

Traveling around Corinth, Wood found that nearly everyone she met had experience with the local courts or could refer her to someone who did. Soon her voice mail inbox filled with messages from people who wanted to share their stories. The callers were diverse in terms of age and race. They were black and white; they were young and old. But they shared with Kenneth Lindsey a precipitous relationship to rock-bottom poverty. If not completely destitute, they were close -- a part-time job away from homelessness, a food-stamp card away from going hungry.

There was the man who couldn't read and hadn't said a word until he was 5 years old. Not long after his 35th birthday, he was arrested for public drunkenness. When he got in touch with Wood, he had been in jail for three days, unable to decipher the charging documents filed against him or figure out a way to access his disability check -- his lone source of income.

There was the woman, Latonya James, with a daughter who had been intentionally scalded with boiling water by her stepmother as an infant; now a teenager ashamed of the scars that covered her chest and neck, the girl had stopped going to her high school. The city charged James, then living in a home without electricity or running water, with truancy, on her daughter's behalf, and Judge Ross ordered her to pay $100 of the $163 fine or go to jail. (She managed to scrape together the money.)

And there was Glenn Chastain, who owed $1,200 for expired vehicle tags -- and, because he had missed one hearing, was denied the chance to pay a partial fine. Chastain spent 48 days at the Alcorn County Correctional Facility. He said he was in a unit occupied by accused rapists and murderers and was beaten by inmates until his ribs were bruised and his face was a mask of blood. He smiled to show me where one of his teeth had been knocked out. (Alcorn County authorities offered no comment on the fight.)

Starting in October, with West in Corinth and his boss, Sam Brooke, in Montgomery, the S.P.L.C. set about drafting the lawsuit, which accused Ross of ""wealth-based detention."" The Corinth court had done more than violate the Constitution, the attorneys wrote. It had broken state law, which says that ""incarceration may be employed only after the court has conducted a hearing and examined the reasons for nonpayment and finds, on the record, that the defendant was not indigent or could have made payment but refused to do so."" Ross, they asserted, had never bothered to ask for that information.

A few months ago, I found Kenneth Lindsey standing on the porch of his home in Corinth, dressed in faded jeans and a shirt that was mostly unbuttoned, exposing the thin gold chain around his neck. The house had belonged to his mother, he confessed, and he hadn't messed around much with the decorating since she died -- the place, a converted double-wide trailer, was full of old family photos. He plummeted into a reclining armchair with a sigh.

Theoretically, he explained, his liver cancer was in remission, although he acknowledged he had no concrete proof. In the time since his first conversation with Wood, he had been back and forth to jail two more times, and he had been to the hospital in Tupelo just once. ""I would estimate that I've spent a quarter of the last year behind bars,"" he told me. Could he calculate exactly what he owed? ""$10,000?"" he responded. ""$11,000?"" The way he said it, it might as well have been a million dollars. ""I ain't never going to pay it down,"" he said. ""Never, ever. I'm going to be paying it down until I die.""

Rummaging in his bedroom closet, he produced a cardboard box, which he upended onto his bed. A blizzard of documents spilled out: tickets and warnings and second warnings and court summons. I picked one up at random. It dated back to 2005. ""Now you're getting the idea,"" Lindsey said.

Nearly every one of Lindsey's court fees related, in one way or another, to his vehicle: expired registration fees, expired driver's licenses. He couldn't pay for the right paperwork or pay down his fines, but he couldn't stop driving either, because driving was how he got to the auto body shop where he picked up the odd shift. Hitchhiking scared him, and he didn't want to bother his friends more than he had to. ""My pride gets in my way a lot,"" Lindsey told me. ""They're not embarrassed by you wanting their help, but you are.""

We returned to the living room. Lindsey propped open the door. It wasn't yet bug season; a fragrant breeze blew through the room. ""Maybe they should investigate why they end up picking on the same damn people all the time,"" he said. ""Why is it us? Tell me that: Why is it us?""

In early December 2017, the S.P.L.C. and the MacArthur Justice Center filed their lawsuit against Corinth. That same month, the city ordered the jail emptied of all inmates incarcerated for nonpayment of fines. ""There was no explanation,"" says Brian Howell, one of the lawsuit's plaintiffs, who was then incarcerated, sitting out $1,250 in fines and court costs for three unpaid traffic tickets. ""It was just, 'All right, get up and go.' ""

Howell is 29, with watery blue eyes and freckled cheeks. Years ago, he was struck by a drunken driver while riding his motorcycle; he lost one leg and suffered extensive nerve and spinal damage. It is hard for him to walk, let alone play with his three children, without the aid of crutches. But the guards at the jail wouldn't lend him a pair. Nor would they give him a ride home. The best they would offer was a lift across the street, to the gas station. From there, Howell began scooting on his buttocks along the side of the road, using his hands to haul himself forward. Soon his forearms were sore, his fingertips bloody. A police cruiser pulled up alongside him. ""The guy looks over, and he just busts out laughing,"" Howell recalled last spring. Howell is extremely soft-spoken, and when he told me what the cop said to him, I was certain I'd misheard. He repeated it more loudly: ""He said, 'Hell, I thought you was a damn dog.' ""

Later that day, as a rare early-spring snowstorm settled over Alcorn County, I drove across town to the modest home that serves as the offices and personal residence of Judge John C. Ross. The roads were empty, with all local schools and most local businesses shut, and as I pulled into Ross's driveway, my rental car noisily skidded; by the time I'd shifted into park, the judge was at the door, a hand raised in greeting.

""Come in, come in,"" he said, without asking what I wanted. When I told him I was a reporter, he smiled broadly. ""Well, you'll have to stay at least until you're all warmed up.""

He led me down a hallway, past a framed drawing of the first Battle of Corinth -- he found it in an old edition of Harper's Weekly, he explained -- and into the sun-washed living room that doubles as his office. On the shelves around us were history books and leather-bound novels by Hemingway. ""I was an English major in college,"" Ross said. He guided me to a chair. ""Sit, sit, sit. Let's talk.""

Ross was not the only target of the lawsuit -- the city of Corinth was named, too -- and he had received specific instructions from attorneys not to directly discuss it. Still, there were things the judge felt he could say: Both entities, he said, had consented to put a temporary hold on the policy of jailing indigent defendants, and incarceration in many cases would be replaced with payment plans or community-service opportunities. ""I intend to abide by that settlement,"" he said.

He spoke of his time at Ole Miss, his matriculation into the university's law school and his decades in private practice. He talked about those decades in a way that made clear he regarded his more recent stint as a Municipal Court judge as something other than the crowning achievement of his legal career. But he had accepted it out of a sense of duty to the place he grew up. ""Outside of school and an early job, I've never lived anywhere else but Corinth,"" he said. ""I love the people, and I love the place. And I don't think I'll ever leave."" He sometimes worked as an administrator for the cemetery across the street, and in retirement, that's where he planned to spend some of his days.

Ross was sitting with his back to a large picture window, and behind him, through the glass, wet snow was falling on the oak tree in his backyard. As politely as he had shown me in, he showed me out again -- he and his friends had plans to visit New Orleans that weekend, and there was packing to be done. As I shook Ross's hand, I was reminded of the taxonomy of municipal judges that Sam Brooke of the S.P.L.C. had laid out for me. ""I'd split them into camps,"" Brooke said. ""The first are the ones that respect the law. The second are the vindictive ones, who see every defendant as a bad person in need of punishment. But the biggest group are judges who are part of the retail industry of processing a whole lot of people. They're just doing what the judges before them did.""

In July, a U.S. district judge finalized the temporary policy Corinth and the S.P.L.C. had agreed to regarding indigent defendants. ""Nothing in this says poor people don't have to obey the law or pay their fines,"" Cliff Johnson of the MacArthur Justice Center told The Associated Press at the time. ""They just get additional time to pay their fines and don't have to go to jail because they're poor.""

In June, Ross announced his retirement; this fall, he was replaced on the municipal bench by Rebecca Phipps, a judge who worked for 40 years as an attorney in Corinth, and who was briefed on the terms of the settlement before accepting the job. After lobbying by the S.P.L.C. and the A.C.L.U., both houses of the State Legislature unanimously passed a bill prohibiting any resident from being jailed for a failure to pay either court costs or fines. The bill went into effect in July of last year.

But the modest progress in Mississippi has not necessarily been mirrored in other states -- in recent months, attorneys in Arkansas and Pennsylvania have filed lawsuits accusing a judge and the Commonwealth of facilitating ""debtors' prisons,"" and in Missouri, Ferguson officials are still fighting a class-action suit first filed in 2015. In the few places where one aspect of the fines-and-fees apparatus has been eliminated, that does not mean poor residents are suddenly free of towering amounts of criminal-justice debt. Nor does it mean they will not continue to come in regular contact with law enforcement, which remains robustly subsidized even as other city services go underfunded. Kenneth Lindsey, for example, was arrested last spring for missing a hearing related to unpaid fines. The judge at the Alcorn County Justice Court sent him to jail for 12 days when he couldn't pay.

""They come out of jail with absolutely nothing but more problems, and then it just keeps on going and going, and it's like they're bound, and they feel like they can't escape,"" Andrea Hurst, Glenn Chastain's girlfriend, told me about her boyfriend and others who find themselves in similar circumstances. ""Their license gets taken, and hey, you get pulled over one day, because the cop knows you got no license, and then back to jail again. You just lost that job again.""

Not long ago, I met Jamie Tillman for lunch at the Corinth Cracker Barrel. After leaving jail, she explained, she started staying in a friend's trailer, but she and the friend had a falling out, and now she was back to drifting from one place to the next. A shelter for battered women down in Tupelo, the bedroom of an acquaintance, the streets, the forest. She looked wan and tired. Her hands fluttered as she spoke.

""I've been waiting to get together enough money for some mood stabilizers,"" she told me. ""Because if I can get stable, I can start showing people that I'm fit to have my kid back. That I'm the person I know I can be.""

She had a part-time job cleaning a couple of houses in the next town over, and a plan: She could use her birth certificate, the only official document she still possessed, to obtain a Social Security card, and with her Social Security card, she would be able to get a driver's license and then a bank account. ""I'll pay off the rest of what I owe to the courts"" -- a few thousand dollars -- ""and then I can start saving like a real person,"" she said.

We walked out to the parking lot, so she could show me the entirety of her belongings, stored for now in a plastic laundry hamper in the back of a friend's car: three changes of clothes, a hair dryer and various envelopes, many bearing the seal of the Alcorn County Court.

As she dug through the hamper in search of her birth certificate, which she was now worried she had misplaced, a sheet of paper fluttered out. It was inscribed, in cursive, with a poem titled ""Money,"" by the American writer Richard Armour. Tillman couldn't remember who gave it to her -- she thought it might have been a friend from jail. Clearing her throat, she started to read aloud: ""Workers earn it, spendthrifts burn it, bankers lend it.""

Then she sighed and skipped to the last line: ""I could use it."""
19,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/31/us/politics/trump-troop-withdrawal-syria-months.html,"WASHINGTON -- President Trump has agreed to give the military about four months to withdraw the 2,000 United States troops in Syria, administration officials said on Monday, backtracking from his abrupt order two weeks ago that the military pull out within 30 days.

Mr. Trump confirmed on Twitter that troops would ""slowly"" be withdrawn, but complained that he got little credit for the move after a fresh round of criticism from retired Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal and revelations from the departing White House chief of staff, John F. Kelly, himself a retired Marine general, about the president's impulsive decision-making.

""If anybody but Donald Trump did what I did in Syria, which was an ISIS loaded mess when I became President, they would be a national hero,"" Mr. Trump wrote. ""ISIS is mostly gone, we're slowly sending our troops back home to be with their families, while at the same time fighting ISIS remnants.""

For a president who has looked to the military for affirmation throughout his campaign and presidency and boasted about stocking his cabinet with what he called ""my generals,"" his decision on Dec. 19 to withdraw quickly from Syria was a significant split from his military and civilians advisers. The criticism from General McChrystal, who commanded American-led troops in Afghanistan from 2009 to 2010, echoed longstanding denunciations by former senior intelligence officials, who have warned that Mr. Trump's approach to national security is reckless.

But during a surprise trip to Iraq last week, Mr. Trump privately told the commander of American forces in Iraq and Syria, Lt. Gen. Paul J. LaCamera, that the military could have several months to complete a safe and orderly withdrawal, according to two United States officials. And on Sunday, Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, told reporters that a ""pause situation"" on the troop withdrawal was in effect.

A Pentagon spokesman, Cmdr. Sean Robertson, said on Monday, ""I'll let the president's words speak for themselves.""

By extending the timetable for withdrawal to several months, Mr. Trump stuck to his commitment to untangle the United States from yearslong military commitments but also heeded warnings from current and former military leaders of the danger of a quick exit. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, who resigned in protest over Mr. Trump's decision, said that leaving Syria in 30 days would jeopardize the fight against the Islamic State, betray its Syrian Kurdish-Arab allies on the ground, and cede the eastern part of the country to the Syrian government and its Russian and Iranian allies.

Nevertheless, Mr. Trump's latest plan left open the question of whether an orderly pullout from Syria would happen. Military planners say they need about 120 days, or four months, to carry out a withdrawal that allows time to decide which equipment to move elsewhere in the region, leave behind with allies or disable to prevent it from falling into the hands of the Syrian government or Russia or Iran.

Military officials have declined to specify the timing of the departure, partly for operational security reasons and partly because many details are still quite fluid, and officials recognize that Mr. Trump could change his mind at any moment and speed up the departure.

Mr. Mattis, who will be succeeded in an acting capacity on Tuesday by his deputy, Patrick M. Shanahan, urged Pentagon employees in a farewell message on Monday to remain ""undistracted from our sworn mission to support and defend the Constitution.""

When Mr. Trump first ordered a drawdown within 30 days, his position provoked an outcry, including from some of his political allies like Mr. Graham, who said that such a hasty withdrawal would leave exposed American partners such as the Kurds, who are concerned about a possible attack from Turkey. But after lunch with Mr. Trump at the White House on Sunday, Mr. Graham said he felt ""a lot better"" about the president's plans.

Military officials have scrambled to translate Mr. Trump's shifting directives and comments into actual orders for commanders in Syria and Iraq to carry out.

On Friday, Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, met at the White House with Mr. Trump's national security adviser, John R. Bolton, to get more clarity on the timing and other details of the withdrawal. Mr. Bolton is scheduled to visit Turkey and Israel in the coming days to discuss regional security issues.

General Dunford then spoke to Mr. Graham about the Syria troop withdrawal before the senator's meeting on Sunday with Mr. Trump. Several Pentagon officials had hoped Mr. Graham could change Mr. Trump's mind on the pullout or at least persuade him to extend the withdrawal timetable.

Col. Patrick Ryder, a spokesman for General Dunford, said in an email that the general and the senator had spoken recently, but he declined to comment on their confidential conversation and referred questions about Syria to the White House.

With most of his top advisers on vacation or having left the White House for good, Mr. Trump spent the weekend talking to allies and watching cable news coverage of the partial government shutdown.

He closely monitors the Sunday morning news shows, where General McChrystal warned that leaving Syria would effectively give up any American leverage over the war there.

""If you pull American influence out, you're likely to have greater instability and of course it'll be much more difficult for the United States to try to push events in any direction,"" General McChrystal said, acknowledging that it was not a ""big surprise"" that Mr. Trump had sought to do so.

He was among the most vocal of retired military leaders who have increasingly criticized Mr. Trump, who responded by tweeting on Monday morning about the ""failed generals"" who oversaw American engagements in the Middle East as they continued and were extended.

""I campaigned on getting out of Syria and other places,"" he wrote. ""Now when I start getting out the Fake News Media, or some failed Generals who were unable to do the job before I arrived, like to complain about me & my tactics, which are working. Just doing what I said I was going to do!""

The president's full-throated defense set him apart from past presidents, said Prof. Peter Feaver, a national security official under former Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush who now teaches political science at Duke University.

""Every president has frustrations with retired military who are grading his homework from the sidelines. Think of every Fox News pundit during the Obama years and think of the so-called revolt of the retired generals in 2006 over Rumsfeld,"" Mr. Feaver said.

""What's different is that this president does so much of his grousing and thinking aloud in public on Twitter, so whereas Obama probably said something under his breath to his aides and President Bush did as well, they didn't tweet it out for everybody to see and hear,"" he added.

Mr. Trump's aides are mindful that he needs to maintain support from rank-and-file members of the military, and they have at times pointed to support he has gotten from soldiers, demonstrated when he visited Iraq the day after Christmas, or when he visited Fort Drum in upstate New York several months ago.

""The president has shown that he can break what had been considered longstanding taboos, he can grab the third rails and not pay a political price for it, but he has not disproved the conventional wisdom that says doing this makes it harder to govern,"" Mr. Feaver said.

Mr. Feaver suggested that Mr. Trump is playing with fire as Democrats take control of the House of Representatives. ""His public complaints about the active-duty folks are much more toxic for civil military relations,"" Mr. Feaver said. ""Remember that they must testify before Congress in the coming months. This issue will fester.""

In his three-paragraph farewell message, Mr. Mattis, as he has done before, cited President Abraham Lincoln's telegram to Gen. Ulysses S. Grant on Feb. 1, 1865, as the Civil War ended: ""Let nothing which is transpiring, change, hinder or delay your military movements, or plans.""

While it was difficult to avoid the possibility that Mr. Mattis was making one final veiled criticism of the commander in chief, colleagues who know the secretary well said his message was more focused on telling Pentagon and military personnel to stay the course no matter the challenges."
20,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/21/opinion/syria-troops-kurds-trump.html,"Mr. Simon worked on Middle East policy in the Clinton and Obama administrations.

American support for the Kurds of Syria was destined for a short shelf life.

The alliance was born in 2014, during fierce fighting between the Kurds and the Islamic State. For several years afterward, the Syrian Kurds fought alongside American troops against jihadists in northeastern Syria and were rightly seen as a useful partner. But overriding American strategic concerns always meant that this pairing couldn't last. Many in Washington and in the Middle East suspected that once the Islamic State was finally defeated, the Kurds' interests -- in particular their desire for autonomy in Syria -- would necessarily be subordinated to America's global priorities.

When President Trump announced on Wednesday his decision to pull 2,000 American troops out of Syria, he may have shocked many people in Washington -- including, apparently, Secretary of Defense James Mattis -- but his impulsive and uncoordinated move coincided with strategic imperative, even if the president himself was unaware of it.

The United States never had a serious strategic stake in Syria's future, as it did in Iraq, which it had set out to reinvent. Washington did provide aid on a large scale to Syrian armed opposition, but kept it mostly under wraps, presumably to avoid implicating American prestige in a battle that might well be lost, and where the United States' interests are narrow. Unlike Iraq, where the Kurds form a large part of the population and enjoyed American patronage for decades, owing to Washington's long struggle with Saddam Hussein, Syrian Kurds are a relatively small minority with only a brief connection to American power. And the battle against the Islamic State was deliberately framed as a mission that combined counterterrorism and humanitarian assistance, rather than state-building or regime change in Syria.

RelatedOpinion | The Editorial BoardTrump's Decision to Withdraw From Syria Is Alarming. Just Ask His Advisers.Dec. 19, 2018

For America, there was always a fundamental problem with getting too close to the Kurds: Turkey, a NATO ally. Ankara was always worried about what would happen if the Kurds of Syria got too powerful, and how that would spill across the border into Turkey's own restive Kurdish region. Despite conflicts between Washington and Ankara in recent years, Turkey is still a critical ally when it comes to Russia, Mediterranean security and protecting Europe's borders. Cold strategic logic was eventually going to dictate the defenestration of the Syrian Kurds.

This inevitability was reinforced by the implausibility of the administration's varying rationales for a continued troop presence in Syria: pressuring Assad by taking control of Syrian oil fields; intimidating Iran; facilitating humanitarian assistance; or protecting the Kurds. But 2,000 troops were not going to scare either Iran or the Assad regime. And with the Islamic State largely gone, there was no longer a pretext for an American deployment.

The administration's oafish announcement of withdrawal -- first put forward in a tweet from the president, naturally -- has generated concerns about a resurgence of the Islamic State. The underlying fear is that despite the destruction of the group's caliphate, its ideology still exists. The implication is that countering an ideology is somehow a military mission. Yet the consensus of social scientists and the weight of common sense is that occupation by foreign forces induces radicalism, especially where occupation is accompanied by devastation and poverty.

If keeping 2,000 troops in Syria is pointless and abandoning the Kurds was inevitable, what is the responsible way to withdraw?

If the United States leaves without any kind of coordination among the various parties in Syria, there will be a vacuum filled by the Turkish military and its Syrian Sunni Arab allies. Their first priority will be fighting the Syrian Kurds; in the process, they will turn another large swath of Syria into a wildlife preserve for jihadists.

To avoid this outcome, the United States must keep the Turks out by addressing their concern about a Kurdistan Workers' Party-affiliated military entity on their border, while guaranteeing Kurdish safety. The only way this can be achieved is by handing control of the area to a third party with the capacity to deliver security to both Turks and Kurds. At this stage, there is just one candidate for this role: the Assad regime.

A decision to do this would no doubt be vexed. Turkish objections, owing to President Recip Tayyip Erdogan's deep animosity toward President Bashar al-Assad of Syria and his mistrust in the United States, would be just one set of obstacles. Kurdish insistence on autonomy would be yet another.

Still, this appears to be the only real possibility for stability. But for it to happen, the United States must do three things:

First, persuade the Kurds to get rid of non-Syrian operatives, while shrinking their military capacity, and accept that they are not going to get the same deal that their Iraqi cousins have won from Baghdad. The imminence of an American withdrawal, combined with Mr. Erdogan's suggestions that he could soon invade the Kurdish regions of Syria, will probably convince the Kurds that they have little choice. But the Syrian regime could provide meaningful incentives, such as integrating the Kurdish forces into Damascus' chain of command and allowing a Kurdish political party to participate in Syrian elections and applying the existing law on decentralization to the Kurdish zone.

Second, convince the Turks that after broken promises and miscommunication with Washington, the United States can still persuade the Kurds to take steps to assuage Turkey's concerns about armed Kurds on its border with Syria. Despite their easy victory over Kurds in the battle of Afrin in March, the Turks are justifiably concerned about the casualties they would take in an effort to control a much bigger area. This fear should be used to encourage Turkish restraint.

Then, either directly or through the United Nations, the United States will have to talk to the Assad regime on the premise that a restoration of Syrian state authority in northeast Syria, including the re-entry of Syrian government forces, is required to stabilize that part of the country over the long term. To this end, the United States will have to deal with the Russians as well, so there is a coordinated approach to both the Turks and the Syrian regime. There are quite a few moving parts to this plan, and all the players will need to be on the same page.

This would require deft diplomacy. Unfortunately, at the moment the United States appears incapable of that. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seems more focused on bluster, and the administration's special representative for Syria engagement appears to have little clue regarding White House policy. But if the administration fails to step up, it will have left the Syrian people far worse off than they already are.

21,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/08/business/media/networks-trump-address.html,"The decision by major broadcast networks to carry President Trump's Oval Office address live in prime time on Tuesday has set off a fierce debate over journalistic ethics and responsibilities in an age of unusual mendacity in politics.

What is normally an easy decision for network executives -- granting airtime to a sitting president to address the nation -- led to hours of hand-wringing by journalists and producers wary of giving a platform to a president whose public remarks, particularly on immigration, have been marked by untruths and misleading claims. Liberals wondered why news outlets would defer to a president who, hours earlier, had taken to Twitter to label journalists as ""the Enemy of the People,"" ""the real Opposition Party,"" and ""crazed lunatics.""

Eventually, ABC, CBS, NBC and Fox agreed to a request by Mr. Trump for the airtime, foregoing their 9 p.m. entertainment shows -- and millions of dollars in associated ad revenue -- for his Oval Office appearance, in which he plans to address the government shutdown. The networks said on Tuesday that they would also broadcast a response from Democratic leaders, including the House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, and Senator Chuck Schumer of New York.

The decision was controversial and predictable at the same time.

Executives at the major networks, who spoke on condition of anonymity to describe sensitive private discussions, cited the government shutdown -- and the millions of Americans affected by it -- as the primary reason for airing the president's remarks. This was also Mr. Trump's first formal request that the networks carry a prime-time address, a rarely used arrow in the presidential quiver.

""When the president of the United States asks for time to make an address to the American public, I don't think you can say 'no,'"" Ted Koppel, the longtime ABC anchorman, said in an interview. Any concern about misleading claims, he added, ""is a judgment you can only make after you hear what he has to say.""

Others argued that traditional ways of covering the president should not apply to the norm-breaking Mr. Trump. Former aides to President Barack Obama pointed out that his request for airtime in 2014 to discuss immigration reform was turned down by the networks, who called the subject overly political. Stephen Colbert, the late-night host, went so far as to criticize his own employer for agreeing to broadcast the speech. ""My network will be carrying Trump's Wall speech live,"" he wrote on Twitter. ""So at 9pm Tuesday, tune into CBS to See B.S.""

In reality, television executives are juggling a slew of concerns, some tied to public responsibility and others crassly commercial. Tuesday is a relatively slow night for prime time, so airing the president's address will not pre-empt a ratings magnet like an N.F.L. game. Executives in New York are mindful of their national affiliates, many of which cater to red-state audiences that might be antagonized to discover their local station is declining to show Mr. Trump's remarks.

Producers at several networks cited the uncertainty surrounding the shutdown, and an impending suspension of federal paychecks, as inherently newsworthy. That won't stop a large portion of the public from criticizing the news media's decision to air the speech live. And Tuesday evening's broadcasts will be scrutinized for whether journalists can sufficiently fact-check and contextualize Mr. Trump's remarks in real time.

Even as the news landscape has fractured, the four major networks still have the biggest audience in mass media. Some journalists have questioned if a different approach is necessary, given that live coverage of a president's speech is easily accessible on multiple streaming and cable venues.

""There are so many sources of news now, but the networks' policies haven't changed very much,"" said Andrew Heyward, a former president of CBS News. ""One very attractive option would be to promote the fact that it's live with a crawl, and then if it turns out to be newsworthy, you can do a special report. You then pull selected sound from it and give it context, as opposed to having to get trapped in something and having to react to it.""

Mr. Trump's aides have told networks to expect the president to speak for eight minutes. The debate over whether it was responsible to air the speech is likely to last much longer."
22,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/04/us/politics/fact-check-trump-shutdown.html,"During a news conference on Friday, President Trump insisted that most furloughed federal employees supported his wall, Mexico is paying for it and it would stop a horde of terrorists from crossing the border. None of that was true.

Most federal workers, even those with rent owed and bills due, would gladly forgo their paycheck as a measure of support for his $5.6 billion border wall, President Trump said on Friday.

He also noted that Mexico would actually be paying for the wall through a new trade agreement, which at the very least raised the question of why the government had to be shut down over a funding dispute involving American tax dollars if the funding was coming from another country. And then there was a Plan C: He said he could use ""emergency powers"" to build the wall.

The wall was needed for many reasons, Mr. Trump said. Stopping drug and human trafficking, and a nonspecific reference to a torrent of terrorists and coyotes easily flowing in over the southern border. ""They drive right in, and they make a left,"" he said.

But there also was sunshine amid the gloom. Mr. Trump spoke of a stunningly positive jobs report and a stock market that soared, at least for a day. Lower gas prices? One person to thank.

The purpose of the president's hastily arranged, hourlong news conference in the Rose Garden was to give his side of the negotiations over a partial government shutdown that stretches into its third week on Saturday. And, for the record, Mr. Trump is not calling the partial closing of the government ""a shutdown.""

""I don't call it a shutdown,"" he said. ""I call it doing what you have to do for the benefit and for the safety of our country.""

The news conference was freewheeling, and the president seemed in high spirits, even with the government shuttered in many places. ""Should we keep this going or not?"" he said.

Here are some takeaways and fact-checks.

The president favors flexible design plans

Mr. Trump has called for a concrete wall on the border with Mexico, though he denied it, telling reporters, ""I said I was going to build a wall. I never said I'm going to build a concrete."" (Just four days ago, Mr. Trump tweeted that ""an all concrete Wall was NEVER ABANDONED."")

Now, he said, steel might be the preferred material, suggesting that would also help a resurgent steel industry in the United States, and could be preferable for its see-through and more aesthetic qualities.

""All of the border things that we'll be building will be done right here in the good old USA by steel companies that were practically out of business when I came into office as president. And now, they're thriving."" Later, he said, ""the steel industry was almost dead.""

""Dead"" is an exaggeration. Steel production has been in decline, as has the number of employees in the industry. But the metals industry still employed over 360,000 workers and produced 80 million tons of raw steel in the year before Mr. Trump took office.

At any rate, Mr. Trump continued, ""we've already built a lot of the wall"" and ""renovated a tremendous amount of wall."" (The Trump administration has replaced some existing barriers with new barriers, and will begin constructing 14 miles of new wall in February. But to date, construction on his border wall has not started.)

Shutdown ownership and impact

In his first meeting about a shutdown with Representative Nancy Pelosi and Senator Chuck Schumer in the Oval Office last month, the president forcefully said that he alone would own the shutdown. On Friday, he was selling shares in it. ""You can call it the Schumer or the Pelosi or the Trump shutdown,"" he said. ""Doesn't make any difference to me. It's just words.""

Could he reach a compromise with Democrats to end the shutdown by coupling wall funding with a pathway to citizenship for the young immigrants known as Dreamers? Mr. Trump responded that Democrats lost interest as soon as the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit upheld an injunction against his administration's termination of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. (A deal on the program and to avoid an earlier government shutdown in early 2018 faltered last January, after Mr. Trump made vulgar remarks on immigration. The court ruled on the case in November.)

That was such a bad decision from the court, Mr. Trump asserted, that even his predecessor, ""when he signed the DACA, with the executive order, made a statement to the effect, this isn't going to work."" (President Barack Obama did not sign an executive order to implement the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. He announced it as a Department of Homeland Security policy in a speech in 2012. He did not say it would not work, but called it a ""temporary stopgap."")

For federal workers who may need a safety net or financial assistance as they go without pay, Mr. Trump said ""the safety net is going to be having a strong border,"" especially because government employees support his wall. (A recent poll of more than 1,400 by Government Executive suggests the opposite: most oppose the shutdown and the wall.)

Mexico paying for the wall?

The president said that the new trade deal with Mexico and Canada will yield billions of dollars for this country. ""That is paying for the wall,"" he said. ""Many, many times over. In fact, what we save on the U.S.M.C.A., the new trade deal we have with Mexico and Canada, what we save on that just with Mexico will pay for the wall many times over, just in a period of a year, two years and three years. So I view that as absolutely Mexico is paying for the wall.""

(Congress has yet to ratify the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement, and it does not compel Mexico to pay for the wall. Whatever federal revenue it generates would come from American taxpayers, not Mexico.)

And, Mr. Trump said, why shouldn't Mexico pay for the wall through trade, given that ""we are losing close to $100 billion a year on trade with Mexico."" (The United States had a $69 billion trade deficit with Mexico in 2017.)

Mr. Trump also took another shot at the North American Free Trade Agreement that the new trade deal seeks to replace, arguing that ""we lost millions of jobs"" through Nafta. (The left-leaning Economic Policy Institute estimated that the United States lost 850,000 jobs because of Nafta. The Times was unable to find any credible estimate that supported Mr. Trump's ""millions"" figure.)

China paying tariffs?

Asked about ongoing trade talks with Beijing, Mr. Trump reported that ""China is paying us tremendous tariffs."" (The United States does not send China a bill for the cost of tariffs, which are often passed on to American importers or consumers.)

China, by the way, ""is the biggest beneficiary of Apple,"" so Mr. Trump is not concerned that the company reduced its revenue forecast this week, sending stocks tumbling. Nonetheless, Mr. Trump said Apple is ""investing $350 billion because of what we did with taxes and the incentives that we created in the United States."" (Apple was already on track to spend $275 billion in the United States over the next five years. After a $38 billion tax payment, the company's investment would be roughly $37 billion.)

Terrorists stopped at the border

After suggesting that terrorists were pouring into the country over wall-less portions of the border, Mr. Trump turned to Kirstjen Nielsen, the homeland security secretary, for specifics. She said there were 3,000 such terrorists ""that we know about,"" but said she could not divulge other information because it was classified.

(The 3,000 figure referred to ""special interest aliens"" stopped at the border, a term that applies to people from any country that has exported or produced one terrorist, according to the libertarian Cato Institute. Besides this ambiguous figure, Mr. Trump has yet to provide evidence for his claim. The State Department said in a September report there is ""no credible evidence"" that terrorist groups had sent operatives to enter the United States through Mexico. The report warned of the vulnerability, but said it was more likely terrorist groups would seek other means of entry.)

Eminent domain

Mr. Trump said that the government would have to use its powers of eminent domain to take private land to build the wall when owners would not agree to sell. He said that's how interstates, schools and other public buildings have been constructed.

Many in his base disagree, especially in Texas where private property rights are often paramount.

About impeachment

Mr. Trump said, mostly in jest, that he had raised the matter of impeachment with Ms. Pelosi, asking her why she did not use the border security issue as grounds. ""And Nancy said we're not looking to impeach you. I said that's good, Nancy, that's good.""

He added, ""You can't impeach somebody that is doing a great job. That's the way I view it."""
23,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/04/nyregion/public-advocate-nyc-special-election.html,"Nearly two dozen people have announced plans to run for the position of New York City public advocate in next month's special election.

It's a job that few people know anything about -- and yet one that nearly every used-to-be, want-to-be or current local politician seems to want.

At last count, nearly two dozen candidates were vying to become the next New York City public advocate in a Feb. 26 special election.

They include some well-known politicians such as Jumaane D. Williams, a city councilman who ran last year for lieutenant governor; Melissa Mark-Viverito, a former City Council speaker; as well as other City Council members, several State Assembly members and a bevy of lesser-known aspirants.

Why all the interest? Good question.

After all, some people, including a few current City Council members, want to abolish the office, which makes no sense to Mark J. Green, the first politician to hold the office of public advocate, which was created 25 years ago.

""Like birds flying south, a couple of times a decade someone makes an unserious proposal to abolish this elected citywide office and it goes nowhere,"" Mr. Green said. ""Why would we not want an advocate watching out for all the people who don't have lawyers and lobbyists to get access to city decision makers?""

Why do so many people want this job?

The job does have its perks.

Even though the public advocate has little real power and a relatively small budget, the office still functions as a watchdog over city agencies and an ombudsman of sorts for the public. The public advocate also can introduce legislation in the City Council.

The job comes with a $184,800 salary, not to mention a driver and an office at the David N. Dinkins Manhattan Municipal Building. But for some, a different office likely beckons across the street: City Hall.

Bill de Blasio used the office as a springboard to become mayor. Mr. Green attempted the same, but fell short. And Letitia James, who succeeded Mr. de Blasio to become the first black woman elected to citywide office in New York City, was able to parlay that experience and name recognition to win the November election for state attorney general. Her victory created a vacancy, necessitating the special election.

Who Wants to Be Public Advocate? Perhaps New York's Next MayorSept. 16, 2018

Roughly half of the candidates are African-American, Hispanic or Asian.

""Tish James is the attorney general now because she was the public advocate,"" said Eric Lane, who served as executive director and counsel to the 1989 Charter Revision Commission.

Who's running?

A better question might be: Who is not running?

The field will become clearer in about two weeks, after candidates submit nominating petitions, which must contain the valid signatures of at least 3,750 city voters. Some of the less well-known or less well-funded candidates may not be able to get the necessary signatures in the short time frame, potentially narrowing the field significantly. The first candidate to successfully file gets the first spot on the ballot.

But for now, there is a candidate for every taste.

You want a candidate with Albany bona fides? Choose from Assembly members Michael A. Blake of the Bronx, who is also a vice chairman of the Democratic National Committee; Daniel O'Donnell of Manhattan; Ronald T. Kim, of Queens; and Latrice Walker of Brooklyn.

Prefer an elected official with more local flavor? The candidates include the City Council members Rafael L. Espinal Jr. of Brooklyn, Ydanis Rodriguez of Manhattan, Eric Ulrich of Queens or Mr. Williams of Brooklyn.

How about a Republican? With so many Democrats, it is conceivable that the traditional Democratic vote could splinter in multiple directions, giving a Republican like Mr. Ulrich a chance. Other Republicans who might run include Manny Alicandro, who sought the Republican nomination for attorney general.

Mr. Alicandro did not do himself a favor when he sought to insult Mr. Ulrich on Twitter by characterizing him as a ""CUNY graduate"" who ""isn't ready for this job."" The comment was broadly criticized on Twitter.

The showdown even includes competition between a husband and wife: Curtis Sliwa, a radio host and founder of the Guardian Angels, and his wife, Nancy Sliwa, a lawyer who ran on the Reform Party line for attorney general.

There are self-described activists: Gwen Goodwin, Tony Herbert, Nomiki Konst and Raphael Schweizer.

There are leaders from the Reform Party (John Tabacco, Michael Zumbluskas); people with affiliations to the former President Barack Obama (Dawn Smalls, Benjamin Yee); lawyers (Peter Gleason, Ifeoma Ike and Jared Rich); former candidates (David Eisenbach, a Columbia professor who ran against Ms. James in the 2017 primary for public advocate; Walter Iwachiw, who has run for mayor as a Republican); and a host of others, including but not limited to Diane Signorile, a real estate broker; Theo Chino, a bitcoin entrepreneur; Daniel Christmann, the host of an online broadcast.

With such a crowded field, someone could win with a relatively small number of votes, increasing the chance that a long-shot candidate could eke out a victory. There is no minimum percentage of the vote needed to win.

What does the public advocate do, anyway?

That's a question that even some candidates seem to flub.

Betsy Gotbaum, the second person elected to the public advocate's job, was at a candidate forum held by Citizens Union, where she serves as executive director. Ms. Gotbaum said she was floored when some candidates started speaking about eliminating student debt, while others mentioned that the office should have subpoena power. The public advocate has the power to deal with neither issue.

""I wish some of the candidates would look at the City Charter and see the duties,"" said Ms. Gotbaum. ""Many did not know and do not know the role.""

The City Charter describes the public advocate as responsible for receiving and investigating multiborough, citywide and individual ""complaints concerning city services and other administrative actions of city agencies."" The 1989 City Charter commission recommended that the City Council president position become the ""public advocate"" to ""monitor delivery of services to the public"" and recommend legislation to fix systematic problems. The job title of Council president was officially renamed public advocate in 1993 by the City Council.

The public advocate can refer complaints to the agency in question or conduct an investigation and make recommendations about how to resolve the complaint. The public advocate also presides over City Council meetings and can introduce legislation, but does not have a vote. And, if something were to happen to the mayor, the public advocate is next in the line of succession.

This is New York City, so a Democrat will win, right?

Technically speaking, no.

February's election is nonpartisan (although most candidates are Democrats), so candidates can form their own individual party label, leading to some interesting and revealing choices.

Ms. Mark-Viverito is running on the ""Fix the M.T.A."" line. Ms. Smalls is similarly positioned, running on the ""No More Delays"" line, a reference to a stalled city plan for discounted MetroCards for the poor.

Mr. Kim is on the ""People Over Corporations"" line; Ms. Ike is on the ""People Over Profit"" line.

Mr. Williams is running on ""The Peoples Advocate"" line; Mr. Blake is running on the ""For the People"" line because ""people don't feel like the city is working for them and we are not fighting for them the way we should, he said. ""Anything with the word public in it is not working the way it should: public housing, public transportation, public hospitals, public education. I think the public advocate is in a position to help.""

Mr. Ulrich is on the ""Common Sense"" line. Mr. Yee has ""The Community Empowerment Party."" Mr. Espinal has the ""Livable City"" tag. Mr. O' Donnell, the first openly gay man elected to serve in the State Assembly, is running on the ""Equality for All"" line.

And Ms. Konst is running on the ""Pay People More"" party line, because one of her issues is increasing the minimum wage to $30 per hour for municipal employees and businesses with more than 75 workers.

Handicapping the finish

The race to raise money will be critical in this sprint of an election. Ms. Mark-Viverito and Mr. Williams may have an edge because of their citywide name recognition; Mr. Williams also has the backing of the Working Families Party, which should provide plenty of volunteers.

Ms. Mark-Viverito boasts $200,000 from her old City Council account, and she was the first person to turn in her petitions, which could place her at the top of the ballot if the signatures are approved.

""There are three variables in this election,"" said Mr. Green, who has endorsed Mr. Williams. ""Can you get enough signatures to get on the ballot? What kind of name recognition do you bring into the campaign?""

Another key factor, he added, is the ""amount of money you can raise in a short time.""

Candidates must file contribution reports on Jan. 15. The Campaign Finance Board will then organize two debates, with candidates needing to meet minimum fund-raising and spending requirements to qualify.

And all this for a fairly fleeting victory: The winner is only guaranteed to hold the office for a few months. Under the City Charter, party primary elections to choose candidates will be held in September and those candidates will then run in a general election in November. The winner of that election will finish Ms. James's term, which runs through 2021."
24,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/03/arts/design/gillie-marc-schattner-sydney-australia-art-paparazzi-dogs.html,"New York has gone to the dogs, but the rabbits and rhinos aren't far behind in their assault.

With little fanfare, Gillie and Marc Schattner, married Australian artists, have marshaled their brash bronze menagerie up and down Avenue of the Americas from Greenwich Village to Rockefeller Center, along Astor Place and over to Downtown Brooklyn. Their anthropomorphic statues -- genteel Weimaraners, ladylike hares and gymnastic wildlife -- are leaving behind indelible pawprints in the duo's covert conquest of New York sidewalks. And in the process, the Schattners have become the most prolific creators of public art in the city's history, to the dismay of leading art historians.

""Nothing we've done has ever really been planned,"" Mr. Schattner, 57, said during a December Skype call from their studio in Sydney. Improvisation is a running theme for the couple, who first met on a shoot in Hong Kong (Gillie was the model and Marc the creative director) before eloping to the foothills of Mount Everest for a Hindu marriage just seven days later, jilting their respective fiancés.

Still, it's a modest explanation for a pair who have received eight art commissions on the streets since 2016, half of them on public land. It's an unprecedented pace for a city whose cultural programs come wrapped in streams of bureaucratic red tape. (It took Christo and Jeanne-Claude, by comparison, 30 years of efforts to win approval for ""The Gates"" in Central Park.) And in August, Gillie and Marc, as they are known, plan to unveil their most ambitious project yet, at Rockefeller Plaza: 10 ""Statues for Equality"" will depict powerful women, including Beyoncé and Angelina Jolie. The Schattners said that their project intends to highlight the gender gap in the city's public statues, of which only 3 percent are of women.

Creating public art as a duo came years after the artists married in 1990. After living in Singapore and New York, the couple settled in Sydney, where they became weekend painters. Mr. Schattner was working in advertising, with long hair and a Porsche. Mrs. Schattner ran her own graphic design agency for 15 years. Their big break came in 2006 when they were finalists for Australia's prestigious Archibald Prize for their portrait of former Australian Olympic swimmer John Konrads and his dog.

The Schattners are now full-time artists with a thriving studio enterprise employing 10 in the heart of Sydney's Alexandria neighborhood, with revenues of $5 million, they said. Their daughter, Jessie, 26, a photographer, works alongside them; their son, Ben, 23, is a composer and musician. And although the Schattners still paint, they are engrossed in their bronze statuary business. Their most popular subjects are ""Dogman"" and ""Rabbitgirl,"" autobiographical ciphers that represent the couple's personalities.

""I'm the Dogman and she's the Rabbitgirl, and we're riding the Vespa together,"" Mr. Schattner told The Sydney Morning Herald. ""I'm the person who will push to take more risks than Gillie. I'm the one who is always trying to make Dogman's penis as big as possible.""

Such candor has not endeared everyone to the Schattners' art, even when it's motivated by feel-good causes like gender equality and, in the case of the white rhinos, wildlife conservation. Gillie grew up in Africa, ""watching an elephant being killed before my eyes,"" she said by email. ""I vowed to do everything in my power to never let that happen again."" Marc spent time in Tanzania in his early 20s studying chimps. ""If we weren't artists we would be running a conservation reserve in Africa.""

Who says they can't do both?

Citing Andy Warhol and Damien Hirst, the two define themselves as ""popular artists."" ""We've made terrible mistakes and have gone wrong in the past,"" said Mrs. Schattner, 53, explaining the fresh-faced pair's path to success. ""We've lost money and learned from that experience, but we've also learned by trying things out, failing, and then trying something different.""

""We want to make work that makes people smile,"" said Mr. Schattner.

Critics are frowning, however. One of Australia's most prominent art critics, John McDonald, called the couple's sculptures ""impossibly tedious"" and ""gimmicky."" New York magazine's senior art critic, Jerry Saltz, lobbed ""bathos-infused folly"" at ""The Last Three,"" the Schattners' depiction of endangered rhinos, arranged as a topsy-turvy column of Cirque du Soleil acrobats in Astor Place. The Schattners responded to his takedown with an open letter on their website defending kitschy art.

What has gone almost unnoticed is how the Australian couple conquered New York City by eschewing the traditional gatekeepers of public art, like the nonprofit Creative Time and Public Art Fund, in favor of some unlikely allies. Five of their commissions have come from Business Improvement Districts, or BIDs -- public-private partnerships that oversee quality of life improvements and are funded primarily by assessments on property owners. From humbler beginnings as stewards of street sanitation, BIDs are evolving into cultural programmers, thanks, in part, to the pedestrianization of many New York streets in the late 2000s. While commissions by BIDs require city permits, critics point out that these new art presenters offer too few avenues for community feedback.

""This explosion of art, to my mind, is a lot of garbage,"" said Michele H. Bogart, a professor of art history at Stony Brook University in New York, and the author of ""Public Sculpture and the Civic Ideal in New York City, 1890-1930."" She considers the Schattners' work ""vapid"" and ""insignificant.""

There are 75 BIDs across the five boroughs. The Times Square Alliance was the first BID to commission temporary public art exhibitions, but recently smaller BIDs have begun to recognize the correlation between public art and valuable foot traffic, according to Tim Tompkins, president of the alliance. ""This is something happening on a huge scale, with the trimming of institutional and philanthropic funding for the arts nationwide,"" he said.

Mr. Schattner, whose persuasive charm and brimming smile recall the gifted salesmanship of Jeff Koons, explained, ""With public art, you find a location and go for it."" In 2016, the Australian couple approached the Dumbo, Brooklyn BID for their first project, ""Paparazzi Dogs"" -- a pack of bronze camera-toting Dogmen exemplifying the artists' spectacle-driven signature aesthetic. The sculpture had previously toured Melbourne, Sydney, Shanghai and Singapore. Success in Dumbo gave the Schattners experience they could leverage when courting other BIDs for commissions.

But it wasn't their art alone that beguiled William Kelley, the Village Alliance's executive director, when the two offered ""Paparazzi Dogs"" to Greenwich Village that fall. The Schattners volunteered to self-fund the project, as they have with every public art commission they've done in New York. Mr. Kelley said he jumped at the chance. Less than two years later, the BID would also exhibit ""The Last Three"" (2017), billed on the Schattners' website as ""the tallest rhino sculpture in the world."" (The 17-foot-high stack currently resides at MetroTech Center, a BID in Downtown Brooklyn.)

It's an open secret that very few public art organizations can afford what they commission. Costs are prohibitive because city officials demand work be weatherproof, graffiti-proof, damage-proof and accident-proof. Multiple permits are usually needed, and artworks must be approved by a city engineer. ""The Last Three"" cost $200,000, the Schattners said, which included fabrication, shipment, installation and de-installation. Even for a large BID like the Village Alliance, shouldering the costs of the single sculpture would eat 14 percent of its $1.4 million budget, which must also cover year-round expenses for street cleaning, public safety and business development for one of downtown's busiest areas.

But art experts said the monetization of public art risks sequestering city space for only the wealthiest artists who can afford to bankroll their work -- and saves taxpayer dollars at the expense of the field's diversity. ""Why is it that one pair of sculptors in a city of thousands of thoughtful artists get chosen over and over again, if not that they have accumulated a reputation that is not necessarily based on the artistic merit of their work?"" Dr. Bogart said. She added, ""The problem with the BIDs is that they go with what's familiar or think is popular.""

The boards of the BIDs that commissioned the Schattners are filled with real estate developers and business people. ""It's like asking someone who isn't a brain surgeon to operate on a brain tumor,"" said Anne Pasternak, who led Creative Time, the New York-based nonprofit, for almost 25 years before becoming director of the Brooklyn Museum. ""Professional advising is critical.""

Harriet F. Senie, a historian at the City College of New York specializing in public art, said the Schattners ""would not be considered serious artists with a capital 'A' and yet they have eight commissions? That's a severe imbalance.""

Yet they could have had more. According to Mr. Tompkins, the Times Square Alliance declined multiple offers for sculptures from the Schattners. ""My staff tells me they were very persistent,"" he said.

Funding issues plague artists working within both the municipal and nonprofit worlds. Jennifer Lantzas, the public arts coordinator for the Department of Parks & Recreation, who worked on nearly 60 exhibitions in the last year, said that artists must often privately raise money or ask their galleries to cover part of the costs.

""When we do ask for funding from the city, they can point to a very long and healthy career of not providing funds and still getting a great program,"" she added.

""Let's just say that the budget is never enough,"" said Arlene Shechet, a leading ceramics artist whose first public art exhibition, ""Full Steam Ahead"" is currently on view with the Madison Square Park Conservancy, a nonprofit whose commissions receives permits from the parks department.

Unwilling to go into debt herself, Ms. Shechet got creative; she entered a partnership with Kohler, which makes plumbing products, and worked for seven months at the company. She estimated that collaboration saved her $500,000 in labor and materials -- all for a temporary project. (She would not reveal the exhibition's final cost.)

""Certainly, artists who have resources have a greater chance""making public art , Ms. Pasternak acknowledged, although she pointed out that artists without funding ""make guerrilla actions all the time."" (Banksy is the best known example of this approach.)

In 2016, the nonprofit Americans for the Arts convened its council of Public Art Network members from across the country to propose a list of 29 best practices for commissioning public art. One rule states that ""any organization or entity commissioning artwork should pay artists for design proposals,"" a stipulation that none of the four BIDs working with the Schattners followed.

By appealing to a BID's bottom line, the Schattners may be setting a precedent for how BIDs work in the future, art experts say. After working with the couple, the Village Alliance created a public art program that requires artists to pay for their work's ""fabrication, installation, de-installation, and site restoration,"" according to a policy memo sent to The New York Times.

Years of experience prompted the Australians to create their art loan program to woo interested organizations around the world. The artists' website details their sculptures' market value. They cite ""Early Morning Coffee,"" a 10-foot-tall sculpture of Dogman and Rabbitgirl at a Melbourne pier, as a case study of their success: one million impressions on social media, an increase in treasured foot traffic, 10,000 Instagram and Facebook posts.

RXR Realty, a private developer based in New York, is a happy customer. Michael Aisner, a vice president, says that the pair have been so ""absolutely wonderful to work with"" that the firm has greenlit five of their art projects over the last year, from the Financial District to Park Avenue. Come August, ""Statues for Equality"" will appear on its property at 1285 Avenue of the Americas, in full view of Radio City Music Hall. Mr. Aisner plans to wrap the Schattners' female sculptures around the building's colonnade like a gang of celebrity caryatids: a Meryl Streep here, a Michelle Obama there.

""I find art kind of off-putting and stodgy, but theirs is really friendly and engaging,"" Mr. Aisner said. ""You can sit down and have a coffee with their sculptures. You can't do that with the Mona Lisa.""

The couple says they invest returns from their studio operation into their public art commissions, breaking even. Still, the Schattners find the money to travel the world for research trips and site visits, to Kenya, India, Shanghai and New York. Their expansive online catalog provides a cushion, offering nearly 1,000 items for sale. It includes 349 sculptures, 308 paintings, 196 prints, and jewelry and scarves recycling images from their public artworks. Prices range from $5.50 for an illustrated card to $520 for a tiger painting to a life-size version of their ""Vespa Riders"" bronze sculpture for $60,000.

The Schattners have been known to sell public art once it leaves the streets, though they say the majority of sculptures are donated to permanent spaces. ""The Last Three"" is slated for the San Antonio Zoo in Texas this year after its run at MetroTech.

Dr. Bogart, whose three-decade career in public art includes a stint on the city's Public Design Commission, sees the Australians' self-financed investment plan as an evolution of an approach begun in the '60s by Christo and Jeanne-Claude. Responsible for monumental installations like London's ""Mastaba"" (2018) floating in Hyde Park and Central Park's critically acclaimed ""The Gates"" (2005), the artist-couple would spend decades fund-raising for a single project by selling smaller drawings and paintings.

The important difference between the pairs of artists, Dr. Bogart said, is the level of outreach involved. The Schattners consult with their BID partners while their predecessors consulted with entire communities. ""Christo would come to everybody and do courtesy reviews with everyone,"" she said.

Indeed, lack of public oversight may have fueled the Schattners' first New York fiasco, last February. The artists approached the Chinatown Partnership BID to bring their 900-pound ""Dogman With Apple"" (2017) statue to a square dedicated to Chinese-American veterans. Thepublic artwork was fast-tracked by Wellington Z. Chen, executive director of the BID. But residents complained that the humanlike dog holding a red apple was ""offensive in light of the long history of degrading caricatures of Chinese as dogeaters in American popular culture."" The artists were hit with a cease-and-desist petition signed by nearly 1,200 people and the project was scuttled.

The Schattners said they were blindsided by the criticism, pointing out that the sculpture had been exhibited in Shanghai previously without complaint.

""Seventy-five BIDs have sponsored some 147 artworks,"" said Mr. Chen. ""Some are horrible. Some are ugly. But do you hear about them? No.""

Amy Chin, a community organizer in the neighborhood for 30 years who helped draft the petition, sees the issue differently. ""Being public, art has to be responsive to its surrounding community,"" she said in an interview. Ms. Chin added, ""The BID had no public process installed because they thought the sculpture would be a gift to the community.""

But is this gift actually intended for residents, or for businesses? ""Merchants are bleeding,"" Mr. Chen said. ""Even if it was a Donald Trump sculpture, I would put it out there if it would increase foot traffic.""

The majority of public art projects, including BID street art, must be approved by the Department of Transportation, the Parks Department, or both. These municipal agencies have boards and advisory committees that review submissions for permits, but Wendy Feuer, assistant commissioner for urban design and art at the transportation department, acknowledges that the agency had no formal art program until 2007. ""We were sort of inventing it as we go,"" she explained. One mission ""is quite frankly to put art on the streets of New York City,"" Ms. Feuer added. ""While quality is important, people will always debate what's good or bad art."" .

Tom Finkelpearl, the city's commissioner of cultural affairs, conceded that ""self-funding is an issue,"" generally speaking, in the field of public art. But he added, ""I don't think the art ecosystem is broken, I think it's quite healthy."" He pointed to his department's $10 million commitment over the next four years for permanent public monuments, including a new statue of Shirley Chisholm in Prospect Park. They will be reviewed by a public design commission that includes artists, art historians and museum trustees.

""I haven't seen a groundswell of opposition to what's going on with the BIDs,"" Mr. Finkelpearl said. ""If I began to sense that people are upset, then we would look into it."" Such actions might include consulting the city's Department of Small Business Services or commissioning a report.

For artists simply trying to bring joy into the streets, the Schattners feel like the art world is disproportionately set against them. ""We want to put a lot more heart into public spaces, more soul and humanity,"" Mr. Schattner said. Why should people be so opposed?

""Critics don't speak for everybody and certainly not for the populace,"" he added.

""Even if we get slammed, that wouldn't touch me if I knew that the public enjoyed it,' Mrs. Schattner said.

Besides, the two Aussies have much more ambitious plans for New York. Recently the couple flew to Uganda to study the country's endangered mountain gorilla population for their largest conservation sculpture yet. One day, they hope to install a gargantuan King Kong on the city's skyline. Maybe their mega-sized ape will tower over Central Park. Maybe he'll splay across Fifth Avenue. Mrs. Schattner, with ambition in her voice, said the sculpture is still in its early stages.

""But wouldn't it be amazing for New York to save the gorillas?""

25,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/03/books/review/chigozie-obioma-by-the-book.html,"The author, most recently, of the novel ""An Orchestra of Minorities"" is ""hardly turned off by considerations of genre. ... I have found even manuals -- of how to hunt wild birds in West Africa -- fascinating.""

What's the last great book you read?

""The Diving Bell and the Butterfly."" It was suggested by a student of mine who wanted to reverse the student-professor relationship by stipulating that I read a particular book. Needless to say I obliged, and now thank her for it. Jean-Dominique Bauby's extremely affecting memoir of being damaged by a stroke is as beautiful as it is disturbing. Yet what makes the craft worthwhile is how, through extremely mitigated prose and skillful curating, it manages never to become sentimental. It is an achievement.

What classic novel did you recently read for the first time?

I think it may now be called a classic, since he recently won the Nobel Prize: Kazuo Ishiguro's ""The Remains of the Day."" It is one of those books you can safely call ""quiet"" or ""deceptive simplicity."" You begin reading Mr. Stevens's eccentric account of the fall of the British tradition of the ""great"" butler only to find yourself slowly drawn into something larger, something achingly sinister. It is as if Ishiguro creates a controlled quicksand into which the reader slowly falls and falls until submerged.

What do you read when you're working on a book? And what kind of reading do you avoid while writing?

It really depends. While working on ""An Orchestra of Minorities,"" I read a few books on Igbo cosmology simply to augment my knowledge of the cosmology and better recreate it in my fiction. But I sometimes find myself rereading works by great writers whose prose I envy. A slim census would include Vladimir Nabokov, Toni Morrison, Alan Paton, Arundhati Roy and Elizabeth Bowen, among others.

What I don't read while working on a book is any book that remotely resembles what I'm working on. I had to read George Saunders's ""Lincoln in the Bardo,"" for instance, for a class I was teaching, and halfway through I wished I hadn't included it in the list because the transient state of spirits and the liminality of some of the characters marginally resembles my new book.

What's the most interesting thing you learned from a book recently?

There are many, but the one I remember quite often is that revenge is not justice. This wisdom is from ""Cry, the Beloved Country,"" by Alan Paton. It is basic human instinct to want to unsheathe the sword once things have swung in our favor, now that the world can hear us, see us and pay attention to us. It is instinctive that we mount the hill and attempt to stomp on those who have oppressed us. It is common for us to say: For so long you made us feel this way, now we must make you taste what it's like. This is what Paton's character Msimangu -- foreseeing an eventual end to the heinous crime against humanity, apartheid -- means when he says: ""I have one great fear in my heart, that one day when they are turned to loving, they will find we are turned to hating.""

What moves you most in a work of literature?

Language. When a sentence jumps all of the rhetorical hurdles that life and our saturated minds place along the way to reach sublimity, I become moved to near tears. Consider this paragraph from Arundhati Roy's novel ""The God of Small Things"": ""Being with Chacko made Margaret Kochamma feel as though her soul had escaped from the narrow confines of her island country into the vast, extravagant spaces of his. He made her feel as though the world belonged to them -- as though it lay before them like an opened frog on a dissecting table, begging to be examined."" I call this audacious prose, and celebrate it enthusiastically.

Which genres do you especially enjoy reading? And which do you avoid?

My people say that a poor maid does not reject the embrace of a wealthy prince because of bad breath. I'm hardly turned off by considerations of genre or type. So I have found even manuals -- of how to hunt wild birds in West Africa -- fascinating. That said, if one returns to a well again and again and finds only bad-tasting water, it is difficult to keep returning there. This is why I tend to avoid works of fiction in which plot isn't a function of character but the reverse, in which a set of events is orchestrated and characters are thrown in as fillers. I have this sense of the Dan Brown books especially. So I tend to avoid ""upmarket crime thrillers."" Although, a few pages in, I'm liking ""My Sister, the Serial Killer,"" by Oyinkan Braithwaite.

How do you like to read? Paper or electronic? One book at a time or simultaneously? Morning or night?

All of the above. But I do prefer reading books during the day in paper form, and at night, for some reason, I have gotten hooked on my tablet.

How do you organize your books?

My work space is disorderly. I have books on the floor, even though my original intent was to designate one shelf for purchased books and a separate shelf for books sent to me by publishers to endorse. I find everything mixed up, with copies of The New York Times poking out between stacks of galleys and issues of The Virginia Quarterly Review.

What's the best book you've ever received as a gift?

Khaled Hosseini's ""A Thousand Splendid Suns."" In 2008, I went from North Cyprus (where I was in college) to Mersin, Turkey, to spend the summer with a friend's family, and they gave me a copy of the book. I found myself tearing into the riveting tale for the better part of the vacation.

What kind of reader were you as a child? Which childhood books and authors stick with you most?

The books that stick with me include ""The Palm-Wine Drinkard,"" by Amos Tutuola; ""Hamlet,"" ""Macbeth"" and ""Romeo and Juliet,"" by William Shakespeare; ""The Concubine,"" by Elechi Amadi; ""Ogboju Ode Ninu Igbo Irunmale,"" by D. O. Fagunwa; and the beloved Nigerian children's book ""The Sugar Girl,"" by Kola Onadipe, a novel about a poor girl who, through suffering and resilience, becomes very successful in society. It's a book I wish had a more international appeal.

[Read Chigozie Obioma's essay about how he came to love reading.]

What's the last book you recommended to a member of your family?

""Cry, the Beloved Country.""

If you could require the American president to read one book, what would it be? And the president of Nigeria?

I doubt if the United States president is a ""yuuuge"" fan of fiction, so I'll not go there. Instead I'll recommend Barack Obama's ""Dreams of My Father."" Should Trump choose to read it, not only would he develop a deeper appreciation of Obama, he would find himself reading great prose from a great writer (I often joke that Obama became president because Americans were smitten by his prose). With the Nigerian president, I expect there will be no luck with fiction either. So I'll recommend Chinua Achebe's ""The Trouble With Nigeria."" First published as a kind of pamphlet, the book is easy to read, and should not be much of a challenge to Buhari, who -- as I hear -- has been struggling with the English language lately.

You're organizing a literary dinner party. Which three writers, dead or alive, do you invite?

Writers one admires aren't often the best to share tables with, I'd think! I wish I had met Nigeria's Chinua Achebe, and still imagine the conversations we would have had. John Milton, the great mind and one of the greatest writers ever to live. I would want to sit by him at the table and inquire into how ""Paradise Lost"" was composed. Luckily, there is a writer alive whom I'd love to sit down with anytime! That would be Jennifer Clement, the author of the National Book Award-longlisted ""Gun Love."" She is a remarkable writer and a great, warm person.

Whom would you want to write your life story?

Ha, interesting question. Perhaps my child?

What do you plan to read next?

""The Waves,"" by Virginia Woolf. I have been meaning to finally read the one book of Woolf's that I hear is just as great as the all-conquering ""Mrs. Dalloway."" I have it on my desk right now. But I also want to finish ""The Bible of Dirty Jokes,"" by Eileen Pollack, who I think might be one of America's most overlooked writers. And I hope to read the last part of ""Duppy Conqueror: New and Selected Poems,"" by Kwame Dawes. It is the last of his books in my collection of about five that I've yet to finish."
26,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/07/us/politics/jim-kim-world-bank-president.html,"WASHINGTON -- The World Bank said on Monday that its president, Jim Yong Kim, would step down from his post in February to join a private infrastructure investment firm, an unexpected departure that comes nearly three years before the end of his term.

The abrupt resignation, which is effective Feb. 1, could prompt a clash between the Trump administration and other governments over the future of the international body. The United States traditionally selects the president of the World Bank, which is made up of more than 100 countries, but Mr. Trump has taken a skeptical view about the importance of multilateral institutions. The World Bank's priorities -- like combating climate change and engaging in foreign aid -- also tend to be at odds with those of the Trump administration. Last month, the bank announced it would invest $200 billion toward fighting climate change over a five-year period.

The Trump administration did surprise some development experts last year when it supported a $13 billion capital increase for the World Bank, the first such boost since 2010. The increase, which the White House had initially resisted, was conditional on the bank putting cost controls in place and came with the understanding that lending to China would be expected to decline. The bank lent $64 billion to developing countries last year, a figure that included China.

""Jim Kim had deftly struck a balance between keeping the Trump administration mollified and involving the World Bank in work on areas that the administration has been openly hostile to,"" said Eswar Prasad, the former head of the International Monetary Fund's China division. ""The new head of the institution will face a difficult challenge in maintaining the institution's legitimacy and relevance while hewing to the Trump administration's open hostility to multilateralism.""

Since the institutions were created at the end of World War II, an American has led the World Bank and a European has led the International Monetary Fund. But there have been rumblings in recent years about changing that tradition, and some have suggested that if Mr. Trump makes an unorthodox selection, other countries on the bank's board could break precedent and block his pick.

""The Trump administration folks have some hard thinking to do about the path forward,"" said Scott Morris, a former Treasury official who is now a fellow at the Center for Global Development. ""It is not a given that an American pick will be the next bank president.""

Mr. Kim was first appointed by the Obama administration in 2012, on the recommendation of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, and was reappointed by President Barack Obama in 2016 to serve a second five-year term.

""We appreciate Mr. Kim's service to the World Bank,"" a Treasury Department spokeswoman said, adding that Steven Mnuchin, the department's secretary, ""looks forward to working with his fellow governors in selecting a new leader.""

During his time at the helm of the bank, Mr. Kim worked to overhaul its structure, which historically was built around a model of rich countries financing the development of poor countries. Mr. Kim sought new sources of financing, encouraging private investors such as sovereign wealth funds, private equity firms and insurance companies to contribute trillions of dollars for projects in places like Indonesia, Zambia and India. The strategy rankled some traditionalists at the bank.

Mr. Kim, the son of Korean immigrants, also spearheaded the bank's response to the Ebola epidemic and the refugee crisis in Europe, the Middle East and North Africa.

Mr. Kim said that in addition to joining a fund focused on investment in developing countries, he will rejoin the board of Partners in Health, a nonprofit health care organization that he helped found more than 30 years ago. The name of the investment fund was not released by the bank.

""The work of the World Bank Group is more important now than ever as the aspirations of the poor rise all over the world, and problems like climate change, pandemics, famine and refugees continue to grow in both their scale and complexity,"" Mr. Kim said in a statement.

Kristalina Georgieva, the World Bank's chief executive, will serve as interim president until Mr. Trump selects a new chief."
27,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/29/us/politics/trump-fact-check.html,"President Trump has a well-documented problem telling the truth.

Fact checkers have compiled lists of all of Mr. Trump's falsehoods since he took office (The Washington Post counts over 7,500, and The Toronto Star over 3,900), rounded up his most egregious whoppers in year-end lists and scrutinized his claims in real time with television chyrons.

Here at The New York Times, we have also fact-checked countless campaign rallies, news conferences, interviews and Twitter posts. After nearly two years of assessing the accuracy of Mr. Trump's statements, we can draw some conclusions not just about the scale of the president's mendacity, but also about how he uses inaccurate claims to advance his agenda, criticize the news media and celebrate his achievements.

Repetition and Inflation

Mr. Trump refuses to correct most of his inaccurate claims, instead asserting them over and over again. They become, by sheer force of repetition, ""alternative facts"" and staples of his campaign rallies and speeches.

Examples abound. He has falsely characterized the December 2017 tax cuts as the ""largest"" or the ""biggest"" in American history over 100 times (several others were larger). He has misleadingly said over 90 times that his promised wall along the southern border is being built (construction has not begun on any new section). He has falsely accused Democrats of supporting ""open borders"" over 60 times (Democratic lawmakers support border security, but not his border wall). And he has lobbed over 250 inaccurate attacks on the investigation into Russian election interference.

Yet Mr. Trump does not rely on repetition alone. He also embellishes talking points to amplify his achievements.

Take his repeated fabrication about the construction of new steel mills. After his administration announced tariffs on steel and aluminum imports in March, the president claimed in June that United States Steel was ""opening six new plants."" A month later, the number rose to seven. He has also occasionally cited eight, possibly nine or a vague ""many plants,"" and he claimed once that plants were ""opening up literally on a daily basis."" To date, United States Steel has yet to open or build one new plant, though the company has restarted idled components of some plants.

Mr. Trump often pairs his misleading claim that his border wall is being built with the statement that he received $1.6 billion from Congress to fund it -- though a spending bill from March stipulated that the money, for border security, could not be used for the wall. In August, he added another $1.6 billion to the count, with no evidence. And despite criticizing a spending bill passed in September for not appropriating any money for the wall, Mr. Trump told campaign rally audiences in Illinois, Texas and Mississippi in October that his administration had secured a ""third $1.6 billion.""

In some cases, true claims morph into false ones in Mr. Trump's telling. In December 2017, he was largely accurate in saying a military spending law would give troops the largest raise in eight years. In March, he then exaggerated that time frame to ""over a decade."" And in May, as he addressed Naval Academy graduates at Annapolis, Mr. Trump wrongly characterized the wage increase as not just the largest, but the ""first in 10 years.""

Shifting and Deflecting

In the face of controversy or criticism, Mr. Trump has defended initial falsehoods with additional dubious claims.

This approach is evident in his shifting statements about the payment that Michael D. Cohen, his former lawyer, made to a pornographic film actress to keep her from speaking about their alleged affair. In April, Mr. Trump falsely denied knowing about the payment.

After the F.B.I. raided Mr. Cohen's office, Mr. Trump acknowledged on Twitter in May that Mr. Cohen received reimbursement for the payment and asserted that it had nothing to do with his presidential campaign. Mr. Cohen would later tell prosecutors that he acted at Mr. Trump's direction and to influence the election.

After the release of an audio recording of the two men discussing a hush-money payment to another woman, Mr. Trump claimed in an August interview on ""Fox & Friends"" that he did not know about the payments until ""later on"" and that Mr. Cohen ""made the deals."" He then misleadingly compared Mr. Cohen's actions -- a willful violation of campaign finance law -- to a civil infraction incurred by former President Barack Obama's 2008 campaign.

By December, Mr. Trump's defense had shifted further: ""I never directed Michael Cohen to break the law.""

Misleading Vagueness and Fanciful Details

The president is known for being unscripted and loose with language, but he sometimes shows tactical restraint.

After Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh was confirmed to the Supreme Court and in the days before the midterm elections, Mr. Trump told rallygoers in Missouri that ""the accuser admitted she never met him, she never saw him, he never touched her, talked to her, he had nothing to do with her, she made up the story, it was false accusations.""

The omission of a name and the use of the words ""the accuser"" may give the misleading impression that Christine Blasey Ford, who testified to Congress that Justice Kavanaugh had sexually assaulted her when they were teenagers, had recanted her account. But in fact, Mr. Trump was referring to another little-known accuser named Judy Munro-Leighton, who recanted her claim of sexual assault.

Mr. Trump also regales his audience with elaborate stories. Some -- like his tales of unnamed ""strong"" or ""tough"" men, miners or steelworkers crying and thanking him -- may have occurred but are impossible to verify.

Others, like his frequent attacks on Senator Richard Blumenthal, Democrat of Connecticut, contain invented details. Not content with just accurately pointing out that Mr. Blumenthal falsely claimed to have served in Vietnam, Mr. Trump adds -- with no evidence -- that Mr. Blumenthal said he had ""charged up Da Nang,"" dodged bullets and saved the lives of fellow soldiers.

Inventing Straw Men

The usual target of this particular strain of falsehoods is the news media, which Mr. Trump suggests purposely underestimates or misinterprets him.

Mr. Trump often lauds strong job growth under his watch and says that the ""fake news"" would have deemed such numbers ""impossible"" or ""ridiculous"" during the 2016 campaign. Yet he neglects to mention that the number of jobs added in the 22 months after his inauguration -- 4.2 million -- is lower than the 4.8 million jobs added in the 22 months before he took office, undermining the premise of his retrodiction.

In another example, Mr. Trump turned a hypothetical talking point first into a purported reality and then -- after headlines debunking his claim appeared -- into a joke that he implied reporters had failed to grasp.

At an October rally in Arizona, Mr. Trump criticized Democrats for allowing undocumented immigrants to apply for driver's licenses. ""Next thing you know, they'll want to buy 'em a car,"" he speculated. ""Then they'll say the car's not good enough, we want -- how about a Rolls-Royce?""

A day later, at a campaign rally in Nevada, Mr. Trump presented this theory as reality, telling supporters that Democrats wanted to give cars and licenses to undocumented immigrants in addition to free health care and education.

After the claim was debunked by news outlets, Mr. Trump responded by ridiculing the news media for mentioning the Rolls-Royce, which was not the actual subject of the fact checks.

""They said he gets a Pinocchio for that,"" Mr. Trump said to laughter at a campaign rally in Mississippi, referring to The Washington Post's rating system for false claims. ""They got me!""

28,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/07/business/dealbook/goldman-1mdb-bitcoin.html,"Get the DealBook newsletter to make sense of major business and policy headlines -- and the power-brokers who shape them.

__________

One year ago, Bitcoin was minting millionaires as its value surged to nearly $20,000. Now it is worth about $4,000, and many wonder whether it can survive as a viable investment option, regardless of whether it will ever supplant currencies.

In 2018, the special counsel investigation by Robert S. Mueller III kept expanding. With the Democrats in control of the House of Representatives, a raft of investigations of the Trump administration is sure to follow.

The more things change, the more they seem to stay the same. Here are some thoughts on topics that should continue to be of interest in 2019:

Will Goldman Fight the Government Over 1MDB?

After the financial crisis, Goldman Sachs sought to expand into Southeast Asia. Unfortunately, that effort was it caught up in a scandal at an investment fund in Malaysia.

Goldman raised more than $6 billion for that fund, called 1Malaysia Development Berhad, or 1MDB. The money was supposed to benefit the Malaysian public but ended up enriching Goldman and those close to Najib Razak, who was prime minister. In December, the Malaysian government filed criminal charges against Goldman, accusing the firm of violating securities laws there.

Those charges come on top of a Justice Department investigation of violations of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, which bars corporations from bribing foreign officials to gain a business advantage. Goldman's former top banker in Asia, Timothy Leissner, pleaded guilty in August, describing his role in concealing bribes and kickbacks. Charges were also filed against Roger Ng, Mr. Leissner's former deputy, who is being held in Malaysia pending extradition.

The firm initially tried to shake off the charges by claiming that any misconduct was the work of a few rogue employees, but reports that Goldman's former chief executive Lloyd C. Blankfein met with a key figure in the fraud have undercut that defense.

Goldman's chief executive, David M. Solomon, has offered a full-throated defense of the firm. In a message to employees, he wrote: ""We believe our culture and our processes around our due diligence and compliance was strong at the time, and is even stronger today.""

An American corporation can be prosecuted for the acts of its employees, so Goldman does not have many defenses if prosecutors decide to file charges.

Although Goldman has pledged its cooperation, the firm has also claimed that it is innocent of the Malaysian charges and may well be girding for a fight with the Justice Department to limit its liability. Goldman also will have to deal with the Securities and Exchange Commission, which shares jurisdiction over the bribery law, and the Federal Reserve, Goldman's chief banking regulator.

Goldman has little choice but to reach a settlement. The key question is how much its entanglement with 1MDB may cost the firm. Disgorging the $600 million fee it earned for arranging the bond deals is the likely starting point for any resolution in the United States.

How much a potential fine could be on top of that is anyone's guess. One possibility is that it will be a multiple of Goldman's profit on the transaction. That could push the penalty over a billion dollars, with the possibility of even more if Goldman has to reach an agreement with the Malaysian government.

Do Cryptocurrencies Need a New Regulator?

The precipitous fall in the value of cryptocurrencies in 2016 cries out for greater regulation to protect investors. Studies have shown that the market for cryptocurrencies is subject to widespread manipulation, which puts smaller investors at the mercy of those who are trying to profit from the price swings.

Two bills were introduced in Congress in December to address manipulation in the cryptocurrency markets. Neither offers a concrete step toward regulating trading platforms, nor do they designate oversight to a single agency.

As investors have suffered losses, the questions have increased about whether cryptocurrencies will survive as a viable investment class. Without greater government oversight to curb manipulation, the interest of small investors may well dry up.

The Coming Investigations

Control of the House means Democrats can investigate actions by the Trump administration, and perhaps the president himself. The subpoenas for documents and testimony are likely to fly up Pennsylvania Avenue in much the way they did during the Obama administration after Republicans took control of Congress.

But those hoping for a cascade of materials from the Trump administration may be disappointed. Congressional investigations may well run into claims of executive privilege, something previous administrations have used to resist demands for information. That means any dispute of what must be produced will be decided in the federal courts under the Supreme Court's decision in United States v. Nixon, the Watergate case that found the judiciary has final authority to determine the scope of any claim of privilege.

That is not a very expeditious route for a congressional committee to pursue. Any decision is likely to take months. Add to that the likelihood of an appeal, perhaps all the way to the Supreme Court, and it may take two or more years to adjudicate a privilege claim.

Corporate Disclosure

In August, President Trump tweeted that he wanted the S.E.C. to change the requirements for companies to issue financial statements from each quarter to twice a year. Publicly traded companies complain that the quarterly reporting requirement feeds into the short-term mentality of the securities markets.

The S.E.C. issued a request for comments on Dec. 18 about ""the nature, content and timing of earnings releases and quarterly reports."" Asking for comments is a sure way to slow-walk any potential changes.

Reuters reported that some Republicans are frustrated that Jay Clayton, the chairman of the S.E.C., has not pushed a deregulatory agenda as aggressively as expected and sided with the two Democrats on the commission with some regularity. Could dissatisfaction with Mr. Clayton cause Congress to take the lead on making major changes to the reporting obligations of companies?

Larger companies are unlikely to see any significant alteration of their quarterly reporting obligations, but smaller companies -- which have a broad appeal on Capitol Hill -- may see a change in the frequency and scope of their reporting.

The question is whether that will be a positive change for the markets. Less reporting, especially by smaller companies, could allow companies to push the envelope in their financial disclosures and help them avoid, at least for a while, their day of reckoning.

With the stock market declining sharply in December and growing concerns about a possible recession, would postponing reporting be good for investors?

Corporate America has a strong voice in Washington, so changes in the reporting requirements that put the interests of executives over investors would hardly be surprising.

Wishing everyone a happy and prosperous new year!"
29,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/15/world/asia/mckinsey-china-russia.html,"This year's McKinsey & Company retreat in China was one to remember.

Hundreds of the company's consultants frolicked in the desert, riding camels over sand dunes and mingling in tents linked by red carpets. Meetings took place in a cavernous banquet hall that resembled a sultan's ornate court, with a sign overhead to capture the mood.

""I can't keep calm, I work at McKinsey & Company,"" it said.

Especially remarkable was the location: Kashgar, the ancient Silk Road city in China's far west that is experiencing a major humanitarian crisis.

About four miles from where the McKinsey consultants discussed their work, which includes advising some of China's most important state-owned companies, a sprawling internment camp had sprung up to hold thousands of ethnic Uighurs -- part of a vast archipelago of indoctrination camps where the Chinese government has locked up as many as one million people.

One week before the McKinsey event, a United Nations committee had denounced the mass detentions and urged China to stop.

But the political backdrop did not appear to bother the McKinsey consultants, who posted pictures on Instagram chronicling their Disney-like adventures. In fact, McKinsey's involvement with the Chinese government goes much deeper than its odd choice to showcase its presence in the country.

For a quarter-century, the company has joined many American corporations in helping stoke China's transition from an economic laggard to the world's second-largest economy. But as China's growth presents a muscular challenge to American dominance, Washington has become increasingly critical of some of Beijing's signature policies, including the ones McKinsey has helped advance.

One of McKinsey's state-owned clients has even helped build China's artificial islands in the South China Sea, a major point of military tension with the United States.

It turns out that McKinsey's role in China is just one example of its extensive -- and sometimes contentious -- work around the world, according to an investigation by The New York Times that included interviews with 40 current and former McKinsey employees, as well as dozens of their clients.

At a time when democracies and their basic values are increasingly under attack, the iconic American company has helped raise the stature of authoritarian and corrupt governments across the globe, sometimes in ways that counter American interests.

Its clients have included Saudi Arabia's absolute monarchy, Turkey under the autocratic leadership of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, and corruption-plagued governments in countries like South Africa.

In Ukraine, McKinsey and Paul Manafort -- President Trump's campaign chairman, later convicted of financial fraud -- were paid by the same oligarch to help burnish the image of a disgraced presidential candidate, Viktor F. Yanukovych, recasting him as a reformer.

Once in office, Mr. Yanukovych rebuffed the West, sided with Russia and fled the country, accused of stealing hundreds of millions of dollars. The events set off years of chaos in Ukraine and an international standoff with the Kremlin.

Inside Russia itself, McKinsey has worked with Kremlin-linked companies that have been placed under sanctions by Western governments -- companies that the firm helped build up over the years and, in some cases, continues to advise.

It has consulted in many sectors of the Russian economy, including mining, manufacturing, oil and gas, banking, transportation and agriculture. A McKinsey official sat on the Russian government's energy board. Former McKinsey consultants have gone to work in the Russian companies they once advised.

In August, VEB Bank -- which is wholly owned by the Russian state, intertwined with Russian intelligence and under United States sanctions -- hired McKinsey to develop its business strategy.

There is no indication that McKinsey has violated American sanctions, which prohibit only certain transactions with targeted companies and individuals. But the larger question is whether the company, in pursuing legitimate business opportunities abroad, is helping to shore up President Vladimir V. Putin's autocratic leadership.

Other consulting companies serve similar clients, but none have the stature to confer credibility quite like McKinsey, a confidant for 92 years to many of the world's most admired companies.

In China, it has advised at least 22 of the 100 biggest state-owned companies -- the ones carrying out some of the government's most strategic and divisive initiatives, according to a review of Chinese-language material by The Times.

While it is not unusual for American corporations to work with China's state-owned companies, McKinsey's role has sometimes put it in the middle of deeply troubled deals. In Malaysia, the company laid out the case for one of Asia's most corrupt leaders to pursue billions of dollars from China at a time when he was suspected of funneling vast sums of public money into his own pocket, drawing tens of thousands into the streets to protest against him.

McKinsey defends its work around the world, saying that it will not accept jobs at odds with the company's values. It also gives the same reason that other companies cite for working in corrupt or authoritarian nations -- that change is best achieved from the inside.

""Since 1926, McKinsey has sought to make a positive difference to the businesses and communities in which our people live and work,"" the company said in a statement.

""Tens of thousands of jobs have been created, lives improved and education provided thanks to the work we have done with our clients,"" it added.

""Like many other major corporations including our competitors, we seek to navigate a changing geopolitical environment,"" the company said, ""but we do not support or engage in political activities.""

Still, some analysts, veteran diplomats and experts on global governance see McKinsey's role in a different light.

While the United States pulls back from international cooperation and adopts a more nationalist stance, major companies like McKinsey are pursuing business in countries with little regard for human rights -- sometimes advancing, rather than curbing, the contentious tactics of America's biggest rivals.

""It is more likely they enable these regimes and likely become complicit,"" said David J. Kramer, a former assistant secretary of state. ""They don't want to alienate regimes, or they would lose business.""

Oligarchs and Autocrats

His bona fides included two criminal convictions and a rigged election that, many assumed, had finally doomed his presidential ambitions.

So it was a bit surprising when McKinsey helped polish the battered image of Mr. Yanukovych and pitch him as something else: a forward-thinking leader with an economic vision of a better future for all Ukrainians.

McKinsey's role in resurrecting Mr. Yanukovych's political career has been lost in the clamor surrounding the conviction of Mr. Manafort, Mr. Trump's former campaign chairman, for secretly taking millions of dollars to help the Ukranian leader win the presidency in 2010.

But McKinsey was financed by the same oligarch who backed Mr. Manafort, and it wrote an economic plan that Mr. Yanukovych wielded to disarm his critics -- before discarding much of it after becoming president.

On his 100th day in office, in a Soviet-era palace adorned with Cossack art, Mr. Yanukovych stiffly briefed the nation, laying out his economic plan. After sipping Cognac and Scotch, legislators and guests packed the hall, where the cameras conspicuously stopped on a man with a bright blue suit and a résumé that touched the lives of virtually everyone in Ukraine.

His name: Rinat Akhmetov, the country's richest oligarch. As much as anyone, he was the reason for the gathering, and he had reason to feel good.

He had rescued Mr. Yanukovych through a strategy that included hiring two very different consulting groups: Mr. Manafort, whose Russian-linked team had worked for dictators with little regard for human rights, and McKinsey, the purveyor of best practices for the world's most important corporations.

That these two disparate groups found common ground is a testament to Mr. Akhmetov's vast business empire and political skill. But for McKinsey, it underscored the risk of consulting in an unstable part of the world, where the company might be perceived as enabling autocratic or corrupt governments.

Mr. Manafort's job was twofold: to soften Mr. Yanukovych's reputation and strengthen his Russian-leaning Party of Regions, facilitating his rise to the presidency. McKinsey provided something different -- an economic plan that Mr. Yanukovych could use to portray himself as a market-based reformer, tilting to the West.

To ensure that the message got through, Mr. Yanukovych and Mr. Akhmetov pointedly mentioned McKinsey in talks with American officials, according to diplomatic cables released by WikiLeaks. Mr. Akhmetov assured the Americans that his candidate was ""a strong McKinsey supporter,"" while Mr. Yanukovych emphasized that he had instructed his aides ""to work directly with McKinsey experts.""

Diplomats remained wary. A respected Ukrainian journalist warned American officials that Mr. Yanukovych might ""sing a song one moment and knife someone the next.""

There were also questions about Mr. Akhmetov, who had long been suspected of links to organized crime, which he denied. One diplomat called his Party of Regions a haven for ""mobsters and oligarchs,"" noting that it might be trying to shed that image.

Mr. Akhmetov's financial ties to Mr. Manafort and McKinsey went beyond politics. He hired both to advise parts of his corporate empire, which included steel, mining, energy, finance, telecommunications, real estate, media, transportation, agriculture and soccer. He also hired former McKinsey consultants to help run his businesses, placing them in senior positions.

Mr. Akhmetov paid Mr. Manafort by wire transfers funneled through a Cypriot shell company, court records show. Other Party of Regions operatives paid Mr. Manafort through shell companies, eventually resulting in his conviction in the United States for failing to declare the money on his tax returns.

McKinsey, by contrast, was paid through a Ukrainian foundation financed by Mr. Akhmetov and run by a former McKinsey consultant now living in Moscow. Set up to promote economic reform, the foundation also sought to publicize McKinsey -- and by extension, Mr. Yanukovych.

To reach its prime audience in the United States, the foundation held two forums on the Ukrainian economy -- one at the Four Seasons Hotel in New York and the other in Washington. On the whole, McKinsey's work was well received.

But the promise of a better future didn't last long.

Within a few years, Ukraine careened toward economic collapse while Mr. Yanukovych looted the nation, living in a palatial residence surrounded by a private zoo, a golf course, a garage filled with classic cars and a private restaurant in the form of a pirate ship.

If that were not enough, he was also quietly building an enormous seaside retreat, complete with 40-foot ceilings and an indoor swimming pool, that eclipsed his presidential residence.

The capital soon turned against him. Mr. Yanukovych had long promised to tie Ukraine to the West by signing sweeping political and trade agreements with the European Union. Then he abruptly reneged, siding with Russia instead.

Protesters flooded the streets for months, chanting pro-Europe slogans. Mr. Yanukovych's government responded with a heavy hand, culminating in what the European Parliament's envoy called a ""Ukrainian Tiananmen,"" referring to China's deadly crackdown on demonstrators in Tiananmen Square. More than 80 protesters were killed before Mr. Yanukovych fled the country in 2014.

The chaos didn't end there. Outraged, Mr. Putin pushed into Ukraine, annexed Crimea and stirred up a war that has claimed more than 10,000 lives. The West responded by kicking Russia out of the Group of 8 industrialized democracies and imposing sanctions. The standoff between Mr. Putin and the West had begun.

McKinsey defended its role in Mr. Yanukovych's rise by saying that the foundation was serious about promoting economic development in Ukraine and featured prominent Westerners on its board. The foundation quietly folded -- without achieving its goals -- just before Mr. Yanukovych fled to Russia. Neither Mr. Akhmetov nor McKinsey would say how much money McKinsey earned.

""When we concluded that the government was not following through on its stated reform agenda, we ended our work,"" McKinsey said in a statement.

Mr. Akhmetov, who publicly broke with Mr. Yanukovych during the protests, declined to speak to The Times. Inside his gold and chrome headquarters, a spokesman said the foundation had been unsuccessful because politicians lacked the will ""to embrace the reform agenda.""

But critics like Anders Aslund, a Swedish-born economist who advised the Russian government in the 1990s and later the government of Ukraine, lamented how Mr. Yanokovych's image had been sold in Western capitals. It was clear, he said, that Mr. Yanokovych ""was about power and robbery.""

McKinsey's role in Ukraine did not end with Mr. Yanukovych's downfall. ""We build leaders who can deliver lasting, meaningful impact for Ukraine's major companies, its economy and society,"" the company wrote on its website.

McKinsey quickly became a favorite of Mr. Yanukovych's successor, Petro O. Poroshenko, an oligarch known as ""the chocolate king"" for his confectionary business.

In a speech last November, Mr. Poroshenko praised McKinsey for its 15 years of work in Ukraine. His daughter-in-law also worked for the company during most of his presidency.

Meanwhile, McKinsey has continued to consult for Mr. Akhmetov, sharing the top floor of a Kiev office building with an Akhmetov company. Another Akhmetov company sits a floor below. In fact, Mr. Akhmetov owns the entire building, which includes a business in the lobby fit for an oligarch: an Aston Martin-Rolls Royce dealership.

Building China's Dream

Deep in the Malaysian jungle, a sprawling construction site sits abandoned, the relentless monsoon rain taking its toll on the rusting fields of steel girders.

It is supposed to be a railway -- part of China's signature Belt and Road Initiative, a $1 trillion global undertaking financed by big Chinese loans, and usually built by Chinese companies.

Chief among them is the China Communications Construction Company, a state-owned behemoth whose initials are stenciled in black on the cement plant at the abandoned site.

China Communications, which was barred for eight years from doing business on some World Bank projects because of a corruption scandal, played a leading role in building artificial islands in the South China Sea that have raised tensions with the United States.

The company's subsidiary also built a new port for Sri Lanka. But the debt turned out to be such a burden that the Sri Lankan government had to give up the port and hand it over for 99 years -- to China.

Sri Lanka's fate was so alarming that Malaysia's new prime minister, Mahathir Mohamad, worried that the same thing might happen to him. So he suspended the railway project in July.

""That is not good for us,"" Mr. Mahathir said in September. ""Malaysian workers have no jobs that they can do. All the work is hired from China. You can see how one-sided it is.""

But for McKinsey, it was anything but one-sided. The company represented both parties involved in the deal.

In 2015, as China Communications was building the artificial islands and still under World Bank sanctions, McKinsey signed it on as a client, advising it on strategy.

Months later, McKinsey won another contract: this one with the Malaysian government, to review the feasibility of the rail line.

In a confidential PowerPoint report, McKinsey told Malaysian officials that the rail line could increase economic growth in parts of the country by as much as 1.5 percent. It was a figure that the prime minister at the time, Najib Razak, who now has been charged with corruption, liked to cite.

In bullet points, McKinsey also said the project would help improve ties with China -- ""build the nation-to-nation relationship"" -- because of its importance in China's Belt and Road Initiative.

And McKinsey endorsed the idea of heavy borrowing from China, referring to it as a ""game changer"" elsewhere in the region.

It isn't hard to see where McKinsey's enthusiasm for the Belt and Road Initiative came from: The firm had promoted the Chinese policy at the highest levels of the company.

Dominic Barton, McKinsey's managing partner at the time, made Belt and Road the theme of a keynote address in Beijing in 2015, recounting the Silk Road trade from the second century B.C. onward.

McKinsey's in-house research group, the McKinsey Global Institute, sprang into action, producing reports -- widely cited in the Chinese state news media -- extolling the benefits of the Belt and Road Initiative.

Mr. Barton -- who has served on the advisory board of China Development Bank, one of the two biggest Chinese lenders to the Belt and Road Initiative -- also batted down concerns in a 2015 interview with Chinese state media that the undertaking might be used as a tool to expand China's global influence.

""The world is waiting for the 'One Belt, One Road' grand blueprint to move from dream to reality,"" Mr. Barton and his colleagues wrote in a report published on the company's Chinese website in May 2015, expressing McKinsey's enthusiasm to work on it.

The feeling was mutual. Nine of the top 20 Belt-and-Road contractors are or have been McKinsey clients, according to research by The Times and figures from RWR Advisory Group, which tracks such projects.

In 2016, McKinsey's client, China Communications, won the $13 billion contract to build the Malaysian railroad. McKinsey justified the project at a time when Mr. Najib was widely accused of corruption, buffeted by street protests over the disappearance of hundreds of millions of dollars from a state investment fund, and badly in need of cash from an outside lender like China.

The scandal over the deal has enveloped both of McKinsey's clients. Mr. Mahatir told local reporters that China Communications, which won a no-bid contract for the railroad, may have deliberately overstated the costs in order to help Mr. Najib and his allies shovel extra money into the investment fund to replenish the missing amounts.

Tony Pua, a Malaysian lawmaker and an aide to the finance minister, said the deal was brokered by a hard-partying Malaysian businessman named Jho Low, who is accused of siphoning off hundreds of millions of dollars from the fund and is now believed to be in China, avoiding a Malaysian arrest warrant.

McKinsey says it has no knowledge of any collusion between China and Mr. Najib. It said that of course it would discuss China's sweeping Belt and Road plans but rejected the notion that, by representing both sides involved in the project, the company had a conflict of interest in any way. By the time China Communications won the bid, its work for Malaysia had already finished, the firm said.

""Our firm's rigorous internal policies and procedures"" ensure that ""we bring an independent perspective"" to help each client ""pursue its own strategic goals,"" McKinsey said.

But the political backdrop -- a government facing crippling corruption accusations and the prospect that Mr. Najib might turn to China for funds to cover his tracks -- should have been obvious to McKinsey at the time, argued Bridget Welsh, a professor at John Cabot University in Rome who focuses on Malaysian politics.

""They were choosing to engage with actors that were deeply tainted,"" Ms. Welsh said of McKinsey.

A Special Relationship

It was not the first time McKinsey had been drawn into questionable arrangements through its work in China.

The company opened its first office there in 1995, using consultants from the United States and Britain. By the end the decade, McKinsey was on hand to help as Beijing began pushing its moribund state-owned companies to adopt Western-style management, a McKinsey specialty.

The firm landed some big clients. Its star pupil was Ping An, an insurance company set up as part of a state-owned shipping company. Beginning in 1997, McKinsey began a two-decade relationship with the company as it rose from a footnote to one of the world's biggest insurers.

McKinsey's success soon reached into the pinnacle of Chinese politics, dragging it -- unwittingly and unknowingly, the company contends -- into a potential conflict of interest in the most glaring example of official enrichment in the history of the People's Republic of China.

Always in search of top talent, McKinsey brought on a 27-year-old named Liu Chunhang as a full-time associate in 2002. He had just graduated near the top of his class at Harvard Business School, according to school records, and stayed at McKinsey for less than a year. But in that time, his in-laws took steps that would turn them into billionaires.

Mr. Liu was the son-in-law of Wen Jiabao, the country's vice premier in charge of finance. Several months later, Mr. Wen became China's premier, putting him in charge of running the government.

At the time, McKinsey's client, Ping An, was preparing for an initial public offering in Hong Kong. The Wen family and its business associates became secret shareholders of Ping An, having acquired their stakes at low cost in late 2002. And as premier, Mr. Wen presided over China's cabinet, which oversaw the insurance industry and signed off on big I.P.O.s.

According to McKinsey, Mr. Liu left the company in July 2003. It's not clear whether he played any role in his extended family's business activities. But when Ping An went public the next year, the Wen family amassed a staggering fortune, largely in company stock. By 2007, the family was worth at least $2.7 billion.

Mr. Liu, who is now a senior official at China's banking regulator, said through a spokesman that he ""never worked on any projects for the firm's Chinese clients,"" and that it would be ""misleading"" to connect him with McKinsey's work for Ping An.

McKinsey said that Mr. Liu had been hired because he was qualified, not because of his family connections.

""Any suggestion that Mr. Liu was hired or employed for improper purpose is false and extremely misleading,"" the company said.

Today, China's best and brightest clamor to work at McKinsey. Partners in the firm have sat in on Communist Party meetings at companies. More than 90 percent of the company's 350 consultants in China are of Chinese descent, according to its website.

And the importance of China to McKinsey over all is evident: The firm's last two managing partners, Mr. Barton and Kevin Sneader, were promoted from the region. Mr. Sneader now runs the entire company from Hong Kong.

McKinsey's name has become so prestigious in the country that a Chinese copycat sprang up, adopting the company's Chinese name.

The copycat firm -- Chengdu McKinsey Management Consulting Company -- even won a contract to advise Sichuan Province on its economic planning. Its ruse was so successful that the China Economic Weekly, a magazine under the Communist Party's mouthpiece People's Daily, wrote a cover article about the spreading influence of the real McKinsey, likening it to an octopus, and marveling at the success of the fake one.

McKinsey said it had not worked on the economic planning in Sichuan Province.

The company, however, has not shied away from contentious programs like ""Smart Cities,"" worrying scholars and human rights advocates who say the approach will strengthen China's surveillance state.

The idea of smart cities is to make them more manageable by collecting data from sources like cameras. In an authoritarian state like China, that raises broad concerns.

""Police patrols cannot be everywhere, for instance, but predictive analytics can deploy them in the right place at the right time,"" McKinsey wrote in a report in June.

""It is about political control,"" said Samantha Hoffman, a fellow at the Australian Strategic Policy Institute.

McKinsey is now working with Ping An to put smart cities into practice in the Chinese city of Nanning to monitor financial fraud.

The company has also championed -- even parroted, critics say -- the Chinese government's ""Made in China 2025"" initiative to become a global leader in sensitive fields like artificial intelligence and aerospace, a policy rattling European and American leaders who fear the plans will undermine their economies and set the stage for Chinese dominance.

In October, Vice President Mike Pence warned that ""through the 'Made in China 2025' plan, the Communist Party has set its sights on controlling 90 percent of the world's most advanced industries.""

McKinsey has produced at least 10 reports in Chinese focusing on ""Made in China 2025."" But earlier this year, China's government ordered the news media to stop writing about it, given the intense criticism from the United States and Europe. McKinsey's reports also stopped mentioning the policy.

""They sometimes seem to be almost like an arm of the People's Daily,"" George Magnus, a former chief economist at UBS, said of McKinsey. ""Obviously they do it in a slightly more subtle way -- sometimes not so subtle.""

Clients Under Sanctions

When Senate investigators wanted to know why Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump's son-in-law, met with the head of a Russian bank under sanctions shortly after the 2016 presidential election, Mr. Kushner explained that, as far as he had been told, the bank chief had ""a direct line to the Russian president.""

It is easy to see how. The bank -- Vnesheconombank, or VEB -- is owned by the Russian government and overseen directly by Mr. Putin's inner circle. The bank's former chief -- the one Mr. Kushner met -- graduated from the training school of the F.S.B., the successor agency of the K.G.B. The bank has also come under scrutiny in Congress and by the special counsel investigating possible collusion in the 2016 election.

And the bank is a McKinsey client.

In August, VEB hired the consulting firm to develop its business strategy -- one of several companies that are under sanctions and that McKinsey advises.

Sberbank -- a state-controlled bank that is on the sanctions list and that sponsored Mr. Trump's Miss Universe contest in Moscow in 2013 -- is also a McKinsey client. In 2016, it agreed to pay the firm up to $5.2 million for advice on restructuring.

Yet another state-owned bank under sanctions, VTB, agreed to pay McKinsey about $4.4 million in 2017 to develop information technology.

McKinsey's work in Russia is extensive. Its Moscow office, the largest of the Western consulting firms working there, has handled about 2,000 projects, working with market leaders in oil, gas, banking and retail, as well as the mining of diamonds, gold and coal. One of its senior partners is the son of the Nobel Prize-winning novelist Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn.

McKinsey is so valued in Russia that even as Mr. Putin and Western nations clashed over Ukraine, a partner in the firm served on a Russian energy commission until 2015, along with several business executives who were either the target of individual sanctions or had ties to companies under sanction.

McKinsey clients help expand Russia's reach abroad. One of them -- PhosAgro, a fertilizer giant with ties to the Kremlin -- is pushing hard for new regulations that would give it greater control over Europe's food supply. The European Union already had concerns about Russian influence over its natural gas supply, much of which came from Gazprom, another Russian company under sanctions that McKinsey has advised on strategy and pricing.

McKinsey says it takes jobs in Russia -- or anywhere in the world -- only when it believes it can make a positive contribution. McKinsey also says its consulting is not political in nature, but focused on helping people lead better lives.

The firm has plenty of accomplishments to point to. In Russia alone, it upgraded Aeroflot, the national airline, improved traffic flow in Moscow and improved worker safety.

And McKinsey is far from the only American company working in legal ways with companies under sanctions. Some American officials have long argued that getting involved in the Russian economy not only benefits the American companies working there, but can also help foster better business practices and a greater appreciation for democratic principles overseas.

Others see little evidence of that. Robert G. Berschinski, a State Department official in the Obama administration, said business leaders and policymakers often believed that actively engaging with authoritarian governments would lead to economic reform, which in turn would drive political reform.

""But what is becoming increasingly clear, in Russia, China and Saudi Arabia -- in all three of those instances -- that belief has not proven to be true,"" he said.

China is a prime example, argued Mr. Kramer, the former assistant secretary of state. He said the country had lifted hundreds of millions of people out of poverty, yet companies that do business there ""have nothing to point to"" showing that Chinese people have been granted more civil or political rights.

In some cases, McKinsey's work may have made things worse.

The firm produced a report tracking how some of Saudi Arabia's most important policies were viewed by the public, singling out three individuals who drove often negative conversations on Twitter.

One was later arrested, according to a human rights group. Another said that Saudi government officials had imprisoned two of his brothers and hacked his cellphone. The third -- an anonymous account -- was shut down.

McKinsey said it was ""horrified by the possibility, however remote,"" that the report could have been misused. But the kingdom is such a vital client for the firm -- the source of nearly 600 projects from 2011 to 2016 alone -- that McKinsey chose to participate in a major Saudi investment conference in October even after the killing and dismemberment of a Washington Post columnist by Saudi agents.

""The world is divided into people who are for beheadings and against beheadings,"" said Anand Giridharadas, a former McKinsey consultant and former Times writer. He added that the firm and other companies were lending ""their reputation and credibility to a regime that deserves none of that.""

For 19 months, Calvert W. Jones, a University of Maryland professor, crisscrossed the Gulf monarchies in the Middle East as part of her research evaluating the work of management consultants in what she calls ""the black box of authoritarian governance.""

""Even if democracy itself remains a distant hope, so the thinking goes, experts might improve the daily lives of citizens in fundamental ways,"" Ms. Jones wrote.

Her conclusions are not likely to make it into recruiting videos for consulting companies seeking idealistic college graduates.

""In the beginning, the best of them want to help, want to do real research, provide data and expert opinions,"" she said. But after initially speaking their minds, she said, they gradually stop.

""They engage in the art of not speaking truth to power,"" she said. ""They self-censor, exaggerate successes and downplay their own misgivings due to the incentive structures they face.""

Outside experts might even reduce, rather than encourage, domestic reform, Ms. Jones said, partly because consultants are often unwilling to level with the ruling elite. The issue is becoming increasingly relevant, she said, as ""the number of experts circulating around the world continues to grow.""

The expansion is clear enough in the lobby of the Ritz-Carlton hotel in Riyadh on a weekday morning. There, a former Western diplomat quipped, you can watch the consultants departing for their jobs ""like bats leaving a cave."""
30,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/15/us/ryan-zinke-interior-secretary.html,"Ryan Zinke, the secretary of the Interior Department and a key figure in the president's sweeping plan to reshape the nation's environmental framework, will leave his post at the end of the year, President Trump said on Saturday. Mr. Zinke's departure comes amid numerous ethics investigations into his business dealings, travel and policy decisions.

""Secretary of the Interior @RyanZinke will be leaving the Administration at the end of the year after having served for a period of almost two years,"" Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter. ""Ryan has accomplished much during his tenure and I want to thank him for his service to our Nation."" The president said he would name a replacement next week.

Mr. Zinke is the latest Trump official to exit an administration beset by questions of ethical conflict. And his departure comes as Mr. Trump suggests he will further shake up his White House. In early November, the president fired Attorney General Jeff Sessions, replacing him with a loyalist who will now take charge of the inquiry into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election.

Mr. Zinke, a former Montana congressman and member of the Navy SEALs best known for riding an Irish sport horse through Washington on his first day in office, oversaw mineral extraction and conservation on roughly 500 million acres of public land. He had become the subject of several federal investigations, one of which his department's top watchdog has referred to the Justice Department, a potential step toward a criminal investigation.

The inquiries include an examination of a real estate deal involving Mr. Zinke's family and a development group backed by the Halliburton chairman David J. Lesar. Mr. Zinke stood to benefit from the deal, while Mr. Lesar's oil services company stood to benefit from Mr. Zinke's decisions on fossil fuel production.

Mr. Zinke has repeatedly denied wrongdoing. ""I followed every procedure, every policy, every rule, and most importantly I followed the law,"" he said in an interview in April.

Mr. Zinke's departure follows that of Scott Pruitt, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. Mr. Pruitt, also known for his aggressive rollback of environmental regulations, resigned amid questions about alleged spending abuses, first-class travel and cozy relationships with lobbyists. Among other actions, Mr. Pruitt came under fire for reaching out to the chief executive of Chick-fil-A with the intent of helping his wife open a franchise.

Beyond examining the real estate deal, the interior department's inspector general had faulted Mr. Zinke for allowing his wife, Lola, to travel in government vehicles, contrary to department policy, and chided him for using $12,000 in taxpayer money to take a charter plane after a talk to a hockey team owned by one of his biggest donors.

The inspector general has also been examining the secretary's decision to block two Native American tribes from opening a casino in Connecticut after his office received heavy lobbying from MGM Resorts International. The entertainment giant had been planning its own casino not far from the proposed tribal one.

Delaney Marsco, ethics counsel at the Campaign Legal Center, a nonpartisan watchdog group, said Mr. Zinke's actions had sometimes been overshadowed by Mr. Pruitt's more obvious fumbles. That let the secretary operate in an ""ethical Wild West,"" she said.

""There are these laws and these ethical norms that are being blown to bits by these cabinet secretaries,"" Ms. Marsco said. ""And that's the pattern, the problem, that keeps us up at night.""

In the April interview, Mr. Zinke said, ""It's not going to distract me,"" He went on: ""There is saying that says, 'Do right, fear no man.' While I'm secretary of the interior I'm going to support the president and his agenda and I'm going to do the right thing for America's lands, and I'm going to keep charging up the hill. That's what SEALs do.""

Rather than an end to Mr. Zinke's pro-fossil fuel policies, the resignation quite likely signals a passing of the playbook. Mr. Zinke's deputy, David Bernhardt, a former oil lobbyist, is expected to step in as acting head of the department.

Mr. Zinke, 57, grew up in Whitefish, Mont., a timber and tourism town at the edge of Glacier National Park. When he took charge of the Interior Department, he promised that his youth in the West would help him balance conservation and extraction on the land in his care. Much of that land is in the West, and it includes the national parks and monuments that have become the nation's environmental icons.

With his flashy leadership style and aggressive approach to deregulation, Mr. Zinke had largely escaped the public thrashing that Mr. Trump has directed at other cabinet members. But in recent weeks the president had signaled that the secretary's tenure might be coming to end, possibly as a result of the ethics inquiries.

""I do want to study whatever is being said,"" Mr. Trump said at a news conference on Nov. 7, referring to the investigations into Mr. Zinke. ""I think he's doing an excellent job, but we will take a look at that, and we'll probably have an idea on that in about a week.""

Mr. Zinke was considered a surprise choice for the position. He had reportedly gained favor with Donald Trump Jr., because, like the president's son, he is an avid game hunter.

He ran the office with a swaggering flair that won him the admiration of the president and conservative Westerners, many of whom applauded his effort to move major department operations to places like Denver or Boise, Idaho. But his style also drew derision from the environmental community and the quiet mockery of many career staffers in his own agency. In Washington, he flew a special interior secretary flag above the Interior building when he was present, and he often skipped a coat and tie for fishing shirts and boots. Beyond the capital, he hiked and rode across landscapes in a cowboy hat, even as he pushed plans to drastically reduce monument boundaries.

In June, Politico reported that Mr. Lesar, the Halliburton chairman, was lending financial backing to a major development in Mr. Zinke's hometown, Whitefish, that would significantly raise the value of property owned by the Mr. Zinke. The development would include a hotel, shops and a brewery, and Mr. Zinke's wife had pledged in writing to allow the developer to build a parking lot that would help make the project possible. The land for the potential lot is owned by a foundation created by Mr. Zinke.

Because Halliburton is the nation's largest oil services company, and because Mr. Zinke regulates the oil industry on public land the deal raised questions as to whether it constituted a conflict of interest. Mr. Zinke's schedule also showed that he had hosted Mr. Lesar and a developer involved with the hotel-brewery project in his secretarial office in 2017.

In response, three Democrats sent a letter to the Interior Department's top watchdog, Mary L. Kendall, requesting an investigation into whether Mr. Zinke had used his position as secretary for personal financial gain. In July, Ms. Kendall complied, opening an investigation. In October, her department forwarded at least one inquiry to the Justice Department.

Heather Swift, a spokeswoman for Mr. Zinke, has said that the secretary did nothing wrong and that he resigned from his charitable foundation's board of directors before the deal was made.

Before Mr. Zinke joined the Trump administration, he often called himself a conservative conservationist. But as secretary, he quickly became one of the chief proponents of Mr. Trump's energy-first agenda, promoting policies that seek to open the east coast to offshore drilling, weaken the standards of the Endangered Species Act and shrink two national monuments, constituting the largest rollback of federal land protection in the nation's history.

Last year under Mr. Zinke, the United States offered up 12.8 million acres of federally controlled oil and gas parcels for lease, triple the average offered during President Barack Obama's second term, according to an analysis by The New York Times.

These policies won Mr. Zinke favor with Mr. Trump, who had made promotion of the fossil fuel industry a key part of his campaign platform, as well as from the oil and gas companies that had increasingly made up Mr. Zinke's donor base as a Montana politician.

His policies have angered environmentalists, who have filed lawsuits trying to block these plans. Many have argued that Mr. Zinke has turned his back on the nation's environmental heritage just as dire news about climate change has made land, water and air protection increasingly urgent.

The replacement by Mr. Bernhardt of his former boss in an acting capacity echoes events that followed the resignation of Mr. Pruitt at the E.P.A. Mr. Pruitt, once a favorite of Mr. Trump's for many of the same reasons as Mr. Zinke, was replaced in an acting capacity by his deputy, Andrew Wheeler, a former coal lobbyist with a low profile and a deep knowledge of the agency he ran and the regulations he sought to undo.

While Mr. Zinke spent his tenure as the face of many of the Trump administration's efforts, many on the inside saw Mr. Bernhardt as the effective manager who was able to push policies through. Mr. Bernhardt, with years of experience in the George W. Bush administration, and as a former lawyer and lobbyist for some of the nation's largest oil companies, brings a deep insider's knowledge to his job that Mr. Zinke lacked. His former legal clients included the Independent Petroleum Association of America and Halliburton.

Since his Senate confirmation last summer, Mr. Bernhardt has generated criticism from environmental and government watchdog groups that his new role will create a conflict of interest, as he oversees proposals that could directly benefit his former clients."
31,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/16/opinion/democrats-2020-election-economic-populism.html,"Young or old? Female or male? White, black or Latino? The first stage of the 2020 presidential campaign -- the jockeying stage -- is underway, and Democrats are trying to figure out who the ideal candidate is.

They're asking the wrong questions, though. Demographic identity matters much less than people often imagine. Think about it: Would an algorithm meant to produce the ideal candidate have spat out any of the past three presidents -- a 70-year-old, orange-haired reality-television star, a law professor with the middle name Hussein or the son of a recent one-term president with the very same name?

There is only one quality -- beyond, of course, charisma -- that Democrats should demand in their nominee. The Democrats need a candidate who can and will run as an economic populist.

[Listen to ""The Argument"" podcast every Thursday morning, with Ross Douthat, Michelle Goldberg and David Leonhardt.]

They need a candidate who will organize the 2020 campaign around fighting for the little guy and gal. (And most of the potential Democratic nominees could do so.) It would be a campaign about Republican politicians and corporate lobbyists who are rigging the game, a campaign that promised good jobs, rising wages, decent health care, affordable education and an end to Trumpian corruption.

The country doesn't only need this agenda. It wants this agenda. A mountain of evidence shows that populism -- the real kind, not the faux Trump version -- is the Democrats' most effective political strategy. Yet that evidence often gets obscured by less important issues, like a candidate's race, sex or precise spot on a traditional liberal-conservative spectrum.

I've written several recent columns about what a populist agenda should and shouldn't include, and I'll write more in the coming months. This column focuses on politics, not policy -- to make the case that populism is a winning issue like no other.

It's a populist country.

The first big batch of evidence is public opinion: On economic issues, most Americans are decidedly populist.

More than 60 percent think taxes on upper-income people are too low, according to Gallup. Almost 70 percent say the same about corporations. A clear majority also favors expanded government health care, more college financial aid, a higher minimum wage and tougher anticorruption laws.

When these issues come before voters as ballot initiatives, the results are equally clear. Minimum-wage increases often pass in a landslide, including in red states like Arkansas, Montana and Nebraska. Expansions of Medicaid also keep passing. In Missouri last month, 62 percent of voters approved a law to rein in the influence of lobbyists (a law that the state's Republican leaders are now trying to undermine).

These issues are politically potent because they unite the Democratic coalition and divide the Republican coalition. The Democratic base -- including Africans-Americans, Asian-Americans, Latinos, young college graduates and middle-class women -- leans populist, polling shows. But so do the white-working class voters who often swing 21st-century elections.

Democrats still aren't going to win a majority of the white working class. But they don't need to. They just need to avoid getting crushed. When they do that, they win elections.

Populism won in 2018.

Whether they were social moderates running in red states or proud progressives in safe districts, many of this year's Democratic House candidates ran similar campaigns. They focused on pocketbook issues, not on Trump. They ran as advocates for working families.

In southern New Mexico, Xochitl Torres Small talked about hard work and grit. In northeast Iowa, Abby Finkenauer's campaign slogan was, ""Fighting for Iowa's Working Families."" In dozens of districts, Democrats campaigned on protecting people's health insurance.

And most of these candidates won. If Democrats repeat their 2018 performance in 2020, they will win the White House.

A fascinating analysis of the midterms was published a few weeks ago. It focused on the fraction of people who voted for Barack Obama in 2012, Donald Trump in 2016 and a Democratic House candidate in 2018 -- that is, the national winners in all three elections.

This group is mostly white, mostly without a college degree and disproportionately rural, according to the analysis, by YouGov Blue and Data for Progress. On social issues, the group's attitudes look pretty Republican. Many of its members think sexism isn't that big of a problem, for instance. They express anxiety about demographic change and favor tighter border security.

By The New York Times

These are the sort of voters that some Democrats had written off as irredeemable racists. But that's a terrible mistake.

On economic issues, swing voters look decidedly un-Republican. They are even more populist than loyal Democrats. By a wide margin, they favor free college, a big expansion of Medicare and federal action both to reduce drug prices and to create jobs.

""These voters want leaders who are going to look out for them,"" Alissa Stollwerk of YouGov told me. Trump persuaded many voters that he was their ally by running a racially focused campaign. Democrats have already shown they can win back a meaningful share of them by running an economically focused campaign.

Look at recent history.

It's not just 2018, either. Populism has fared well as a political strategy over the last generation -- a period, not coincidentally, when living standards for most Americans have risen with frustrating slowness.

Trump's populism is a mirage, but many voters believed it in 2016. He was the rare Republican who criticized free trade and seemed to care more about protecting Medicare than reducing the budget deficit. Trump managed to out-populist Hillary Clinton, and it's a part of why he won.

Four years earlier, Barack Obama was the populist candidate. He ran for re-election casting himself as the defender of working people and Mitt Romney as an out-of-touch rich guy. The 2012 Obama was ""more populist than any major party presidential nominee in decades,"" as a column in The Guardian put it. The 2008 Obama, of course, ran against the financial crisis occurring on George W. Bush's watch.

The Democratic president before Obama -- Bill Clinton -- ran as a populist, too. It's true he also pitched himself as a centrist rather than a liberal. But populism isn't the same as liberalism. Most voters don't tote up all of a candidate's policies and try to figure out his or her precise ideology. They care more about the values a candidate projects, and Clinton sold himself as an ally of workers.

He gave the central economic speech of his 1992 campaign at Wharton, the elite business school in Philadelphia -- during which he called the school ""a powerful symbol of where our country went wrong."" Take that, fat cats.

Contrast Bill Clinton and Obama with the Democrats who have lost a presidential election over the last generation: Hillary Clinton, John Kerry and Al Gore. Fairly or not, none of them figured out how to portray themselves as defenders of ordinary families.

Finally, it's worth glancing at other countries where, as in the United States, the middle class has been struggling lately. Populism has also been working, for both good and ill, in many of those places.

In Britain, Brexit was a Trump-like triumph for populist politics. In France, Prime Minister Emmanuel Macron is foundering because he hasn't focused enough on the working class. Across Europe, alternatives on both the left and right are growing at the expense of establishment parties.

Populism takes very different forms -- from odious racism to sensible economics -- but there is no other political style consistently succeeding in the Western world right now.

Who's the populist for 2020?

There is more than one form that a Democratic populist can take. Franklin Roosevelt, the most successful populist of the past century, was an aristocrat. Bill Clinton and Lyndon Johnson were hardscrabble Southerners. Barack Obama managed to do quite well with much of the white working class despite having one big obvious difference from them.

So the need to run a populist campaign in 2020 doesn't point to any specific candidate.

Yes, there are a few for whom populism would come easily, including Joe Biden, Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren. The same applies to Senator Sherrod Brown. While most Democrats were getting thumped in Ohio this year, his blue-collar style helped him win comfortably.

Then there are other candidates for whom a populist campaign would be a natural outgrowth of their careers. Amy Klobuchar, the Minnesota senator, has focused on the disturbing power on large corporations. Kamala Harris, the California senator, has proposed a huge middle-class tax cut.

But almost every single one of the potential Democratic candidates could run a smart populist campaign. Take Beto O'Rourke. His record in the House was not especially populist. He cast a procedural vote for a trans-Pacific trade deal, for example. Yet his Texas Senate campaign captured the energy of the moment. In campaign ads, his top issues included: ""Get big money out of politics"" and ""Jobs for Texans.""

We're living in a populist era. The question is who figures out how to thrive in it. In 2016, it was Trump. It doesn't need to be in 2020.

32,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/16/opinion/editorials/trump-border-troops-visit.html,"President Trump is happy to send the military to the border as a political prop before the midterm elections, to order up a grand parade down Pennsylvania Avenue for his review and to berate athletes who kneel during the national anthem as disrespectful of the military.

But visiting the troops that he has ordered to the front lines in places like Iraq, Afghanistan and Syria has been a bridge too far for this commander in chief.

""I'm going to a war zone,"" Mr. Trump told reporters in November, when pressed about his conspicuous lack of war zone visits.

So far, he's all talk and no boots on the ground.

The president is expected to spend 16 days at his home in Palm Beach, Fla., over the Christmas and New Year's holidays -- his longest trip to the ""Southern White House"" since the inauguration in 2017. The weather there is expected to be a sunny 75 degrees. Perfect for a few rounds of golf, or more than a few.

Temps in Kabul, Afghanistan, during the same period are forecast to be in the mid-40s. There, more than 8,000 soldiers from the United States and more than three dozen allied countries are fighting against a resurgent Taliban after 17 years of war. Little wonder that the mission and the morale of those charged with achieving it are both being seriously questioned.

The forecast is rosier for the border with Mexico, where several thousand soldiers will have to spend the holidays away from their families, having been deployed there in a pre-election ploy by the president to rile up anti-immigrant sentiment.

He probably won't have to worry about rain, which was the excuse given by the White House for his decision not to visit an American military cemetery in France while he was in Paris last month to commemorate the end of World War I.

There have been numerous and conflicting explanations for why Mr. Trump has avoided visiting troops downrange -- he doesn't agree with all the conflicts and doesn't want to be associated with them, he's too busy, he's scared for his safety. Never mind that nearly every president since Dwight Eisenhower has safely visited soldiers in conflict zones from Vietnam and Korea to Iraq and Afghanistan. Barack Obama, for one, visited Iraq as a senator in 2008 and returned within his first three months in the White House. He went to Afghanistan four times.

What Mr. Trump's excuses all reveal, however, is a basic misunderstanding. Visiting soldiers and sailors and Marines in the field isn't about the president. It is about the troops. It's about those who are close to the enemy and far from home, following orders and serving a cause greater than themselves.

A visit from the president isn't just about raising morale and smiling for a few photos, though that can mean more to a young grunt than most civilians may realize. Americans want a president who isn't afraid to look at and reflect upon the consequences of his decisions. It's why presidents visit wounded soldiers at Walter Reed National Medical Center and why they lay wreaths at Arlington National Cemetery, as Mr. Trump did this weekend.

""I'm here on behalf of your commander in chief and all of the American people to pay a debt of honor and respect and gratitude to each and every one of you for your service and your sacrifice,"" Vice President Mike Pence told soldiers and airmen at Bagram Airfield in Afghanistan during a surprise visit in late December last year.

This holiday, it would be heartening to see the president himself deliver the same sentiment to America's troops on the front lines, in his own words.

33,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/18/us/politics/deep-state-trump-classified-information.html,"WASHINGTON -- Call it the deep-state defense.

After the Pentagon stripped an official's security clearance for reading a top-secret paper in public, his allies said he was ""caught in the web of the deep state.""

When federal agents raided the home of a government contractor suspected of taking classified documents, his supporters denounced the ""deep state F.B.I.""

And when a conservative conspiracy theorist rejected a plea deal with the special counsel, he claimed he was targeted because he dared ""to oppose the deep state.""

President Trump has long tried to explain away his legal troubles as the work of a ""deep state"" of Obama supporters entrenched in the law-enforcement and national-security bureaucracies who are just out to get him. Now junior officials and others accused of wrongdoing are making the case that the same purported forces are illegitimately targeting them, too.

The defenses have frustrated some current and former government officials -- including at the White House -- who say the accused are trying obscure their responsibility for mishandling classified information.

Adam Lovinger, a Pentagon analyst, was one of the first to wrap himself in the deep state defense, and he appealed the loss of his security clearance in a closed hearing last week. His lawyer, Sean Bigley, has become one of the architects of the strategy.

""If someone had come to me a couple years and started talking about the deep state, I would have rolled my eyes and said, 'You are in tinfoil-hat territory,'"" Mr. Bigley said. ""But I have now represented well over a dozen people who have been targeted for political reasons.""

A Striking Coincidence?

Alleging misconduct by law enforcement has long been a standard defense tactic, especially in white-collar cases, but the political cast of deep-state-style claims is new, said Samuel Buell, a Duke law professor and former federal prosecutor. He said it seemed to be aimed at getting conservative media attention in the hope that Mr. Trump will come across their case and intervene.

""From the practitioner standpoint, this is not going to appeal to the judge,"" he said. ""You are playing to a different audience -- the one with the pardon power.""

Indeed, Mr. Lovinger has become a cause célèbre on the right. His lawyer has appeared on Fox Business and Sean Hannity's radio program to argue that bureaucrats have weaponized the security clearance process against government workers who are Trump supporters. Conservative media outlets like The Daily Caller, The Washington Free Beacon and Breitbart regularly cover him.

The case traces to a September 2016 Hawaiian Airlines flight from New York to Honolulu during which Mr. Lovinger reviewed a document with labels showing it contained highly classified information. Unbeknown to Mr. Lovinger, he was sitting next to a naval intelligence officer. When the plane landed, the officer immediately reported the security breach.

By the time Mr. Lovinger joined the staff of the National Security Council five months later under President Trump, his troubles were mounting. He faced additional investigations into allegations that he had orchestrated the leak of information to a reporter and improperly increased the security clearance of a Pentagon contractor, according to a summary of the inquiry.

In May 2017, Mr. Lovinger's own clearance was suspended, and he was escorted out of the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, Mr. Bigley said.

Determined to win it back, Mr. Lovinger fashioned himself a victim of Democratic-supporting national security officials. ""Security clearances are being weaponized against the White House by hostile career bureaucrats, thwarting the president's agenda by holding up or blocking appointees,"" Mr. Bigley, his lawyer, wrote in a Wall Street Journal Op-Ed this spring.

Mr. Bigley disputes the Pentagon's charges, saying the document on the plane was improperly marked and contained no real top-secret information and that his client leaked to no one. As for the dispute over the contractor's clearance, Mr. Bigley insisted that his client followed procedure.

The real motive for the scrutiny, Mr. Bigley said, stemmed from complaints Mr. Lovinger made in 2016 about lucrative Pentagon contracts awarded to outside consultants, including at the Office of Net Assessment, the Pentagon's strategy group where he worked.

Their defense took on its deep-state tinge over the summer after an academic named Stefan Halper, the recipient of one of the contracts Mr. Lovinger had questioned, was identified as an F.B.I. informant who sought information from Trump associates during the early stages of the investigation into ties between the campaign and Russia.

As Mr. Trump and conservative media began to portray Mr. Halper as a deep-state spy inside the Trump campaign, labeling it Spygate, Mr. Bigley amplified his deep-state defense. Though Mr. Lovinger had not known about Mr. Halper's work for the F.B.I., he had complained about his Pentagon contract.

""Mr. Lovinger was targeted because he blew the whistle on Stefan Halper and a Clinton crony getting suspicious defense contracts,"" said Tom Fitton of the conservative watchdog group Judicial Watch, which has sued for files about the case. ""It is disturbing that the Defense Department may now be implicated in Spygate targeting of President Trump.""

But there is no evidence Mr. Lovinger's clearance was revoked for political reasons, said Robert O. Work, the deputy secretary of defense in both the Obama and Trump administrations, asserting the officials who oversaw Mr. Lovinger were fiercely apolitical. ""It is quite surprising to me that someone would think this is some sort of deep state,"" Mr. Work said.

Mr. Lovinger has a found champion in Representative Louie Gohmert, Republican of Texas, who said this year without evidence that he believed the Justice Department was ""spying"" on him for his criticism of the Russia inquiry. Mr. Gohmert has introduced a bill, the Adam S. Lovinger Whistleblower Reprisal Act of 2018, aimed at giving additional protections to government employees who report wrongdoing.

A Spreading Strategy

While Mr. Lovinger may have seized on the defense early, it is spreading. Jerome Corsi, who recently published a book called ""Killing the Deep State,"" employed it as he began publicly discussing his potential plea deal last month with the special counsel overseeing the Russia investigation, Robert S. Mueller III.

In November, Mr. Corsi decided against agreeing to plead guilty to lying to Mr. Mueller's investigators, who have questioned him about whether he had advance knowledge of WikiLeaks' plans to publish stolen Democratic emails during the 2016 campaign.

Mr. Corsi has insisted he simply misremembered events and portrayed himself a victim of Mr. Trump's purported enemies in law enforcement and national security.

""I guess I am going to have to go to prison for the rest of my life because I dare to oppose the deep state,"" Mr. Corsi said.

Others targeted by Mr. Mueller have taken up the mantle. George Papadopoulos, the Trump campaign adviser who served two weeks in prison for lying to investigators, is working on his own book: ""Deep State Target.""

Last month, F.B.I. agents searched the home of Dennis N. Cain, the former bureau contractor, as part of a counterintelligence investigation, suggesting they had information that Mr. Cain was illegally storing copies of classified bureau documents there.

Mr. Cain had provided copies of the F.B.I. files to the Justice Department inspector general as part of a whistle-blower complaint. The documents related to the Clinton Foundation and Uranium One, a Canadian mining company whose sale in 2013 to the Russian state-owned nuclear power corporation was subject to American approval because the nuclear fuel is considered a strategic asset.

The State Department under Hillary Clinton approved the sale, and a conspiracy theory has developed that she signed off because a businessman who once owned much of the company had made a large donation to her foundation years earlier. There is no evidence Mrs. Clinton played any personal role in approving the deal, but the theory has gained credence in conservative circles.

After The Daily Caller first reported the raid on Mr. Cain, conservative websites piled on, arguing that it showed a deep-state cabal in control of the F.B.I. Donald Trump Jr. linked on Twitter to another Daily Caller story about the raid. And Mr. Cain joined in last week: ""So I blow the whistle on the FBI, get raided by the same FBI, and now they want to keep the FBI's reasons secret?"" he wrote in a since-deleted Twitter post. ""Do we now live in a secret police state? Feels a little like '1984.'""

A reporter for The Daily Caller wrote in an email last week sent to congressional aides, right-wing figures and others that prosecutors were engaged in a ""cover-up for the F.B.I."" The reporter, Richard Pollock, added: ""Eventually, justice will be done.""

The F.B.I. declined to comment.

The inspector general delivered the documents to the congressional intelligence committees, a person familiar with the case said. The Senate Intelligence Committee received documents they believed to be from Mr. Cain but deemed them meaningless, according to a committee official. The committee has decided not to interview Mr. Cain; Republicans and Democrats on the panel had already concluded they had no compelling reason to scrutinize the uranium deal.

Still, Senator Chuck Grassley, Republican of Iowa and chairman of the Judiciary Committee, has demanded that the inspector general provide him copies of Mr. Cain's documents and asked the F.B.I. about the raid.

And some organizations, including left-leaning groups, have criticized the raid, saying Mr. Cain should have enjoyed whistle-blower protections. Mr. Cain and his lawyer say they followed federal whistle-blower rules.

But by bringing the documents home, Mr. Cain violated those rules and lost his legal protections, experts said. ""The rules must be followed,"" said Mark S. Zaid, a national security lawyer who has represented whistle-blowers. ""It is a very simple and straightforward concept."""

35,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/17/world/americas/mexico-migrants-trump.html,"MEXICO CITY -- Mexico's new government has a strategy for dealing with President Trump.

Don't anger him. Don't cave in to him. Try to get him to join an ambitious investment plan to stem migration by creating jobs in Central America.

And if Mr. Trump is not convinced, remind him that there's another player in the region willing to step into the vacuum left by the United States and become a powerful presence in its back yard: China.

That, in a nut shell, is the Mexican government's plan to defuse the standoff over the thousands of migrants amassed at its border with the United States, hoping to make it across.

Mexico's approach was officially rolled out last week, when Andrés Manuel López Obrador, the country's new president, introduced what he called a ""Marshall Plan"" to address the root causes of Central American migration: a $30 billion initiative to redevelop the region and welcome migrants into Mexico with visas, health care and employment.

The proposal, which Mexican officials have likened to the plan to rebuild postwar Europe, is a break with Mr. López Obrador's predecessor, who considered allowing people seeking asylum in the United States to remain in Mexico, as Mr. Trump demanded.

And Mexico's new plan is, in many respects, the opposite of Mr. Trump's vow to crack down on migration, which includes building a wall, deploying the military and cutting aid to Central America.

Mexican officials say they are not going to force a confrontation with Mr. Trump by demanding that he take the migrants onto American soil; that would only anger the American president, and he would not do it anyway, they say.

But at the same time, they say they are not going to strike a deal with the United States to keep asylum seekers on the Mexican side of the border. That would allow Mr. Trump to claim a victory Mexican officials are not willing to give him.

Instead, they want to change the focus of the conversation to developing the economy of Central America, creating jobs there so people don't have to stream north in the first place.

And how does Mr. López Obrador's new government hope to convince Mr. Trump that he should care about investing in Central America?

Enter China, or at least the perceived threat to the United States posed by its growing engagement in the region.

While it is unclear whether Chinese interests would include supporting a plan to curb migration out of Central America, in recent years the country has increased its presence there, funding infrastructure projects, tightening ties with governments and even convincing a handful of Central American nations to switch their diplomatic recognition of Taiwan to China -- a sticking point with the Americans.

By privately raising the prospect of China assisting in the new regional development plan, Mexico is trying to leverage the region's changing reality in its favor, given that it cannot take cooperation with the United States for granted.

""For a long time there has been this competition within Latin America for influence, where China is willing to invest billions in infrastructure and energy that the United States simply isn't,"" said Duncan Wood, the director of the Mexico Institute at the Wilson Center.

The approach is also a reflection of the distinct personalities of Mr. López Obrador and Mr. Trump: Both are mavericks -- albeit on opposite sides of the political spectrum -- and both are willing to break with long-established conventions.

""Partly because of Trump and partly because of Andrés Manuel, there is an opening there,"" Mr. Wood said.

Unlike his predecessor, Mr. López Obrador is willing to chart an independent course in his response to the Trump administration -- partly because of Mr. Trump's hard line on migration and partly out of a conviction that the only way to tackle the issue is to go after its root causes.

And to do that, Mexico will look for help wherever it can find it, including in China, which has already expressed an interest in Mr. López Obrador's plan to lay hundreds of miles of track for a tourist train in the Yucatán Peninsula -- a project widely opposed by environmental advocates.

Of course, that does not mean Mexico will make a sharp turn to China, given its longstanding relationship with the United States. Nor does floating the idea that China may participate make Mexico's costly proposal any more plausible.

""The money is just not there,"" said Mark Feierstein, the former senior director for Western Hemisphere affairs at the National Security Council during the Obama administration. He noted that the United States was spending more than $650 million a year in Central America's Northern Triangle, which is composed of Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador.

But that may be beside the point.

""If nothing else, it is a good bargaining chip,"" said Doris Meissner, a senior fellow at the Migration Policy Institute in Washington, of the idea that China could increase its investment in the region. ""Both sides are laying down their frameworks and their points of view as to how they should they proceed.""

The idea that China could increase its influence in Mexico emerged even before Mr. López Obrador came into office.

""I heard from senior Mexican officials during the transition that if the United States is not going to treat Mexico with respect, don't be surprised if you see a Chinese submarine in a Mexican port,"" said Juan Gonzalez, who was an adviser to Vice President Joseph R. Biden on Central America.

""I think it was hyperbolic,"" he said of the outgoing officials' warning before adding, ""I think Mexico sees increased political risk coming from the political process in the United States and they are diversifying their interests.""

Since taking office on the first of this month, Mr. López Obrador has done nothing if not shake up the establishment.

He has announced the cancellation of the construction of a new airport, a multibillion-dollar project that was well underway, and temporarily suspended new auctions for oil exploration in Mexico. He has also cut salaries for government employees and proposed a measure to dismantle a much-vaunted education overhaul.

In his first few weeks in office, as on the campaign trail, Mr. López Obrador has focused on domestic issues -- an inward-looking vision that differs from recent Mexican presidents who saw the global stage as the nation's future.

But the migrant crisis forced its way to the top of the agenda, proving a frustrating first test for Mr. López Obrador.

The arrival of thousands of migrants traveling in caravans from Honduras and other countries in Central America raised the profile of an existing problem, raising the stakes and forcing Mr. López Obrador to decide how to manage it just days after taking office.

For decades, Mexico kept its head down as hundreds of thousands of migrants -- many of them Mexican -- made their way into the United States. But in recent years, the nation's status as a transit country has changed.

Mexico is becoming a destination, not just a portal to the United States. Every year, more people apply for asylum in Mexico, and many more choose to stay and seek work. A bottleneck in the United States has meant that thousands of migrants are stuck waiting months at the border for their initial asylum interview.

In 2014, at the urging of the Obama administration, the Mexican government adopted a tough policing strategy along its southern border with Guatemala that essentially amounted to detention and deportation. But that also failed to curtail the flow of migrants.

Today, with some 10,000 migrants having entered Mexico in caravans that focused global media attention on their plight, mass roundups and deportations are not an option, officials say. Nor is striking a deal with the Trump administration to host the migrants indefinitely.

And so the government of Mr. López Obrador is trying to fold them into Mexican society -- and raise money to invest in projects that would create employment and prosperity in the region.

""It's not enough just to point out that the causes of migration have to be dealt with,"" said Marcelo Ebrard, Mexico's foreign secretary, adding that Mexico wants to counter the idea ""that the best way to confront migration is through exclusion and control.""

This is, in part, a recognition that Mexico forms a part of a busy migration corridor and that, with or without help from the United States, it has to deal with the issue.

""Finally, the issue of the Northern Triangle and migration is seen as a regional issue,"" said Rafael Fernández de Castro, the director of the Center for U.S.-Mexican Studies at the University of California, San Diego, and a former Mexican presidential adviser. ""There is a window of opportunity: The knowledge and awareness have never been as clear as they are now.""

Mr. López Obrador is also signaling an interest in playing a broader leadership role in the region, as Mexico did during the 1970s and 1980s.

""Mexico wants to take back leadership in the region,"" said Rodolfo Cruz Piñeiro, director of the department for population studies at the College of the Northern Border in Tijuana. ""Mexico is telling the U.S.: 'I can control this region for you, but I need your economic help.'""

""What will the U.S. ask? That's the great unknown,"" he added."
36,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/26/us/politics/government-shutdown-wall.html,"WASHINGTON -- With a partial government shutdown stretching past Day 5, the impasse over funding a wall at the southwestern border has highlighted the debate over effective border security, with a breakthrough possibly hinging on a semantic argument: What is a wall?

Lawmakers will return to Capitol Hill on Thursday to resume negotiations over either a stopgap spending bill to reopen nine federal departments and several government agencies or broader measures to fund the government through September. But the White House and Democrats remain at odds over the $5 billion that President Trump is demanding for a wall, his signature campaign promise.

Representative Steve Scalise of Louisiana, the majority whip, told House members on Wednesday that no votes were expected on Thursday. That signaled that the shutdown would almost certainly stretch through the weekend -- and probably into the new year. More than likely, it will fall to House Democrats to pass legislation reopening the government when they take control on Jan. 3.

The president told reporters on Wednesday that he would do ""whatever it takes"" to ensure funding was provided for the wall he once bragged Mexico would pay for.

""We need a wall,"" Mr. Trump said during a visit to American troops in Iraq. ""We need safety for our country. Even from this standpoint.""

Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the Democratic leader who is expected to be elected speaker next week, told USA Today: ""He says, 'We're going to build a wall with cement, and Mexico's going to pay for it' while he's already backed off of the cement. Now he's down to, I think, a beaded curtain or something. I'm not sure where he is.""

Democrats say they have little reason to negotiate. The administration has spent only 6 percent of the $1.7 billion allocated during the 2017 and 2018 fiscal years for physical barriers on the border, they said. About $1.3 billion was designated in 2018 for different types of fencing in areas that would have covered about 96 miles, but rising costs have shaved off 12 miles.

With so little spent, Democrats argue, Congress has no business more than doubling this year's allocation. But a Republican aide said that all but $70 million of the money allocated in 2018 had been committed to border security projects.

Mr. Trump and his conservative allies are trying to paint their opponents as unwilling to invest in border security, while Democrats are working to draw a distinction between the current showdown and past border fights, when Congress approved billions of dollars in funding for hundreds of miles of fencing, barriers, drones and other measures to impede illegal immigration.

A wall ""would be spending an enormous amount of money that would not achieve the taxpayers' goal,"" said Robert Menendez, Democrat of New Jersey and one of eight senators who negotiated a bipartisan immigration overhaul that passed the Senate in 2013.

""There is not a one-size-fits-all solution -- a wall, slats, whatever -- and nobody who has ever looked at this question has said that that is the solution,"" he added.

While a final decision has not been made, Ms. Pelosi will most likely seek a swift vote on the legislation the House spurned before funding lapsed: the Senate's stopgap spending bill would provide funding through Feb. 8, according to a House Democratic aide familiar with the negotiations.

Because next month will herald a new Congress, the Senate will have to pass it again. And there is no guarantee that Mr. Trump will sign it.

""We are still open to discussion,"" said Representative Bennie Thompson, Democrat of Mississippi and the incoming chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee. ""I would say that the wall is the problem. Most people we talk to say the wall is a political answer to a problem that really requires a thoughtful, a more pragmatic response.""

Whether Mr. Trump signs the bill might depend on whether he and Democrats can agree to disagree on what a border barrier is called. Democrats have accepted fencing in the past. Mr. Trump has taken to intermittently calling his barrier a wall or ""aesthetically pleasing steel slats.""

In Iraq, he told reporters he was planning on ""going to the wall"" on the Mexican border next year for a ""ground breaking."" He said he planned to visit the border before his State of the Union address, usually given toward the end of January.

It was one of a series of inscrutable statements from the president since parts of the government closed, furloughing 380,000 federal workers and forcing over 420,000 to work without pay. On Monday, he tweeted that he had signed a contract to build 115 miles of border wall in Texas, an odd pronouncement given that the Homeland Security Department ran out of money at midnight on Dec. 21. The department referred questions to the White House, which has yet to offer an explanation.

As the impasse continues, the president and other conservatives have pointed to previous votes -- including the Secure Fence Act of 2006 and the Senate bill that Mr. Menendez helped negotiate -- as evidence that Democratic objections are driven by spite for the president, not opposition to the policy itself.

""Chuck Schumer and Senate Dems should support more border security -- just like they have in the past,"" Ronna McDaniel, the chairwoman of the Republican Party, tweeted on Wednesday. ""In 2013, every single Senate Democrat supported $46 BILLION, which included 700 miles of barrier with Mexico.""

The existing fence, which Mr. Trump has started to claim was built under his administration, was actually begun under President Bill Clinton, a Democrat, and has steadily grown in fragments, said Wayne Cornelius, an immigration expert at the University of California, San Diego. Experts continue to question its effectiveness, even as it expands.

""The fact remains that border enforcement -- especially the construction of physical barriers -- has never kept determined migrants out of the country,"" Mr. Cornelius said in an email, describing the current system as an ""elaborate obstacle course"" for migrants seeking to enter the country illegally.

The $1.3 billion allocated for border security funding in the 2018 fiscal year, which ended Sept. 30, successfully passed the Senate with bipartisan support -- and the president acquiesced angrily to signing it into law. That money, however, can be used only to replicate or improve existing fences on the border.

The spending bill that passed through the Senate Appropriations Committee with bipartisan support this year offered similar restrictions on the $1.6 billion the Trump administration formally requested. And Democrats are determined to maintain those restrictions once they take control of the House.

A senior Democratic aide said it was impossible to say whether the steel slats Mr. Trump has recently talked about would qualify as the fencing detailed in the bill, given the president's shifting descriptions of what he wants.

Mr. Trump's demand ""doesn't comply with what the professionals at homeland security said they needed to secure the border,"" said Senator Michael Bennet, Democrat of Colorado. ""There is an absolutely massive difference. It's as if he entered the policy debate believing what he says and not understanding how false his statements are.""

Mr. Bennet this year helped put together the compromise that would have allocated $25 billion in wall money in exchange for offering legal residence to thousands of young immigrants brought to the United States illegally as children. Based on his interactions with the White House in the last year, he said he does not believe Mr. Trump actually wants a solution, merely an issue to use for political scores.

Some Republicans have dismissed the distinction between fencing and wall and said a wall could be an improvement to barriers along portions of the border.

""The hard line of the Democrats is ridiculous,"" said former Representative Jack Kingston, a Georgia Republican whose years on the House Appropriations Committee overlapped with a number of debates on border security. ""You have to come to the table with something you want and something you're willing to give.""

However, Mr. Kingston added, Republicans erred in not ""continuously building the case for why a wall is important.""

But in places where border fencing is already in place, there is confusion over whether a concrete wall could be an enhancement.

For years in San Diego, most residents have referred to the barrier there as a fence. But some have taken to calling it a wall, in a nod to the president's campaign messaging and the barrier's three reinforced layers of sheet metal, concrete columns and metal fence edged by razor wire.

""I'm not sure what more they could plan to do here; we have a pretty extensive border wall here already that dates back to Bush, when they raised the height and added more layers,"" said Serge Dedina, the mayor of Imperial Beach, who has spent his whole life on the border. ""It has significantly changed already. As always with the border, it has nothing to do with reality. We're the safest beach city in San Diego County.""

Denise Moreno Ducheny, a senior policy adviser at the University of California, San Diego's Center for U.S.-Mexican Studies, condemned Mr. Trump's vision of a border wall as ""a fourth-century solution to a 20th-century problem.""

""If you are going to do more things to secure the border, do it with more intelligence, more technology,"" she said. ""The whole idea that you are going to build a Great Wall of China between California and Mexico is just silly.""

Some activists in California have used the word ""wall"" to describe the fencing for years, including Enrique Morones, who leads the group Border Angels, which leaves water and other aid for those crossing through the desert.

""When people hear fence, they think of it as something that you have with your neighbor, not something that has led to the deaths of thousands of people,"" he said, pointing to the number of migrants who have moved farther east to more treacherous terrain.

""President Bush, President Obama, they all reinforced what was already there,"" he added. ""The only difference is they didn't think it was a major political win for them."""
37,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/26/us/reid-hoffman-alabama-election-disinformation.html,"Reid Hoffman, the tech billionaire whose money was spent on Russian-style social media deception in a Senate race last year, apologized on Wednesday, saying in a statement that he had not approved the operation and did not support such tactics in American politics.

Mr. Hoffman said he had no idea that political operatives whose work he had financed had used fakery on Facebook and Twitter in the special Senate election a year ago in Alabama. But he had an obligation to track how his money was spent, he said, and he promised to exercise more care in the future.

""I categorically disavow the use of misinformation to sway an election,"" said Mr. Hoffman, a co-founder of LinkedIn and a prominent figure at the intersection of Silicon Valley and Democratic politics. He said he had financed ""organizations trying to re-establish civic, truth-focused discourse"" and was ""embarrassed"" to learn his money had been spent on disinformation.

The New York Times and The Washington Post reported last week that $100,000 from Mr. Hoffman was spent on a deceptive social media campaign to aid Doug Jones, the Democratic candidate, who barely defeated the Republican, Roy Moore.

The money went to a small group of social media experts that included Jonathon Morgan, the chief executive of New Knowledge, a cybersecurity firm.

They created a Facebook page intended to look like the work of conservative Alabamians, and used it to try to split Republicans and promote a conservative write-in candidate to take votes from Mr. Moore.

They also used thousands of Twitter accounts to make it appear as if automated Russian bot accounts were following and supporting Mr. Moore, according to an internal report on the project. The apparent Russian support for Mr. Moore drew broad news media coverage.

Democratic political strategists say the small Alabama operation -- which accounts for a minuscule share of the $51 million spent in the contest -- was carried out as a debate about tactics intensified within the party.

Democrats had been shocked to learn of Russia's stealth influence campaign to damage Hillary Clinton and promote Donald J. Trump in the 2016 presidential race. But at least a few Democrats thought their party could not shun such tactics entirely if others were going to continue to use them.

The Alabama operation is among the first examples to come to light of such underhanded methods on social media in American politics. But because such efforts are generally very easy to hide and very difficult to trace, it is possible that other instances have gone undetected.

In 2017, through a fund called Investing in Us, Mr. Hoffman gave money to a small company, American Engagement Technologies. The company's leader, Mikey Dickerson, is a former Google employee who founded the United States Digital Service during the Obama administration to try to upgrade the federal government's use of technology. An associate of Mr. Hoffman's said that his total grant to American Engagement was $750,000, which also went toward other political races and social media research. Mr. Dickerson has declined to comment.

American Engagement then passed $100,000 to Mr. Morgan and other researchers. Mr. Hoffman's statement says the money went to Mr. Morgan's company, New Knowledge, but Mr. Morgan said the Alabama project was carried out separately from the company.

The revelations of and fallout from the operation are being closely watched. Some American political experts fear that the Russian influence campaign of 2016 could become a dangerous model for stateside politics, with dirty tricks on social media becoming common. Laws and regulations have not been updated to cope with such a threat.

On Saturday, Facebook shut down five accounts, belonging to Mr. Morgan and other unnamed individuals, in response to their use of ""inauthentic"" operations on the platform. Twitter declined to say whether it had taken any action in the Alabama case.

Senator Jones and Democratic Party officials have said they were unaware of the social media tactics and denounced them. Mr. Jones has called for investigations by the Justice Department and the Federal Election Commission -- a call Mr. Hoffman joined on Wednesday.

""We cannot permit dishonest campaign tactics to go unchecked in our democracy -- no matter which side they purportedly help,"" Mr. Hoffman said in his statement.

Mr. Hoffman, whose net worth is estimated by Forbes at $1.7 billion, has long been involved in politics. In 2017 he co-founded an organization called Win the Future that billed itself as a ""nonpartisan project lab"" intended to encourage every American to become an informed voter. He has also supported Vote.org, which has a similar goal, and Higher Ground Labs, a start-up to help progressive candidates.

He has made no secret of his opposition to President Trump, and in 2016 he offered to donate $5 million to veterans' groups if Mr. Trump released his tax returns."
38,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/26/opinion/editorials/climate-change-environment-trump.html,"The editorial board represents the opinions of the board, its editor and the publisher. It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section.

It's hard to believe but it was only three years ago this month -- just after 7 p.m., Paris time, Dec. 12, to be precise -- that delegates from more than 190 nations, clapping and cheering, whooping and weeping, rose to celebrate the Paris Agreement -- the first genuinely collective response to the mounting threat of global warming. It was a largely aspirational document, without strong legal teeth and achieved only after contentious and exhausting negotiations. But for the first time in climate talks stretching back to 1992, it set forth specific, numerical pledges from each country to reduce emissions so that together they could keep atmospheric temperatures from barreling past a point of no return.

Two weeks ago, delegates met at a follow-up conference in Katowice, Poland, to address procedural questions left unsettled in Paris, including common accounting mechanisms and greater transparency in how countries report their emissions. In this the delegates largely succeeded, giving rise to the hope, as Brad Plumer put it in The Times, that ""new rules would help build a virtuous cycle of trust and cooperation among countries, at a time when global politics seems increasingly fractured.""

But otherwise it was a hugely dispiriting event and a fitting coda to one of the most discouraging years in recent memory for anyone who cares about the health of the planet -- a year marked by President Trump's destructive, retrograde policies, by backsliding among big nations, by fresh data showing that carbon dioxide emissions are still going up, by ever more ominous signs (devastating wildfires and floods, frightening scientific reports) of what a future of unchecked greenhouse gas emissions is likely to bring.

The conference itself showcased the very fossil fuels that scientists and most sentient people agree the world must rapidly wean itself from. Poland's president, Andrzej Duda, set the tone by declaring he had no intention of abandoning coal, which provides nearly four-fifths of Poland's electricity. The United States and three other major oil producers -- Saudi Arabia, Kuwait and Russia -- refused to endorse an alarming report issued in October by the United Nations scientific panel on climate change calling for swift reductions in fossil fuel use by 2030 to avoid the worst consequences of climate change, which it said were approaching much faster than anyone had thought.

Wells Griffith, Mr. Trump's international energy and climate adviser, managed in one quote to summarize the dismissiveness of the American delegation and its fealty to the president's apparently unshakable conviction that anything that helps the environment must inevitably hurt the economy. ""The United States has an abundance of natural resources and is not going to keep them in the ground,"" he said. ""We strongly believe that no country should have to sacrifice their economic prosperity or energy security in pursuit of environmental sustainability."" The administration is full of zero-sum philosophers like Mr. Griffith. The idea that sustainability may be a necessary condition of future economic growth appears never to have crossed their minds.

Further depressing the proceedings were recent defections and political troubles in countries that, along with the United States, had been expected to lead the way to a low-carbon energy future. Germany, which long ago walked away from carbon-free nuclear power, is having a hard time cutting back on coal because of political opposition. In Australia, a prime minister was kicked out of office because he wanted to reduce the use of coal, which Australia produces in abundance. China, despite admirably aggressive investments in wind and solar power, has yet to get a firm grip on its emissions from coal-fired plants. The new president-elect of Brazil, Jair Bolsonaro, not only named an outspoken climate-change denier as his foreign minister but also, reversing his predecessors' policy, pledged to open up the Amazon to mining and farming. This will threaten biodiversity in one of the world's great rain forests while crippling its ability to act as a sink for carbon emissions.

No country's backsliding, of course, compares with Mr. Trump's. Determined to demolish President Barack Obama's entire climate strategy, Mr. Trump has in the past year replaced Mr. Obama's clean-power plan, which was aimed at reducing carbon dioxide emissions from power plants, with an essentially useless substitute that would emit 12 times the pollution envisaged by the Obama plan. He has proposed weakening a major Obama regulation requiring automakers to nearly double the fuel economy of passenger vehicles by 2025. (This rollback, The Times reported this month, came after a lot of whining by oil interests, not, as one might suspect, from the auto companies, which had accepted the challenge.) And the Environmental Protection Agency and the Interior Department have taken multiple steps to roll back Obama-era efforts to control emissions of methane, a greenhouse gas many times more powerful than carbon dioxide. These three programs formed the basis of Mr. Obama's pledge at the 2015 Paris meeting to reduce America's greenhouse gas emissions by 26 percent to 28 percent below 2005 levels by 2025.

The health and environmental effects of the Trump rollbacks, as documented by a Times investigation published this week, are far-reaching and potentially devastating.

This holiday season has brought more gifts to fossil fuel interests; every day is Christmas Day for the likes of Murray Energy and Exxon Mobil. This month, the E.P.A. proposed killing an Obama rule that would effectively block the construction of new coal-fired power plants. The Interior Department relaxed restrictions on oil and gas drilling in areas inhabited by the sage grouse, a threatened bird. Also in December, the department released an environmental-impact statement that would open all or part of the 1.5 million-acre coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to leasing and exploration. The area had been off limits to drilling for decades until Congress, late last year, approved an amendment sponsored by Senator Lisa Murkowski, an Alaska Republican, to open it up.

All this is fundamentally Mr. Trump's doing. A series of early executive orders established the pro-fossil fuel policy framework; Scott Pruitt, the E.P.A. administrator, and Ryan Zinke, the interior secretary, filled in the details. Mr. Pruitt has left Washington and Mr. Zinke is in his final days, both finishing under ethical clouds. They will deserve, along with Mr. Trump, history's censure for doing virtually nothing to move to a more responsible energy future -- and for not doing so at just the moment when the world needed the kind of leadership that Mr. Obama and his secretary of state, John Kerry (and Bill Clinton and Al Gore before them), tried to provide.

The numbers are not great. The goal in Paris was to keep warming from exceeding 2 degrees Celsius over preindustrial levels, and if possible to hold the line at 1.5 degrees, thresholds that scientists deemed unacceptably risky. Delegates knew that even if every country managed to fulfill its individual pledges, the world would be on pace for 3 degrees of warming in this century. So they agreed to tighten the targets as time went on, but instead they've slid backward. Many large emitters are not on track to meet their self-imposed goals. That includes America, despite the retirement of many coal-fired plants in favor of cleaner natural gas, the increasing cost competitiveness of renewable fuels like wind and solar power, and the valiant efforts of states like California to sharply reduce their own emissions and lead where Mr. Trump will not.

The bottom line, according to the Global Carbon Project, is that after three years in which emissions remained largely flat, global levels of carbon dioxide increased by 1.6 percent in 2017 and are on pace to jump by 2.7 percent this year. Some scientists have likened the increase in emissions to a ""speeding freight train."" That has a lot to do with economic growth. It also has a lot to do with not moving much faster to less carbon-intensive ways of powering that growth. Or in Mr. Trump's case, moving in the opposite direction.

39,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/21/us/politics/supreme-court-asylum-trump.html,"WASHINGTON -- The Supreme Court on Friday refused to revive a Trump administration initiative barring migrants who enter the country illegally from seeking asylum.

The court was closely divided, with Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. joining the four-member liberal wing in turning down the administration's request for a stay of a trial judge's order blocking the program.

The court's brief order gave no reasons for its action. Justices Clarence Thomas, Samuel A. Alito Jr., Neil M. Gorsuch and Brett M. Kavanaugh said they would have granted the stay.

In a proclamation issued on Nov. 9, President Trump barred migrants from applying for asylum unless they made the request at a legal checkpoint. Only those applying at a port of entry would be eligible, Mr. Trump said, invoking what he said were his national security powers to protect the nation's borders.

Lower courts blocked the initiative, ruling that a federal law plainly allowed asylum applications from people who had entered the country unlawfully.

""Any alien who is physically present in the United States or who arrives in the United States,"" the relevant federal statute says, may apply for asylum -- ""whether or not at a designated port of arrival.""

Judge Jon S. Tigar of the United States District Court in San Francisco issued a temporary restraining order blocking the initiative nationwide. ""Whatever the scope of the president's authority,"" Judge Tigar wrote, ""he may not rewrite the immigration laws to impose a condition that Congress has expressly forbidden.""

Mr. Trump attacked Judge Tigar, calling him an ""Obama judge."" Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr. took issue with the characterization, saying that federal judges apply the law without regard to the policies of the presidents who appointed them.

A divided three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit, in San Francisco, refused to stay Judge Tigar's order. The majority opinion was written by Judge Jay S. Bybee, who was appointed by President George W. Bush.

""We are acutely aware of the crisis in the enforcement of our immigration laws,"" Judge Bybee wrote. ""The burden of dealing with these issues has fallen disproportionately on the courts of our circuit. And as much as we might be tempted to revise the law as we think wise, revision of the laws is left with the branch that enacted the laws in the first place -- Congress.""

The Trump administration then urged the Supreme Court to issue a stay of Judge Tigar's ruling, saying the president was authorized to address border security by imposing the new policy.

""The United States has experienced a surge in the number of aliens who enter the country unlawfully from Mexico and, if apprehended, claim asylum and remain in the country while the claim is adjudicated, with little prospect of actually being granted that discretionary relief,"" Solicitor General Noel J. Francisco told the justices.

""The president, finding that this development encourages dangerous and illegal border crossings and undermines the integrity of the nation's borders, determined that a temporary suspension of entry by aliens who fail to present themselves for inspection at a port of entry along the southern border is in the nation's interest,"" Mr. Francisco wrote.

The American Civil Liberties Union, representing groups challenging the policy, said Congress had made a different determination, one that only Congress can alter.

""After World War II and the horrors experienced by refugees who were turned away by the United States and elsewhere, Congress joined the international community in adopting standards for the treatment of those fleeing persecution,"" lawyers with the A.C.L.U. wrote. ""A key safeguard is the assurance, explicitly and unambiguously codified, that one fleeing persecution can seek asylum regardless of where, or how, he or she enters the country."""
40,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/30/world/asia/china-american-centers-culture.html,"BEIJING -- The American ambassador to China, Terry Branstad, wanted to make what in most nations would have been a routine trip.

One of his favorite schools, Iowa State University, had opened a center to promote American culture in an inland Chinese province, and the laid-back former governor of Iowa was eager to take questions from Chinese students.

The center's program, largely financed by the State Department, was deliberately benign so as not to offend Chinese government sensibilities. Politics was off the agenda. English lessons focused on fashion, music and sports. An essay-writing contest was called ""Bald Eagle & Panda"" after well-known fauna in both countries.

But Henan Normal University, a campus set on the Yellow River with a prominent statue of Mao Zedong out front, denied Mr. Branstad permission to visit the center this fall -- and offered no explanation.

The rebuff underscored how the United States and China compete not only in trade and technology, but also over the values and beliefs that define their societies, an echo of the Cold War with the Soviet Union.

In China, such programs provided a window into American culture outside the filter of the Communist Party, and their unwinding could deepen the divide between the societies of the world's two largest economies.

The center that turned down Branstad was one of more than 20 that the State Department opened in the past decade on college campuses across China to promote American culture and counter anti-American propaganda by offering English lessons, screening movies and hosting visiting music and dance performances.

Today, the American centers have closed after the Chinese authorities denied American officials entry to them and state security agents interrogated an American academic working on a Chinese campus.

""It became clear after a while that the centers were no longer an asset to the Americans and became a terrible liability,"" said Jennifer Tarlin of the University of North Dakota, who served as director of an American center at a Shanghai university from 2011 until this summer.

The program's launch coincided with a rise in nationalist sentiment in China. Shortly after he came into power six years ago, President Xi Jinping rolled out a campaign against Western values, investing Communist Party members in academia with the power to redline even the most innocuous and apolitical expressions of American culture.

And funding American culture in China became particularly unpopular in Washington as the Trump administration worked to distance the countries and anger built over Beijing's propaganda in America.

China's Ministry of Foreign Affairs did not respond to a request for comment.

When the American centers opened a decade ago, they bucked a trend. Promoting American culture abroad, once a high point of American foreign policy, was considered obsolete, an idea that was dispensed with at the end of the Cold War.

In the early 1990s, conservative Republicans and Clinton Democrats worked together to demolish the United States Information Agency and slash the budgets of culture programs abroad. Democracy had prevailed, the thinking went, and the internet rendered cultural diplomacy unnecessary.

But China was a special case. The American government was concerned about negative depictions of the United States in China's tightly controlled state media.

On American campuses, the Chinese government was subsidizing a network of Confucius Institutes, where Beijing appoints teachers and dictates the curriculum. It grew from around 70 outposts during the Obama administration to more than 100 today.

In 2011, only five roughly equivalent American places existed in China -- at American embassies or consulates, sites that are closely watched by Chinese security and forbidding for local residents to enter.

The Obama administration felt compelled to act.

By 2012, the State Department had made individual grants of $100,000 to more than two dozen American universities to open centers on Chinese campuses. To distance itself, it urged the centers to seek extra funds from private American sources and stayed away from decisions about programming.

William Brustein, then-vice provost for international affairs at Ohio State University, recalled meeting the American ambassador, Jon M. Huntsman Jr., in Beijing in 2011.

The ambassador told Mr. Brustein about the State Department's new venture.

""'They're like the Confucius Institutes -- this is America's answer,'"" Mr. Brustein recounted the ambassador saying. ""'You should open a center -- try to pick a place that is not Beijing or Shanghai.'""

Ohio State prided itself on its already large number of fee-paying Chinese students, and the university thought the center would attract more. Many students came from Hubei Province, so it was easy for Mr. Brustein to persuade Wuhan University, a major university there, to agree to host a place that would showcase American themes.

The center opened in 2012 in a loft-like space with a kitchen and English-language cookbooks, and was led by an English teacher at Ohio State, Bob Eckhart, who brought jazz groups and dance ensembles over for performances.

The most successful gig was a group of African-American step dancers, Mr. Eckhart said. ""We stressed that we were presenting authentic American culture and that we were not just cheerleaders for America.""

Other centers opened at campuses across China.

Often the programming was quirky. At the University of Shanghai for Science and Technology, Ms. Tarlin invited American musicians who played Depression-era folk. She staged a workshop production of the opera ""Scarlet Letter"" with a libretto by the feminist writer Carol Gilligan.

It wasn't long before the centers ran afoul of the orthodoxy of President Xi and his campaign against liberal democracy.

Strict edicts announced by the education minister, Yuan Guiren, in early 2015 signaled the official disfavor. Books highlighting Western values had no place in the classroom; Chinese universities must ensure that Mr. Xi's ideology was front and center, Mr. Yuan said.

Suddenly, university officials barred American cultural groups and speakers. The Chinese honed in on the ties with the State Department, suspicious that the United States was using the centers as a cover for spreading democratic ideas, former and current diplomats said.

In Nanjing, Chinese state security officials summoned a dean of the New York Institute of Technology, Monique Taylor, for questioning for several hours in 2015.

Ms. Taylor was responsible for the American center sponsored by the institute at the Nanjing University of Posts and Telecommunications; she was also in charge of a separate academic program with faculty from New York City on the Nanjing campus.

The interrogation rattled the American university, according to three people familiar with the episode. A spokeswoman for the university declined to comment.

After the episode, the university declined a new State Department grant and deleted the word American from the center's name. It was renamed Campus Commons.

A State Department inspector general's appraisal of the embassy in Beijing in 2017 described how the Chinese government called American public affairs diplomats ""hostile foreign forces."" The report said that from January 2016 to April 2017, there were 153 instances of Chinese thwarting the work of the American public affairs officials, including with the centers.

In the 2000s, as the Confucius Institutes flourished in the United States, those who wanted to promote American soft power eventually prevailed with the opening of the centers in China. But American diplomats responsible for culture could never get the centers to take off: In Washington, the economic relationship was considered far more important, former diplomats said.

As secretary of state, John Kerry took up the cause of the centers with Liu Yandong, who was a vice premier until this year and China's top culture czar.

The Chinese dismissed Mr. Kerry's complaints, said Richard Stengel, who was under secretary of state for public diplomacy and public affairs at the time.

""In my experience, the Chinese project, rationalize and then minimize,"" Mr. Stengel said, explaining that senior Chinese officials denied any problems. ""They first say, 'You do it, too.' Then they say: 'It's not my responsibility, it happens on the local level.' And finally: 'It doesn't matter much anyway.'""

In all, the State Department spent $5.1 million on 29 centers, though about 10 of them never opened. The inspector general's report concluded that the effort had been ""largely ineffective.""

The State Department said it had stopped funding all of the centers.

Mr. Branstad was not the first American envoy to run into trouble over one of them.

Mr. Kerry complained to the Chinese ambassador to Washington, Cui Tiankai, that the American ambassador at the time, Max Baucus, had also been prevented from traveling to one.

According to Mr. Stengel, who was in the conversation, Mr. Kerry turned to Mr. Cui and asked: ""Have we ever limited where you can go?""

Mr. Cui replied: ""Not yet."""
41,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/30/arts/kavanaugh-kanye-beyonce-washington-pop-culture.html,"WASHINGTON -- What pop culture moments of 2018 revealed deeper truths about political life in America?

After a year covering politics, President Trump and Washington, we recently shared our takes with Patrick Healy, the Politics editor and a former deputy Culture editor.

Katie Rogers As someone who is ensconced in the All-Trump-All-the-Time orbit as a White House reporter, I think 2018 was the ""reality-is-stranger-than-fiction"" year. Justice Brett Kavanaugh's confirmation process -- and the ""S.N.L."" bit that followed -- and Kanye West's visit to the Oval Office were two huge moments where I couldn't tell where reality ended and a cultural dialogue began.

Matt Flegenheimer The Matt Damon-as-Kavanaugh sketch -- one of the few ""S.N.L."" bits to draw much blood in D.C. this year -- speaks to the challenge of comedy in this moment, right? There was objectively very little that was funny about the Ford-Kavanaugh testimony. I was in the hearing room. It was wrenching / heartbreaking / generally miserable. But getting emotional about 36-year-old calendars, as Kavanaugh did, is a little funny.

Rogers I thought there was a Roman Coliseum element to it. America is sitting there, rapt, watching a battle between two people whose lives as they knew them seemed over. And then three days later Matt Damon repeats it verbatim for laughs. It was a jarring cultural moment.

Flegenheimer He liked beer, O.K.?

Astead Herndon The Kavanaugh-Ford hearing had a ""you'll-remember-this-forever"" feel. And something I remember is the time in between their testimony, when even Republicans were calling Ford ""credible"" in a way that, for a moment, felt like a real sea change.

Patrick Healy Astead, this is where Damon's sketch on ""S.N.L."" was revelatory to me. Damon reminded us how Kavanaugh's aggressive, grievance-driven performance turned the tide for the Republicans against a credible woman, not unlike what Trump's aggressive, grievance-driven performance did in 2016.

Rogers Yes. I was texting people in the White House during Kavanaugh's emotional testimony. When they told me that's exactly how they'd expect him to act, that was a reminder of how different the rules can be for men and women.

Healy The rules were very different that day.

Rogers Speaking of performances, I was in the Oval Office during the Kanye West visit with Trump. Kellyanne Conway was posing for pictures with Kid Rock in the driveway, an errant Beach Boy was praising the president for trying to save Whitney Houston's life, and in the middle of it all was President Trump and Kanye West.

Herndon I think people actually glossed over what Kanye said in the Oval Office -- that supporting Trump made him feel like a superhero. It spoke to that sense of male grievance we saw in the Kavanaugh hearing. Kanye actually mentioned the many women in his family, and said supporting Trump felt like it helped him reclaim masculinity, in so many words. And I found that pretty revealing, considering I had talked to Trump-supporting men throughout the year who said similar things

Flegenheimer I wonder if part of it -- for Kanye and other Trump fans who think like him, to Astead's point -- is just how subversive it can feel to support the guy. You're not supposed to like Trump, they're told.

Rogers It makes people dig their heels in.

Flegenheimer And Trump and Kanye are two prolific diggers of heels.

Herndon Another thing on Kanye, the theater of it all was just incredible. I'm from the Chicago area where Kanye was so revered for speaking up for social justice -- the area that defended him when he interrupted Taylor Swift or whined about awards. People loved it. But many hometown people have disavowed him now -- and it speaks to how people see Trump as a unique red line.

Healy Katie, did you learn anything new about Trump and pop culture in 2018 on the White House beat?

Rogers Trump played loud music on his campaign plane so I know he enjoys music. He clearly has a reverence for musicians of a certain era, like inviting a Beach Boy to the White House and playing Elvis during a medal ceremony. The idea that the president enjoys music and the degree to which musicians interact with him -- even to distance themselves -- is fascinating.

Flegenheimer Trump's rally playlist is amazing.

Rogers Yes. Elton John is forever ruined for me. Trump loves, loves Elton.

Flegenheimer Not a traditional Republican playlist.

Rogers Someone added Rihanna's ""Don't Stop the Music"" to the list at some point this year. You haven't lived until you've seen a rally crowd try to dance to it.

[Read about our critics' take on the best pop albums of 2018.]

Healy Astead, what struck you about pop culture and the 2018 elections?

Herndon One of the big themes from the midterms was people who had previously stayed away from politics but were now getting involved. We saw that in pop culture, too. Voices who had typically stayed neutral spoke out. Venues that were once apolitical distractions became places for protest. Taylor Swift getting involved in the Tennessee Senate race comes to mind.

Flegenheimer If you had told us then that 2018 would be the year for Kanye to support President Trump and Taylor to support ... Tennessee Senate candidate Phil Bredesen.

Herndon I think there's a uniqueness to this cultural moment and we've seen politicians who recognize that be really successful. Beto and his Facebook lives. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Instagram. It's a time for disrupters. And it kind of seems like politicians are behaving more on social media like influencers? Rather than typical elected officials.

Flegenheimer And vice versa! It just speaks to how much politics and pop culture are merging, right? Beyoncé and LeBron going in for Beto, Taylor Swift getting off the sidelines for a local race when she wouldn't do the same for Hillary Clinton ... and a president who tweets a video from his Emmys appearance while signing a Farm Bill.

Rogers Ocasio-Cortez's use of Instagram to explain to her followers how the government works has been really interesting. And disruptive.

Herndon It's Trump-esque. The radical transparency that people find endearing and authentic?

Healy Ocasio-Cortez has racked up 1.2 million followers on her Instagram account. She is connecting with a lot of voters in a very humanizing way. I'm not sure many of her Washington colleagues realize the power of what she's doing. I couldn't help but wonder: What are the cultural political moments of 2018 that absorbed huge numbers of Americans but Washington may have been clueless about?

Flegenheimer ""This Is America"" from Childish Gambino! Who Trump definitely thinks is the youngest leader of a New York City crime family.

Rogers It was crazy to me how few in people in Washington seemed to know who Kanye West was on the day of his visit. I actually heard someone ask ""Is it Kan-YEE or Kan-YAY"" in the White House driveway and I wanted to melt into the pavement.

Herndon ""Black Panther"" was the movie event of the year, which is fairly incredible considering the themes of black nationalism are so front and center. You also had other performances that spoke to political ideas, like ""This Is America"" or Beyoncé's H.B.C.U.-themed Coachella performance.

Rogers This year pop culture really proved how bankable nonwhite story lines and heroes and love stories can be. Which is very at odds with a vocal, in-power conservative political culture obsessed with bringing America back to this idea of Christian, white predominance.

Herndon There was also ""Crazy Rich Asians"" and ""To All the Boys I've Loved Before."" We saw a real thirst for new, diverse stories, which actually mimics the calls for representation in the political world. I don't think it's an accident that, during a political moment that so centers white identity and white identity politics, we're seeing popular art that lurches in an opposite direction.

[Our chief film critics choose the films that moved them this year.]

Healy I wonder if President Trump and Republican leaders watched ""This Is America"" or parts of Beyoncé's Coachella performance, or understood what ""Black Panther"" and ""Crazy Rich Asians"" were saying about America in 2018. These moments were about nonwhite artists, characters and concerns rising as defining moments in the culture at a time when white identity politics is defining the presidency. And here is Trump, congratulating Roseanne Barr for supporting him on ""Roseanne.""

Flegenheimer What ever happened to that show?

Healy Our colleague John Koblin nailed it. ABC wanted to cater to ""white working-class"" Trump supporters. I interviewed her in March about the changes in her character to make her a Trump supporter. She erupted at me and the ABC publicist tried to shut me down.

Rogers Roseanne is performing in my Indiana hometown this spring. Suffice it to say conservative America is ready to forgive her.

Flegenheimer It just speaks to Trump's ability / insistence to nose into any moment. It seems like big cultural happenings are so often processed, in part, through a prism of: How will Trump involve himself -- or, possibly, screw things up? Or the reality that he might, even if no one thinks there's a way. Of course this is true for major moments that connect to him in some way -- but even some that don't. He managed to upset everyone after Aretha Franklin died by saying she ""worked for him"" because she had performed at his venues.

[Read about our critics' favorite TV shows of 2018.]

Rogers Yes. The week following John McCain's death, Washington drove itself mad when the president really didn't say anything at all. And with the Roseanne drama, President Trump said nothing about the racist remarks she made about Valerie Jarrett, a former Obama aide. Instead, he was upset that ABC did not apologize to him for unspecified horrible treatment over the years.

Herndon The inverse of the Trump screwing-things-up phenomenon is that it creates this weird low bar, where he's praised by Washington for doing things that are pretty normal.

Rogers Yes, like not causing a scene at a former president's funeral.

Herndon Or going like two days without tweeting about Dr. Ford.

Flegenheimer Mike Huckabee defended Trump nearly ruining the illusion of Santa Claus for a 7-year-old by noting that he did not boil her rabbit.

Herndon I'd say Washington's deference to civility and decorum is putting it at increasing odds with the rest of the country, which is more partisan and enraged

Rogers Oh, I think it's safe to say Washington is also partisan and enraged. It's just that people in Washington have the levers.

Flegenheimer It can be hard to tell if Trump is a symptom or a cause of the lack of decorum -- to say nothing of the weird politics / culture synergy. On the one hand, the celebri-fication of politics predates him. On the other, he made porn industry reporting an essential part of the beat!

Rogers That says it all.

Flegenheimer Political stories this year took me to a strip club in Greenville, S.C., to see Stormy Daniels; a basketball gym in Houston to watch Ted Cruz and Jimmy Kimmel settle a feud by sweating on each other for charity; and the living room of a former ""Sex and the City"" star running for governor of New York. Read that sentence! America!

Rogers Yesterday it was crazy to see Stormy's memoir sitting next to Michelle Obama's in the airport bookstore.

Herndon That relates to the authenticity point we were discussing earlier. The idea that both women are living out their truths in a society that has tried to stifle it

Healy I read ""Becoming"" on vacation. The first two sections -- ""Becoming Me"" about Michelle Obama's childhood, and ""Becoming Us"" about her and Barack -- were absorbing. She was a deeply driven perfectionist, and her views on assimilation (it's always minorities under pressure to assimilate) and about constraining herself in predominantly white power structures were a reminder (among other things) that it's so hard to be an individual in politics. That's part of what interests me about Ocasio-Cortez. She is doing it her way, for better or for worse.

Flegenheimer Sinatra-Ocasio-Cortez 2020.

Herndon The thing about Michelle Obama, and Ocasio-Cortez, also, is that there's a working-class background most minorities can relate to. There's a reason you have moments like the little black girl who posed with Michelle Obama's National Portrait Gallery painting.

Rogers There's a freshness, an edginess and a sense of disruption on the left in its candidates and leaders like the Obamas, from memoirs to those portraits. What stands out about the right, which is where I focus most of my attention, is conservatives' commitment to treat that edginess as an assault on a specific idea of the American Dream.

Herndon I agree with Katie. You have historically marginalized voices asserting themselves and demanding to be heard in pop culture and Washington. But you also have a conservative universe that's using these new voices as proof that the country's direction is being lost. Something's gotta give.

Rogers 2018: Something's Gotta Give is an excellent theme.

Flegenheimer Happy New Year!"
42,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/29/opinion/climate-change-global-warming-history.html,"Mr. Bledsoe lectures on environmental policy at American University.

Thirty years ago, a NASA scientist, James Hansen, told lawmakers at a Senate hearing that ""global warming is now large enough that we can ascribe with a high degree of confidence a cause-and-effect relationship with the greenhouse effect."" He added that there ""is only 1 percent chance of accidental warming of this magnitude.""

By that, he meant that humans were responsible.

His testimony made headlines around the United States and the world. But in the time since, greenhouse gas emissions, the global temperature average and cost of climate-related heat, wildfires, droughts, flooding and hurricanes have continued to rise.

This fall, the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released an alarming report warning that if emissions continue to rise at their present rate, the atmosphere will warm up by as much as 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 degrees Celsius) above preindustrial levels by 2040, resulting in the flooding of coastlines, the killing of coral reefs worldwide, and more catastrophic droughts and wildfires.

To avoid this, greenhouse gas emissions would need to fall by nearly half from 2010 levels in the next 12 years and reach a net of zero by 2050. But in the United States, the world's second-largest emitter of greenhouse gases, President Trump continues to question the science of climate change, and his administration is rolling back emissions limits on power plants and fuel economy standards on cars and light trucks, while pushing to accelerate the use of fossil fuels. Other major nations around the world aren't cutting emissions quickly enough, either.

So what has happened over the last 30 years? Progress has been made in fits and starts, but not nearly enough has been done to confront the planet-altering magnitude of what we have unleashed. Here's a look at some of what has occurred:

1988

A report to Congress by the Environmental Protection Agency warns that global warming caused by industrial pollutants is likely to shrink forests, destroy most coastal wetlands, reduce water quality and quantity in many areas and otherwise cause extensive environmental disruption in the United States over the next century.

The United Nations and the World Meteorological Organization form the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change to report to world leaders on the science of climate change.

1989

Britain's prime minister, Margaret Thatcher, who earned a degree in chemistry at Oxford, tells the United Nations in a speech, ""We are seeing a vast increase in the amount of carbon dioxide reaching the atmosphere."" She warns that, as a result, ""change in future is likely to be more fundamental and more widespread than anything we have known hitherto."" She calls for a global treaty on climate change.

1990

In its first report, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says that ""human activities are substantially increasing the atmospheric concentrations of the greenhouse gases"" and will lead to a predicted ""increase of global mean temperature during the"" 21st century ""of about 0.3 degrees Celsius per decade,"" which it says is ""greater than that seen over the past 10,000 years."" That's a little more than a half-degree Fahrenheit per decade.

1991

An internal study by the oil giant Exxon finds that ""warming will clearly affect sea ice, icebergs, permafrost and sea levels"" in the Arctic and that ""higher sea levels and bigger waves"" could ""damage the company's existing and future coastal and offshore infrastructure.""

1992

The United States and 171 other nations, meeting at the Earth Summit in Brazil, sign a treaty on climate change to limit greenhouse gas emissions to a level that will not interfere with the planet's climate. But the deal lacks mechanisms to achieve that goal.

1993

President Bill Clinton proposes a federal tax on fossil energy sources to help reduce carbon dioxide emissions. The measure narrowly passes the House of Representatives but dies in the Senate; a gasoline tax increase of 4.3 cents per gallon becomes law instead, the last time federal energy taxes have been raised.

1994

An Earth Summit agreement, approved by 166 counties, enters into force, committing nations to ""stabilizing greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system.""

1995

Countries that signed the Earth Summit agreement in 1992 agree to negotiate ""binding targets"" on emissions for major developed countries like the United States, but set significantly less stringent requirements for developing countries like China and India.

1996

Climate change plays almost no role in the presidential campaign, with no mentions in the presidential debates and only a passing reference in the vice-presidential debate.

1997

Concentrations of carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas, reach the highest levels in at least 400,000 years, as measured in Arctic ice cores.

More than 1,500 scientists from 63 countries, including 110 Nobel Prize winners, issue a call to action: ""A broad consensus among the world's climatologists is that there is now a discernible human influence on global climate"" that represents ""one of the most serious threats to the planet and to future generations.""

One hundred and ninety-two nations agree to the Kyoto Protocol to fight global warming. The agreement requires the United States and other developed countries to cut greenhouse gas emissions, but not developing countries like China.

1998

The global average temperature of 58 degrees Fahrenheit is the warmest since reliable records began about 120 years ago.

Industry opponents of the Kyoto Protocol draft a proposal to spend millions of dollars to convince the public that the environmental accord is based on shaky science.

2000

In the presidential campaign, George W. Bush, the Republican nominee, promises to cut carbon dioxide emissions from power plants, while Al Gore, the Democratic candidate, calls for aggressive climate policies but does not make climate change a major campaign issue and mentions it only once in the debates.

2001

Under strong pressure from conservative Republicans and industry groups, President Bush says his administration will not seek to regulate emissions of carbon dioxide from power plants. reversing a campaign pledge. He also says he will seek to withdraw the United States from the Kyoto climate accord and that the United States will not comply with its emissions-reduction targets.

China declines to slow the rapid growth of its greenhouse gas emissions.

2002

President Bush proposes a voluntary plan involving tax credits and other incentives to encourage businesses and farmers to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions.

2003

The Senate votes 55 to 43 against a bill sponsored by Senator John McCain, a Republican from Arizona, and Senator Joe Lieberman, a Democrat from Connecticut, to limit carbon dioxide emissions by creating a market-driven ""cap and trade"" program. Only four Republicans vote yes.

The Republican campaign adviser Frank Luntz writes a memo to party officials noting: ""Should the public come to believe that the scientific issues are settled, their views about global warming will change accordingly. Therefore, you need to continue to make the lack of scientific certainty a primary issue.""

2004

Climate scientists across the globe overwhelming agree that evidence of climate change is clear and persuasive, according to a detailed analysis in Science Magazine by the science historian Naomi Oreskes. As she puts it: ""Many details about climate interactions are not well understood, and there are ample grounds for continued research to provide a better basis for understanding climate dynamics. The question of what to do about climate change is also still open. But there is a scientific consensus on the reality of anthropogenic climate change. Climate scientists have repeatedly tried to make this clear. It is time for the rest of us to listen.""

2005

At a climate conference in Montreal, the United States and China refuse to agree to take mandatory steps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

Congress passes an energy policy act that provides tax and other incentives for some low emissions energy sources, including nuclear power, hydropower and wind and solar power. But it also continues large subsidies for fossil fuels.

2006

With its rapid industrialization, China surpasses the United States as the world's biggest emitter of greenhouse gases.

2007

Congress raises auto fuel efficiency standards for the first time since 1976.

2008

Barack Obama and John McCain, the Democratic and Republican presidential candidates, endorse limiting greenhouse gas emissions through cap-and-trade legislation.

2009

The House of Representatives passes a cap-and-trade bill that would require cuts in greenhouse gas emissions of 17 percent below 2005 levels by 2020 and 83 percent by 2050. Only eight Republicans vote yes. The bill never receives a vote in the Senate, even though Democrats control 57 seats and two independents caucus with them.

The American Petroleum Institute, funded by major oil companies, helps organize and pay for the first Tea Party rallies, including protests against the House-passed cap-and-trade legislation.

President Obama says the United States will cut greenhouse gas emissions by 17 percent below 2005 levels by 2020 as part of the Copenhagen Accord signed by 193 nations. Large developing nations, including China, also pledge reductions, though they are voluntary.

2010

The International Energy Agency reports that global energy-related emissions of carbon dioxide hit a high of 30.6 billion tons, an increase of 1.6 billion tons over 2009.

President Obama reaches an agreement with American auto companies to raise fuel efficiency standards to 54 miles per gallon by 2025, the largest emissions-cutting action of his presidency.

2011

More than half of all carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels combustion since the Industrial Revolution began in 1751 have occurred just since the mid-1980s, according to a study by scientists for the United States government.

Greenhouse gas emissions in the United States decline slightly, but China's have increased by about 170 percent since 1999.

2012

In his acceptance speech to become the Republican presidential nominee, Mitt Romney mocks President Obama's climate efforts: ""President Obama promised to slow the rise of the oceans and to heal the planet. My promise is to help you and your family.""

2013

Scientists report that concentrations of carbon dioxide reached a record 400 parts per million in the atmosphere, the highest levels in at least three million years, before human beings evolved, and that global emissions rose by 60 percent between 1990 and 2013.

In his second Inaugural Address, President Obama calls climate change the leading issue of our time. ""We will respond to the threat of climate change, knowing that failure to do so would betray our children and future generations.""

More than 60 percent of all carbon dioxide emissions come from six nations: China, 30 percent; the United States, 16 percent; India, 6 percent; Russia, 5 percent; Japan, 4 percent; and Germany, 3 percent.

2014

President Obama and President Xi Jinping of China announce limits on greenhouse gas emissions; the United States agrees to cut emissions by 26 to 28 percent below 2005 levels by 2025; China says it will begin scaling back emissions before 2030. The agreement sets the stage for a global climate deal.

A United Nations study finds that even if global greenhouse gas emissions are cut to the level required to keep temperature rise below 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit or 2 degrees Celsius, the cost of climate change adaptation in developing countries is likely to reach two to three times previous estimates of $70 billion to $100 billion per year by 2050

2015

The Paris climate accord is approved by 195 nations, including the United States, marking the first time that all major nations pledge to make emissions reductions to limit the global average temperature increase to less than 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit.

The Republican-controlled Congress votes to phase out tax credits for wind and solar energy by 2020; various tax incentives for fossil fuel production remain. President Obama signs the bill, citing support from the renewable energy industry.

2016

2016 is the warmest year on record, the third consecutive year that a global annual temperature record has been set, and the 40th consecutive year that annual temperatures have been above the 20th-century average. The five warmest years have all occurred since 2010.

James Hansen and other scientists publish research finding that current global temperatures are the highest in at least 115,000 years, when sea levels were 20 to 30 feet higher than today.

Nearly all of the 16 Republican presidential hopefuls deny the science of climate change, and none support the Paris climate agreement. Donald Trump pledges to ""cancel"" American involvement in the Paris accord.

Not a single question on climate change is asked by moderators in any of the four presidential or vice-presidential debates.

The United States joins with 189 other countries to phase out hydrofluorocarbons, gases used as refrigerants, a move that will stave off nearly a degree Fahrenheit of warming by 2100.

Mr. Trump is elected president following a campaign in which he called for more fossil fuel drilling, fewer environmental regulations and vowed to pull the United States out of the Paris climate accord. ""Regulations that shut down hundreds of coal-fired power plants and block the construction of new ones -- how stupid is that?"" Mr. Trump asked during the campaign.

2017

Following up on his campaign promises, President Trump signs an executive order directing his administration to undo regulations to cut emissions from the electric power sector; orders the resumption of the federal coal leasing program; says he will seek to weaken fuel economy standards for cars and light trucks; and proposes to cut the budget of the Environmental Protection Agency by 30 percent. He also says he will withdraw the United States from the Paris climate accord.

Hurricane Harvey unleashes 50 inches of rain, the largest rainfall in United States history, paralyzing five million in Houston, killing 30, with a price tag of at least tens of billions of dollars to federal taxpayers. Multiple peer-reviewed studies find that Hurricane Harvey was made as much as 40 percent larger and more intense because of warming Gulf of Mexico waters tied to the changing climate.

More than 30 leading climate science and policy experts, including Nobel Prize winners, say that limiting global temperatures to below 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit will require removing fossil fuels from the global energy system by 2050, reducing emissions of super greenhouse gas pollutants like HFCs, methane and black carbon rapidly by 2030, and extracting carbon dioxide directly from the atmosphere.

2018

Concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere reach 410 parts per million, the highest level in at least three million years

President Trump insists coal is the key to the country's energy and economic future and orders Energy Secretary Rick Perry to take immediate steps to prevent market shutdowns of coal plants.

The Trump administration says it will roll back fuel economy standards set by the Obama administration for cars and light trucks, a move that would increase greenhouse gas emissions in the United States by an amount greater than many midsize countries put out in a year.

In another move to undo the Obama climate legacy, the Trump administration proposes letting states set their own coal emissions regulations, upending rules to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from coal-fired power plants. Many experts say this will cause greenhouse gas emissions from the power sector to begin rising for the first time in decades.

After falling for more than a decade, carbon dioxide emissions in the United States are set to rise by 2.5 percent in 2018. Global emissions grew by 1.6 percent in 2017 and will increase by about 2.7 percent in 2018.

Go. Jerry Brown of California signs legislation requiring that 100 percent of the state's electricity come from carbon-free sources by 2045.

Thirteen federal agencies present the starkest warnings to date of the consequences of climate change for the United States, predicting in a report that if significant steps are not taken to rein in global warming, the damage will knock as much as 10 percent off the size of the American economy by century's end. The report warns of devastating effects on the economy, health and the environment, including record wildfires in California, crop failures in the Midwest and crumbling infrastructure in the South.

An international team of scientists finds a growing likelihood that runaway warming could destabilize the entire global climate system and lead to a ""Hothouse Earth"" that in the long term will push global average temperatures to seven to nine degrees Fahrenheit warmer than preindustrial temperatures, with seas 60 to 200 feet higher than today. ""Humanity is now facing the need for critical decisions and actions that could influence our future for centuries, if not millennia,"" the scientists write.

Paul Bledsoe is strategic adviser at the Progressive Policy Institute and a lecturer at American University's Center for Environmental Studies. He served on the White House Climate Change Task Force under President Bill Clinton.

43,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/30/briefing/trump-epa-new-years-eve.html,"Good morning, and welcome to the last weekend of 2018. Here are the week's top stories, and a look ahead.

1. President Trump stuck to his demands for border wall funding as the government shutdown entered its first full week, and he threatened to close down the southern border if the ""obstructionist Democrats"" didn't budge.

The impasse will be the first major challenge for the incoming speaker, Nancy Pelosi of California, as the Democrats take control of the House next week.

And federal workers, 800,000 of whom are furloughed or working without pay, are beginning to get anxious about the prospect of a protracted shutdown. ""This one feels different,"" said one T.S.A. officer who was worried about her mortgage and medical expenses.

In another push for his wall, Mr. Trump on Saturday blamed Democrats for the deaths of two migrant children in U.S. custody; an 8-year-old boy died on Dec. 24, and a 7-year-old girl died three weeks earlier.

The president said people were making the arduous journeys to the border because of ""pathetic"" immigration policies. ""If we had a wall, they wouldn't even try!"" he tweeted. Above, a migrant looks from Tijuana, Mexico, into San Diego County.

2. In his first visit to troops stationed in a combat zone, President Trump, above, went to see American forces in Iraq on Wednesday. He was met with a standing ovation from about 100 American servicewomen and men at Al Asad Air Base, some of them wearing ""Make America Great Again"" caps.

The president singled out people wearing the caps and accused Democrats of being weak on border security, leading some to criticize Mr. Trump for turning the visit into ""a campaign rally.""

During the visit, Mr. Trump defended his intention to pull U.S. forces from foreign wars in Syria and Afghanistan, saying that ""the United States cannot continue to be the policeman of the world.""

Mr. Trump's abrupt decision to withdraw the troops has managed to unite the left and right against his plans, our White House correspondent writes.

3. The Trump administration on Friday proposed major changes to the way the federal government calculates the benefits of restricting mercury emissions from coal-burning power plants.

The Environmental Protection Agency, using a different formula, declared that the federal rules imposed on mercury by the Obama administration are too costly to justify. Above, a coal-fired plant in Sidney, Mont.

In just two years, President Trump has unleashed a regulatory rollback with little parallel in the past half-century. The trade-offs, while often out of the glare of Washington, are frighteningly real for the health and safety of people around the country.

We took an up-close look at four places in the U.S. where Mr. Trump's retreat on the environment is unfolding in consequential ways.

4. Stocks rose or fell sharply for most of the holiday week, sometimes doing both in the same day. The raucous week on Wall Street ended quietly on Friday, as stocks drifted between gains and losses before closing slightly lower. Above, outside the New York Stock Exchange.

Most of the seesawing can be attributed to lighter-than-usual volume, which is typical for a holiday week, but volatility has become a hallmark of trading lately.

Shares experienced their steepest drop in several weeks on Monday as investors worried over President Trump's attacks on the Federal Reserve.

Both the treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, and the president's incoming chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, have tried to assure the public that Mr. Trump does not intend to fire Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chairman.

____

5. For the first time in 20 years, a large pool of literary works will lose their copyrighted status and enter the public domain. That means books will likely be cheaper, and artists can create new works based on classic stories without fear of an intellectual property lawsuit.

In other words: Make way for the fan fiction.

Some publishers are worried about the change, and stand to lose money. But for readers, experts say, the additions will be a huge boon.

Thousands of artists and writers -- including Kahlil Gibran, Zelda Fitzgerald, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Agatha Christie, Jean Toomer and Thomas Mann, pictured clockwise from left -- will have their work enter the public domain.

____

6. There was a shake-up in Saudi Arabia's government:

King Salman of Saudi Arabia named new ministers and security chiefs while keeping power firmly in the hands of his son, Prince Mohammed bin Salman. Many of those promoted are close associates of the crown prince, who already has near-total control of the kingdom.

Why it matters: Western intelligence agencies have concluded that Prince Mohammed knew about and most likely ordered the killing of the Saudi dissident Jamal Khashoggi in October. And the crown prince has directed the Saudi military campaign in Yemen that has contributed to a humanitarian crisis and drawn growing opposition in the West.

The Saudis say they are battling to rescue Yemen from a hostile faction backed by Iran. But to do it, the Saudis have used their vast oil wealth to outsource the war, mainly by hiring what Sudanese soldiers say are tens of thousands of desperate survivors of the conflict in Darfur to fight, many of them children. Above, Sudanese soldiers in Hudaydah, Yemen.

7. The end of the year is always a great time for reflection.

At The Times, we highlighted 18 people who left indelible impressions on both our readers and journalists in 2018, including a woman battling the severe addiction crisis in her community and a man, above, fighting efforts to weaken the Native American vote in Utah.

We also have six athletes who changed the game this year, and a few notable moments from 2018 when the internet was actually funny.

45,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/02/us/politics/trump-cabinet-meeting-factcheck.html,"WASHINGTON -- President Trump had a few things to say to start the new year.

About walls. About wheels. About death and sand. About Mitt Romney and Iran. About his popularity in Europe and within the Republican Party. About essentially firing Jim Mattis as defense secretary, and forcing the retiring senators Bob Corker and Jeff Flake from office. And about validation from Kanye West and how his generals were ""better looking than Tom Cruise.""

He lamented being lonely in the White House over Christmas and New Year's. He had been essentially out of public view for a week, so when he convened his first cabinet meeting of 2019, he seemed to be releasing some pent-up demand to be heard.

Here are some takeaways and fact-checks from the 95-minute session.

Mr. Trump seems quite dug in on -- and not accurately informed about -- building a wall.

Walls, the president said, are a time-tested effective way to secure a border. Just look at the Vatican, he said. Is that wall, ""the biggest wall of them all,"" immoral, he asked. (Vatican City has walls, but they do not enclose the entire territory and visitors can easily enter some parts.)

""The United States needs a physical barrier,"" he said, adding that it ""needs a wall."" Later, though, he said he did not really care if the barrier were called a wall, but wanted only to emphasize that a wall was needed.

A wall, he said, would stop the flow of heroin into the country, and it would stop human trafficking. There are ""probably"" 30 million to 35 million undocumented immigrants in the United States, he speculated, and they cost the government $250 billion, which ""would pay for the wall.""

(Government and independent analyses have estimated there are about 11 million undocumented immigrants in the country, and one of the highest estimates for costs of illegal immigration -- a criticized study from an anti-immigration group -- pins the figure at $116 billion. Building a wall would not remove these immigrants from the United States and reduce whatever costs they impose.)

And, Mr. Trump noted, President Barack Obama built a wall around ""his compound,"" except that is not quite what Mr. Obama did. In any event, Mr. Trump said he did not want to be critical of his predecessor; rather, he wanted to make the point that walls work. Drones and other technology, he argued, had more limited capacity. ""I know more about drones than anybody,"" he said.

The wall, though, had the advantage of history.

""The wheel, the wall, some things never get old,"" Mr. Trump said.

Mitt Romney's op-ed article got the president's attention.

Mr. Romney, the newly elected Republican senator from Utah, announced his presence in Washington by writing an op-ed article in The Washington Post that was a scathing criticism of Mr. Trump. Usually not one to shy from a fight, Mr. Trump was relatively restrained when he talked about Mr. Romney, who was the Republican presidential nominee in 2012.

""I'd love him to be a team player, possibly he won't be,"" Mr. Trump said. The president noted that he had endorsed Mr. Romney for the Senate, and Mr. Romney, in turn, had praised him ""profusely."" Then Mr. Trump added that Mr. Romney's words might not play well in Utah, where the president said he is extremely popular. (Mr. Trump is probably less popular in Utah any almost any largely Republican state.)

He went to on criticize Mr. Romney's race against Mr. Obama in 2012, and said that if Mr. Romney had fought Mr. Obama as hard as he has fought him, Mr. Romney might have won. And when asked if he were concerned about a primary challenge from Mr. Romney in 2020, Mr. Trump replied, ""They say I am the most popular president in the history of the Republican Party."" (Actually, Mr. Trump's approval rating among Republicans was 88 percent at 701 days into his term, according to Gallup, the same as President George W. Bush at the same point. Over all, Mr. Trump's approval ratings among his own party have largely hovered below Mr. Bush's.)

Cabinet members know the value of praise.

One by one, the president called on select cabinet members for their contributions to border security. One by one, they responded by praising their boss.

Kirstjen Nielsen, the homeland security secretary, applauded his leadership on border security. She was followed the acting attorney general, Matthew G. Whitaker, who saluted the president for giving up his Christmas and New Year's holidays ""while some members of Congress went on vacation."" Rick Perry, the energy secretary and a former governor of Texas, also praised the president, saying he had been rebuffed on border security from the Obama administration. ""You're standing up and saying don't come,"" Mr. Perry said.

Not to be outdone, Vice President Mike Pence noted that he, too, stayed in Washington over the holidays. Then he, too, piled on the compliments: ""I want to thank you for the strong stand you have taken on border security.""

Syria and ISIS are on Mr. Trump's mind.

Mr. Trump was still stinging from criticism over his decision to withdraw American troops from Syria, lamenting that he was the only person who would get ""bad publicity"" for it. One rebuke in particular, from Mr. Mattis, seemed to prompt the president to issue some criticism of his own.

""How has he done in Afghanistan? Not good. I'm not happy,"" Mr. Trump said, before adding, ""I wish him well. President Obama fired him and, essentially, so did I."" (Mr. Mattis resigned in protest, and Mr. Trump initially characterized the retired Marine general's departure as a retirement.)

He protested that some characterized the withdrawal as aiding Russia, insisting that ""they're not happy."" (In fact, President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia called Mr. Trump's decision to withdraw American troops from Syria ""correct."")

Besides, he said, Russia learned how costly and fruitless a foreign war can be after ""they went bankrupt fighting in Afghanistan"" even though it had good reason to invade the country ""because terrorists were going to Russia."" (The Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan in 1979, beginning a ""decade-long attempt by Moscow to subdue the Afghan civil war and maintain a friendly and socialist government on its border,"" according to the State Department.)

Mr. Trump then misleadingly claimed that Mr. Obama gave Iran $150 billion and $1.8 billion cash. (The first figure refers to a high estimate of frozen Iranian assets released by the Iran nuclear deal -- not a check cut to Tehran -- while the second refers to a payment of a debt owed to Iran.)

The president likes to read polls.

Unprompted, the president responded to a recent poll in Europe that Mr. Romney cited in his op-ed article that showed only 16 percent of people in Germany, Britain, France, Canada and Sweden believed that the American president would ""do the right thing in world affairs,"" down from 84 percent in 2016.

Mr. Trump took the low number as a measure of how well he is doing in the United States. ""If I were popular in Europe, I wouldn't be doing my job.""

He later added, though, that he could indeed reverse those numbers. ""I could be the most popular person in Europe,"" he said. ""I could run for any office if I wanted to.""

And he has no intention of letting up.

Mr. Trump seemed to think that some of his predecessors -- he did not name names -- have coasted in what is frequently described as the most difficult, loneliest job in the world.

""It would be a lot easier if I just relaxed and enjoyed the presidency like a lot of other people have done,"" he said."
46,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/02/us/politics/trump-kim-jong-un-letters.html,"WASHINGTON -- It has become a favorite parlor trick of President Trump's, and on Wednesday, he was at it again, brandishing his latest letter from the North Korean dictator, Kim Jong-un.

""Those few people that I've shown this letter to,"" Mr. Trump told reporters during a cabinet meeting, his voice trailing off as he waved three typewritten sheets in front of the cameras. ""They've never written letters like that. This is a great letter. We've made a lot of progress with North Korea and Kim Jong-un.""

If history is any guide, he will end up showing Mr. Kim's letter to more than a few people. Mr. Trump delights in sharing with visitors the correspondence he has received from North Korea's leader since they began writing to each other last year.

Typically, according to people who have witnessed such displays, Mr. Trump calls to an assistant sitting just outside the Oval Office to bring him ""the letters,"" which he then fans out across the Resolute Desk so the people facing him can get a glimpse. They are translated into English and filled with flowery references to Mr. Trump as ""Your Excellency.""

Theirs is not the first improbable pen-pal relationship -- Catherine the Great famously corresponded with Voltaire. Nor is it the most passionate -- the writers Henry Miller and Anais Nin come to mind. But few pen-pal relationships have ever been so proudly celebrated, at least by one of the pals.

""He wrote me beautiful letters,"" Mr. Trump said at a rally in September. ""And they're great letters. We fell in love.""

The White House has yet to release any of Mr. Kim's missives to Mr. Trump, though it did make public one the president wrote to the North Korean leader in May, when he briefly pulled out of a planned summit meeting. Mr. Trump has said he would like to make Mr. Kim's letters public but that the North Korean leader asked him to keep them private. In the meantime, the president plays peekaboo with inquiring reporters.

""Oh, would you like to see what was in that letter. Wouldn't you like it?"" Mr. Trump joked last June when they pleaded for details of one letter. ""How much? How much?""

""It was a very interesting letter,"" he continued, ""and at some point, it may be appropriate -- I may be able to give it you.""

Mr. Trump has a long history of showing off to visitors. His 26th-floor office at Trump Tower has a windowsill crammed with mementos, including a championship belt sent to him by the boxer Mike Tyson; a football helmet from Tom Brady, the New England Patriots quarterback whom the president once said he hoped would be his son-in-law; and a basketball shoe signed by Shaquille O'Neal, the N.B.A. star.

""This is some serious foot,"" he told a Wall Street Journal reporter, gesturing at the shoe, during the 2016 presidential campaign.

What makes Mr. Kim's letters different, analysts said, is that they are key to a highly sensitive diplomatic negotiation over North Korea's nuclear arsenal. The North Korean leader, they said, has set out methodically to cultivate Mr. Trump -- building a rapport with him, even to the exclusion of other senior American officials, like Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who is overseeing the negotiations.

Some analysts said they believed that South Korea's president, Moon Jae-in, had counseled Mr. Kim on the wording in the letters, calculating that the president would respond to flattery and a solicitous tone.

If so, it has worked: Mr. Trump has been unstinting in his praise of Mr. Kim, even as the nuclear negotiations have bogged down, sometimes rancorously. In one letter, said a person who saw it, Mr. Kim complained that he did not want to deal with Mr. Pompeo -- only with Mr. Trump.

""We really have established a very good relationship,"" Mr. Trump said on Wednesday, noting that he and Mr. Kim would meet for a second time. If he had not been elected, Mr. Trump added, the United States and North Korea would be involved in a ""nice, big, fat war.""

""From a negotiation standpoint, what Trump thinks is happening is that he has the trust of Kim Jong-un,"" said Joseph Y. Yun, a former State Department official who has negotiated with North Korea.

""They've bonded, and what that means is that there's not going to be any hostility between them,"" Mr. Yun said. ""Whether Pompeo makes progress or not doesn't really matter because everyone has pulled back from the brink. There is no degree of urgency on the part of Trump.""

Mr. Trump is not the first president to try to turn a hardened foe into a pen pal. His predecessor, Barack Obama, sent two letters to Iran's supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, in 2009 to try to restart negotiations over its nuclear program. The ayatollah sent a multipage response to Mr. Obama's first letter and never replied to the second.

Those letters, however, have never been released; the White House refused even to confirm their existence.

Mr. Trump has been considerably less discreet. In June, he posed, smiling, with Kim Yong-chol, an emissary from the North Korean leader, who had hand-delivered a letter from Mr. Kim in a curiously oversize envelope. After teasing reporters about its ""interesting"" contents, he abruptly reversed course, when asked whether he had replied.

""No, I didn't. I haven't seen the letter yet,"" Mr. Trump said. ""I purposely didn't open the letter. I haven't opened it."""
47,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/10/us/politics/pence-government-shutdown.html,"WASHINGTON -- Vice President Mike Pence flatly declared on Thursday that there could be no agreement to reopen the government without funding for President Trump's border wall, laying out terms that Democrats had already rejected even as he called on them to negotiate an end to a partial shutdown that is approaching the longest in American history.

""No wall, no deal,"" Mr. Pence said in a briefing with reporters on Capitol Hill as Mr. Trump made a visit to the border to bolster his case for the wall, his signature campaign promise. ""We're going to keep standing strong, keep standing firm.""

""It's time,"" Mr. Pence added, ""for Democrats to come to the table.""

But even as he appeared to invite Democrats for a fresh round of negotiations, Mr. Pence essentially blocked potential offramps for the impasse. He made it clear that Mr. Trump would not drop his insistence on funding for a wall on the southwestern border, which Democrats have branded a nonstarter.

And he indicated that the president was disinclined to accept the idea behind a bipartisan plan being developed in the Senate -- similar to a measure that Republicans and Democrats supported last year, but that the White House ultimately rejected -- that would trade wall funding for legal status for undocumented immigrants facing the threat of deportation.

Speaker Nancy Pelosi also showed no signs of budging, urging the Republican-controlled Senate to take up a measure the House passed on Wednesday to reopen part of the government.

""We say to them: 'Take yes for an answer. This is what you had proposed,'"" Ms. Pelosi said at a news conference. ""Why are you rejecting it at the expense of the health, safety and well-being of the American people? Do you take an oath to the American people, or to Donald Trump?""

The dueling comments underscored the intractable differences between Mr. Trump and congressional Democrats that have led to a stark breakdown in the newly divided government, with the president dug in on his demands and Democrats, now in control of the House, using their power to deny him. As the two sides grapple over who should be held responsible, the showdown has forced 800,000 federal workers to go without pay and placed federal benefits for millions more in jeopardy, with the fallout being felt across the country in ways large and small.

Even as Mr. Pence spoke, there were signs that the partial shutdown, now in its 20th day, would almost certainly become the longest in American history, surpassing a 21-day lapse that began in December 1995. Mr. Trump tweeted that he would skip a planned trip to an economic summit meeting in Davos, Switzerland.

At the same time, the only glimmer of a bipartisan compromise being discussed in the Capitol appeared to die even before it took its first breaths. A flurry of negotiations that began late Wednesday among moderate Republicans, including several facing competitive re-election contests in 2020, crumbled amid White House opposition.

""We're kind of stuck,"" said Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, who had spearheaded the talks. ""I don't see a pathway forward.""

""It kind of fell apart,"" Mr. Graham added, wearing a dejected expression.

The short-lived negotiations were an attempt to revive a compromise that would have paired funding for a wall with legal status for young immigrants brought illegally to the United States as children, sometimes known as Dreamers. President Barack Obama created the program, Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, that allowed some of them to apply for work permits and deportation reprieves. But Mr. Trump rescinded the program in 2017, drawing a legal challenge currently before the Supreme Court.

Senators were also discussing including legal status for immigrants who were living legally in the United States under grants of Temporary Protected Status that Mr. Trump has revoked. But Mr. Pence said such issues were not on the table.

""We feel confident that the Supreme Court will find DACA to have been unconstitutional, and at that time, he believes that there will be an opportunity for us to not only address the issue affecting the Dreamers, but also a broader range of immigration issues,"" he said.

Ms. Pelosi sidestepped a question about whether she would support a deal to reopen the government that included DACA, saying, ""We haven't had that discussion.""

""What we're talking about now is just the president's insistence on a wall,"" she said. ""We need to have comprehensive immigration reform. Democrats and Republicans know that.""

Republican senators who have begun calling on their leaders to bring up measures being passed by the House to reopen the government while the debate over border security continues said they were disappointed with the breakdown of the talks on a potential compromise.

""It's very difficult when we're dealing with people who do not want to budge at all with their positions, and that's the president and Speaker Pelosi,"" said Senator Susan Collins of Maine. ""They're each very dug in on their position, and that's made this very difficult to resolve."""
48,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/10/us/politics/border-wall-government-shutdown.html,"McALLEN, Tex. -- President Trump traveled to the border on Thursday to warn of crime and chaos on the frontier, as White House officials considered diverting emergency aid from storm- and fire-ravaged Puerto Rico, Florida, Texas and California to build a border barrier under an emergency declaration.

In a sign of growing unease about the partial government shutdown, some Senate Republicans came off the sidelines to hash out a deal that would reopen the government as Congress worked toward a broader agreement tying wall funds to protection for some undocumented immigrants and other migrants.

But before those negotiations could gain momentum, they collapsed: Vice President Mike Pence and other members of Mr. Trump's team let it be known privately that the president would not back such a deal.

""It kind of fell apart,"" Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, said, looking dejected. ""I have never been more depressed about moving forward than I am right now. I just don't see a pathway.""

In a brief statement not long after, Mr. Graham declared, ""It is time for President Trump to use emergency powers to fund the construction of a border wall/barrier."" He added, ""I hope it works.""

The administration appeared to be looking into just that: using extraordinary emergency powers to get around Congress in funding the wall. The White House has directed the Army Corps of Engineers to examine emergency supplemental funds allocated last year after devastating hurricanes and wildfires that could instead be used to pay for the wall, according to congressional and Defense Department officials with knowledge of the matter, who insisted on anonymity to discuss the possibility.

But the president's advisers, including his son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner, whose role was first reported by The Wall Street Journal, have urged him to try to find other approaches than declaring a national emergency.

The advisers have warned him of a range of possible negative outcomes, particularly the risk of losing in court, people familiar with the discussions said. Some have suggested that Mr. Trump would be giving a dysfunctional Congress a pass from fulfilling its duties if he makes an aggressive move.

The White House counsel's office has explored an executive order, but officials there have also suggested that Mr. Trump should exhaust other options first. And some of his more conservative advisers have suggested it is a form of government overreach that is antithetical to conservative principles.

As the shutdown neared Day 21, Mr. Trump, used a visit to a border facility in McAllen, Tex., to blame the protracted shutdown affecting large sections of the federal government on Democrats, charging that their opposition to a wall was allowing for brutal crime and violence.

""You'll have crime in Iowa, you'll have crime in New Hampshire, you'll have crime in New York"" without a wall, he warned.

""If we had a barrier of any kind, whether it's steel or concrete,"" Mr. Trump said of tragic stories involving violence and human trafficking, ""they wouldn't even bother trying. We could stop that cold.""

In a bewildering set of statements that underscored the freewheeling, often contradictory nature of his attempts to force Democrats to capitulate, Mr. Trump renewed his threat to declare a national emergency and build his wall without congressional approval, but then suggested a short time later that he was open to a broader immigration deal that would grant legal status to undocumented immigrants.

""We can declare a national emergency,"" Mr. Trump said. ""We shouldn't have to.""

Later, standing just above the Rio Grande with military vehicles and border agents as his backdrop, he said he would consider a compromise that would allow undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as children, often known as Dreamers, to maintain legal status they lost when he ended the Obama-era program that protected them.

""I would like to do a much broader form of immigration,"" Mr. Trump said. ""We could help the Dreamers.""

Only hours earlier, Mr. Pence had rejected such a deal as part of the current negotiations, saying the president wanted to wait until the Supreme Court ruled this spring on whether an Obama-era program protecting young immigrants brought here illegally as children was constitutional. ""No wall, no deal,"" Mr. Pence declared in a briefing with reporters on Capitol Hill. ""We're going to keep standing strong, keep standing firm.""

The vice president faulted the Democrats, declaring it time for them to begin negotiating, but he has essentially blocked potential offramps for the impasse. He has made it clear that Mr. Trump would not drop his insistence on funding for a wall on the southwestern border, which Democrats have branded a nonstarter.

Mr. Pence also indicated that the president was disinclined to accept the idea behind a bipartisan plan that had been under discussion in the Senate -- similar to a measure that Republicans and Democrats supported last year, but that the White House rejected -- that would trade wall funding for legal status for undocumented immigrants facing the threat of deportation, including the Dreamers and people who previously held Temporary Protected Status.

Privately, he told Mr. Graham's group that the president would not support the developing proposal, which would have reopened the government for three weeks while Republicans and Democrats worked to hash out a broader legislative deal on the wall and temporary grants of legal status for the two groups.

""We're kind of stuck,"" Mr. Graham conceded.

Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California, also showed no signs of budging, urging the Republican-controlled Senate to take up a measure that the House passed on Wednesday to reopen part of the government. The House passed two more measures on Thursday, this time funding the Departments of Housing and Urban Development, Transportation and Agriculture, as well as the Food and Drug Administration.

A dozen Republicans crossed party lines to support one of the measures -- slightly more than in previous votes, but no indication that the patience of Mr. Trump's own party was wearing thin.

""We say to them: 'Take yes for an answer. This is what you had proposed,'"" Ms. Pelosi said at a news conference. ""Why are you rejecting it at the expense of the health, safety and well-being of the American people? Do you take an oath to the American people, or to Donald Trump?""

The showdown has forced 800,000 federal workers to go without pay and placed federal benefits for millions more in jeopardy, with the fallout being felt across the United States. Without debate on Thursday, the Senate unanimously passed legislation to ensure that workers who go without salaries receive back pay when the government reopens. Senator Mitch McConnell Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, said Mr. Trump had assured him he would sign the bill.

The partial shutdown will almost certainly become the longest in American history on Saturday, eclipsing a 21-day lapse that began in December 1995. Mr. Trump posted Thursday on Twitter that he would skip a planned trip to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, slated to begin Jan. 22, because of the impasse.

Republican senators who had called for reopening the government while the debate over border security continues said they were disappointed.

""It's very difficult when we're dealing with people who do not want to budge at all with their positions, and that's the president and Speaker Pelosi,"" Senator Susan Collins of Maine said. ""They're each very dug in on their position, and that's made this very difficult to resolve.""

The implosion of the deal left lawmakers bracing for Mr. Trump to declare a national emergency. The administration was exploring whether it would be possible under such authority for Mr. Trump to divert disaster funds provided after deadly storms away from recovery and rebuilding and toward his border wall. Senior Democrats were exploring both legislative and legal options to challenge the move.

The president is allowed to divert unspent money from projects under a national emergency. But a senior administration official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe confidential discussions, questioned the legality of using Army Corps funding, saying it would be subject to restrictions under the Stafford Act, which governs disaster relief. The official said the process was as much a political exercise intended to threaten projects Democrats valued as a pragmatic one.

""That would be a travesty,"" Representative Peter A. DeFazio, Democrat of Oregon and the chairman of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, said in an interview.

""It's all speculative at this point,"" he said, alluding wryly to Mr. Trump's penchant for abrupt announcements at all hours of the day and night. ""Until we get a tweet at 2:30 tomorrow morning, we won't know."""

Good evening. The government shutdown will reach its 21st day tomorrow, and, if it lasts to Saturday, become the longest in 43 years. But first:

1. Scientists say the world's oceans are heating up far, far more rapidly -- 40 percent faster on average -- than previously thought. The finding, in a newly published analysis, has dire implications.

The oceans have been absorbing most of the heat trapped by greenhouse gas emissions, offering a buffer against climate change. Their escalating temperatures are already killing off marine ecosystems, raising sea levels and making hurricanes more destructive.

2. ""No wall, no deal.""

Vice President Mike Pence flatly declared there could be no agreement to reopen the government without funding for a border wall -- terms that Democrats have already rejected.

And a bipartisan plan developed in the Senate that would trade wall funding for legal status for undocumented immigrants facing deportation also seemed to be dead on arrival.

The partial shutdown, now in its 20th day, will almost certainly become the longest in American history, surpassing a 21-day lapse that began in December 1995.

50,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/20/us/politics/trump-mattis-resignation.html,"WASHINGTON -- For most of his tumultuous 23 months in office, President Trump has tried to shake off anyone who would restrain his insurgent style of leadership. With the resignation of Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, Mr. Trump is at last a president unbound.

Even for some Republicans, this was a deeply unsettling prospect, especially after a week in which Mr. Trump rejected a deal to keep the government running, openly criticized the Federal Reserve for raising interest rates, and announced that the United States would pull 2,000 troops out of Syria, without consulting allies or warning Congress.

That last decision prompted Mr. Mattis to quit after he could not persuade Mr. Trump to reverse course, and the defense secretary left little doubt in his resignation letter that he viewed the president as a threat to the world order the United States helped construct.

And it all played out at a moment Mr. Trump is awash in investigations of possible collusion between Russia and his campaign, inquiries into his business and his family foundation, and allegations that he directed his former lawyer to pay hush money to two women with whom he is alleged to have had affairs.

If there was a common thread in Mr. Trump's actions, it was his unswerving conviction that his political survival depends on securing his conservative base. Those supporters have pounded him relentlessly in recent weeks for his failure to build a border wall with Mexico -- one of the bedrock promises he made during his improbable journey to the White House.

He rejected the stopgap budget deal because it failed to fund the wall. He criticized the Fed because its policy is dampening the stock market, which until recently he viewed as a barometer of his success. And he pulled troops out of Syria because it fulfilled a campaign promise to extract the United States from foreign wars.

Mr. Trump, officials said, also decided on deep cuts in the 14,000 troops serving in Afghanistan -- a war he long derided as a misadventure and only grudgingly agreed to continue under pressure from Mr. Mattis, among others.

In a tweet, Mr. Trump offered Mr. Mattis perfunctory thanks and promised to name a new defense secretary soon. But this was no mere personnel shake up: Mr. Mattis was arguably the last and most important of the officials that Senator Bob Corker, Republican of Tennessee, once called ""those people that help separate our country from chaos.""

The other two -- former Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson and the White House chief of staff, John F. Kelly -- also fell afoul of Mr. Trump. He fired Mr. Tillerson and forced out Mr. Kelly before embarking on a messy process to find a successor from a cast of unwilling candidates.

As members of Congress and his own administration digested the implications of this latest departure, the White House projected defiance. Mr. Trump, his aides said, was merely delivering on his promise to shake up the political establishment.

""The American people voted for a president, Donald Trump, who's very tough, very strong, very aggressive on terrorism,"" his chief domestic adviser, Stephen Miller, said on CNN. ""Let's defend our national security. Let's put America first. Let's not spill American blood to fight the enemies of other countries.""

But lawmakers from both parties expressed alarm at Mr. Trump's actions.

Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, accused him of throwing a ""Trump temper tantrum,"" which he said was ""plunging the country into chaos."" Mr. Mattis had been one of the few ""islands of stability"" in a storm-tossed administration, he said.

Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, who challenged Mr. Trump for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016, said on Twitter that Mr. Mattis's resignation ""makes it abundantly clear that we are headed towards a series of grave policy errors which will endanger our nation, damage our alliances & empower our adversaries.""

Just as critically for Mr. Trump, he has been harshly criticized by supporters who are influential with his conservative voters, including Ann Coulter, the right-wing commentator, and Rush Limbaugh, the radio host, for not being more aggressive about building a border wall, even if it risked shutting down the government.

On Wednesday night, Ms. Coulter predicted that Mr. Trump either would not serve out his term or would fail to get re-elected; he unfollowed her on Twitter a short time later.

Similar political considerations drove Mr. Trump's decision on Syria. He calculated that pulling out American soldiers would be a way to fulfill a campaign pledge, at a time when he was being forced to compromise on the wall.

Mr. Mattis, several officials said, had talked Mr. Trump out of announcing the withdrawal before the midterm elections, in part by promising to give him options for a drawdown. It was the latest of several internal debates in which Mr. Mattis and other aides stalled a president who had made no secret of his desire to pull out of Syria.

But with Christmas coming, his political base increasingly restive and a cloud of legal troubles enveloping the White House, the president decided to pull the trigger now, calculating that it would deliver him a quick win.

Mr. Trump's eagerness to slip the leash of his handlers was apparent in the days leading up to the troop decision.

Last Friday, aides prepped him on delivering a blunt message to Turkey's president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan: Turkish troops must not cross into neighboring Syria to go after Kurdish fighters there because it would interfere with the American-led battle against the Islamic State.

Instead, officials briefed on the call said, Mr. Trump told Mr. Erdogan that the terrorists of ISIS had been vanquished and that the United States would pull its troops out of Syria any day.

That off-script conversation laid bare a deeper rift between Mr. Trump and his national security team -- a rift that spilled dramatically into the open on Wednesday when he abruptly pulled the plug on the four-year-old mission.

""We've been thinking that as the walls close in around Trump, we would have a 'Wag the Dog' scenario where he starts to lash out,"" said Derek H. Chollet, a top Pentagon official in the Obama administration. ""But it won't be getting us into wars -- it will be the opposite.""

""We shouldn't be surprised if we wake up one morning soon and he's tweeted that we're beginning the process of getting out of NATO, or bringing troops home from South Korea,"" he said.

Mr. Mattis was not alone in opposing the president's move: Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and the national security adviser, John R. Bolton, also did not support it. Mr. Bolton's predecessor, Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster, argued in favor of staying in Syria, telling him in one meeting that the United States had not suffered a single casualty there for the previous 12 months, according to a person who was there.

That mollified Mr. Trump for a few months. But after the midterm elections, he raised the prospect again.

""The Russia investigation, Michael Cohen, Mike Flynn's sentencing and the stock market crash all played a part,"" said Kori Schake, a former national security aide to President George W. Bush and the author of a book with Mr. Mattis.

""Two years into this administration, we need to stop giving the president the benefit of the doubt when we look at his national security decision-making,"" she said. ""This was political."""
51,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/10/us/ed-buck-timothy-dean.html,"The man who was found dead this week inside the apartment of Ed Buck, a political activist and donor in Los Angeles, was identified Thursday as Timothy Dean, 55, of West Hollywood. He was described as a fashion consultant who had been friends with Mr. Buck and had played in gay basketball competitions.

The authorities found Mr. Dean when they responded around 1 a.m. on Monday to a 911 call about a person in a West Hollywood apartment who was unconscious and not breathing.

Detectives in the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department quickly turned their attention to Mr. Buck because they had visited the same residence under similar circumstances in July 2017. At that time, they found another man, Gemmel Moore, 26, naked and dead of a drug overdose on a mattress in Mr. Buck's living room.

Both Mr. Dean and Mr. Moore were black, which raised suspicions among political activists and critics of Mr. Buck, a 64-year-old white man who has given more than $116,000 to Democratic candidates and groups in the past decade or so. Protesters have gathered outside Mr. Buck's apartment to demand justice for Mr. Dean and Mr. Moore.

""He will not stop,"" LaTisha Nixon, Mr. Moore's mother, wrote on Facebook this week. ""He will continue to hurt and kill black men. There are 2 people now that have lost their lives..#justice4gemmel""

A lawyer for Mr. Buck, Seymour I. Amster, said on Thursday that his client and Mr. Dean had been friends for 25 years. He said that Mr. Dean had ""ingested some type of substance"" before arriving at Mr. Buck's apartment and that Mr. Buck had tried to resuscitate him.

The Los Angeles County medical examiner's office identified Mr. Dean but has not released a cause of death. The sheriff's department has not named Mr. Buck as a suspect.

But the authorities said that homicide detectives were among the officials who responded to Mr. Buck's residence on Monday and that they would open a review of their investigation into the death of Mr. Moore and conduct new interviews. Mr. Buck was not charged in that death.

Mr. Amster said his client was innocent in both deaths.

Mark Chambers, a longtime friend of Mr. Dean's, confirmed that Mr. Dean had been friends with Mr. Buck but also expressed concern that his friend's character was under attack in the aftermath of his death.

""I've known Tim for 30 years,"" Mr. Chambers said in a phone interview Thursday. ""He's not an angel and he's not a devil. He is in between, just like everybody else.""

Mr. Chambers said his friend was a fashion stylist who had long worked in retail, including at Bloomingdale's and most recently at Saks Fifth Avenue. Mr. Dean posted about his job on Instagram, sharing photos of high-end men's shoes and bags, and asking followers to come shop with him. He also looked the part. ""Going to work this morning!"" he wrote in October alongside a photo of himself in a slim-fitting suit with a stylish pocket square.

He had worked to expand his horizons in recent years, according to Mr. Chambers, who said Mr. Dean obtained an associate degree in 2015 and was baptized last year.

""I'm surviving and thriving in my life right now,"" Mr. Dean wrote on Facebook after his baptism. ""I will never have everything all figured out at once, but I have enough sorted out now that I can honestly say I'm happy, healthy and centered.""

Mr. Chambers, who founded the National Gay Basketball Association, said Mr. Dean also spent many years competing in basketball leagues and the Gay Games, an international sporting event modeled after the Olympics, including in last year's Games in Paris.

Mr. Dean was a passionate player who loved to make a show of catching a rebound, Mr. Chambers said. ""His initials were T.M.D., and it also stood for 'Too Much Drama,'"" he said. ""He was the reigning champ of the Most Dramatic Award on the basketball court.""

Off the court, Mr. Dean was a close friend who helped dress Mr. Chambers and his husband in Armani tuxedos for their wedding. ""He did not believe in sending a text -- birthday, Christmas -- he called you,"" Mr. Chambers said. ""If he found out you were sick, he didn't say, 'What do you need?' He came to your house and brought you what he thought you needed.""

Ottavio Taddei, Mr. Dean's roommate, also said that Mr. Dean was always trying to help others. Mr. Taddei said that while Mr. Dean ""enjoyed a couple of drinks every now and then,"" he did not know him to use drugs.

""I've personally never seen him using drugs and never seen him in the apparent state of alteration caused by any form of drug,"" Mr. Taddei said Thursday. ""I consider this whole tragedy extremely controversial and I do hope the police department will dig into it.""

Mr. Buck has been prominent in politics since the 1980s, when he first got involved in Arizona as a Republican. In the late '80s he led the Mecham Recall Committee, a movement to oust Gov. Evan Mecham, a Republican, who was later impeached over fraud and perjury allegations.

Mr. Buck later switched parties, and gave about $1,500 to support Barack Obama and $2,950 to back Hillary Clinton, according to OpenSecrets.org, which tracks campaign fund-raising. Mr. Buck is also prominent in L.G.B.T. political circles and ran unsuccessfully for the West Hollywood City Council about a decade ago.

After the news of Mr. Dean's death, politicians who have received donations from Mr. Buck faced pressure to return the money.

Representative Ted Lieu, Democrat of California, announced that he would donate more than $18,000 in campaign contributions he received from Mr. Buck to L.G.B.T. and African-American civil rights organizations, The Los Angeles Times reported."
52,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/10/us/politics/trump-pompeo-china-cairo.html,"WASHINGTON -- President Trump has long claimed that he puts ""America first"" overseas. But in two remarkable statements on Thursday, Mr. Trump and his secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, explicitly favored foreign autocrats over elected American leaders.

Mr. Pompeo chose Cairo, the site of President Barack Obama's 2009 address to the Islamic world, to deliver a caustic, point-by-point repudiation of Mr. Obama's message. He paid tribute to Egypt's repressive president, Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, for his courage in supporting Mr. Trump's alternative approach.

About an hour later, on the South Lawn of the White House, Mr. Trump said that China's Communist Party bosses negotiated in better faith than the Democratic leaders in Congress, with whom the president is in a bitter standoff over his border wall that has shut down much of the federal government.

""I find China, frankly, in many ways to be far more honorable than Cryin' Chuck and Nancy. I really do,"" Mr. Trump said, referring to the Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, and Speaker Nancy Pelosi. ""China is actually much easier to deal with than the opposition party.""

This is the same China that Mr. Trump's national security strategy designated as one of the greatest threats to American interests -- a revisionist power determined to ""erode American security and prosperity"" with predatory trade practices, military aggression, and a regime that represses its people while trying to undermine America's democracy.

Mr. Trump's affinity for strongmen is well established, as is his contempt for his predecessor and his habit of gleefully ridiculing opponents, regardless of their party affiliation. But rarely has the Trump administration offered such a striking display of embracing autocrats as friends and painting those at home with whom it disagrees as enemies.

""It's such a break with the tradition that you unify the country against opposition abroad, and you act with a certain decorum in dealing with opponents at home,"" said the presidential historian Robert Dallek. ""There seems to be none of that in this administration.""

Mr. Trump's comments about Mr. Schumer and Ms. Pelosi came in an off-the-cuff exchange with reporters as he left the White House for a trip to the border in Texas. It suggested that the president was still basking in the afterglow of his steak dinner with President Xi Jinping in Buenos Aires last month, when he agreed to call a truce in his trade war with China.

Mr. Pompeo's address, by contrast, was carefully choreographed in both its language and setting -- a highly symbolic effort to discredit what Mr. Obama heralded as America's ""new beginning"" with the Muslim world.

Mr. Obama, the secretary of state said, underestimated the scourge of radical Islam; declined to stand up to the mullahs in Iran, even as they brutally cracked down on protesters; turned the other way while the militants of Hezbollah massed rockets against Israel; and did nothing after President Bashar al-Assad of Syria used sarin gas against his own people.

""The age of self-inflicted American shame is over, and so are the policies that produced so much needless suffering,"" Mr. Pompeo said at the American University in Cairo. ""Now comes the real new beginning.""

Mr. Pompeo lauded Saudi Arabia for working with the United States to curb Iran's malign influence in the region. He said nothing about human rights and did not mention the killing of the Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, which the C.I.A., an agency he once led, concluded was ordered by the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, a close ally of Mr. Trump.

To those who watched Mr. Pompeo harshly question Secretary of State Hillary Clinton in 2015 when he was a House member investigating the Benghazi attacks, the fact that he would attack a Democratic president was hardly surprising. But that he did it on foreign soil angered some diplomats, who subscribe to the adage that partisan politics should stop ""at the water's edge.""

Even those who were deeply critical of Mr. Obama's Middle East policy said they found Mr. Pompeo's speech off-key -- more a stunt aimed at his boss back in Washington than a serious attempt to set out a new blueprint for American involvement in the region.

""There's something a little cheap about going to Cairo,"" said William Kristol, the neoconservative political analyst, who has been equally critical of Mr. Trump. ""If he doesn't approve of Obama's Cairo speech, the way you do that is not to give another Cairo speech.""

Mr. Kristol noted that Mr. Obama's speech was also a rebuke of his predecessor, George W. Bush, especially for the Iraq war and his use of torture on suspects after the terrorist attacks of September 2001. But by comparison with Mr. Pompeo, Mr. Obama's language was delicate.

""9/11 was an enormous trauma to our country,"" Mr. Obama said at Cairo University. ""The fear and anger it provoked was understandable, but in some cases, it led us to act contrary to our own ideals.""

In his dissection, Mr. Pompeo did not mention a line that would seem more likely than any other to provoke a Trump official: Mr. Obama's admission that the United States played a role in overthrowing the democratically elected government of Iran in 1953 -- a coup, he said, that had left a residue of suspicion toward America. Mr. Pompeo's focus was on making the Iran of today start ""behaving like a normal country.""

For all his contempt toward Mr. Obama, Mr. Pompeo fell back on some positions that sounded a lot like those of the last administration. In Syria, he said, the United States would ""work through the U.N.-led process to bring peace and stability to the long-suffering Syrian people.""

Nor is it clear that Mr. Trump's praise of autocrats is encouraging them to act in ways that benefit the United States. It may actually do the opposite, as the case of Prince Mohammed demonstrates.

The trade talks between the United States and China, which ended this week in Beijing, were less rancorous than the shutdown negotiations between Mr. Trump and the Democrats. But they have yet to produce a breakthrough -- and Mr. Trump's decision to skip the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, later this month because of the shutdown could put off a trade deal even longer.

""Strongman envy helps explain both the president's comments and a muddled view of the Middle East,"" said William J. Burns, a former deputy secretary of state who is now president of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace.

""The irony,"" Mr. Burns said, ""is that trashing his predecessor or congressional opponents on the global stage is seen by those same strongmen as evidence of his weakness and manipulability."""

Good morning.

The oceans are warming up faster than thought, the U.S. shutdown remained a logjam, and Norway disclosed the kidnapping of a tycoon's wife. Here's the latest:

Oceans are warming far faster than we thought

A new analysis reports that ocean temperatures are rising 40 percent faster on average than previously thought. The finding has dire implications.

The oceans have been absorbing most of the heat trapped by greenhouse gas emissions, offering a buffer against climate change. Their escalating temperatures are already killing off marine ecosystems, raising sea levels and making hurricanes more destructive.

Continued heating will only make those effects more catastrophic, scientists say. ""2018 is going to be the warmest year on record for the Earth's oceans,"" said Zeke Hausfather, an author of the study. ""As 2017 was the warmest year, and 2016 was the warmest year.""

A grim milestone for the U.S. government shutdown

The partial government shutdown entered its 21st day, tying it for the longest such one in American history.

Developments: Senate Republicans tried to broker a compromise on Thursday, and their efforts swiftly disintegrated. Vice President Mike Pence insisted that the White House would settle for nothing less than a border wall, and Democrats, as ever, rejected one. The White House was considering diverting relief money from storm- and fire-ravaged Puerto Rico, Florida, Texas and California to pay for a wall.

Impact: Many farmers are near or at a financial breaking point. ""I may lose the farm, but I strongly feel we need some border security,"" one farmer in Missouri said.

More: President Trump canceled a trip to the Davos economic conference in Switzerland later this month and visited the U.S. southern border near McAllen, Tex., where crime is near a 30-year low despite his portrayal of a border ""crisis."" Two of our reporters are traveling the border's length.

Pompeo takes shots at Obama's Middle East policies

U.S. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, in a speech in Cairo, declared that the U.S. would take a more activist role in the region. He also rejected much of President Barack Obama's human-rights-based approach there, outlining an approach that is based on a close alliance with authoritarian rulers.

Mr. Pompeo -- whose remarks came almost exactly a decade after Mr. Obama delivered a landmark speech in the same city -- denounced the former president for, he said, underestimating ""the tenacity and viciousness of radical Islam"" and for his policies on Iran. Here are the many ways Mr. Pompeo departed from Mr. Obama. We also fact-checked the speech.

Confusion: Mr. Pompeo apparently sought to reassure jittery nations with his declaration that ""when America retreats, chaos follows"" and that the U.S. would ""expel every last Iranian boot from Syria,"" but the effect was confounding to many, coming weeks after President Trump's impulsive announcement that U.S. forces would leave Syria.

Go deeper: The U.S. has spent $8 billion to build a strong Afghan air force but it is still struggling, which could complicate Mr. Trump's efforts to pull out of the country.

An abduction shocks Norway

The wife of a wealthy Norwegian businessman has been kidnapped, and demands have been made for a large ransom paid in cryptocurrency, the police revealed this week.

Details: Anne-Elisabeth Falkevik Hagen went missing from the couple's home on Oct. 31, but the drama had played out in secret until the police made it public. They said that they have a line of communication with people claiming to be her captors who are demanding a ransom -- said to be as high as 9 million euros -- in a cryptocurrency called Monero. Whether she is still alive is unclear, and three men are being sought for questioning.

Effects: The case is dominating headlines in Norway. It has highlighted worries that the egalitarian-minded country's practice of publishing people's tax returns could be handy to kidnappers. And it has led to calls for cryptocurrencies, which are favored in criminal activities, to be banned or regulated.

Here's what else is happening

Michael Cohen: President Trump's former personal lawyer, who implicated the president in a scheme to pay hush money to two women who say they had affairs with Mr. Trump, has agreed to testify publicly before Congress on Feb. 7, setting up a blockbuster airing of scandal.

Russia investigation: The presence of a dozen Ukrainian political and business figures in Washington for the celebrations surrounding President Trump's inauguration has been under investigation by federal prosecutors interested in potential influence-peddling.

Snow: Once-in-a-generation heavy snowfall has left at least six people dead and brought travel and tourism to a halt in parts of the Alps.

Cristiano Ronaldo: Law enforcement officials in Nevada investigating a sexual-assault accusation against the soccer star have obtained a warrant for a sample of his DNA.

Brexit: Prime Minister Theresa May does not appear to have a Plan B if lawmakers in Parliament vote against her unloved plan for withdrawal, as seems likely. Underlining the country's tensions, a TV movie about the Brexit campaign starring Benedict Cumberbatch has set off anger and angst.

Democratic Republic of Congo: The U.N. Security Council is set to meet to discuss the disputed outcome of the country's presidential election. The victory of the president-elect, Felix Tshisekedi, been called into question by, among others, Belgium and France.

Ford: The automaker said it would lay off ""thousands"" of the 68,000 workers it employs in Europe and close a factory in France. Tougher emissions rules and declining demand have been hurting profits.

Forced marriages: After public outrage, the British government announced that it will no longer require British women forced into marriages abroad to pay the government for the cost of helping them escape, acknowledging that they ""may have endured particular suffering.""

Venezuela: President Nicolás Maduro was inaugurated for a second term after an election last year that was widely considered illegitimate -- and despite a plummeting economy and skyrocketing violence, hunger and migration. Our team explains how he has clung to power.

Vintage tanks: As President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia promotes the Soviet victory over Nazi Germany as a cornerstone of nationalist fervor, he has a pressing need for T-34 tanks for military parades, museum shows and film shoots. So it was with great fanfare that Russia took in a consignment of old tanks from the Lao People's Army.

Back Story

The game is afoot this weekend for the Baker Street Irregulars, a literary society devoted to Sherlock Holmes that is holding its annual dinner in New York City.

Founded in 1934, the Irregulars are named for a group of street urchins who assisted Holmes in some of Arthur Conan Doyle's 60 stories about the fictional detective.

The group, which is invitation only, has about 300 members around the world and publishes a quarterly journal of Sherlockian scholarship.

The Irregulars' dinner tonight is part of a five-day celebration in Manhattan featuring a lecture, a memorabilia sale and parties with other groups of Sherlock Holmes fans, including the Baker Street Babes. (The first female members of the Irregulars weren't admitted until the early 1990s.)

The event is timed to coincide with Holmes's birthday, which enthusiasts have generally agreed is Jan. 6 -- although the reasoning is far from elementary.

54,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/11/briefing/government-shutdown-mike-pompeo-jayme-closs.html,"Good morning,

We start today with breaking news from Syria, as well as the latest from the government shutdown, which is now tied for the longest in history. And it's Friday, so there's a new news quiz.

Breaking

The U.S. began withdrawing troops from Syria today, an American military spokesman said.

White House sees storm aid as a way to build a wall

The Trump administration is considering diverting $13.9 billion allocated last year for areas damaged by hurricanes and wildfires to pay for a wall on the southwestern border. That's according to congressional and Defense Department officials with knowledge of the matter, who insisted on anonymity to discuss the possibility.

Officials are debating whether they could make such a move without a declaration of a national emergency. President Trump has repeatedly said he might declare one in order to bypass Congress, where Democrats have declined to fund a wall.

Yesterday: Mr. Trump visited the border city of McAllen, Tex., to make his case.

Go deeper: Two Times journalists are driving the length of the 1,900-mile border. Their first dispatch is from Brownsville, Tex.

The Daily: On today's episode, hear from a sheriff in Arizona who supports Mr. Trump's plans.

Government shutdown nears a record

The partial closure that has resulted from the impasse over a border wall would become the longest in history on Saturday. Most of the 800,000 federal workers involved will miss a paycheck today.

On Thursday, Vice President Mike Pence made clear that President Trump would not support a deal to reopen the government before wall funding was secured. ""No wall, no deal,"" Mr. Pence said.

Impact: Farmers have generally stood by President Trump, but some say the loss of crucial loans, payments and other services during the shutdown is threatening their support.

The details: Here's what the shutdown does and doesn't affect, as well as a look at its growing consequences.

Oceans are warming faster than we thought

Water temperatures are rising 40 percent faster on average than a United Nations panel estimated five years ago, according to an analysis published on Thursday.

The oceans have been absorbing most of the heat trapped by greenhouse gas emissions, offering a buffer against climate change. The escalating temperatures are already killing off marine ecosystems, raising sea levels and making hurricanes more destructive.

The background: Historically, understanding ocean temperatures has been difficult. A 2014 U.N. report presented five estimates, all showing less ocean warming than the levels projected by computer climate models. The new analysis incorporates more recent data, and its results are more in line with the models.

Mike Pompeo lays out a vision for the Middle East

The secretary of state told an audience in Cairo on Thursday that ""the age of self-inflicted American shame is over"" and that the U.S. would pursue a more activist policy in the Middle East, despite President Trump's move to withdraw troops from Syria.

Mr. Pompeo sharply criticized former President Barack Obama, saying he had ""fundamental misunderstandings"" about the region that ""underestimated the tenacity and viciousness of radical Islamism."" In a speech in 2009, also in Cairo, Mr. Obama made an effort to reset relations with the Muslim world in the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks and the Iraq war.

Closer look: Mr. Pompeo's speech contrasted starkly with Mr. Obama's. We compared the two.

News analysis: The Trump administration on Thursday ""explicitly favored foreign autocrats over elected American leaders,"" one of our White House correspondents writes. Mr. Pompeo praised Egypt's repressive president, and Mr. Trump later said that the Chinese were ""far more honorable"" than Democratic congressional leaders.

If you have 35 minutes, this is worth itThe nature of beauty

For decades, the centerpiece of evolutionary theory has been that creatures with the most advantageous traits have the best chance of multiplying. Beauty -- so far as a reproductive mate was concerned -- was merely a shorthand for those traits.

Charles Darwin himself never thought that explained everything. Now biologists are revisiting his theory that animals can appreciate beauty for its own sake.

Here's what else is happening

Missing girl is found: Jayme Closs, 13, disappeared in October on the night that her parents were shot to death in their rural Wisconsin home. She was found alive on Thursday, the authorities said. A suspect was in custody.

Huawei arrest: The Polish authorities have charged a Chinese employee of Huawei, the telecommunications giant, and a Polish national with spying for China, officials said today. The arrests come as the U.S. and its allies have tried to restrict the use of Chinese technology based on espionage fears.

Michael Cohen in Congress: President Trump's former personal lawyer said on Thursday that he would give ""a full and credible account"" of his work for Mr. Trump to a House committee next month.

Inauguration scrutiny: Federal prosecutors are investigating at least a dozen Ukrainians who were present during President Trump's inaugural festivities. Some of them, or their allies, are thought to have promoted proposals aligned with Russia's interests.

New Carlos Ghosn accusations: Japanese prosecutors brought fresh charges of financial wrongdoing today against the former head of the automaking alliance of Nissan, Renault and Mitsubishi. He is in jail in Tokyo.

Snapshot: Above, Venezuelans at the inauguration of President Nicolás Maduro, who was sworn in on Thursday for a second term. He has been able to retain power despite a plummeting economy, skyrocketing violence and an election that was widely seen as illegitimate.

Andy Murray retirement: The former No. 1 player and three-time Grand Slam champion announced today that he would end his tennis career after Wimbledon, if not sooner.

News quiz: Did you follow the headlines this week? Test yourself.

Late-night comedy: Jimmy Fallon discussed the government shutdown. ""Everyone's fighting. People are exhausted. There's no end in sight. It's basically like playing a game of Monopoly with your family.""

55,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/15/opinion/obamacare-unconstitutional-texas-judge.html,"After sitting on a ruling for months, a federal judge in Texas has given the Trump administration and a group of Republican-led states exactly what they asked for, and then some: the invalidation of the entire Affordable Care Act.

Don't panic. The ruling, issued late on Friday and only one day before the end of the law's annual open enrollment period, is not a model of constitutional or statutory analysis. It's instead a predictable exercise in motivated reasoning -- drafted by a jurist with a history of ruling against policies and laws advanced by President Barack Obama.

The reason the judge, Reed O'Connor, gets these cases isn't a mystery: Texas and its allied states know the game and shop these lawsuits right into Judge O'Connor's courtroom.

Another thing that isn't a mystery? The genesis of this latest attack on Obamacare. Disenchanted that a Republican-controlled federal government wouldn't repeal every word of the law, Texas and a coalition of states tried a sleight of hand: They leaned on President Trump's 2017 tax bill, known officially as the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act -- which zeroed out the tax penalty of the health care law's individual mandate -- and argued that the mandate itself was unconstitutional.

That argument has a certain flair to it, but the states didn't stop there. Their lawyers suggested that, because the individual mandate is a linchpin of the A.C.A. as a whole -- in fact, the one thing that holds the law together -- the law cannot stand without it. If the mandate falls, the logic went, the entire statute falls with it.

Shocking even conservative legal experts, the Trump administration fell for this spurious argument and lent its support to the Texas lawsuit -- which, if successful, would render all of the marquee provisions of Obamacare, like protections for patients with pre-existing conditions, null.

This all-out assault on health care is one reason Democrats did so well in the midterm elections, as voters rejected anti-Obamacare candidates at the polls. They included several lawmakers who had gleefully voted for Mr. Trump's tax bill less than a year earlier.

Except the tax bill did not invalidate the Affordable Care Act -- it did away only with the penalty for not being insured. Congress left the rest of the law intact.

Instead of respecting that legislative choice, Judge O'Connor proceeded to find all the operative provisions of the A.C.A. ""inseverable"" from the hollowed-out individual mandate. The whole law must fall. He gave the Texas-led challengers precisely what they wanted.

This partisan, activist ruling cannot stand. If it's not reversed by the conservative United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit, then it's off to the Supreme Court, where all five justices who, in 2012, already determined that the Affordable Care Act was constitutional will still be there.

One of them is Chief Justice John Roberts, who made a splash last month when he appeared to rebuke Mr. Trump's criticism of judges who don't rule as the president likes. The president this time around is rejoicing over Obamacare's apparent demise -- and is heaping praise on the ""highly respected judge"" who was itching to do Republicans' bidding. (The White House, in a modicum of decency, has said the law will stay put as the appeal moves through the courts.)

But as Chief Justice Roberts said when he cast the decisive vote that upheld Obamacare, ""It is not our job to protect the people from the consequences of their political choices."" Here the American people, through their elected representatives, made their choice, both in 2010 and 2017: Obamacare is the law of the land. It will remain that way.

56,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/11/magazine/gay-conservative-trump-era.html,"Hannity is a buffoon,"" Ben Holden said, perhaps a bit too loudly. Holden was drinking disappointing sangria with a friend at the bar of the Trump International Hotel in Washington, where he had come last February more out of curiosity than reverence for the president. He was in town for his first Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), an event that he took seriously enough to dress up for (dark suit, American-flag tie) but that he was also interested in for its anthropological weirdness. A 23-year-old student at Suffolk University in Boston who is gay and ""leans conservative,"" Holden planned to take copious notes and write a gonzo-style journalistic piece about a political gathering known as much for its raucous parties as its provocative speakers.

Holden wasn't the only young L.G.B.T. person in the Trump lobby that night. A few feet away, several conservative gay and bisexual journalists and activists reclined on couches. Among them was Charlie Nash, a tweed-wearing 21-year-old British reporter for Breitbart who described himself to me as a pagan, an absurdist and a right-wing environmentalist. Next to Nash was Lucian Wintrich, the 30-year-old former White House correspondent for The Gateway Pundit, a conspiracy-peddling far-right website founded by another gay man, Jim Hoft, to ""expose the wickedness of the left."" Wintrich is perhaps best known for his Twinks4Trump photo series, in which he photographed lithe young men wearing Make America Great Again baseball caps.

At the bar, Holden and a fellow Suffolk student were joined by a heavyset man in a colorful checkered shirt. Before telling them his name (and asking that I not use it), the man introduced himself by way of a toast: ""We're going to build that wall! We're going to make America great again!""

Holden's friend challenged the man to an arm-wrestling contest before having second thoughts. ""Actually, my masculinity is not worth sweating over in a zero-sum situation,"" he said.

""That's nonsense!"" the man told him. ""There's an economic benefit to masculinity.""

This led to some back-and-forth about economics and gender theory before Holden's friend relented and assumed an arm-wrestling position at the bar. The showdown didn't go his way. ""I think you got help from the Russians,"" he said.

""Collusion!"" the man shouted with delight.

Before long, it became clear why he had joined the students in conversation: to hit on Holden, who is tall and broad-shouldered and has big, protruding ears that add to an aura of youthful affability. But even as the man flirted he confided that he was deeply closeted and, in fact, saw his same-sex attractions as a kind of affliction. Still, he wanted Holden's phone number.

Holden couldn't relate to someone with shame about his sexual orientation, nor to those he called the ""loud gay Trump fanboys,"" referring to people like Wintrich and the former Breitbart senior editor Milo Yiannopoulos, who are both categorized by the Anti-Defamation League as ""alt lite,"" a designation given to those the organization says ""are in step with the alt-right in their hatred of feminists and immigrants, among others."" Wintrich and Yiannopoulos have made careers out of social media trolling and incendiary campus speeches tailored to outrage progressive students. (Wintrich titled a 2017 talk ""It's O.K. to Be White."") Holden saw them as gay minstrels producing a kind of garish, campy performance art meant more to shock than to make a cogent argument. He wasn't sure what they actually believed.

For his part, Holden said he believed his sexual orientation was one of the least interesting things about him. ""Being gay is not an accomplishment in and of itself,"" he told me, ""so I'm reluctant to lead with it or believe that it should dictate how I think about health care."" Holden was increasingly skeptical of tribalism and extremist elements of both parties; he seemed almost traumatized after attending the live CPAC taping of ""Hannity,"" describing some in the crowd as ""maladjusted and mindless"" and ""dredged up from the savage American hinterlands.""

Though he said he is liberal on most social issues and wishes the Republican Party would take climate change seriously, Holden aligns himself with conservatives and libertarians in many other ways -- he's anti-abortion, free-market-oriented and skeptical of big government. But perhaps above all else, Holden rejects what he considers a bedrock of contemporary liberalism: that, as he put it, your ""immutable characteristics"" -- race, ethnicity, sexual orientation -- ""should determine what your position is on every political issue, or what you're allowed to express an opinion about."" He added that he feels alienated from progressives on his campus and across the country, many of whom he believes are unwilling to debate issues ""without resorting to shaming or name-calling.""

Holden certainly didn't endear himself to most students on his campus when he showed up to classes wearing a MAGA hat a week before the 2016 presidential election. In retrospect, he said, he wasn't proud of his support for Trump. ""I think I did it mostly out of spite,"" he told me. ""It was a kind of 'F you' to the left and the Democratic Party, which is doubling down on intersectionality and identity politics.""

After barely an hour at the bar, Holden and his friend returned to CPAC's host hotel, the Gaylord National Resort in National Harbor, Md. Holden considered the Gaylord a fitting name for a conference with many openly gay attendees, including Log Cabin Republicans (a conservative L.G.B.T. group founded in 1977), Fox News analysts, transgender women and students from across the country.

Gregory T. Angelo, a 40-year-old longtime communications specialist who until recently was the president of the Log Cabin Republicans, told me that he had never seen so many openly gay conservatives at CPAC. ""They're coming out in recent years in a way they have not before,"" he said. Guy Benson, 33, a conservative writer and Fox News on-air contributor who came out publicly in 2015, told me that the conservative gay movement has become diverse enough in the past few years ""to have multiple constituencies with vastly different priorities and political styles.""

Many L.G.B.T. conservatives say they feel newly relevant and accepted in the Republican Party, which has long opposed L.G.B.T. rights. And, perhaps counterintuitive, some attribute this in part to Trump himself. ""The narrative on the left tends to be that Trump is horrible for L.G.B.T. people in every way imaginable, but that's not how many gays on the right see it,"" Benson told me. ""As a candidate, Trump signaled that L.G.B.T.-related culture wars are not ones the G.O.P. needs to be fighting anymore, and much of the base noticed. As flawed as Trump is, and despite some of his unfortunate policy moves on this front, he might actually represent a fulcrum point within the party on gay issues.""

Some gay conservatives feel so emboldened, in fact, that they ""shout about their love of the president and their L.G.B.T. identity from rooftops,"" Angelo told me. (By ""rooftops,"" he mostly meant Twitter.) Standing in front of the Log Cabin booth at CPAC, next to a poster affirming the organization's support for the Second Amendment, Angelo didn't shout, but he did beam as he showed me a letter Trump wrote in 2017 congratulating the group on its 40th anniversary. Trump is the first sitting Republican president to publicly commend the organization.

What a difference three years can make. In 2015, CPAC wouldn't even let the Log Cabin Republicans set up a booth at the conference. But now here they were, snapping pictures in front of their booth and poster (""This will be sure to trigger my entire school at once,"" a Log Cabin intern said) and basking in enthusiastic thumbs-ups from convention attendees. Though Angelo conceded the Republican Party ""still has work to do"" on L.G.B.T. issues, he insisted the future has never looked brighter. ""It's a good time to be a gay conservative,"" he said.

The reality, I would come to learn, is a bit more complicated than that.

There have historically been few good times to be a gay conservative. Gay Republicans have spent the better part of several decades being excoriated from all sides, largely rejected by their party and alternately mocked and reviled by many in the L.G.B.T. community. When I asked Rob Smith -- a 36-year-old Iraq War veteran and former Democrat who is now a conservative -- about the longtime narrative associated with gays in the G.O.P., he didn't hesitate. ""Self-hating queens,"" he said.

Gay conservatives have offered endless fodder for comedians. David Letterman took a shot during the 2004 Republican National Convention: ""You know the Log Cabin Republicans -- they hate Hillary Clinton, but they love what she's done with her hair."" Jimmy Dore, co-host of the Young Turks' ""The Aggressive Progressives"" web series, joked during a 2007 standup routine, ""They're gay Republicans -- they're people who are gay and, on purpose, are Republicans.""

When not mocking gay conservatives, comedians -- as well as many in the L.G.B.T. community -- have delighted in the sex scandals of closeted gay Republican lawmakers across the country, who often voted against gay rights even as they solicited gay sex in restrooms, hired male escorts or hooked up with men in their congressional offices. But gay Republicans have also long been seen by many in the L.G.B.T. community as no laughing matter. They're routinely denounced for supporting a party that only 4 percent of L.G.B.T. people view as ""friendly"" toward the L.G.B.T. community, according to a 2013 Pew poll.

Gay Republicans have typically offered two reasons for remaining loyal to a party that offers little reciprocation. The first is that while they wish the party were better on L.G.B.T. issues, they prioritize other concerns more. ""Why should I be a Democrat when I disagree with Democrats on most issues?"" Sarah Longwell, the 38-year-old chairwoman of the Log Cabin Republicans, asked me. ""I became interested in conservative ideas, particularly economic ideas, in high school. I knew I was conservative before I knew I was gay."" In a video on the home page of PragerU, a conservative video site, Guy Benson explained his political priorities: ""I'm a Christian, a patriotic American and a free-market, shrink-the-government conservative who also happens to be gay.""

But gay conservatives also speak of their party affiliation as a kind of public service. Many have insisted for decades that their presence in the G.O.P. (their ""place at the table,"" as some put it) has helped it evolve, however slowly, on L.G.B.T. rights. In recent years, gay and lesbian conservatives have been especially eager to take partial credit for the legalization of same-sex marriage. ""You weren't going to have the cultural shift on gay marriage without Republicans talking to Republicans about gay dignity and why gay marriage is important,"" Longwell said.

In a new documentary about the Log Cabin Republicans produced by the organization, longtime members also champion their 2004 lawsuit to overturn ""don't ask, don't tell,"" the Clinton administration policy on gay, bisexual and lesbian service members, which the organization opposed because it required service members to conceal their sexual orientation. ""It was Clinton and the Democratic Party that passed 'don't ask, don't tell,' "" a Log Cabin member says on camera. ""We fought that for 20 years.""

Listening to gay Republicans take credit for gay civil rights victories is a mind-bending exercise for many L.G.B.T. people. The writer and sex-advice columnist Dan Savage, who has publicly called gay Republicans ""house faggots,"" told me that ""the G.O.P. continues to be an anti-queer political movement, and these useful idiots continue to let themselves be used by the party to inoculate itself against charges of homophobia and transphobia.""

Though L.G.B.T. activists have never had particularly nice things to say about gay Republicans, the rhetoric has been dialed up in the Trump era. Kevin Sessums, a magazine writer and author who prolifically rails against Trump and Republicans on his popular Facebook page, has called gay Trump supporters ""Vichy gays"" for what he describes as their ""collaboration with a fascist and deeply homophobic regime."" Recently, when a gay and formerly liberal power couple from New York were profiled in The Times as Trump supporters, the reaction was fierce. ""These people are vile, despicable gay men,"" the writer and gay activist Michelangelo Signorile wrote on Twitter.

[Read how a gay and liberal couple became two of N.Y.'s biggest Trump supporters.]

Savage, Sessums and Signorile don't lack for evidence when it comes to the Republican Party's continued L.G.B.T. problem. Though Trump claimed while a candidate that he would be a ""better friend"" to L.G.B.T. people than Hillary Clinton would, gay rights advocates insist that he has failed to govern that way. ""The coordinated, systematic onslaught of attacks on L.G.B.T.Q. civil rights has been unprecedented in scale and scope,"" says Chad Griffin, the president of the Human Rights Campaign, an L.G.B.T. civil rights organization, adding that in Trump's first year alone, ""there were dozens of rollbacks, rescissions and executive orders attacking basic rights and protections.""

Transgender Americans have borne the brunt of those efforts. Trump has tried to block transgender people from serving in the military and reversed several Obama-era policies that protected transgender Americans from discrimination in workplaces, schools and prisons. But gays and lesbians haven't escaped unscathed. In addition to more symbolic gestures, like failing to recognize L.G.B.T. Pride Month, Trump has taken a plethora of anti-gay actions ""to pacify the intolerant base of his party,"" says Jimmy LaSalvia, a longtime gay conservative activist who left the G.O.P. in 2014. On the same day as the transgender military ban announcement, for example, the Trump administration landed two other blows against L.G.B.T. rights: The Justice Department argued that the 1964 Civil Rights Act's ban on sex discrimination doesn't protect American workers on the basis of sexual orientation, and Trump nominated a longtime gay rights foe, Sam Brownback, as his ambassador at large for international religious freedom, a State Department position. (As governor of Kansas, Brownback signed an executive order in 2015 prohibiting the state government from penalizing religious groups that deny services to married same-sex couples.)

Still, many of Trump's L.G.B.T. supporters dispute that Trump is bad for gay people; at CPAC, a Log Cabin Republicans flyer boasted of ""fighting the 'fake news' about our president."" Gay conservatives like to cite Trump's nomination of the openly gay Richard Grenell as ambassador to Germany as evidence that Trump has ""no personal animus toward L.G.B.T. people,"" as Angelo put it.

Critics of the party's positions on L.G.B.T. issues have other targets besides the Trump administration. The most obvious is the G.O.P.'s breathtakingly anti-L.G.B.T. 2016 platform, which implicitly affirms conversion therapy for minors, claims that allowing transgender people to use the restroom matching their gender identity is ""dangerous"" and argues for the superiority of heterosexual households. Angelo called it ""the most anti-L.G.B.T. platform in the party's 162-year history.""

And yet, many L.G.B.T. conservatives -- including Angelo -- insist the party today is no longer an inhospitable place for gay people. Some, like Lucian Wintrich, go so far as to say that ""it's liberal propaganda to suggest that the right today is anti-gay."" Others are more cleareyed about their party's shortcomings but say the platform, which is voted on by a committee dominated by social conservatives, is, as Angelo told me, ""functionally meaningless"" and ""doesn't represent the views of the Republicans I know.""

Angelo, who said the Log Cabin Republicans had a spike in membership and social media followers in 2016, believes that this greater G.O.P. openness largely explains why increasing numbers of young conservatives are coming out of the closet and ""speaking their minds."" But other gay conservatives told me that Trump has simultaneously had an opposite effect. Andrew Sullivan, arguably the most influential (and controversial) conservative gay voice of the last three decades, told me he knows many politically moderate gay conservatives who have decided to ""keep their heads down"" during the Trump era. ""Because they know that during this period of the Great Awokening, opposing Trump is not enough to satisfy the far left,"" said Sullivan, who still considers himself center-right politically even though he has supported Democratic presidential candidates since 2000. ""Anything less than completely accepting the far left's worldview will get you attacked as racist, or misogynistic, or ableist, or whatever slur the mob settles on.""

Considering how much criticism L.G.B.T. conservatives face from outside their ranks, I was surprised by how often I heard them disparage one another. The assimilationist-minded Log Cabin Republicans, the Trump critics like Sullivan, the deliberately trollish Yiannopoulos acolytes and the conservative-leaning college students coming of age in an era of greater social acceptance have seemingly little in common besides their sexual orientation -- and their oft-stated distaste for identity politics. I routinely heard conservative gays criticize other conservative gays as ineffective, boring or empty vessels. ""What I see right now in the conservative L.G.B.T. community are a lot of Twitter trolls and some social media celebrities,"" Rob Smith, the Iraq vet, told me. ""What I don't see are a lot of movement leaders.""

Not long before CPAC last year, I asked Doug Hattaway, a gay Democratic strategist who was a senior adviser to Hillary Clinton's 2008 presidential campaign, if he counted any gay conservatives as good friends. He did not, he told me, though he recently had gone on a Tinder date with a Trump appointee. ""It did not go well,"" he said. But Hattaway was friends with a gay former conservative -- a 32-year-old named Ryan Newcomb, who worked in the White House during the George W. Bush administration and whom Hattaway describes as now being a ""raging progressive."" Hattaway invited Newcomb to join us that night for a drink at a bar in Washington's Logan Circle neighborhood.

The same day, I spoke by phone with a longtime gay conservative who served in Trump's presidential campaign. (Though he is out of the closet, he asked me not to use his name so he could speak freely about his personal life. I'll call him C., the first letter of his first name.) C. was having a rough week. His liberal boyfriend of about a year, whom C. was ""head over heels for,"" had decided, after much consternation, that he couldn't continue seeing a Trump-supporting Republican. Though C. was devastated, he said he'd had plenty of practice being rejected by gay Democrats. He'd had men storm out of first dates with him, yell at him in bars and pour drinks on his head.

I didn't expect anything that dramatic to happen when I invited C. to join Hattaway, Newcomb and me at the bar. As we waited for C. to arrive, Newcomb reclined in his seat with a drink and scrolled through his cellphone contacts, amazed at how many right-leaning gays he knew. I heard something similar from Tim Miller, a gay former communications staff member for Jeb Bush, who told me he was surprised by how quickly a community of mostly young, openly gay conservative men has formed in recent years in Washington. (Conservative lesbians often have less luck finding community. Sarah Longwell told me that she personally knew only a handful of conservative lesbians, and that her spouse and all her close lesbian friends are Democrats.)

When C. finally arrived, it didn't take long for talk to turn to Trump. ""I still can't believe he's president,"" Newcomb said, shaking his head in disbelief.

""Why?"" C. asked.

""Because he's not worthy of the title.""

""Well, he won,"" C. said, annoyed.

Awkward silence ensued. Before long, C. left. ""I can stomach gay Republicans,"" Hattaway said once C. was out the door. ""But a gay Trump supporter? They know it's indefensible, so off they go.""

But many gay Trump supporters aren't so quick to run from a fight. In late 2017 I visited Chadwick Moore, a 35-year-old former liberal and writer for the national gay magazine Out who is now one of the most combative L.G.B.T. conservatives on social media and on Fox News, where he is Tucker Carlson's go-to gay on the supposed hysterics of the gay left. During a June segment about a Huffington Post piece calling for a boycott of Chick-fil-A for its past donations to groups opposing L.G.B.T. rights, Moore gleefully drank from a Chick-fil-A cup as he mocked ""pearl-clutching lefty gays"" he deemed ""desperate for villains"" because they have ""no one left to hate.""

Moore -- who has repeatedly defended the Proud Boys, a far-right men's group of self-identified ""Western chauvinists"" that was banned on Facebook and Instagram after 10 members were arrested on charges of riot and attempted assault in New York in October -- insists that the real threat to gay people comes from Islam. A strain of Islamophobia is common among some gay conservatives here and abroad, including in France's far-right National Rally party (formerly called the National Front), which, though it opposes same-sex marriage, reportedly had more gay people in leadership roles in 2017 than any other major party in the country. ""Pray for Le Pen,"" Moore tweeted in support of National Rally candidate Marine Le Pen before last year's French presidential election.

This current iteration of Moore would likely come as a surprise to the old version, who voted for Hillary Clinton. Moore ""came out"" as a conservative not long after he wrote an October 2016 Out cover story about Yiannopoulos that was harshly criticized as too sympathetic by many L.G.B.T. journalists. When I met with Moore on the patio of a bar in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, to talk about his political metamorphosis, he had come directly from a taping of Carlson's show and was still on an adrenaline high. Though he was friendlier and more introspective in person than he is on social media, it was difficult to take him seriously when he said things like ""David Duke is actually a leftist"" and ""What's not to love about Trump? He's a drag queen. He's a cartoon character. He's fabulous. He's a Kardashian!""

I was curious how much of Moore's persona was Yiannopoulos-inspired performance art that he didn't actually believe but that was gaining him more notoriety than he enjoyed as a writer for Out. I also wondered whether Moore's schoolyard mocking of the gay left (sample tweet to Glaad, a group focused on L.G.B.T. media coverage: ""Grow a pair, ladies"") was retribution for being publicly rebuked by his L.G.B.T. colleagues and eventually shunned by his longtime gay friends.

Unsurprisingly, Moore rejected both theories, insisting that as a member of the mainstream media, I couldn't possibly understand him or portray him positively. ""I like myself so much more and am so much happier"" as a conservative, he said, but that's ""going to be left out of your article, because it's too uplifting."" He no longer supports Democrats, he explained, because the contemporary left is dishonest, hysterical and obsessed with policing speech. Worse yet, the left is no fun anymore. ""If you love mischief, if you love upsetting delicate people, I don't know where else you would be right now than the gay right,"" he told me.

Though Moore and Lucian Wintrich rarely passed up an opportunity to throw shade at each other when I spoke with them -- Moore calls Wintrich ""the dumbest person on the internet,"" while Wintrich says Moore is ""stealing Milo's tired act"" -- they share a belief that their contemporary brand of conservatism is channeling a subversive, old-school gay spirit.

""Being gay used to be about being transgressive and pushing the culture,"" Wintrich told me in late 2017 in the Washington apartment he lived in at the time, which was decorated with huge framed Twinks4Trump photographs. Wintrich, who attended Bard College and could even now pass for a brooding student at the famously liberal school, smoked a cigarette near an open kitchen window. ""When did gay men get so boring?""

In April I traveled to northwest Oklahoma to meet Colton Buckley, a 24-year-old gay cowboy in the midst of a Republican primary campaign for a seat in the Oklahoma House. A self-described ""God-fearing, gun-toting gay,"" Buckley hoped to represent Ellis County, a sparsely populated area that may have more feral pigs than Hillary Clinton supporters. Of the 1,766 county residents who voted in the 2016 presidential election, only 155 backed Clinton.

That was good news for Buckley, one of the youngest Trump delegates to the 2016 Republican convention and one of more than 20 Republican L.G.B.T. candidates who competed in federal or local races in the 2018 election, according to the LGBTQ Victory Fund, a political action committee. (Five of these candidates won.)

Buckley, who came out publicly after the deadly 2016 terrorist shooting at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, told me that his primary opponents were trying to use his sexual orientation against him. ""There's a whisper campaign going on,"" he said, as he drove around Ellis County in his pickup truck, wearing jeans and a cowboy hat. Buckley told me he opposes both same-sex marriage -- ""for biblical reasons,"" he said -- and what he calls ""the homosexual agenda."" (When I asked for sample agenda items, Buckley said it was less of an actual list and more of a ""catchall phrase for a liberal doctrine."") Buckley summarized his political beliefs this way: ""I'm one of the most conservative gay people you'll ever meet.""

Buckley lives in Arnett, a small, barren town with only one place to get a beer -- a dive bar called the Longhorn with signage you might expect to find at the after-party for a women's rodeo (""Cowgirl Motto: Party 'til He's Cute""). The Longhorn's chatty owner, Stacy McCartor, had also outfitted the place with Buckley campaign signs. She didn't care that he was gay, she said, though she worried that others would. ""If only you were a lesbian -- guys can wrap their heads around that!"" she told him.

I watched Buckley give a short version of his stump speech to three men in their 30s sitting around a table drinking. Then Buckley pulled out his phone to play a video from his campaign website, in which he shoots an AR-15 rifle after defiantly asking, ""What part of 'shall not be infringed' do you not understand?""

The most talkative of the three men didn't know that Buckley was gay, and finally he asked why I was there taking notes. ""This is a journalist,"" Buckley told him, ""and he wants to know how a young man who lives in rural Oklahoma and who is running for office as a Republican is also a fag."" (Buckley told me he often used derogatory terms ""to disarm voters who would potentially shut down based on my sexual orientation."")

The man looked confused. ""I'm going to need a couple more beers,"" he said finally.

After gathering his thoughts, he told Buckley that he was ""in the wrong area to be doing this. People around here ain't gonna vote for you."" He said he didn't personally have a problem with gay people before suggesting, a few minutes later, that Buckley might eventually learn to appreciate the opposite sex. ""You don't have no interest in a woman?"" he asked.

""Nope,"" Buckley said, adding that he didn't choose to be gay. ""Why would I live in a rural area and be a Republican and a Christian and choose something where everybody's gonna hate me?""

""I don't hate you,"" the man said. Before long, in fact, he almost seemed ready to play matchmaker. ""Do you have any interest in anyone here in town? Any fellas?""

Buckley offered him a choice. Would he prefer a candidate who is straight but who wants to raise taxes, as Buckley suggested one of his opponents did? Or would he prefer ""a faggot that's going to fight for your gun rights and make sure your taxes don't get raised""? The man didn't hesitate. ""The faggot,"" he said. Buckley turned toward me. ""See? That's why I'm going to win this race.""

Buckley turned out to be wrong about that -- he finished in third place with just 26 percent of the vote. When I texted him after the primary to ask if he thought he would have made the runoff had he not been openly gay, he didn't hesitate. ""Yes,"" he wrote back. But Buckley didn't regret coming out. ""The fact that I'm running honestly, bringing all of myself to the table, is a testament to how things are changing in this country for gay people,"" he told me. He suspected that had he been born five or 10 years earlier, he would have run as a closeted candidate. ""That's what most gay conservatives did until now,"" he said. ""Or they didn't run at all.""

If an openly gay cowboy running for office was a surprise to Republicans in Ellis County, conservative transgender activists were an equally unexpected sight at last year's CPAC. Three transgender women, including Jennifer Williams, a 50-year-old government contractor from Trenton, walked around the Gaylord holding an L.G.B.T.-pride flag and small signs that read: ""Proud to be Conservative. Proud to be Transgender. Proud to be American. #SameTeam.""

They knew they had their work cut out for them. Williams, who is running for the state's General Assembly, told me that while most mainstream Republicans wouldn't dare be openly contemptuous of gays and lesbians anymore, there's no similar reprieve for transgender people. She described an endless barrage of antitransgender rhetoric from conservatives, including from some gay men (both Wintrich and Moore used the transgender slur ""tranny"" in their conversations with me) and from prominent voices like Ben Shapiro, who has called transgenderism a ""mental disorder."" At CPAC, Shapiro told the crowd that ""you don't get to tell little boys they can become little girls just to avoid offending people.""

The day after Shapiro's speech, I watched the transgender women engage in a lengthy discussion with several young men, including Ben Holden and another conservative gay college student. In what occasionally felt like a debate, Williams tried to get them to understand that transgender people face many of the same smears -- that they're mentally unstable and a threat to children in restrooms -- that were aimed at gay men not long ago. Their conversation was momentarily interrupted when a young white nationalist walked between them, handing out his business card and suggesting that his organization ""is going to be the future, because we have stuff like this"" -- meaning transgender people -- ""we have to deal with."" Though jarring, the disruption offered Williams and the students something they could agree on: White nationalism is bad.

I could think of few lonelier identities than that of transgender conservative activist, and I wondered whether Williams considered leaving the party after she transitioned in 2015. She had, she said, but she decided against it partly because ""I was a Republican long before I was transgender,"" adding that her politics -- including limited government, a strong military and free-market policies -- still align her more closely with Republicans.

Like many L.G.B.T. conservatives, she also held out hope that her party might change. Jimmy LaSalvia, the longtime gay conservative who left the party in 2014, told me that he had watched several waves of gay conservatives have similar hopes dashed over the decades: ""I've seen so many fight the good fight, then become disillusioned that the party isn't changing and become independents or Democrats,"" he said. ""Then a new group of young gay conservatives appears, and they know almost nothing of this history, and they again insist that the party will change.""

Williams's initial optimism in 2016 was shared by many L.G.B.T. conservatives, who watched as candidate Trump ""made rather unprecedented public moves for a Republican to declare himself on the side of L.G.B.T. voters,"" recalls Patrick J. Egan, a political scientist at N.Y.U. who researches L.G.B.T. voting behavior. Trump hawked ""LGBTQ for Trump"" T-shirts on his campaign website, held up a pride flag during a campaign event and presided over what Angelo, the former Log Cabin president, called ""the most gay-friendly convention in G.O.P. history."" That's a low bar, to be sure, but for some Log Cabin members who witnessed Pat Buchanan's virulently anti-gay speech at the 1992 Republican convention, Trump's willingness to say the term ""L.G.B.T.Q."" from the stage and to offer the PayPal co-founder and openly gay conservative Peter Thiel a prime speaking slot was ""deeply meaningful,"" Angelo said.

But it wasn't meaningful enough to earn Williams's support -- or that of many L.G.B.T. people. Trump received just 14 percent of the community's vote, according to exit polling, significantly less than the 22 percent who backed Mitt Romney in 2012. One reason, Williams said, was Trump's selection of Mike Pence, who has a long history of opposing L.G.B.T. rights, including suggesting that same-sex marriage might cause ""societal collapse,"" as his running mate.

Still, Trump's announcement as president that he would block transgender people from serving in the military came as a surprise to Williams. ""It felt like somebody sucker-punched me,"" she said. But many gay conservatives I spent time with played down the importance of Trump's record on transgender rights. ""I think the trans issue gets more attention than it warrants,"" says Jamie Kirchick, a center-right gay writer and visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution who opposed Trump's military ban but who believes ""the gay movement has been overtaken by transgender issues affecting a minuscule percentage of the population."" Rob Smith, the Iraq veteran, channeled the feelings of many gay conservatives I spoke to about transgender rights when he tweeted: ""A 'good' gay in 2018 must: Diffuse his masculinity at all costs. Never question a trans person. Ever.""

The unwillingness of many gay conservatives to prioritize the struggle of transgender people comes as little surprise to Richard Goldstein, a gay former executive editor for The Village Voice who published ""Homocons,"" a scathing book about gay conservatives, 17 years ago. Though Goldstein doesn't view them with the same scorn he once did (he sees their ability to live openly gay lives as proof of ""the gay left's success making it possible for every gay person to be themselves""), he remains disappointed by what he sees as their inability to empathize with marginalized communities. ""These are mostly white gay men who are pretty comfortable and who can't seem to understand that many in the L.G.B.T. community are still not safe and need protection,"" Goldstein said.

That seeming lack of compassion also struck Alexander Chalgren, who for a time was arguably the most famous young Trump supporter in America. The former deputy director of Students for Trump, Chalgren, now a 21-year-old student at Cornell, was featured on a 2016 episode of ""This American Life,"" during which he said that just because he was gay and black didn't mean he had to be a Democrat. But by the time I met Chalgren at CPAC, he had begun to sour on the president. He was particularly disheartened by Trump's reaction to the 2017 white-supremacist marches and violence in Charlottesville and by his transgender military ban, which Chalgren called needlessly cruel. ""I don't have respect for a draft dodger who won't allow other people to serve,"" he told me.

When I talked to Chalgren again in November, he said he had lost all faith in Trump -- and was disgusted by the Republicans' ""complete capitulation"" to him. ""I don't consider myself a Republican anymore,"" he told me. ""I'll be voting for Democrats in 2020.""

Among some L.G.B.T. conservatives there's a contention that Chalgren's experience is rare, and that the real movement is among people -- both straight and gay -- fleeing the Democratic Party, though the only evidence for this is anecdotal. In the 2018 midterms, in fact, 82 percent of L.G.B.T. voters supported their Democratic candidate for the House of Representatives, an increase over the three previous midterm election cycles, according to NBC News exit polling. The same polls show a decline since 2014 in Republican Party identification among L.G.B.T. voters, though the proportion who identify as ""conservative"" has held steady at 14 percent.

A leading proponent of the Democratic-flight theory is Brandon Straka, a gay 41-year-old hairstylist and longtime liberal from New York who became disillusioned with the Democratic Party and announced in a YouTube video last May that he was walking away from it. The #WalkAway hashtag became a sensation on right-wing social media, and Straka organized a #WalkAway march and rally in Washington 10 days before the midterm elections.

I met Straka the morning of the event at the Trump International Hotel; he had come from an appearance on ""Fox & Friends,"" which apparently caught the attention of Trump, who promptly tweeted about the march. Though it was raining, about 500 people (the crowd would later at least quadruple, by my estimate) gathered for a premarch rally at a park. Some came bearing signs. One read ""I never dreamed I'd grow up to be a deplorable, but here I am killing it. #WalkAway,"" while another read ""Not a Bot,"" a reference to reports contending the movement's popularity was inflated by Russian social media accounts and other agents of disinformation.

Many of those in attendance at the premarch rally said they were longtime conservatives -- or ""WalkWiths,"" as they called themselves. But I also met longtime Democrats and formerly ""closeted conservatives,"" people like Lynzee and Michelle Domanico, a married lesbian couple who in 2018 launched The Closet on the Right, a website for ""people living in fear"" of being ""shunned, abandoned and vilified"" for their conservative beliefs. As I spoke with Lynzee and Michelle, another lesbian walked by and said: ""More lesbians for Trump. We love Daddy!""

The most interesting conversation I had that morning was with a married lesbian couple in their 60s who had until recently lived in San Francisco. The quieter of the pair, Jill, seemed surprised and not altogether comfortable that her recent political metamorphosis (from ""San Francisco liberal"" to political independent) had brought her here, only feet from a man holding a sign critical of Planned Parenthood. ""I'm walking away -- I'm just not sure what I'm walking away toward,"" Jill told me. ""I'm not a Democrat anymore, but I'm not ready to embrace Trump or to align myself with Republicans. I'm a Jew, I'm pro-choice. The evangelical wing of the party would keep me away.""

Attending the rally had been the idea of Jill's wife, Ann, who expressed frustration with a contemporary Democratic Party she insists has lost its mind -- and its priorities -- in the Trump era. ""I don't hear any coherent vision for what the Democratic leadership believes in -- most of what I hear is constant demonizing of Trump and his supporters,"" she said. ""I told Jill: 'Let's say I had a MAGA hat on. I wouldn't, but let's say I did. How far do you think I'd get down the street in New York, San Francisco or Berkeley before somebody spit on me or hit me?' That's not my Democratic Party. Old-school Democrats -- we fought for the right of people we disagreed with to be able to speak, even when we thought their positions were offensive and wrong.""

Among the gays and lesbians I spoke with at the rally, there was a prevailing belief that while the L.G.B.T. community's loyalty to the Democratic Party may have made sense in the past, it doesn't now and won't in 2020. As many gay conservatives see it, most L.G.B.T. people are now fully assimilated and are as secure as any other Americans.

Whether L.G.B.T. people feel secure in this country could have profound implications on the future of the community's vote, says Patrick Egan, the N.Y.U. political scientist. He believes that as L.G.B.T. people feel increasingly assimilated, they could go the way of one or the other of two traditionally Democratic constituencies: Jewish voters, who have by and large remained loyal to the Democratic Party as they have assimilated, or non-Hispanic Catholics, who gradually shed their partisanship. He suspects that will depend partly on the degree to which L.G.B.T. people continue to see themselves as outsiders.

Egan notes that marginalized groups can feel insecure even when protected by law, as L.G.B.T. people increasingly are. In a 2015 Washington Post article, he proposed asking ""any legally married gay couple this question: Where do you feel comfortable holding your spouse's hand in public?"" For most gay couples, he suggested, the list of safe places is a short one. Until that changes, Egan suspects L.G.B.T. voting behavior won't.

There's another factor that could curb any meaningful L.G.B.T. migration toward the Republicans. The L.G.B.T. community, Egan says, has been ""deeply infused with the notion of coalitions with other disenfranchised groups. There's a sense among many rank-and-file voters that these fates are linked.""

Egan suspects that's partly why Trump got so little L.G.B.T. support. Longwell, the Log Cabin chairwoman, agrees. ""For many L.G.B.T. people, it didn't matter how positive candidate Trump's posture was on gay issues,"" she says. ""It couldn't compensate for the alarming way Trump talked about women and minority and immigrant communities,"" adding that many L.G.B.T. people are also members of those groups. Though Longwell can envision the day L.G.B.T. young people don't automatically vote Democratic, she told me that will depend on what the Republican Party looks like after Trump. ""I don't believe that the party at this moment is compelling for many young people, gay or straight. In fact, I worry that we're losing a generation.""

In October, Ben Holden sat with three other conservative students at a table in a student center on the campus of Suffolk University behind a banner promoting their chapter of Young Americans for Freedom (Y.A.F.), a national conservative student activist organization.

The four club members were white men, a stark contrast to the diverse students at tables around them. Holden recognized the optics problem while also lamenting that he had to think that way. What you look like shouldn't make your argument any more or less valid, he said: ""Demographics shouldn't be destiny.""

During the hour I sat with the club members, only one person -- a reporter for The Suffolk Voice, the school's online student publication -- stopped to chat with them. ""You guys causing drama?"" the young reporter said with a smile. (Y.A.F. is used to ruffling feathers. In April the group invited Christina Hoff Sommers, a critic of contemporary feminism, to campus.)

""Not enough, unfortunately,"" Holden told her. ""We're just here showing people we're still alive.""

""Oh, they know,"" she said. ""Especially after your little Twitter escapade.""

The reporter was referencing a short video Holden and Y.A.F. posted to Twitter on Oct. 11, National Coming Out Day, during which Holden said he was ""coming out as a conservative."" Almost as an afterthought he added, ""Also, I'm gay. Not that that really matters anymore."" The video drew some outrage on Twitter, with one young woman writing that ""this parasite is mocking a day that was created to spread awareness about a community that is oppressed every single day.""

Despite making the Coming Out Day video, Holden played down the relevance of his sexual orientation to his politics. Most conservatives his age ""couldn't care less that I'm gay,"" he told me. Though he conceded that ""the left is responsible for most of the progress on gay issues,"" he believes that ""now it's more a generational issue than a left vs. right one.""

Holden was keener to discuss his favorite class this semester, ""Fyodor Dostoyevsky and the Great Philosophical Novel."" He said that the course was causing him to re-evaluate his motivations and those of everyone else in the world. It was also making him even more suspicious of conversations (political or otherwise) ""where one or both people have a predetermined conclusion,"" he said.

He reminded me that he's only 23, and that though he leans politically conservative at this moment in his life (and plans to return to CPAC in late February), he doesn't want to be forever wedded to one ideology. ""But we live at a time when you're expected to pick a side, and to stick to it without giving an inch or admitting that the opposing side might not have malicious intent,"" he said. Nearly every time we spoke over the past year, Holden lamented this polarization, which he said had an impact on students on his campus, cable-news commentators and seemingly everyone else. Holden had hoped to put together a ""smart and nuanced"" panel at Suffolk about immigration policy, for example, but he wasn't sure such a thing was possible.

""Trying to engage people in a thoughtful debate about ideas during the Donald Trump era seems like something very few people want to do,"" he said. ""I spend a lot more time thinking about how to exist during this time of political lunacy than I do about being a gay conservative."""
57,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/14/business/huawei-meng-hsbc-canada.html,"It was a message that federal authorities had grown accustomed to hearing: The global bank HSBC belatedly realized it had been processing financial transactions that might have run afoul of American law.

HSBC had repeatedly been penalized for helping clients launder money. Now, though, there was a different problem. From 2009 to 2014, HSBC helped the Chinese telecommunications giant Huawei move money in Iran, in breach of United States sanctions. This time, the bank said, it had a good excuse: Huawei, and one of its top executives, tricked HSBC into handling the business.

This month, the matter exploded into an international incident that shook global financial markets and threatened to deepen tensions between the American and Chinese governments. Meng Wanzhou, Huawei's chief financial officer and a daughter of the company's founder, was arrested in Vancouver by Canadian authorities who were acting at the behest of American prosecutors.

The details of the criminal charges against Ms. Meng, filed under seal, remain murky. But court filings in Canada and interviews with people familiar with the Huawei investigation show that the events leading to her arrest were set in motion years ago.

They grew out of an Obama administration national security investigation into Chinese companies -- including Huawei -- that act as extensions of the country's government, according to the people familiar with the investigation. The focus only recently shifted to whether Huawei, and specifically Ms. Meng, deceived HSBC and other banks to get them to keep facilitating business in Iran. Former federal prosecutors said pursuing Ms. Meng, 46, for alleged bank fraud proved to be a better line of attack than trying to build a case on national security grounds.

American national security experts believe China has bolstered its economy -- now the world's second largest -- by stealing corporate, academic and military secrets. Among the concerns is that Chinese telecommunications equipment could be used to spy on American citizens. The top United States intelligence agencies told senators this year that Americans should not buy Huawei products.

Counterintelligence agents and federal prosecutors began exploring possible cases against Huawei's leadership in 2010, according to a former federal law enforcement official. The effort was led by United States attorney's offices in places where Huawei has facilities, including Massachusetts, Alabama, California, New York and Texas.

As they investigated Huawei, F.B.I. agents grew concerned that company officers were working on behalf of the Chinese government, according to current and former federal officials.

But criminally charging Huawei or its executives for espionage or other security crimes was not likely to be simple. Former federal prosecutors said doing so often risked exposing the sources of confidential information. As a result, they said, prosecutors often look to bring more conventional cases involving crimes such as bank fraud. Think of it as the Al Capone strategy: Prosecutors went after the notorious gangster by charging him with tax evasion.

That is where HSBC came in.

Since at least 2009, Huawei had been a client of the bank. In 2013, a report by Reuters revealed that Huawei, through a subsidiary called Skycom, had been secretly doing business in Iran -- a country subject to stringent international sanctions.

HSBC asked Huawei if the Reuters report was true. It was a big concern for the bank, because the previous year federal prosecutors had accused it of willfully failing to stop money laundering by customers, including in countries like Iran. To settle that investigation, HSBC had paid a $1.9 billion fine, entered into a deferred prosecution agreement and agreed to have a court-supervised monitor installed inside the bank.

While American companies are legally restricted from doing business with people and institutions in countries under United States sanctions, nothing stops Huawei from doing so. But if an international bank like HSBC moves money through the United States on its way to or from Iran, that potentially violates American law -- which is what HSBC executives were apparently worried about with Huawei and Skycom.

Huawei sent Ms. Meng -- a daughter of Huawei's founder, Ren Zhengfei -- to try to assuage HSBC's concerns. In August 2013, she gave a PowerPoint presentation to HSBC officials in which she denied that Huawei was connected to Skycom. She also said Huawei had complied with American sanctions and would not use HSBC for any transactions in Iran, according to Canadian court filings.

While Ms. Meng's presentation was in Chinese, Huawei later sent an English version to the bank. ""HSBC has been working with Huawei for a long time and has a deep understanding of Huawei's history of growth around the world,"" the presentation said. ""We have been and will continue to be transparent.""

The presentation was kept on file at HSBC. Several of the bank's risk-assessment committees relied on it to justify continuing to do business with Huawei. By 2014, the bank had unwittingly cleared more than $100 million in transactions with Skycom in Iran, according to federal prosecutors.

In 2015, HSBC appeared to have a change of heart about doing business with Huawei. The bank's reputational risk committee met in New York on April 15 and decided not to do business with Huawei's American subsidiary.

The next year, the United States accused ZTE, another large Chinese technology company, of operating in countries that were under sanctions. As part of that case, American officials released internal ZTE documents in which executives had described creating ""cutoff companies"" that would do business in places like Iran and North Korea.

In the documents, the executives said ZTE should follow the example of a rival company, called F7. American officials concluded that was a reference to Huawei, prompting them to intensify their scrutiny of the company, according to a senior Obama administration official.

By early 2017, HSBC and the court-appointed monitor inside the bank had disclosed the Iran transactions to federal prosecutors in Brooklyn, according to a person briefed on aspects of the federal investigation. HSBC provided the prosecutors with Ms. Meng's 2013 PowerPoint presentation. HSBC said this week that it was cooperating with the government and was not under investigation itself.

In April last year, Huawei learned of the investigation when prosecutors subpoenaed one of its American subsidiaries, according to the Canadian court documents.

Federal prosecutors concluded that Huawei secretly controlled Skycom and used it to dodge international sanctions in Iran from 2009 to 2014.

This summer, the prosecutors decided to file criminal charges against Ms. Meng -- fulfilling their yearslong goal of going after Huawei executives for allegedly acting as an extension of the Chinese government.

Prosecutors filed the charges, under seal, on Aug. 22, and a federal judge in Brooklyn signed a warrant for Ms. Meng's arrest. The charges focused, at least in part, on her allegedly tricking at least four banks, including HSBC and Standard Chartered, into facilitating the company's Iranian transactions.

While Ms. Meng's main home is in Shenzhen, China, she regularly traveled to Canada; she and her husband own two houses in Vancouver. The authorities figured it was only a matter of time before she traveled there, and the United States and Canada have an extradition treaty.

On Dec. 1, Ms. Meng flew from Hong Kong to Vancouver International Airport, where she stopped for a 12-hour layover before flying to Mexico. As she got off the plane, the Canadian police arrested her.

The United States is seeking her extradition, but federal prosecutors haven't unsealed the charges against her.

Much of what is known about the charges comes from a three-page letter that the Brooklyn prosecutors sent to their Canadian counterparts on Dec. 3. Court filings by the Canadian authorities largely rely on the facts provided by the United States. The filings were made public during Ms. Meng's bail hearing this week.

In their three-page letter, the prosecutors argued that Ms. Meng had lied to banks about Huawei's connections to Skycom to keep doing business in Iran. They said her 2013 presentation to HSBC ""contains multiple material misrepresentations as to the nature of Huawei's business in a high-risk jurisdiction."" A spokesman for the United States attorney's office in Brooklyn declined to comment.

On Tuesday, a Canadian judge released Ms. Meng after she posted about $7.5 million in bail and submitted to strict electronic surveillance.

Federal authorities have 60 days from Ms. Meng's arrest to file extradition papers in Canada.

David Martin, one of Ms. Meng's lawyers in Canada, did not respond to requests for comment. During the bail hearing, he said Ms. Meng's presentation to HSBC had been prepared by Huawei's legal team. He said his client was innocent and planned to fight extradition.

In the meantime, her arrest has injected Ms. Meng, a mother of four, into the middle of a multifaceted tug-of-war between the United States and China.

President Trump said in an interview with Reuters on Tuesday, ""If I think it's good for what will be certainly the largest trade deal ever made -- which is a very important thing -- what's good for national security -- I would certainly intervene if I thought it was necessary.""

In China, online chat forums and social media are buzzing with ire toward the United States and Canada. The Global Times, a nationalistic Chinese media outlet, has floated the idea of a boycott of Canadian tourism and products like Canada Goose jackets."
58,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/11/magazine/marine-corps-integration-newsletter.html,"In this week's At War newsletter: a Times reporter and former Marine writes about his life in boot camp, in response to the service's gender-integration news.

At War is a newsletter about the experiences and costs of war with stories from Times reporters and outside voices.

Last week, the Marine Corps announced that it would integrate a platoon of female recruits into an all-male training battalion at Parris Island, S.C., the swampy, sand-flea-ridden East Coast training hub for enlisted Marines.

It was big news. Headlines, including from The New York Times, heralded that the Marine Corps was finally integrating female and male Marines at boot camp -- a move that comes years after the Army, Navy and Air Force had fully integrated their basic training for recruits. But the initiative wasn't a permanent one. The Marine Corps said that the change was a one-time thing and that it had no further plans to repeat the process with future battalions. Enlisted female Marines are normally assigned to their own training battalion at Parris Island. Because there were fewer recruits than usual this winter, Marine officials thought it would be smart to attach the incoming platoon of 50 women to a male battalion for efficiency's sake.

Marines to Integrate Female and Male Training Battalions for First TimeJan. 4, 2019

A recruit's world at Marine Corps boot camp is relegated to his or her assigned platoon, so this temporary change does not have female recruits living alongside their male counterparts in the barracks -- much like basic training in the Army. They are still being kept separate, housed on their own floor with their own female drill instructors.

[Get a weekly roundup of Times coverage of war delivered to your inbox. Sign up here.]

But that's not to say this is not a big deal for the Marine Corps. It's an organization steeped in old habits and tradition and surrounded by a rampant group of veterans who are quick to criticize any change to their ""old corps."" The corps has the lowest percentage of women of any military branch and for years has resisted integration of its fighting forces.

In the winter of 2007, at age 19, I was in Platoon 3028, India Company, Third Recruit Training Battalion, the same company and battalion that this female platoon will soon join. Back then, Third Battalion was located on the other side of the base, far away from the other two male battalions. There were rows of barracks that housed each company of recruits -- India, Kilo, Mike and, later that year, Lima -- with an old parade ground, built in the middle of the 20th century, surrounded by tree lines. On Parris Island, we felt isolated from the rest of the world and at Third Battalion even more so.

Our interaction with female recruits was not just limited but was explicitly forbidden by our drill instructors. On Sundays, we would see them at church, assigned to their own rows of seats in the auditorium. One story circulated that a male recruit was passing notes to a female recruit in church, and his drill instructors found out. We all pictured him getting hazed until 2 in the morning and to within an inch of his death. Who knows what really happened, and who knows if that's really changed.

Elsewhere in the Marine Corps, women have slowly started to appear in the combat jobs that the Obama administration opened in 2015 -- a change the Marine Corps leadership strongly opposed at the time. Of the roughly 15,000 women in the Marines (less than 10 percent of the force), around 100 are serving in the once-restricted roles, and only one has led an infantry platoon. In 2018, I profiled First Lt. Marina A. Hierl, who is the first woman in the Marine Corps to lead an infantry platoon. In the beginning, she faced skepticism from her superiors, but months later, she was seen no differently than anyone else in her 1,000-strong battalion.

TIMES EVENT: Civilian Casualties of the War on Terror

Tuesday, February 5, 2019 | New York City

A rare convergence of experts on the human costs of war will discuss the often-ignored outgrowth of the global war on terror: two decades of civilian casualties. Times journalist and Marine Corps infantry veteran C. J. Chivers, winner of the Pulitzer Prize for his 2016 story about an Afghan war veteran suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder, will moderate the discussion. The panelists are Alissa J. Rubin, the Times Paris bureau chief who won a Pulitzer Prize for foreign reporting on Afghanistan in 2015; Azmat Khan, an investigative reporter and New York Times Magazine contributor, who uncovered civilian casualties among nearly 150 airstrike sites across northern Iraq; and writer Brian Castner, a veteran of the Iraq war and weapons expert for Amnesty International's crisis team, who also investigates war crimes and human rights violations.

59,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/11/us/politics/state-department-ambassadors-shutdown.html,"WASHINGTON -- The State Department plans to fly all of its ambassadors and other top diplomatic envoys from around the world into Washington next week for a two-day conference, even if the ongoing partial government shutdown continues.

Most State Department employees have been furloughed or are working without pay since the shutdown began on Dec. 22. But the department will pay for travel expenses and other costs related to the forum, called the Global Chiefs of Mission Conference.

The conference is scheduled to take place on Jan. 16 and 17, and embassy leaders from around the world are expected to be absent for about one week from the countries in which they work. The conference was first held in 2011, when Hillary Clinton was secretary of state, and has been held twice since.

Asked for comment on Friday, the State Department issued a statement that said officials had decided to continue with the conference because ""it is essential to the conduct of foreign affairs essential to national security.""

The department noted that Congress recently confirmed 23 ambassadors. It called the conference ""particularly important and timely in helping them get off to the right start."" Bloomberg News first reported the decision to hold it, despite the shutdown.

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is expected to attend the forum after returning from a long trip through the Middle East.

But some former diplomats are criticizing the State Department for pressing forward with the conference.

""The notion that it's imperative that we have to get all chiefs of mission together is nonsense,"" said Brett Bruen, a former American diplomat who also worked in the White House during the Obama administration and now runs a consulting firm in Washington.

Mr. Bruen said the chiefs of mission should remain abroad, reassuring their host governments of American reliance despite the federal shutdown that was prompted by President Trump's demand for funding to build a wall on the United States border with Mexico.

""They need to be out in the field at this moment when America's credibility is on the line,"" Mr. Bruen said. ""They don't need to be back in Washington having long-term discussions with senior administration officials when the threats are immediate to America's credibility.""

""Their role right now is being the ambassadors of assurance and reliability,"" he said.

A State Department official said it was not possible to divert the money budgeted for the conference to the payroll.

Most State Department employees were last paid on Jan. 3. Their next paycheck, to be issued on Jan. 17, might have zero dollars, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Local citizens employed at American embassies overseas are still working with pay, but that could end if the shutdown continues.

During a shutdown in 2013, about 3,000 local employees went without pay at one point, the official said.

United States citizens and others working in the consular sections of embassies, which deal with visas and passports, are still working with pay because the budget for those operations generally comes from visa and passport fees."
60,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/11/world/middleeast/syria-withdraw-mideast-us.html,"BEIRUT, Lebanon -- When Turkey, Iran and Russia meet to talk about the end of the war in Syria, they do so without the United States.

Peace talks to solve the Israeli-Palestinian conflict have been frozen for years, but the long-awaited Trump plan to break the impasse has yet to arrive.

And now, despite conflicting messages about how and when it will happen, the United States is set to withdraw from Syria.

The withdrawal, which the military said began with equipment removal on Friday, is just the latest instance of a broader American disengagement from the Middle East that could have lasting effects on one of the world's most volatile regions.

As the United States steps back, Russia, Iran and regional strongmen increasingly step in to chart the region's future.

""It is not pretty,"" said Richard Haass, the president of the Council on Foreign Relations. ""It is violent. It is illiberal in every sense of the word, and the United States is essentially missing in action.""

Since the end of the Cold War, the Middle East has remained perpetually near the top of the American foreign policy agenda, kept there by the Persian Gulf War of 1990-91, the American invasion of Iraq in 2003, the Arab Spring and the battle against the Islamic State.

American leaders have offered a range reasons for the great investment of American blood and treasure in the region: to replace dictatorships with democracies, to enhance the rule of law, to support allied governments and to fight terrorism.

But for some scholars of the region, the concrete benefits of all that engagement pale in comparison to the size of the American efforts.

""When you look at the cost-benefit analysis, there is a limited payoff, and the United States is going to reduce its footprint over time because there are so many other things to deal with in the world,"" said Gary Sick, a Middle East scholar at Columbia University who served on the National Security Council under three presidents.

A similar view of the region has shaped the approach of both the Obama and Trump administrations. Despite the drastic differences in their words and style, both have viewed the Middle East primarily as a source of nuisance that siphoned resources from other American priorities. Both presidents called on regional powers to play a greater role in protecting and governing the region.

The immediate desire to step back was driven by battle fatigue after years of deadly combat in Iraq, and a feeling that American military investment often did not make matters better. But scholars say that longer term shifts have made the region less central to America's priorities.

American protection is no longer necessary to ensure the free flow of oil from the Persian Gulf, for example, and a boom in domestic production has made the United States less dependent on Middle Eastern oil anyway. Israel now boasts the region's most effective military and a strong economy while many of its neighbors are in shambles, making it less dependent on American protection.

""The reality is that our direct interests in terms of protecting the American homeland are very few in the Middle East,"" said Mr. Sick, adding that the record on American interventions doing more good than harm was at best mixed.

""Things are pretty chaotic as they are, and I don't see them getting better with our presence and I don't see them getting worse if we're not there,"" he said.

Others argue that American leverage still matters and can make a difference when the United States chooses to use it. They point to examples such as the Libyan dictator Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi's giving up his country's nuclear program under American pressure.

The Israeli-Palestinian peace process began with and was nurtured by American involvement, although Mr. Trump's moving the American Embassy to Jerusalem last year undermined a sense among Palestinians that the United States could serve as an honest broker. And pressure by American presidents pushed both Egypt and Saudi Arabia to take modest steps toward political openness.

""It can be significant for an American president to publicly criticize America's autocratic allies and lend rhetorical support to those in the region struggling against oppression and for human rights,"" said Amy Hawthorne, the deputy director of the Project on Middle East Democracy. ""Strong presidential rhetoric combined with strong presidential action behind the scenes can move the needle.""

Although President Trump has spoken little of human rights abroad while unabashedly embracing autocratic allies, many analysts said that even when the United States did champion democracy and human rights, it was tainted by the whiff of hypocrisy given its support for regional strongmen and its reluctance to punish them.

It was under President Obama, for example, that Egypt killed hundreds of civilians protesting a military coup and Saudi Arabia executed 47 people in one morning. Neither faced meaningful sanctions. Nor did Mr. Obama enforce his self-imposed red line after Syria killed more than 1,000 people in a chemical weapons attack.

Such positions have battered the reputation of the United States in the Middle East as a champion of democracy, rule of law and human rights.

""The loss of this has been quite tragic, the sense that the United States doesn't stand up for these values any more,"" said Maha Yahya, the director of the Carnegie Middle East Center in Beirut. ""We are seeing a growing sense of impunity among Arab autocrats, a sense that they can do what they want no matter how many human rights violations they commit.""

But as the United States pulls back, regional powers are left to their own devices and other foreign states move in.

With little notice to the United States, Saudi Arabia began a military intervention in Yemen that nearly four years later has failed to dislodge the Iran-aligned rebels it targeted while causing a humanitarian crisis. Iran has deepened its ties with militias in Syria, Iraq, Lebanon and Yemen, undercutting their governments. And the American withdrawal from eastern Syria could set off a scramble between Russia, Iran and Turkey to fill the void.

While the players are new, their intervention perpetuates the history of foreign interference that has kept Arab states weak, said Rami G. Khouri, a professor of journalism at the American University of Beirut and a senior fellow at Harvard University's Kennedy School of Government.

""Less external military intervention by lots of people, the Russians, the Iranians, the Turks and the Americans -- that would be helpful,"" he said. That would allow the people of the region to ""define the balance of power and culture and identity and authority in the region by themselves over time.""

As the United States begins to withdraw from Syria, critics have compared the move to President Obama's decision to withdraw American troops from Iraq after deciding that America's military role there was no longer essential. Within a few years, the jihadists the United States had thought were defeated were back and stronger, rebranded as the Islamic State, and prompting a new American military operation.

That operation has now nearly succeeded in ousting the jihadists from the territory it once controlled. But it has also left entire cities in ruins with no clear path to rebuilding and done little to address the issues of poor governance that fueled the jihadists' rise. Many fear that could cause the cycle to repeat itself -- again.

Some say the only solution is for the United States to find more productive, long-term ways to be involved in shaping the region's future as opposed to just using force when there is a crisis.

""We have got to find a middle ground between trying to transform the Middle East and increasingly walking away from the Middle East,"" said Mr. Haass of the Council of Foreign Relations.

""We want to wash our hands of it,"" he said, ""but history suggests that the Middle East won't let us."""

Here are some of the biggest stories you might have missed (and some links if you'd like to read further).

The shutdown is now the longest in U.S. history.

The partial government shutdown has entered its 22nd day, making it the longest in American history.

Privately, many Republicans say the stalemate over the border wall has been made exponentially worse by White House ineptitude on Capitol Hill. On Friday, the president stepped back from declaring a national emergency under pressure from congressional Republicans, but there is still no end in sight.

On Tuesday night, President Trump used his first prime-time Oval Office address -- one that was filled with misleading assertions -- to pressure Congress into paying for his long-promised border wall.

A day after storming out of a meeting in the White House with congressional leaders, Mr. Trump traveled to the southern border on Thursday to bolster his case for a wall, and he canceled his trip to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.

As effects of the shutdown pile up, more Americans are feeling the bite. The nation's air travel system could be at risk; farmers that stood with Mr. Trump during the election are at a breaking point; and 800,000 federal employees still haven't received a paycheck.

More revelations about Trump and Russia.

In the days after President Trump fired James B. Comey as F.B.I. director, law enforcement officials became so concerned by the president's behavior that they began investigating whether he had been working on behalf of Russia against American interests, The Times reported on Friday.

More connections between Mr. Trump's circle and Russian officials came to light this week. A formatting error by Paul Manafort's lawyer revealed that Mr. Manafort, a former manager of the Trump campaign, shared polling data with a man tied to Russian intelligence.

House Democrats summoned Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, for a classified briefing about the government's plans to end sanctions on companies linked to a Russian oligarch, Oleg V. Deripaska. Mr. Mnuchin told lawmakers that the White House played no formal role in the decision, and he said later that he would consider delaying the lifting of the sanctions so skeptics in Congress could have more time to review it.

Confusion over the Syria withdrawal plan.

President Trump's national security adviser, John R. Bolton, appeared to roll back Mr. Trump's decision to rapidly withdraw from Syria on Sunday, laying out conditions for a pullout that could leave American forces there for months or even years. Mr. Bolton -- who found himself scrambling after Mr. Trump's announcement -- is at least partly responsible for the conditions that led to the president's sudden move.

The president's withdrawal plan fell into further disarray on Tuesday after Turkey's leader rebuffed Mr. Bolton, angrily dismissing his demand that Turkey agree to protect America's Kurdish allies.

Regardless of the turmoil, the American military began withdrawing some equipment (but no troops yet) from Syria on Friday.

Today's On Politics briefing was compiled by Isabella Grullón Paz in New York.

Is there anything you think we're missing? Anything you want to see more of? We'd love to hear from you. Email us at onpolitics@nytimes.com."
62,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/12/us/politics/kamala-harris-democrats.html,"If Senator Kamala Harris's book tour is a preview of her likely presidential campaign, the early signs point to a catchall message meant for Democrats across the spectrum.

Speaking Friday night at the 92nd Street Y on New York's Upper East Side, Ms. Harris covered many bases: her origin story from Oakland to Capitol Hill, what drew her into public life and the importance of voters ""seeing themselves"" reflected in the nation's array of leaders. She cited her work to reform the juvenile criminal justice system in California as one of her biggest policy accomplishments. She talked about the necessity for Democrats to work in a bipartisan fashion while standing strong against a White House that many of their voters view as corrupt.

It was a broad, biography-heavy message -- not a rigid ideological mantra -- meant to lay groundwork for a national profile as she prepares a next possible step: joining a growing field of Democrats who will compete to take on President Trump.

""Anything worth fighting for is a fight worth having,"" Ms. Harris said. ""There is a democracy in place, and if we fight -- maybe we won't win all the time -- but it will matter.""

But as some audience members noted after her remarks, and voters nationwide may learn soon, almost everything about Ms. Harris is more complex than it appears.

Though rated as one of the most liberal members of the Senate, Ms. Harris speaks less about Wall Street corruption and economic populism than do Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders, two fellow senators who are also looking to a 2020 matchup against Mr. Trump. Ms. Harris has built a devoted following because of her Senate committee interrogations of Trump administration officials, but she remains disliked by some criminal justice activists who say her policies as California attorney general and San Francisco district attorney helped increase the state's prison population.

Even her race and her life story -- she is often described as one of two African-American women to have served in the Senate -- are more textured in context: She has a Tamil Indian mother and a Jamaican father and spent some of her teenage years in Montreal.

Ava Leegant, a surgeon from San Francisco who came to the event skeptical of Ms. Harris's presidential chances, said she left bullish about her appeal.

""I didn't think someone from California could speak to all parts of the country,"" Ms. Leegant said, ""but I was impressed.""

""She's my first choice to be my first choice,"" said Betsy Kagen, a 33-year-old film editor who attended the talk.

The themes of Ms. Harris's new book, ""The Truths We Hold: An American Journey,"" could help her stand out in a crowded Democratic presidential primary. More than a dozen candidates are expected to join the presidential race in the coming months, and as the party searches for its next iteration after two decades of dominance by the Clintons and Barack Obama, questions of policy, identity and tone in the campaign will be paramount.

Longtime strategists and admirers of Ms. Harris believe she is well positioned to create electoral coalitions among Democrats desperate to beat Mr. Trump, partly because she is not tethered to any one of the divergent and sometimes warring factions of the party. On MSNBC's ""Morning Joe"" on Friday morning, Ms. Harris was asked, ""Why would you want to be president?"" and responded by citing the need for leaders who have a ""vision of our country in which everyone can see themselves.""

""Her message of unity, that's the key,"" said Valoree Celona, a 50-year-old insurance executive who came to the 92nd Street Y with friends. ""If she can get people to have that hope again, that's what's important. That's what President Obama did.""

But Ms. Harris would also need to grapple with Democratic rivals who are more ideologically liberal and may try to move the debate to the left in ways that could force difficult choices for her.

Mr. Sanders, the Vermont senator and 2016 presidential candidate who is considering running again, has demonstrated an ability to shift conversation toward more populist themes like free public colleges and campaign finance reform. Ms. Warren, the Massachusetts senator who became the first major candidate to announce presidential intentions and head to Iowa, has drawn attention for challenging Democratic candidates to propose a more broad restructuring of American society that would address economic inequality. Ms. Warren rarely mentioned Mr. Trump on the campaign trail, and is pushing primary candidates to have a more policy-driven discussion.

""We need change,"" Ms. Warren said at multiple stops during her Iowa trip. ""And not just one statute here or one law there. We need big structural change.""

Rebecca Katz, a progressive political consultant based in New York who is not working for a 2020 candidate, said she believes that women and nonwhite candidates are scrutinized more than white male politicians, yet hopes that Ms. Harris will embrace bold ideas and tell more of her personal story even if it seems risky. Mo Elleithee, the former spokesman of the Democratic National Committee who now leads Georgetown University's Institute of Politics and Public Service, said that much of the country is still unaware of Ms. Harris, and that she has time to refine a national narrative that resonates with many groups of Democrats.

Reviews of Ms. Harris's book have been mixed, as critics have accused her of not adequately grappling with several controversial stances she took as California attorney general and others have characterized it as overly reliant on political clichés.

In the memoir, which was released simultaneously with a children's book by Ms. Harris called ""Superheroes Are Everywhere,"" she repeatedly writes that she does not believe in ""false choices."" This can mean both meaningful workers' rights and a strong economy, she writes at one point, but she also applies the concept to police accountability and public safety.

""I know how hard it is for the officers' families, who have to wonder if the person they love will be coming home at the end of each shift,"" Ms. Harris writes. ""I also know this: It is a false choice to suggest you must either be for the police or for police accountability. I am for both. Most people I know are for both. Let's speak some truth about that, too.""

Sean Clegg, a longtime political adviser who is expected to play a senior role in any presidential campaign from Ms. Harris, said that if she ran she would discuss issues like income inequality, but that the message would be coupled with a call for partisan healing.

Paul Berkman, a 72-year-old New Yorker who attended the book talk, said he wished Ms. Harris talked about more policy ideas during her conversation, which was moderated by the poet Cleo Wade. Mr. Berkman said he left not knowing her answer to the ""why-are-you-running-for-president"" question every candidate faces.

""She seems like a likable person, but there's so many candidates -- I want someone to verbalize why it should be them,"" he said.

Sarah Weiss, a 33-year-old book editor, said she was disappointed by Ms. Harris's talk, especially after the heavy policy focus of Ms. Warren's trip to Iowa.

""My concern is that she's not liberal enough, and she talks in clichés that are kind of meaningless,"" Ms. Weiss said of Ms. Harris. ""She keeps saying there's more that connects us than divides us, but at this time in politics, it seems like that's not enough.""

At that point her friend Rachel Steinberg chimed in: ""She is not running for president yet! She doesn't need a platform.""

They agreed to disagree."
63,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/12/us/politics/julian-castro-president-announce.html,"Julián Castro, the former housing secretary and former mayor of San Antonio, announced on Saturday that he would run for president, one of the most high-profile Latino Democrats ever to seek the party's nomination.

His first campaign stop will be in Puerto Rico, where he will speak on Monday at the Latino Victory Fund's annual summit and meet with residents still struggling to recover from Hurricane Maria. Later in the week, his campaign said, he will go to New Hampshire.

Mr. Castro, in prepared remarks that he was set to deliver in San Antonio on Saturday, said, ""When my grandmother got here almost a hundred years ago, I'm sure she never could have imagined that just two generations later, one of her grandsons would be serving as a member of the United States Congress and the other would be standing with you here today to say these words: I am a candidate for president of the United States of America.""

Mr. Castro's announcement had been expected for several weeks. He established an exploratory committee in December, two months after publishing a memoir, ""An Unlikely Journey"" -- a familiar path for presidential candidates who want to play up their life stories and qualifications and, perhaps, get ahead of their biggest vulnerabilities. This month he also visited two of the early caucus and primary states, Iowa and Nevada, where he emphasized health care (he supports Medicare for All) and affordable housing.

He now joins Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii and former Representative John Delaney of Maryland on the still-short list of Democrats who have said definitively that they will seek for the party's 2020 nomination. That list is expected to grow considerably in the coming weeks and months.

[Read about what Mr. Castro and the other early entrants will be doing in the early days of the 2020 campaign.]

Mr. Castro, 44, was raised in San Antonio in a politically active family. His mother, Rosie Castro, was an activist with the Mexican-American political party La Raza Unida and frequently took Julián and his twin brother, Joaquin -- now a congressman -- to rallies and meetings. Joaquin Castro will be the chairman of Julián's campaign.

At the age of 26, Mr. Castro became San Antonio's youngest City Council member, and after one unsuccessful campaign for mayor in 2005, he was elected to the city's top job in 2009. In 2012, he delivered the keynote address at the Democratic National Convention -- the same platform that catapulted Barack Obama, then a little-known state senator, to national prominence in 2004. Mr. Obama, as president, later chose him to lead the Department of Housing and Urban Development.

Many of the likely 2020 candidates are better known, but Mr. Castro has brushed this off.

""In my whole life, I don't think I've ever started out as the front-runner,"" he told The New York Times last month. ""I grew up in a neighborhood where nobody growing up there was the front-runner at anything. So I'm not going to concern myself with who people think of as the front-runner and who they don't.""

Among the Democrats frequently mentioned as 2020 contenders, he is the only Latino, and also one of the youngest. If elected, he would be the third-youngest person ever to become president, after Theodore Roosevelt (42) and John F. Kennedy (43).

The full field of candidates could include former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.; Senators Cory Booker of New Jersey, Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, Kamala Harris of California, Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Bernie Sanders of Vermont; and former Representative Beto O'Rourke of Texas, who ran a high-profile but unsuccessful campaign against Senator Ted Cruz last year."
64,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/12/us/politics/trump-fbi-counterintelligence-investigation.html,"WASHINGTON -- President Trump on Saturday unleashed an extended assault on the F.B.I. and the special counsel's investigation, knitting together a comprehensive alternative story in which he had been framed by disgraced ""losers"" at the bureau's highest levels.

In a two-hour span starting at 7 a.m., the president made a series of false claims on Twitter about his adversaries and the events surrounding the inquiry. He was responding to a report in The New York Times that, after he fired James B. Comey as F.B.I. director in 2017, the bureau began investigating whether the president had acted on behalf of Russia.

In his tweets, the president accused Hillary Clinton, without evidence, of breaking the law by lying to the F.B.I. He claimed that Mr. Comey was corrupt and best friends with the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III. He said Mr. Mueller was employing a team of Democrats -- another misleading assertion -- bent on taking him down.

Individually, the president's claims were familiar. But as the special counsel's inquiry edges ever closer to him, Democrats vow a blizzard of investigations of their own and the government shutdown reaches record lengths, Mr. Trump compiled all the threads of the conspiracy theory he has pushed for many months in an effort to undermine the investigation.

Mr. Trump accused the F.B.I. of opening ""for no reason"" and ""with no proof"" an investigation in 2017 into whether he had been working against American interests on behalf of Russia, painting his own actions toward Russia as actually ""FAR tougher"" than those of his predecessors.

The Times article, published Friday evening, reported that law enforcement officials became so alarmed by Mr. Trump's behavior surrounding his firing of Mr. Comey that they took the explosive step of opening a counterintelligence investigation against him.

Naming several of the bureau's now-departed top officials, including Mr. Comey and his deputy, Andrew G. McCabe, Mr. Trump said the F.B.I. had ""tried to do a number on your President,"" accusing the ""losers"" of essentially fabricating a case. ""Part of the Witch Hunt,"" he wrote -- referring dismissively to the investigation now being overseen by Mr. Mueller.

At the time he was fired in May 2017, Mr. Comey had been leading the F.B.I.'s investigation into Russia's attempts to influence the 2016 presidential election, and the officials believed that his removal, in hindering the inquiry, posed a possible threat to national security. Their decision to open the case was informed, in part, by two instances in which Mr. Trump tied the firing to the Russia investigation.

The inquiry they opened had two aspects, including both the newly disclosed counterintelligence element and a criminal element that has long been publicly known: whether the firing constituted obstruction of justice.

When Mr. Mueller was appointed days later, he took over the joint inquiry as part of his larger investigation of Russia's action in 2016 and whether anyone on the Trump campaign conspired with Moscow. It is not clear whether he is still pursuing the counterintelligence matter, and no public evidence has emerged that Mr. Trump himself secretly conspired with the Russian government or took directions from it.

Mr. Trump indicated on Saturday that he had not known of the existence of the counterintelligence investigation before the Times article, and he did not dispute the newspaper's reporting.

But he made clear that he viewed any such inquiry as illegitimate from the start. He presented it, without evidence, as part of a vast, yearslong conspiracy to undo his presidency.

In the tweets, Mr. Trump defended his decision to fire Mr. Comey -- ""a total sleaze!"" -- at length, accusing the former director of overseeing a ""rigged & botched"" investigation of Mrs. Clinton, and leading the agency into ""complete turmoil."" Democrats and Republicans alike wanted Mr. Comey removed, he said.

""My firing of James Comey was a great day for America,"" Mr. Trump wrote. ""He was a Crooked Cop.""

But an investigation conducted by the Justice Department's inspector general and internal surveys of F.B.I. agents have undercut Mr. Trump's portrayal of Mr. Comey as corrupt and unpopular within the bureau.

Mr. Trump's comments echoed those that his White House spokeswoman, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, released on Friday night.

""This is absurd. James Comey was fired because he's a disgraced partisan hack, and his deputy, Andrew McCabe, who was in charge at the time, is a known liar fired by the F.B.I.,"" Ms. Sanders said. ""Unlike President Obama, who let Russia and other foreign adversaries push America around, President Trump has actually been tough on Russia.""

Parts of the statements by Mr. Trump and Ms. Sanders are at odds with the public record and with the findings of the inspector general's report. While Democrats were furious with Mr. Comey over his public statements about the Clinton email server case -- at a news conference and in a pair of letters in the middle of the campaign -- they were deeply alarmed by his removal, given his role in the Russia investigation.

In his report, the inspector general, Michael E. Horowitz, pointedly criticized Mr. Comey for breaking with longstanding policy to publicly discuss the Clinton case, and he castigated ""insubordinate"" senior officials who worked with Mr. Comey for privately criticizing Mr. Trump even as they investigated him. But he ultimately said he had found no evidence to believe that the decision not to charge Mrs. Clinton for her use of a private email server in handling classified information ""were affected by bias or other improper considerations.""

""Rather, we concluded that they were based on the prosecutor's assessment of facts, the law and past department practice,"" he wrote.

Mr. McCabe, who briefly served as acting director after Mr. Comey was removed, was fired last March for failing to be forthcoming with investigators about an unrelated conversation he had authorized between F.B.I. officials and a journalist. Mr. McCabe argued that the firing was politically motivated and designed to hinder the Russia investigation. Other members of Mr. Comey's team have also been fired or left the bureau.

Mr. Comey responded on Twitter on Saturday with a quotation attributed to former President Franklin D. Roosevelt: ""I ask you to judge me by the enemies I have made.""

The Times report cited former law enforcement officials and others familiar with the investigation, as well as private testimony that the F.B.I.'s former general counsel, James A. Baker, delivered to Congress related to the inquiry.

""Not only would it be an issue of obstructing an investigation, but the obstruction itself would hurt our ability to figure out what the Russians had done, and that is what would be the threat to national security,"" Mr. Baker said in his testimony, portions of which were read to The New York Times.

Some former law enforcement officials outside the case have since debated whether F.B.I. investigators overreacted in opening the counterintelligence inquiry during a chaotic period after Mr. Comey's firing. Other former officials noted that those critics were not privy to all of the evidence and argued that sitting on it would have been an abdication of duty."
65,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/12/obituaries/patricia-wald-dead.html,"Patricia M. Wald, who was the first woman to serve as chief judge of the federal appeals court in Washington and who later wrote seminal rulings while serving in The Hague on the international court for war crimes in the former Yugoslavia, died on Saturday at her home in Washington. She was 90.

Her daughter, Johanna Wald, confirmed her death and said the cause was pancreatic cancer.

Judge Wald was a pioneer for women in law, rising from a working-class Irish family to enter the legal profession at a time when women were a rare presence. She eventually became the first woman to serve on -- and preside over -- the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, one of the most influential appeals courts in the country. Her career spanned a generational change that propelled women into visible and prominent roles, including on the Supreme Court, a job for which she was once in consideration.

Her path to prominence showed the obstacles women faced in the mid-20th century. She graduated from Yale Law School in 1951; when she began, three years earlier, Harvard Law School did not even entertain applications from women. She became a law clerk for Jerome Frank, a prominent appeals court judge in New York, and worked briefly for some of Washington's most prominent lawyers before leaving the workplace for 10 years to be at home with her family. She raised five children with her husband, Robert Wald, a Yale Law School classmate who established a thriving Washington law practice. He died in 2010.

She described her choice without complaint or regret. ""I didn't feel any terrible sense of isolation or loss,"" she said of leaving the workplace. ""I just assumed I would go back.""

In a 2006 interview, she described the question of whether motherhood is a real or fulfilling job as a false debate. ""In my view, how you pursue your life as a parent and careerist is a question of individual personality,"" she said.

""I did not want to go back to work until my kids were in regular school,"" she said, though she added that ""I respect other women's choices to go back earlier.""

She first became pregnant in the early 1950s while working at Arnold & Porter, then a small firm formed by a few of Washington's top lawyers. She hid her condition for a time because she feared that it would reinforce a negative view of hiring women. ""I was afraid they might say, 'You take your first woman associate and in three months, she's pregnant,'"" she said.

For several weeks, she did her legal research across the street from the firm at a private library because, she said, she often collapsed in exhaustion over her books and just napped.

After her decade at home, she went back to work, initially part time. She jointly wrote a book about bail in the United States and served on several commissions to improve legal services and juvenile justice. In the beginning of that period, her youngest child was not yet in school and she worked during his nap times and late at night. On weekends, she recalled, her husband took full responsibility for the children so she could work without interruption.

She became a trial lawyer for the Legal Services Corporation and, after holding several other posts, was named assistant attorney general for legislative affairs by President Jimmy Carter, who later nominated her to the appeals court.

Harold Hongju Koh, a professor and former dean of Yale Law School, described Judge Wald as an iconic figure in the sweep of American law. ""It's hard to think of a more exuberant pioneer in this arena,"" he said. She excelled as a judge both in the United States and abroad, he said, and ""fought for human rights and civil liberties everywhere long after many activists would have laid down their pens.""

Patricia Ann McGowan Wald was born on Sept. 16, 1928, in Torrington, Conn., the only child of Margaret O'Keefe and Joseph McGowan. In describing her childhood for oral history projects, she said she grew up in a crowded Irish-American household with an extended family of mostly women after her father left home when she was 2. While her mother and an aunt often worked as secretaries, the rest of the household revolved around episodic factory work at the Torrington Company.

Her family, she said, took great pride in her academic success and made it clear they did not expect her to end up on the factory floor. She went away to Connecticut College -- the school that offered the greatest financial aid -- but spent her summers on the assembly line greasing ball bearings and fabricating sewing needles. The workers were on strike during her last summer there so she worked for the union.

Everyone at home would chip in, she said, to see that she had decent clothes for school. ""At one point, we had eight people in the house and only two were working, my grandfather and an aunt, and they were carrying the rest of us, as a family does,"" she said.

She recalled that some of her girlfriends from wealthier families were not encouraged to become professionals because their parents well understood the obstacles. But she benefited from her family's lack of sophistication about the odds against her success. ""They were like, 'Go for it,'"" she said.

She joined the Court of Appeals in Washington in 1979. She was its first female member, but was soon joined by Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who would go on to become the second woman to serve on the Supreme Court.

The appeals court was known as a liberal bench, but after Ronald Reagan's election, it became notably more conservative with new appointees, including Robert H. Bork, Kenneth Starr and Antonin Scalia.

After that, much of her tenure on the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit coincided with a contentious period in which conservative and liberal judges squared off against each other regularly. Although the court's docket is heavy with cases involving the important but typically dry area of federal regulation, its judges often deal in the nation's most controversial issues. Throughout her career, Judge Wald was considered liberal and held a view of the Constitution as an engine of social progress.

She participated in more than 800 cases, including an opinion she wrote striking down the so-called gag rule, a federal regulation that barred doctors who accepted federal payments from discussing abortion with their patients. Her decision was overturned in 1991 by a 5-to-4 vote of the Supreme Court in a related case, Rust v. Sullivan. President Bill Clinton settled the issue by eliminating the rule shortly after taking office in 1993.

She also ruled that the State Department had systematically discriminated against women, thus setting in motion major changes in federal employment. Judge Wald also dissented from the majority in a three-judge ruling that resulted in the dismissal of all criminal charges against the former Reagan national security official Oliver L. North stemming from the Iran-contra scandal.

She once clashed with Judge Bork over the constitutionality of a Washington statute that prohibited protesters from being within 500 feet of an embassy but allowed favorable demonstrators to be inside that perimeter. Judge Bork wrote for the majority upholding the law, but her dissenting argument that it violated the principle that any restrictions on political speech had to be content-neutral was later upheld by the Supreme Court.

In 1986, she became the appeals court's chief judge, a largely administrative post that depends on seniority. She would have been the first female chief judge of any federal court but for a brief stint by Florence E. Allen, who was named a chief judge as a ceremonial tribute in 1958 just before she retired.

Judge Wald's name was among those mentioned when a spot opened up on the Supreme Court during the Clinton administration. She had also been in consideration for attorney general.

Within days of her retirement from the appeals court, she arrived in The Hague as a judge on the Yugoslav tribunal. After nearly a year of graphic testimony, she wrote the landmark judgment in the Krstic case, which found for the first time that the massacre of about 8,000 men and boys at Srebrenica constituted genocide.

In her second major trial, she ruled that the numerous rapes at the Omarska detention camp were part of the war crimes that women there had suffered. Sitting as an appeals court judge in another case, she overturned the conviction of three military officials. While many thought the defendants guilty, she ruled that the evidence and eyewitness accounts were insufficient. Her decision dismayed some, but the ruling was generally regarded as an enhancement of the court's legitimacy.

In 2013, President Barack Obama awarded her the Presidential Medal of Freedom, the nation's highest civilian honor.

She is survived by five children, Douglas, Frederica, Johanna, Sarah and Thomas Wald, and by 10 grandchildren."

When Bill de Blasio Became Donald Trump (*Wait, what?)

Let's just say from the outset that we are not 100 percent serious when we suggest that the liberal mayor of New York City appeared indistinguishable from the divisively nationalist, immigrant-unfriendly 45th president of the United States. But certain Trumpian characteristics in the mayor revealed themselves this year so much so that The New York Post featured a picture of him on its cover with a photoshopped head of orange hair and the line, ""Don Blasio."" The catalyst for this new impression was the court-ordered release of thousands of pages of emails from his administration showing the mayor to be aggressive, insecure and deeply contemptuous of a press corps he believes has covered him unfairly. Also, he uses all caps sometimes. Also, he loves real estate developers.

When an Unknown Bartender Became a Che Guevara T-shirt

Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez rose from obscurity over the summer to defeat longtime incumbent Joseph Crowley in the Democratic primary to represent the city's 14th Congressional district. But that is easily the dullest and least relevant way to describe her change of fortune. On the left she has become a symbol of working-class grievance, of an urban youth class mired in student debt and locked out of domestic comforts by a national housing crisis. On the right she has become a lightning rod for those who fear and loathe a rising progressive energy. Is she weak on policy? Does it matter? She is leading an emotionally charged movement.

When Andrew Cuomo Became the Bartender Who Became the Che Guevara T-shirt

More than any other year, this was the one in which the governor really wanted you to believe that he had become a firebrand left-of-center liberal. Challenged by Cynthia Nixon in the Democratic primary, he started to adopt her positions on the legalization of pot, the evil of plastic bags, the need for less punishing teacher evaluations and so on. Is he really looking like Ms. Ocasio-Cortez? Not when he is wearing a windbreaker roaming through a subway tunnel in Canarsie, but he has proposed a Green New Deal just as she has, and he is sounding like he wants to be a revolutionary.

When the New York City Housing Authority Became the Ultimate Slumlord

In June the federal government delivered a brutal rebuke to the nation's biggest public housing authority, accusing it of gross mismanagement and failure to provide a safe living environment for residents, especially children who had been exposed to lead paint. The city was supposed to move quickly making repairs; it didn't. Reports of squalid conditions continue, and in one complex, thousands of residents didn't have heat or hot water on Thanksgiving.

When Eric Schneiderman Became Ike Turner

Previously regarded as a friend to feminists, the New York attorney general was accused of beating up several former girlfriends, in an article in The New Yorker and he resigned immediately after it appeared. His degradations followed the familiar narrative of domestic violence: his assaults were accompanied by his cruel assessments of the women he was dating. Initially he insisted that everything that transpired with these women was consensual. It was only after a special prosecutor determined that limitations in the law made it impossible to level criminal charges that Mr. Schneiderman accepted ""full"" responsibility for his conduct and committed to ""making amends.""

When Amazon Became Philip Morris

So it turned out that Amazon was more or less just kidding when it solicited proposals from cities around the country hoping to be home to the company's second headquarters. The company affirmed its elitist commitments when it chose to locate in New York and suburban Washington over, say, Detroit or Pittsburgh. And while that was maddening enough to plenty of urbanists, many New Yorkers have greeted the impending arrival of Amazon with a rage toward the company that was not necessarily foreseeable. Amazon's encroachment into Queens, where the terror is that it will drive housing prices up even further and deny jobs to the people who really need them, has made the retailer the brightest new emblem of corporate malevolence.

When Sheryl Sandberg Became Ayn Rand

Many women in New York's pop intellectual and publishing communities embraced Sheryl Sandberg's book ""Lean In'' when it came out a few years ago. Its simple advice for female empowerment: Women need to just buck up and assert themselves if they wanted more from the patriarchy. For some of us -- I will say smugly -- that did not pass the feminism smell test.

The #MeToo movement should have confirmed to any doubters that women weren't the problem -- social structures were the problem. But it wasn't until damaging reports of Ms. Sandberg's role in subverting democracy at Facebook and selling out its users that her dethroning was complete, and that it was clear that someone so committed to greed and corporate narcissism was not going to lead American women to a better place. On her book tour, Michelle Obama called the Lean In movement a ""lie.""

When Juul Became Crack

As rates of drug and alcohol use have declined among adolescents for years, Juul became the beloved vice of teenagers across the city and around the country. The company, which has more than 70 percent of the e-cigarette market in the United States, was supposed to help grown-ups quit conventional cigarettes. Instead, the easily concealable and cool-looking vaping device has spurred a nicotine addiction among young people who had never smoked. All along, the company -- disingenuously, it would seem -- maintained that this was not its intent. And yet Juul offered its product in flavors like Crème Brûlée and something akin to Froot Loops, unlikely to appeal to anyone old enough to vote.

When Rudy Giuliani Became Alex Jones

If you enter ""Rudy Giuliani"" and ""unhinged"" into Google, you get a lot of entries. Had Mr. Giuliani stayed out of the Trump scrum, he would have had a decent chance at an enviable legacy in which the world would have remembered him as the strong and calming mayor presiding over New York City during 9/11. Instead he went full throttle into his role as the president's cable-news consigliere, giving interviews so erratic and illogical that even Fox News has been confounded.

When New York Became Peoria

This is not a delusional post about how a slightly softened real-estate market has turned the city into a quaint center of simplicity. No; this is a post about the ways in which New Yorkers, who famously strain themselves not to look twice at celebrities and pretend to disregard their power, went bonkers over the mysterious arrival of a Mandarin duck in Central Park. Suddenly, everyone was Ron Galella, desperate for a picture and obsessed with where this gorgeous patchwork quilt of a creature would show up next."
67,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/13/world/africa/china-loans-africa-usa.html,"KAMPALA, Uganda -- Growing up in suburban Ohio, Rajakumari Jandhyala never imagined she would end up in the oil business, much less on the front line of America's global competition with China. She spent two decades as a policy adviser on Africa, most recently as an aid official in the Obama administration.

But in 2016, she heard about a call for proposals to build an oil refinery in Uganda that could be the largest in East Africa, and she put together a bid. She landed an investor in Kenya. She recruited oil and gas executives from General Electric. An Italian contractor joined the group of companies that formed a consortium, too.

The main problem was the big advantages enjoyed by the competition: two Chinese energy companies, one of them a state oil giant with Beijing's support.

China is aggressively seeking investments and contracts around the world, and perhaps nowhere is this more visible than Africa, where Chinese companies have won contracts to build dams, roads, stadiums, airports and railways. In country after country, governments have borrowed heavily from China to pay for these projects.

China's investments in Africa are central to President Xi Jinping's signature Belt and Road Initiative, a trillion-dollar program to build infrastructure and extend Beijing's influence around the globe.

The Trump administration has accused China of engaging in predatory lending aimed at trapping countries in debt, acquiring strategic assets like ports, and spreading corruption and authoritarian values. In response, the United States has announced an effort to help American businesses compete.

""We're streamlining international development and finance programs, giving foreign nations a just and transparent alternative to China's debt-trap diplomacy,"" Vice President Mike Pence said in a speech in October. The White House has also unveiled an Africa strategy aimed at China.

The idea is to challenge China's infrastructure program while also pushing back against its trade practices, cybertheft and expanding military facilities and presence in the Pacific and Indian Oceans. But the threat posed by the Belt and Road Initiative to American interests is debatable, and it is unclear how far the United States should -- or can -- go to compete. The funds set aside by the Trump administration amount to just a fraction of Beijing's commitment.

In Africa, American businesses have been largely absent while Chinese companies have put down roots, nurturing powerful allies through both legitimate and illegal means. Some target individual African officials and their family members with cash bribes or deals for services, like legal representation or insurance.

Ms. Jandhyala's bid for the $4 billion refinery project was a case study in the long odds the United States faces as it tries to go head-to-head against China in infrastructure development -- and in the conditions under which American companies could prevail.

The competition came to a head early last year, when Ms. Jandhyala and other consortium executives faced off in a conference room above Lake Victoria against Ugandan officials backing the Chinese companies. Uganda's strongman president for the past 33 years, Yoweri Museveni, had called the meeting in his compound to try to resolve the bitter dispute.

In a sign of the intense infighting, Uganda's domestic intelligence agency investigated three officials believed to favor the American consortium and questioned its ability to finance the project, according to a copy of the agency's report reviewed by The New York Times.

In an April speech, Mr. Museveni praised Western companies for finally ""waking up"" to Africa. But he also noted that ""the Chinese have already woken up -- they are really, really, really very active and fast.""

""So why not take advantage of both?"" he asked.

Scramble for a Prize

The African Great Lakes have long tempted outsiders seeking riches, including the European nations that began plundering the continent in the 19th century. But in 2006, four decades after the end of British rule in Uganda, a prize untapped by the colonialists was discovered: oil deposits by Lake Albert that are among the largest in East Africa, enough to transform parts of impoverished Uganda.

Mr. Museveni's government negotiated for years with foreign companies before agreeing to a plan for extraction and the construction of a pipeline southeast to the Tanzanian coast, where the oil could be shipped around the world.

But Mr. Museveni also insisted on building a refinery in Uganda to ease the region's dependence on imported fuel. The contract went to Russians at first, but they withdrew.

Ms. Jandhyala, 53, heard about the plans on a scouting trip to Uganda in 2016, her first visit since working for the Ugandan prime minister's office a decade earlier as an adviser on a peace process to end an insurgency.

From a shared work space in Washington, she recruited partners for what she hoped would be the first project for Yaatra Ventures, which she founded in 2015 to invest in African infrastructure.

""With G.E., here was an American company that could bring capabilities,"" she said.

She was not alone in sensing the opportunity. Uganda received more than 40 proposals to build the refinery.

Leading one bid was Dongsong, a private hydropower and mining company in the southern Chinese city of Guangzhou. A proposal made outside formal channels came from the China National Offshore Oil Corporation, or CNOOC, the country's third-largest state oil company.

Both companies had offices in Kampala, the capital of Uganda, and had worked closely for years with the Ministry of Energy and Mineral Development. Dongsong was building a $620 million phosphate mine and fertilizer factory in eastern Uganda. CNOOC was one of three foreign companies that had struck deals to extract oil.

But their proposals included tough terms, according to interviews and an internal government assessment reviewed by The Times.

Dongsong wanted a sovereign loan guarantee -- making the Ugandan government responsible for the project's debt if it failed -- and insisted that 60 percent of labor and materials come from China. CNOOC, meanwhile, wanted greater access to the oil fields themselves.

The American consortium tried to set itself apart, proposing that Uganda's state oil company and other East African nations own up to 40 percent of a new private company that would build and run the refinery. The consortium would finance the project by selling shares to investors as well as by borrowing, but it was not asking for a sovereign guarantee.

The American proposal meant less debt risk for Uganda, but there were questions about the consortium's ability to raise the money. The Chinese bids, by contrast, promised immediate financing from Chinese state banks. And at the energy ministry, officials were longtime proponents of Chinese companies.

""At the end of the day, we are developing a lot of capital-intensive projects,"" said Robert Kasande, a top energy official. ""We need the financing. The Chinese can do that.""

'Remember My Name'

Ugandan soldiers with Kalashnikov rifles stand guard at Dongsong's headquarters in Kampala, a hilltop villa with a swimming pool and sweeping views of the capital. Lü Weidong, the company's founder, flies in several times a year.

""My biggest ambition is that when I walk into Ugandan villages, villagers line up and welcome me with applause,"" he said at his China office, seated behind a rosewood tea table inlaid with carved dragons. ""I hope to drive the industrial development of Uganda, and let the history of East Africa and Uganda remember my name.""

Slim, bald and vegetarian, Mr. Lü personifies Beijing's ""going out"" strategy, which encourages Chinese businesses to establish footholds around the world. After focusing on domestic hydropower projects, Dongsong sought opportunities in mining overseas.

Mr. Lü, 50, a former bank manager who belongs to a political advisory body controlled by the Communist Party, said he ventured to Uganda after a chance meeting with the country's consul general in Guangzhou. Soon, he got the mine deal. ""Every decision is made by heaven,"" he said.

But Dongsong's presence in Uganda has been laced with controversy.

In 2016, the Ugandan inspector general's office concluded that its mining license had been acquired through fraud and recommended it be revoked, according to the inspector general's report. (Officials never did.)

Dongsong has also been accused of fraud in a lawsuit by one of Mr. Lü's early partners in Uganda, and it is mired in property disputes around the mine. In 2017, two finance ministry officials were arrested on suspicion of demanding and accepting bribes from Dongsong.

The company has faced problems in China as well. A court in Hebei Province said last year that Mr. Lü had set up a shell company to pay bribes to two state bank officials who were convicted on corruption charges.

Mr. Lü denies any wrongdoing, and his legal problems do not appear to have bothered Ugandan officials. They put Dongsong's refinery proposal on their short list and traveled to Guangzhou in 2017 to conduct due diligence interviews.

Mr. Lü impressed the team with slick presentations and punctual shuttle buses, an official on the trip said. The team noted that Dongsong's consortium included a Chinese state company with experience building refineries in Africa.

Dongsong also secured a promise of financing from one of China's largest state banks -- as long as Uganda guaranteed the loan.

The model is common across Africa, where loans from Chinese state banks have financed a construction boom, largely by Chinese companies and workers. These loans generally have tougher terms than World Bank aid packages. Though interest rates can be low, recipients must repay the loans much faster, according to AidData, a research center at William and Mary, a university in Williamsburg, Va.

That has left some nations at high risk of debt distress, analysts say. In Kenya, for example, a Chinese bank could take over a port if Nairobi defaults on a $3.2 billion loan for a railway project.

Uganda's debt burden is manageable, analysts say, though the country has increased borrowing. From 2000 to 2014, it received at least $1.24 billion in Chinese loans, AidData said. In 2015, it agreed to borrow an additional $1.9 billion for two dams to be built by Chinese companies, and it now seeks a $2.2 billion loan for a railway.

Still, Mr. Museveni and other officials appear to be rethinking the nation's reliance on China. While Western energy companies have also been implicated in Ugandan corruption cases, China took a hit in the most recent big scandal: In 2016, officials uncovered shoddy construction at the two dams, which remain unfinished.

And yet, Dongsong enjoyed unique advantages in the refinery competition.

Since 2013, it has retained Abmak Associates as legal counsel in Uganda, according to corporate filings.

The law firm's chief executive is Henry A. Kaliisa, the son of Fred Kabagambe Kaliisa, who for more than two decades was Uganda's most powerful energy official. He lost his job in the fallout from the dam scandal but still wields enormous influence.

Americans in the Arena

The Ugandan team put the American consortium on its short list as well and also flew to Washington. Ms. Jandhyala and a financing partner, Ronald Mincy, hosted them in a shared work space. One official asked them, ""Do you have money?""

In an internal report afterward, the team gave Dongsong a higher rating but also recommended inviting the Americans and Chinese to Kampala for parallel negotiations. The government set a date in June 2017.

But Mr. Lü asked whether Dongsong was the preferred bidder and declined to attend or send anyone. The Ugandan officials decided to enter final talks with just the Americans after they appeared.

In a letter to the Ugandan energy minister reviewed by The Times, Mr. Lü responded by threatening to challenge the process.

Around that time, the other Chinese bidder, CNOOC, quietly emerged with a late push to build the refinery and take control of additional oil fields. (CNOOC did not respond to written questions on the project.)

Ms. Jandhyala sought help in Washington.

The Overseas Private Investment Corporation, the American government's development finance agency, could not commit to the kind of billion-dollar financing offered by Chinese banks, but it provided a letter saying it would consider lending $250 million and providing loan insurance.

""That lent confidence to other people,"" Ms. Jandhyala said.

The Commerce Department also determined the project was in the ""national interest,"" giving the United States Embassy in Uganda permission to lobby for it.

The United States ambassador, Deborah Malac, said she made the case for the American consortium with the energy minister, Irene Muloni, whom she described as resistant. She also spoke to Mr. Museveni a dozen times, she said. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross sent two letters and called.

""There were a lot of interested parties beholden to the Chinese who tried to derail the process,"" Ms. Malac said.

Among the skeptics was Sam Kutesa, the foreign minister, she said.

Last December, a New York court convicted a representative of a Chinese energy company of paying bribes to African officials, including $500,000 to Mr. Kutesa. In an interview, Mr. Kutesa described the payment as a donation to his foundation and said he did not have a strong view on who should win the refinery project.

In Uganda, all major decisions end up before Mr. Museveni. Officials jockey for his ear, and the president is adept at playing them off one another.

That gave the Americans an opening. Despite naysaying by energy officials, Mr. Museveni liked the idea of balancing the Americans and Chinese in the oil industry, and he was intrigued by G.E.'s involvement, Ugandan officials said.

Last January, he called the meeting at Lake Victoria and forced energy officials to sit down with Ms. Jandhyala and her partners. He then got cabinet approval. The deal was signed in April.

""I think the big lesson is that we have to be aggressive,"" Ms. Malac said. ""We have to be willing, as the U.S. government, to find our opportunities to advocate on behalf of our companies.""

Abigail Grace, a researcher at the Center for a New American Society who worked on the White House National Security Council, said American diplomats around the globe should be trained to deal with China issues.

""This example shows that despite the idea that China might prevail, we can win if we get our act together,"" she said.

In October, President Trump signed a bill creating a new agency to replace the Overseas Private Investment Corporation and give out $60 billion in financing -- double the previous amount, though still a fraction of what China has pledged to spend.

Meanwhile, G.E. has begun selling its stake in the oil field services company in Ms. Jandhyala's consortium. Its exit could weaken Ugandan confidence in the deal, and there is still uncertainty about the group's ability to secure financing.

The Chinese appear to have moved on. Mr. Lü said he planned to open a mine in Mozambique. And in September, CNOOC got what it really wanted: Uganda agreed to give it a new parcel to explore at Lake Albert.

At the Beijing signing, Mr. Museveni and Mr. Kutesa smiled as they shook hands with Chinese executives."

1. The government shutdown is now the longest in history.

At midnight on Saturday, the partial shutdown reached 22 days, surpassing the previous record of 21 under the Clinton administration in 1995.

President Trump, above, used an Oval Office address and a visit to Texas to push for his long-promised border wall, the central issue of the shutdown. Under pressure from his own party and advisers, the president has backed away from declaring a national emergency to pay for the wall.

His aides said they expected the stalemate to be resolved by the time Mr. Trump delivers the State of the Union address on Jan. 29.

2. The shutdown's day-to-day impact on Americans -- even those who work for the government -- varies radically from workplace to workplace, or even from colleague to colleague. Above, a protest outside the Federal Center in St. Louis.

At one research institute in Colorado, for example, some people are employed directly by the federal government and cannot work or be paid, while others are paid by the University of Colorado, Boulder, but are locked out of their federal offices. For a third group that hasn't been affected, the institute's director said, it's: ""Shutdown? What shutdown? I am not feeling anything.""

Some states are also feeling the impact more than others. We broke down how federal workers in every state are affected.

3. Days after President Trump fired James B. Comey, above, as F.B.I. director in May 2017, the bureau opened an inquiry into whether Mr. Trump had been working on behalf of Russia against American interests -- either knowingly or unwittingly.

That inquiry is now under the purview of the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, though it's unclear whether he is still pursuing the matter.

On Tuesday, lawyers for Paul Manafort, who was a top official in Mr. Trump's campaign, accidentally disclosed that Mr. Manafort had shared polling data with a business associate tied to Russian intelligence. ""This is the closest thing we have seen to collusion,"" said a fellow at the Foreign Policy Research Institute. ""The question now is, did the president know about it?""

4. The American military has begun withdrawing equipment -- but not troops -- from Syria. Above, an outpost on the edges of Manbij.

There is confusion over President Trump's plans to wind down U.S. involvement in the conflict: Last month, officials said the president intended to pull out American troops within 30 days, but more recently, the national security adviser, John R. Bolton, said the pullout was conditional and American forces could remain in Syria for months or even years.

And despite those plans, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said in a speech in Cairo on Thursday that the U.S. would pursue a more activist policy in the Middle East.

5. Julián Castro is running for president.

Mr. Castro, above, a housing secretary in the Obama administration and the former mayor of San Antonio, is one of the highest-profile Latinos to ever seek the Democratic nomination.

His speech Saturday announcing his run was firmly progressive: He called for a higher minimum wage, denounced police killings of African-Americans, and condemned President Trump's immigration policy.

His first campaign stop will be in Puerto Rico on Monday, and later in the week he will go to New Hampshire.

69,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/13/us/politics/trump-russia-shutdown.html,"WASHINGTON -- So it has come to this: The president of the United States was asked over the weekend whether he is a Russian agent. And he refused to answer.

The question, which came from a friendly interviewer, not one of the ""fake media"" journalists he disparages, was ""the most insulting thing I've ever been asked,"" he declared. But it is a question that has hung over his presidency now for two years.

Those who thought the now 23-day government shutdown standoff between Mr. Trump and Congress has been ugly have not seen anything yet. The border wall fight is just the preliminary skirmish in this new era of divided government. The real battle has yet to begin.

With Democrats now in charge of the House, the special counsel believed to be wrapping up his investigation, media outlets competing for scoops and the first articles of impeachment already filed, Mr. Trump faces the prospect of an all-out political war for survival that may make the still-unresolved partial government shutdown pale by comparison.

The last few days have offered plenty of foreshadowing. The newly empowered Democrats summoned the president's longtime personal lawyer to testify after he implicated Mr. Trump in an illegal scheme to arrange hush payments before the 2016 election for women who claimed to have had affairs with him. Legal papers disclosed that Mr. Trump's onetime campaign chairman shared polling data with an associate tied by prosecutors to Russian intelligence.

New reports over the weekend added to the sense of siege at the White House. The New York Times reported that after Mr. Trump fired the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, in 2017, the bureau opened an investigation into whether the president was working for the Russians. And The Washington Post reported that Mr. Trump has gone out of his way as president to hide the details of his discussions with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia even from members of his own administration.

What all this adds up to remains unclear. Whether it will actually lead to a full-blown impeachment inquiry in the House has yet to be decided. But it underscores the chance that with candidates already lining up to take him on in 2020, Washington will spend the months to come debating the future of Mr. Trump's presidency and the direction of the country.

""The reality,"" said Andy Surabian, a Republican strategist and former special assistant to Mr. Trump, is ""that the next two years are going to be nonstop political war.""

The White House has begun recruiting soldiers. The new White House counsel, Pat Cipollone, has hired 17 new lawyers, according to The Post, as he prepares for a barrage of subpoenas from House Democratic committee chairmen.

But Mr. Trump's inner circle has shrunk, and he has fewer advisers around him whom he trusts. His White House chief of staff is still serving in an acting capacity, and the West Wing is depleted by the shutdown. As he himself wrote on Twitter this weekend, ""There's almost nobody in the W.H. but me.""

Mr. Surabian said the rest of the party must recognize the threat and rally behind the president. ""Republicans need to understand that Democrats in Congress, beholden to the 'resistance,' aren't interested in bipartisanship, they're out for blood,"" he said. ""It's a war we can win,"" he added, ""but only with fortitude, unity, coherent messaging and a willingness to fight back.""

Democrats, for their part, insist they are out for accountability, not blood, intent on forcing a president who went largely unchecked by a Republican Congress during his first two years in office to come clean on the many scandals that have erupted involving his business, taxes, campaign and administration.

They plan to get started in the coming days. On Tuesday, they will grill former Attorney General William P. Barr, who has been nominated by Mr. Trump to assume his old office again, about his approach to the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III. Mr. Barr wrote a private memo last year criticizing Mr. Mueller's investigation, and Democrats will use his confirmation hearings to press him on whether the special counsel will be allowed to finish his work and report it to Congress.

Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic minority leader, also plans to force a vote in the Senate this week on the Trump administration's plans to lifts sanctions on the companies of Oleg V. Deripaska, a Russian oligarch close to Mr. Putin's government, if he reduces his ownership stakes. Democrats plan to use the issue to argue that Mr. Trump has been soft on Russia.

Even committees that are not usually in the investigation business are jumping into the fray. Representative Eliot L. Engel, Democrat of New York and the new chairman of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, told The New Yorker last week that he was eliminating the subcommittee on terrorism in favor of a subcommittee aimed at investigating Mr. Trump's foreign policy.

Lost in all this may be any chance of bipartisan policymaking. At stake in the current fight is just $5.7 billion for Mr. Trump's promised border wall, roughly one-eighth of one percent of the total federal budget. If one-eighth of one percent of the total budget can prompt the longest government shutdown in American history, then the potential for further clashes over the remaining 99.87 percent seems considerable. On issues like health care, taxes, climate change, guns and national security, the two sides start this era of divided government far apart.

""That's the flashing yellow light here,"" said Mayor Rahm Emanuel of Chicago, a former top White House aide to Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama. ""If you can't do Government 101, what makes you think you're going to do Advanced Placement Government like finding the money for an infrastructure bill?""

Julian Epstein, who was the counsel for Democrats on the House Judiciary Committee during Mr. Clinton's impeachment fight 20 years ago, said big issues like a shrinking middle class largely untrained for the 21st-century economy would go unaddressed during the battles to come.

""The political class is now addicted to Manichaean conflict as a way of life,"" Mr. Epstein said. ""It's become the mother's milk -- for base voters in both parties who together make up a minority share of voters, for cable television and for social media.""

Given the investigations, Mr. Trump may prefer a battle over the border wall as more favorable ground to fight even with 800,000 federal workers furloughed or forced to work without pay. Polls suggest he is not winning with the broader public but has rallied his base behind him in the fight.

More Americans blame Mr. Trump for the government shutdown than blame Democrats, and most oppose a border wall, according to a new survey by The Post and ABC News. But support for a wall has grown over the last year, from 34 percent to 42 percent, while opposition has slipped from 63 percent to 54 percent.

At this point, negotiations have broken down. While Mr. Trump had gambled that Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California, would back down, she has made clear that she has no interest in compromise, and left town over the weekend. She and Mr. Schumer have insisted that Mr. Trump reopen the government while negotiations over a border wall proceed, which the president has refused to do. Mr. Trump walked out of their talks last week after he asked Ms. Pelosi if she would support his wall if he reopened government and she said no.

""It's all about their own sense of strength,"" said John Feehery, a former senior House Republican aide. ""Pelosi wants to be validated. She wants to be seen as a strong leader. Trump feels like he has to govern through strength. This is strength versus strength. Unfortunately, the people in the middle are the government workers who can't afford to lose a paycheck.""

Instead of talks to end the shutdown, the president spent at least part of his weekend defending himself against the suspicions about his affinity for Mr. Putin. He insisted that he has actually been tougher on Russia than his predecessors and that the F.B.I. was led by ""losers that tried to do a number on your President.""

He picked up the telephone on Saturday night to call into the Fox News show hosted by Jeanine Pirro, who participated in a campaign rally with him last fall. She asked him about the F.B.I. investigation reported by The Times with a tone of scorn.

""I'm going to ask you, are you now or have you ever worked for Russia, Mr. President?"" Ms. Pirro asked.

""I think it's the most insulting thing I've ever been asked,"" he answered. ""I think it's the most insulting article I've ever had written. And if you read the article, you'd see that they found absolutely nothing.""

She then cited the Post article about his efforts to conceal details of his private meetings with Mr. Putin. ""We had a great conversation,"" he said. ""We were talking about Israel and securing Israel and lots of other things, and it was a great conversation. I'm not keeping anything under wraps. I couldn't care less.""

Ms. Pirro expressed sympathy for the battles he was waging.

""You've got such fight in you, it's unbelievable,"" she said.

""Well,"" he answered, ""I guess I have good genes."""
70,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/08/opinion/trump-speech-border-wall.html,"Seldom has a president's ego required so much shoring up. There's not enough concrete in creation for that job.

It's funny that we are still talking about the physical features of what President Trump wants or will settle for on our country's southern border -- about whether it will be concrete or steel, solid or slatted, a fancied-up fence or, in Nancy Pelosi's hilariously acerbic dig, a ""beaded curtain."" Because it's not really a wall that Trump is after, if indeed it ever was. It's a victory for victory's sake. It's a show of his might. It's proof of his potency.

The longer his stalemate with Democrats in Congress grinds on, the clearer that becomes. Seldom has a president's ego been this tender, and seldom has it required so much shoring up. There's not enough concrete in creation for that job.

Network executives had little choice but to grant him prime time on television Tuesday night so that he could make his case for the wall to Americans under the guise of a crisis that's his own doing. He has never made such a request before, so it's not like this particular grandstanding is habitual.

And had the networks refused him, they would have handed him a cudgel in the culture wars that he would have used the same way that he governs -- shamelessly, putting his ludicrous claims of martyrdom above any national interest. Better for the networks to go along, with a plan in place to check his assertions rigorously and call out his lies immediately.

Even this deep into a presidency of such incompetence and amorality, he deserves a hearing; that's how the rest of us demonstrate the very respect for traditions and norms that he refuses to show. But he doesn't deserve an unfiltered one. That's the road to autocracy.

Trump isn't selling something that the country really needs, and that's why he and his allies have to lard the pitch with lies. According to The Washington Post Fact Checker, there are more bogus claims and hallucinated menaces when he talks about immigration and the border than when he talks about anything else.

He insists that would-be terrorists see a porous southern border as a welcome mat, but that's bunk: Most try to get into the United States by plane and are apprehended at airports. He wildly inflates the amount of crime committed by undocumented immigrants and just as wildly overstates the effect a border wall might have on the country's opioid crisis.

When it comes to the border and the wall, his willful estrangement from reality is so profound that network executives and newspaper editors spent part of Tuesday in strategy sessions about how to respond to his inevitable barrage of falsehoods. Should there be a crawl of words on the bottom of the television screen that correct him in real time? Could fact checkers work speedily enough to post rebuttals online within minutes of his misrepresentations, before they took root? This is where we find ourselves. Other presidents have been untrustworthy, and others have had to be called out on it. But not like this. This is surreal.

It's a function of, more than anything, his ego, his vanity, to which the television networks, furloughed federal workers -- all Americans -- are hostage. He's not remarkable among presidents in having a high opinion of himself and in desperately wanting others to share it. A robust measure of arrogance and some degree of neediness are what make the grind of the campaign trail and the glare of the media bearable. All presidents want to rack up triumphs that make them look and feel large. But none in my lifetime has spun so many fictions in the service of that. None has been so naked in his hunger for that heft.

To live with his resounding defeat by that ""nasty woman"" in the popular vote, Trump had to invent the specter of millions of illegally cast ballots. He never did produce any evidence of that. To not feel eclipsed by President Barack Obama, he claimed there was a media conspiracy to undercount his inauguration crowd. But photographs don't lie. Not the way a president does.

The day after his inauguration, in a visit to the C.I.A. headquarters, against a backdrop of stars that symbolized men and women who had been killed on the job for America, he used his remarks to tally his appearances on the cover of Time magazine. ""I think we have the all-time record,"" he said, but ""we"" as usual meant ""I.""

There's no occasion unsuitable for bragging, no mission more vital than the exaltation of Trump. When, over the recent Christmas holiday, he at last paid a visit to a combat zone and spoke to American troops in Iraq, he seemed less intent on thanking them for their service than in having them thank him. He dwelled on a pay increase that they had received and claimed -- erroneously -- that they had gone without one for 10 years, until he came along.

""We got you a big one,"" he said. ""I got you a big one. I got you a big one."" I. Big. That's the Trump credo in two words.

And that, at this point, is the point of the wall. I. Big. ""It's like a manhood thing for him,"" Pelosi reportedly told House Democrats in a closed meeting last month. ""As if manhood could ever be associated with him.""

Now we're all yoked to it, this crazy, self-affirming monument that's a barrier only to reason and responsible government.

71,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/04/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-iowa.html,"COUNCIL BLUFFS, Iowa -- Senator Elizabeth Warren hit the presidential campaign trail in southwestern Iowa on Friday evening, making her the first declared major candidate to host an event in the pivotal state and kicking off a Democratic primary season that promises to dominate the coming year.

Hundreds of people packed a room in a bowling alley just across the state's border with Nebraska as Ms. Warren, the uncompromising leftist and ardent critic of unrestrained capitalism, tackled issues including income inequality and climate change in an hourlong question-and-answer session with voters.

Though Ms. Warren's campaign is still nascent -- she announced the formation of an exploratory presidential committee on Monday -- Friday's event had all the hallmarks of a candidate meant to last: a laser-focused message on income inequality, a robust campaign staff shepherding hordes of interested reporters, and an excited supporter base eager to hear more.

""This is how it starts. Person to person. Town to town. Across Iowa and then across America,"" Ms. Warren said, addressing supporters who were standing outside the venue, which was filled to capacity.

""All of us, together, raising our voices -- that's what's going to make real change,"" she said. ""And Iowa is going to have a big part of determining where we go next.""

[Make sense of the people, issues and ideas shaping American politics with our newsletter.]

The event not only kicked off Ms. Warren's campaign, but marked the starting point to what figures to be a long and grueling Democratic primary season. Dozens of candidates, including governors, senators and big-city mayors -- many of whom will be new to the national stage -- are considering joining the race in the coming months.

Some have characterized the 2020 Democratic nomination process as perhaps the most wide open since 1992: The party has no single leader, no obvious front-runner to challenge President Trump in 2020, and no broadly unifying ideology as it moves away from a quarter-century of dominance by the Clintons and Barack Obama.

Ms. Warren, who will be among the top-tier candidates no matter who else runs, has staked out a position as one of the party's most resolute voices on the left. Before she took questions from the audience, she laid out her overarching premise of America's ills: too much corporate money in the political system, a retrenchment from government regulation in the market and even overt discrimination that has affected racial minorities.

""It is an America right now who works for the rich and powerful. And we need to call it out for what it is: corruption pure and simple,"" Ms. Warren said. ""What's happening to opportunity in this country? Why is the path so rocky for many -- and why is it so much rockier for people of color?""

Ms. Warren also paid special attention to telling her personal story. To the assembled crowd about 500, which included almost 200 people waiting outside, she spoke of her Oklahoma roots and her family's humble upbringing.

She said she was motivated to run for president, not by party politics or the desire to oppose President Trump, but because her personal life benefited from an American economy that has now become too inaccessible.

The event comes in a busy week for Ms. Warren. After announcing her exploratory committee on Monday morning, she has four more events in Iowa this weekend, in Sioux City, Des Moines, Storm Lake and Ankeny. The Council Bluffs appearance on Friday drew Iowans and residents of nearby Omaha.

In the crowd, many of the potential voters said they were just beginning to look at presidential candidates and had not yet decided on a singular person to support.

Daniel Jaimes, a 28-year-old graduate student who supported Bernie Sanders in the 2016 primary, said Ms. Warren was currently in his ""top two"" choices, because she speaks to grass-roots populism.

Gary Himes, 70, said he voted for Mr. Trump in the 2016 election but had been so disappointed by the current administration that he intends to vote for a Democrat ""no matter what."" Liel Wilwerding, a 36-year-old Omaha resident, said she was looking for a candidate who can win back former Trump voters, like Mr. Himes.

""It's important to pick a candidate who can go into these areas and be attractive,"" said Ms. Wilwerding, who also supported Ms. Sanders in the 2016 primary.

Ms. Wilwerding brought a gift for Ms. Warren: a cross-stitched pattern that read ""Nevertheless, she persisted,"" the admonishment-turned-rallying cry spoken by Mitch McConnell, the majority leader and Republican of Kentucky, when he cut short a speech by Ms. Warren on the Senate floor last year.

But most of all, many of the voters said they were excited to spend the next year hearing from several candidates.

""I supported Bernie in the primary, but I'm keeping my options open,"" said Sarah Jane Teetzel, a 46-year-old Omaha resident. She added one caveat: ""Except if I have to vote for an old white guy, he better be exceptional."""
72,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/08/opinion/trump-troops-syria-afghanistan.html,"There is no shortage of policies and decisions made by President Trump worth criticizing, but since the earliest days of his presidential campaign, he has expressed at least one belief that deserves to be encouraged, not denigrated: the desire to disentangle the United States from costly overseas conflicts.

Mr. Trump's noninterventionist impulse has always fit uncomfortably with the team he assembled, particularly the latest, more hawkish iteration in his ever-shifting foreign policy cast. For a time, the President grudgingly deferred, allowing conflicts to escalate in virtually every theater he inherited.

Recently, the president's preferences seemed to prevail, at least momentarily, as he tweeted his decision to withdraw 2,000 American troops from Syria and suggested he would do the same with as many as 7,000 from Afghanistan.

Since then, a bewildering public tug of war between the president and his national security team has left a trail of confusion. It remains unclear whether the United States is withdrawing from Syria right away or gradually; whether it wait until the Islamic State is wholly defeated or it believes that is already the case; whether the United States will protect its Syrian Kurdish allies, somehow; and whether it remains committed to its goal of ending Iran's presence in Syria.

The absence of anything akin to a decision-making process in the administration is not surprising. The surprise is that among the most vocal critics of President Trump's withdrawal announcement have been not just Republican hawks but also a chorus of voices on the left.

Progressive opponents of Trumpism should resist the urge to do so over the wrong transgressions. We may not know what the policy actually is until Mr. Trump implements it, but on Syria and Afghanistan, his initial instinct -- to do less, with less -- was correct. It is his execution, timing and inability to leverage his decisions for the best possible terms that were damaging.

In Syria, whatever one's view of the tragic and long-debated trajectory of the conflict or past policy decisions, the United States has few remaining, achievable interests at stake: preventing the Islamic State from regaining territorial control, protecting the predominantly Kurdish forces on whom Washington relied to do most of the counterterrorist fighting and supporting our allies in their efforts to defend against threats emanating from Syrian territory. The success of none of those goals will be determined by a relatively small, long-term military presence.

Mr. Trump misled the country by claiming that the Islamic State has been defeated. But the argument that American boots on the ground are needed to address its remaining strongholds is a recipe for a perpetual presence, since the terrorist group represents a generational threat that can be countered and contained but not soon wholly vanquished.

In truth, many on the right who denounced Mr. Trump's announcement did so principally because they see Syria as a venue for confronting Iran. But that is chasing an illusory and dangerous goal: It is hard to see how a few thousand American troops could counter tens of thousands of Iranian and Iranian-backed forces, aligned both with Moscow and President Bashar al-Assad's regime that has largely won the civil war.

A chorus of criticism inevitably greeted Mr. Trump's recent statement that Iranian forces ""can do what they want"" in Syria. Yet read as a statement of fact rather than the extension of a green light, he stumbled upon a self-evident truth: Notwithstanding Israel's successful efforts to limit Iran's importation of advanced weaponry into Syria, Tehran's position in the country is essentially secure.

Mr. Trump is correct that the better course is to extricate ourselves from Syria, but his fatal error has been in its implementation. Most egregiously, his snap decision during a telephone call with President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey betrayed our Kurdish partners who led the fight against the Islamic State and risked being exposed to assault by Turkey and the Syrian regime.

A more responsible course would have been to use the prospect of an eventual American withdrawal to help avert a subsequent conflict between the Kurds and their adversaries. If, as he is now suggesting, the president withdraws the troops more gradually rather than right away, that opportunity might still exist.

It requires Mr. Trump to use that time wisely. He should start by abandoning the dangerous notion of Turkey seizing areas controlled by Kurdish forces and instead allow the Kurds -- in the absence of long-term American protection -- to negotiate an understanding with the Syrian regime. This might entail returning some aspects of the Syrian state to northeast Syria, Kurdish forces retaining their military capacity but lowering its profile and a degree of self-governance for the region.

In Afghanistan too, Mr. Trump's bottom line was correct. After more than 17 years of combat and a virtual stalemate, at best, for more than a decade, there is little rationale for continuing to expend American blood and treasure on a conflict trending badly, with unclear objectives.

But here too, the self-proclaimed ""great negotiator"" erred in folding America's limited cards for nothing in return, rather than using his willingness to withdraw as an incentive for the Taliban -- currently locked in negotiations with Mr. Trump's own diplomats -- to make peace.

So much is objectionable about the Trump era that it is hard for critics to know which targets to strike. But principled opposition requires that progressive opponents of President Trump not distort their beliefs for quick rhetorical wins. Whatever administration eventually follows will have many messes to clean up and will need to distinguish those that truly matter.

Inevitably, the United States will face threats that will require the use of military force. But we ought to continually question our enduring involvement in faraway conflicts, particularly when they come at a terrible cost to the United States and local populations as in Afghanistan and Iraq; make us complicit in abuses as in Yemen; entangle us with unsavory partners as occurred with some elements of the Syrian opposition; or exacerbate anti-American sentiment as our broader counterterrorism campaign often did.

Troop withdrawals can be messy and costly even in the best of circumstances. But that is not a reason to drift into forever wars while searching for the perfect exit. It is a reason to be disciplined about objectives and judicious about intervening in the first place.

Mr. Trump's Syria and Afghanistan decisions, assuming he sticks to them, may well lead to disastrous outcomes because of how they were executed, their timing, the complete lack of consultation with allies and experts and his utter failure to leverage them. All of that justifies a verdict of malpractice. But one can render that judgment while acknowledging that done differently, withdrawing is the right thing to do.

73,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/08/us/politics/house-democrats-gun-control.html,"WASHINGTON -- Emboldened House Democrats, seeking a politically charged debate on gun control, unveiled legislation on Tuesday to expand background checks to nearly all firearms purchases, a move timed to mark the eighth anniversary of the mass shooting in Arizona that nearly killed former Representative Gabrielle Giffords.

By introducing the measure less than one week after taking control of the House, Democrats are signaling that it is a top priority. A vote could come within the first 100 days of the new Congress. The measure, and a companion bill introduced Tuesday in the Senate, also reflects the changing politics around gun laws, an issue many Democrats once shied away from.

The bill, which will almost certainly pass the House but will face a steep climb in the Republican-controlled Senate, would require background checks on the purchases of nearly all firearms, including those sold at gun shows and over the internet. There would be limited exceptions, including for law enforcement officers and for guns transferred between close family members.

Polls have shown that a vast majority of Americans -- by some estimates, 90 percent -- support universal background checks for all gun purchases. Many Democrats, including Representative Lucy McBath, a freshman from Georgia whose son was shot and killed at a Florida gas station, were elected last year after promising to address gun safety.

""Today we take a decisive step to help save lives right away,"" said Representative Mike Thompson, Democrat of California and the bill's chief sponsor, adding, ""From public polling to the ballot box, the American people have spoken up and demanded action.""

By limiting the bill to background checks -- and keeping out other provisions such as a ban on assault rifles or high-capacity magazines -- gun safety advocates hope to pressure Republicans on a policy that has broad public support. In the Senate, Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, will have to decide whether to bring up the bill. In the House, Republicans will be forced to vote on it.

""It will show us who's with us and who's against us,"" said Patricia Maisch, 69, who survived the Jan. 8, 2011, mass shooting in Tucson that killed six and grievously injured Ms. Giffords.

But by narrowing the bill so dramatically, Democrats may also limit its utility. Suspects in many recent high-profile mass shootings -- including those in Pittsburgh; Parkland, Fla.; Thousand Oaks, Calif.; Las Vegas; and Sutherland Springs, Tex. -- had passed background checks when purchasing their weapons.

Even so, gun law changes rarely make it through Congress. The measure is similar to one written by Senators Joe Manchin III, Democrat of West Virginia, and Patrick J. Toomey, Republican of Pennsylvania, in response to the mass shooting that killed 20 children and six adults at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Conn., in 2012. That bill, pressed hard by President Barack Obama and the parents of Sandy Hook victims, fell to a bipartisan filibuster in 2013 in a Senate controlled by Democrats.

Then as now, the National Rifle Association opposed the measure.

""So-called universal background checks will never be universal because criminals do not comply with the law,"" said Jennifer Baker, a spokeswoman for the powerful gun lobby. She noted that the gunman who shot Ms. Giffords passed a background check. His name did not come up in the federal database even though he had mental health issues.

The Democrats' measure was unveiled at a news conference featuring Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California, Mr. Thompson, who helped write the House companion bill to Toomey-Manchin in 2013, and Ms. Giffords, as well as gun safety advocates and victims of gun violence from around the country. Mr. Thompson plans to escort Ms. Giffords, who as a former member is still permitted on the House floor, into the chamber so she can formally drop the bill into the ""hopper"" -- the bin, located on the rostrum, where all legislation has its start.

Ms. Giffords, 48, a Democrat who once opposed gun control, was shot in the head during a constituent meeting she was holding in a supermarket parking lot. Those who died included a 9-year-old girl and a young staff member for Ms. Giffords; 13 were injured, including Ms. Giffords, who suffered a serious brain injury that makes conversation difficult.

""It's been a long, hard haul, but I'm getting better,"" Ms. Giffords told reporters at a breakfast Tuesday, reading from a prepared statement. She said she was still undergoing ""speech therapy, physical therapy -- and yoga, too.""

Current law requires only federally licensed gun dealers to perform background checks. Gun safety advocates say the law is riddled with loopholes that allow felons, domestic abusers and others who would ordinarily be prohibited from buying guns to purchase them through private sales, including online and at gun shows.

For gun safety advocates and victims of gun violence, Tuesday's bill introduction represents an important shift in Washington after a year of devastating massacres, including the mass shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Fla., last February, which spawned a powerful youth movement.

""Successful legislative change follows cultural change,"" said Emily Nottingham, whose son, Gabriel Zimmerman, then an aide to Ms. Giffords, was killed in the Tucson shooting. She added, ""When more and more people recognize that this is a national issue that can affect all of us, not just a few people somewhere else, then cultural change happens, and that's what we're seeing now.""

Under the Thompson bill, anyone who wanted to sell a gun but lacked a license would have to take the weapon to a licensed dealer, who would then conduct a background check on the purchaser.

Transfers between law enforcement officers and military personnel acting in a professional capacity would be exempt, as would ""a loan or bona fide gift between spouses, between domestic partners, between parents and their children, between siblings, between aunts and uncles and their nieces or nephews or between grandparents and their grandchildren,"" according to the text of the bill.

Transfers to executors of estates would also be exempt, as would temporary transfers of weapons for the purpose of hunting or to ""prevent imminent death or great bodily harm."""
74,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/08/opinion/green-new-deal.html,"It was a good idea that didn't catch on in 2007. Now we're running out of time.

Back in 2007, I wrote a column calling for a ""Green New Deal,"" and I later expanded on the idea in a book, ""Hot, Flat and Crowded."" Barack Obama picked up the theme and made a Green New Deal part of his 2008 platform, but the idea just never took off. So I'm excited that the new Democratic Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and others have put forward their own takes on a Green New Deal, and it's now getting some real attention.

There is no agreed-upon policy road map for a Green New Deal. But as one of the leading climate bloggers, Joe Romm, recently pointed out, ""Since the midterms, dozens of U.S. representatives and at least four Democratic senators have pledged support to create a Select Committee to create legislation for a Green New Deal. The goal is a 'detailed national, industrial, economic mobilization plan' to rapidly transition the country away from fossil fuels and toward clean energy, such as a solar, wind, and electric cars.""

The Green New Deal that Ocasio-Cortez has laid out aspires to power the U.S. economy with 100 percent renewable energy within 12 years and calls for ""a job guarantee program to assure a living wage job to every person who wants one,"" ""basic income programs"" and ""universal health care,"" financed, at least in part, by higher taxes on the wealthy. Critics argue that this is technically unfeasible and that combining it with democratic socialist proposals will drive off conservatives needed to pass it.

Myself, I like the urgency and energy she and groups like the Sunrise Movement are bringing to this task. So for now I say: Let a hundred Green New Deal ideas bloom! Let's see what sticks and what falls by the wayside.

My own definition of a Green New Deal, which has evolved since 2007 as the technology has gotten better and the climate problem has gotten worse, remains focused on how a green revolution in America can drive innovation, spur new industries and enhance our security. Originally I also thought it could help us get our groove back after the 2007-8 recession. Success required changes in attitude, scale and innovation.

Clean energy is a problem of scale. If you don't have scale, you have a hobby. I like hobbies. I used to build model airplanes. But you can't mitigate climate change as a hobby. The reason I called for a Green New Deal was first and foremost to convey that this undertaking required a massive, urgent response commensurate with the scale and time frame posed by accelerating disruptive climate.

For too long ""green"" was viewed as a synonym for a project that was boutique, uneconomical, liberal, sissy and vaguely French. I wanted to recast green as geostrategic, capitalistic, economical, innovative and patriotic. My motto was, ""Green is the new red, white and blue."" I did not believe in being a ""nice"" green. I believed in being a mean green. I believed greens should be as brassy, bold, big sky and in-your-face as any oil and gas executive.

I liked the way environmental writer David Roberts put it in 2008: ""Like so much of the American left, the environmental movement has become acclimated to the notion that it is operating outside the mainstream, knocking sheepishly on the door. Its rallying cry might as well be, 'If it's not too much trouble. ...'"" Forget that, Roberts argued, it is time for the green movement to think big and make big demands -- something oil and gas executives do every day.

To achieve scale, though, my view was that a Green New Deal had to be embraced by more than liberals. You had to reach conservatives and even climate deniers. My way of doing that was to focus on something we can all agree on: math. There are about 7.6 billion people on the planet today and, according to the United Nations, there will be 8.6 billion in 2030. A billion more people driving, flying, eating protein, building homes and drinking water in just over a decade.

If they all adopt the per-capita consumption habits of today's Americans, we're going to burn up, heat up, eat up, plow up, choke up and smoke up the planet, whether the climate changes or not. That means that clean power, clean cars, clean manufacturing, clean water and energy efficiency have to be the next great global industries -- otherwise, we humans are going to be a bad biological experiment, whether the climate changes or not.

Who believes that America can remain a great country and not lead the next great global industry? Not me. A Green New Deal, in other words, is a strategy for American national security, national resilience, natural security and economic leadership in the 21st century. Surely some conservatives can support that.

And to make sure that they have an incentive to, I would also guarantee that a portion of every dollar raised by a carbon tax in a Green New Deal would be invested in two new community college and high-speed broadband in rural areas of every state. Each state could decide where. Every American needs to feel a chance to gain from a Green New Deal.

But which Green New Deal? Mine is focused on innovation. I believe there is only one thing as big as Mother Nature, and that is Father Greed -- a.k.a., the market. I am a green capitalist. I think we will only get the scale we need by shaping the market. If I were drafting a Green New Deal platform today, it would put in place steadily rising mileage, manufacturing and emissions standards; stronger building codes; and carbon market prices that would say to our industries and innovators: Here are the goals, here is the level of clean power or efficiency that you have to hit every year -- and may the best company win.

As I wrote in my 2007 column: ""To spark a Green New Deal today requires getting two things right: government regulations and prices. Look at California. By setting steadily higher standards for the energy efficiency of buildings and appliances -- and creating incentives for utilities to work with consumers to use less power -- California has held its per-capita electricity use constant for 30 years, while the rest of the nation has seen per-capita electricity use increase by nearly 50 percent, according to the Natural Resources Defense Council. That has saved California from building 24 giant power plants.""

To keep it simple, my goals would be what energy innovator Hal Harvey has dubbed ""the four zeros."" 1. Zero-net energy buildings: buildings that can produce as much energy as they consume. 2. Zero-waste manufacturing: stimulating manufacturers to design and build products that use fewer raw materials and that are easily disassembled and recycled. 3. A zero-carbon grid: If we can combine renewable power generation at a utility scale with some consumers putting up their own solar panels and windmills that are integrated with the grid, and with large-scale storage batteries, we really could, one day, electrify everything carbon-free. 4. Zero-emissions transportation: a result of combining electric vehicles and electric public transportation with a zero-carbon grid.

That's my Green New Deal circa 2019. It basically says: Forget the Space Race. We don't need a man, or woman, on Mars. We need an Earth Race -- a free-market competition to ensure that mankind can continue to thrive on Earth. A Green New Deal is the strategy for that. It can make America healthier, wealthier, more innovative, more energy secure, more respected -- and weaken petro-dictators across the globe.

I am eager to see what other people propose, but we don't have another decade to waste. This may well be our last chance to build the technologies we need at the scale of the challenge we face in the time we still have to -- as scientists say -- manage the unavoidable aspects of climate change and avoid the unmanageable ones.

As the environmentalist Dana Meadows once put it, ""We have exactly enough time -- starting now.""

75,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/08/us/politics/donald-trump-speech.html,"WASHINGTON -- President Trump sought to go over the heads of Congress to enlist public support for his long-promised border wall on Tuesday night, raising the stakes of an ideological and political conflict that has left the doors of many federal agencies shuttered for 18 days.

With the first prime-time Oval Office address of his presidency, Mr. Trump contended that the illegal flow of immigrants and drugs from Mexico has become such a crisis that it justifies keeping much of the government closed until Democrats in Congress give him money to build the barrier.

""How much more American blood must we shed before Congress does its job?"" the president asked in a nine-minute speech. Asking Americans to call their lawmakers, he added: ""This is a choice between right and wrong, justice and injustice. This is about whether we fulfill our sacred duty to the American citizens we serve.""

But Democrats dismissed his talk of a crisis as overstated cynicism and, with polls showing Mr. Trump bearing more of the blame since the partial shutdown began last month, showed no signs of giving in. The White House dispatched Vice President Mike Pence and others to Capitol Hill to try to shore up Senate Republicans, who are growing increasingly anxious as the standoff drags on.

In taking his argument to a national television audience to be followed by a trip to the Texas border on Thursday, Mr. Trump hoped to reframe the debate. After spending much of the first two weeks of the shutdown cloistered in the White House, he has now opted to use the powers of the presidency to focus public attention on his ominous warnings about the border. At the same time, he tried to recast the situation as a ""humanitarian crisis"" as well as a security risk, an effort to take some of the edge off his sharp anti-immigrant language.

Yet privately, Mr. Trump dismissed his own new strategy as pointless. In an off-the-record lunch with television anchors hours before the address, he made clear in blunt terms that he was not inclined to give the speech or go to Texas, but was talked into it by advisers, according to two people briefed on the discussion who asked not to be identified sharing details.

""It's not going to change a damn thing, but I'm still doing it,"" Mr. Trump said of the trip to the border, according to one of the people, who was in the room. The border trip was just a photo opportunity, he said. ""But,"" he added, gesturing at his communications aides, Bill Shine, Sarah Huckabee Sanders and Kellyanne Conway, ""these people behind you say it's worth it.""

Congressional leaders from both parties are scheduled to return to the White House on Wednesday afternoon to resume negotiations that so far have made little progress. Mr. Trump has insisted on $5.7 billion for the wall while Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she would not give him a dollar for a wall she called ""immoral.""

In their own televised response last night, Ms. Pelosi and Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic minority leader, chided the president for using the shutdown to stoke fear. ""President Trump must stop holding the American people hostage, must stop manufacturing a crisis and must reopen the government,"" Ms. Pelosi said.

Mr. Trump has made the wall the singular focus of his presidency as he enters his third year in office, and the shutdown has become an enormous political gamble. His promise to erect a ""big, beautiful wall"" along the border became perhaps the most memorable promise on the campaign trail this fall, eliciting chants from supporters of ""build the wall,"" and he has been frustrated by his inability to deliver on it.

But his alarming description of a ""crisis"" at the border has raised credibility questions. Migrant border crossings have been declining for nearly two decades. The majority of heroin enters the United States through legal ports of entry, not through open areas of the border. And the State Department said in a recent report that there is ""no credible evidence"" that terrorist groups had sent operatives to enter the United States through Mexico.

""There is no crisis, there is no invasion, there is no clear and present danger, as the president would try to convey to the American people to scare them and to justify actions otherwise not justified,"" said Representative Steny H. Hoyer of Maryland, the Democratic majority leader.

Even so, Democrats, many of whom voted in 2006 for 700 miles of fencing along the border, did not want to conduct the debate on Mr. Trump's terms. Instead, they focused attention on the damaging effects of the shutdown, already the second longest in American history. About 800,000 government employees are either furloughed or working without pay, in addition to hundreds of thousands of contractors.

House Democrats planned to approve individual spending bills this week that were intended to reopen closed departments one at a time in hopes of putting Republicans on the defensive, but Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the Republican leader, has said he would not put any bill on the floor without Mr. Trump's explicit support.

Senate Democrats took to the floor on Tuesday to pressure Mr. McConnell, who has largely kept out of the conflict, and they vowed to block consideration of other legislation until the government is reopened.

Mr. McConnell fired back, noting the 2006 legislation. ""Maybe the Democratic Party was for secure borders before they were against them,"" he said. ""Or maybe they're just making it up as they go along. Or maybe they are that dead-set on opposing this particular president on any issue, for any reason, just for the sake of opposing him.""

But two more Senate Republicans spoke out on Tuesday in favor of reopening the government while negotiations over border security continue. ""I think we can walk and chew gum,"" Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska told reporters.

Senator Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, who is chairwoman of the Appropriations subcommittee on homeland security, expressed frustration with the shutdown and ""how useless it is,"" indicating that she might support reopening the government while wall talks continue. ""I mean, I think I could live with that, but let's see what he says tonight,"" she said before the speech.

That makes five Republican senators who have expressed such a position, which if combined with a unanimous Democratic caucus would make a majority to reopen the government. But the Senate is tightly controlled by the majority leader, and he can prevent bills from coming to the floor for a vote.

The United States Chamber of Commerce, normally influential with business-oriented Republicans, called on both sides to reopen the government and agree to a compromise that would include both doing more to secure the border while permitting younger immigrants brought to the country illegally when they were children to stay.

If Democrats do not agree to approve the money for the wall, Mr. Trump has threatened to declare a national emergency and proceed with its construction without approval by Congress, a move that could provoke a constitutional clash with the legislative branch over the power of the federal purse. While some legal experts said the president has a plausible case given current law, it would almost surely generate a court challenge by critics arguing that he was overstepping his bounds.

Even some Republicans warned him against such a move. Senator Susan Collins of Maine said that although the law provides the president with emergency powers, ""the administration should not act on a claim of dubious constitutional authority."" She added, ""It should get authorization from Congress before repurposing such a significant sum of money for a border wall.""

The wall is popular with Mr. Trump's Republican base, but the public at large holds the president responsible for the shutdown, according to polls. In a poll by Reuters and Ipsos, 51 percent of respondents said that Mr. Trump ""deserves most of the blame,"" up four percentage points from earlier in the crisis, while 32 percent pointed the finger at congressional Democrats.

Moreover, the public seems to have grown weary of the impasse. Seventy percent of registered voters in the latest The Hill-HarrisX poll urged the president and Congress to reach a compromise while just 30 percent asserted that sticking to principles was more important than reopening the government.

The president's use of the Oval Office for the speech stirred some debate, with critics asserting that a setting more typically used for occasions of war or other national security crises was being turned into a partisan platform in a policy dispute. The subsequent televised statements by Ms. Pelosi and Mr. Schumer were the first time opposition leaders were given national airtime to respond to a president in the Oval Office.

Not counting speeches to Congress, Mr. Trump had made only five formal addresses to the nation before Tuesday night, three of them in prime time and none from the Oval Office, according to Mark Knoller, a longtime CBS News journalist who keeps close track of recent presidential history. Mr. Trump's previous prime-time speeches were to introduce his two Supreme Court nominations and to announce his decision to send more troops to Afghanistan.

By contrast, Bill Clinton gave 16 addresses to the nation over eight years, 14 of them from the Oval Office. George W. Bush gave 23 such addresses, six from the Oval Office, and Barack Obama gave 12, with three from his office. The television networks declined to give Mr. Obama prime time for a national address on immigration in 2014 because it was seen as political, although it did not come at a time of government shutdown."
76,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/08/arts/television/trump-prime-time-speech-border-review.html,"If you had the word ""crisis"" in your presidential address drinking game, my sympathies.

In President Trump's first televised address from the Oval Office, and the rebuttal from Representative Nancy Pelosi and Senator Charles Schumer, there was a lot of crisis talk: ""Crisis of the heart,"" ""Manufacturing a crisis."" The president cast the crisis as a dire, dangerous wave of immigration coming across the Mexican border. For the Democrats, the crisis was the extended government shutdown, precipitated by Mr. Trump's insistence on funding for his promised border wall.

What there was not, after two days of media drama, was a convincing argument for why this needed to be a prime-time event at all. There was no news. There was no new argument. There was just a wall of sound, and the American viewing audience paid for it.

Nor was there much compelling television, unless you're an avid maker of internet memes. This was not a friendly setting for either party.

The Oval Office, which can confer gravitas on a typical president, simply saps this atypical one. Mr. Trump comes alive playing off a crowd, like the ones he drove wild with promises that Mexico would pay for the wall. Plopped behind a desk, sniffling, reading sleepily from a TelePrompTer, he was a comedian playing an empty room.

Ms. Pelosi and Mr. Schumer, meanwhile, shared a lectern in a hallway, side by side, one glaring as the other spoke, looking unfortunately like a cross between Grant Wood's ""American Gothic"" and the twins from ""The Shining.""

There was a bit of new rhetoric from Mr. Trump (his prepared speech referenced morality, something he rarely does off the cuff), and a few sound bites from the opposition (""We don't govern by temper tantrum,"" Mr. Schumer said). But you heard nothing you couldn't absorb from a few minutes surfing cable news, or political Twitter, any time of the day.

So what did all this accomplish? Well, it got Mr. Trump on TV, his true home. After a run of headlines for the new Democratic House, it gained him two days of newscasts about him, him, him. Cable reporters gave hourly updates on whether the president might declare a national emergency. He became the protagonist again, the home audience hanging on for the dramatic reveal.

The real crisis revelation, honestly, was a crisis of TV standards, which came long before the cameras started rolling. On Monday, the networks hemmed, wobbled, then decided to give Mr. Trump unfiltered access to their audience, on a topic on which he has a clear record of, well, ""lies,"" ""falsehoods,"" ""misstatements"" -- I'll leave it to you and your thesaurus.

Whatever the semantics, the networks know they can't trust Mr. Trump to tell the truth. They know this because he went on live TV twice last week -- in a Cabinet meeting and in a long Rose Garden ramble -- and said numerous things about this very topic that were demonstrably, empirically false.

Assessing whether a source is credible isn't bias. It's not political. It's journalism. In this case, the networks had more evidence than Charlie Brown did about Lucy and her football. (This comparison may be unfair to Charlie Brown, who did not act out of fear that the football would tweet mean things about him.)

Instead, the broadcast networks carried Mr. Trump's address live, and without the real-live, onscreen fact-checking that news outlets have experimented with in other speeches.

ABC scrambled to cram in speed-talking fact-checks between speeches, its correspondents correcting information about the number of illegal border crossings, fact-checking Mr. Trump's claim that Mexico would pay for the wall and noting that most heroin comes into the U.S. through legal border crossings. NBC and CBS focused more on the politics of the shutdown, going forward. (The cable networks, of course, had all night to debate and speculate.)

CBS's screen graphics were especially friendly to the president. The chyrons under its analysis read ""President Trump: 'The Border Wall Will Pay for Itself'"" -- with no assessment of the claim -- ""President Trump: Border Wall Is 'Just Common Sense'"" and ""Pres. Trump: Securing Border a 'Choice Between Right and Wrong.'"" There were no captions quoting the Democratic rebuttal.

Live airtime for Oval Office addresses isn't an entitlement. The broadcast networks declined to air a 2014 speech by Barack Obama -- on immigration! -- on the grounds that it would be essentially political. They could have done the same for Mr. Trump, then covered the news he made, if there was any, with context and fact-checks.

Instead, they made a gutless decision to put appearances or tradition or the fear of a presidential ragetweet over their responsibility to keep their audience from being misinformed, and for a partisan fizzle of a news event.

We will see how Mr. Trump fares with the Democrats. But the TV networks put up as much of a barrier as a wall made of toothpicks."
77,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/09/style/jared-polis-gay-governor.html,"BOULDER, COLO. -- On Tuesday, the first openly gay man elected governor in American history was sworn in, his partner at his side. It was a vision of progress captured in its unfurling: a milestone celebrated by those who saw themselves represented, even as it was also accepted by others as a matter of unremarkable course.

In November, Jared Polis beat his Republican opponent, Walker Stapleton (a second cousin to Jeb and George W. Bush), in a self-funded campaign that helped make the race the most expensive in Colorado history. Constituents voted for him by a more-than-10-point margin, in a state whose swing on gay rights in the last three decades can be described as a complete about-face. Even in Colorado, once known as the ""Hate State"" for its anti-gay policies, Mr. Polis's gayness was ""interestingly uninteresting to voters, "" as the conservative columnist George F. Will wrote.

""What we found,"" Mr. Polis said, ""was that the voters don't really care. This has been a much bigger deal nationally.""

The national press trumpeted his win as part of a ""Rainbow Wave"" that carried more than 150 L.G.B.T. candidates into office nationwide. Here in Colorado, Mr. Polis, 43, a five-term congressman from a district that includes Boulder and Fort Collins as well as rural and mountain communities, has been shruggingly, who-cares gay for years. He does not conform to the clichéd gay stereotypes: He's a techie nerd with thinning hair and an ungymmed physique, in ever-present blue sneakers and a western belt. (Mr. Polis's inaugural ball is the Blue Sneaker Ball; the dress code is easy to infer.) In 2014, GQ called him the worst-dressed congressman ever, though he's improved his style a bit since then.

When Mr. Polis was first elected to Congress in 2008, though, the usual preconceptions about gay men preceded him. ""The things people assume but don't know about the L.G.B.T. community,"" said his partner, Marlon Reis, 37. ""All gay men are stylish, they dance well, they yada yada yada."" When they arrived in Washington, Mr. Reis continued, ""Barney Frank actually said to Jared one day, 'Your suit looks like you crumpled it up in your pocket for the whole day.'""

Annise Parker, the chief executive of LGBTQ Victory Fund, which supports L.G.B.T. candidates and endorsed Mr. Polis, stumped with him during the last month of his campaign. ""I have great respect and affection for him but he's not the most exciting guy in the world,"" she said. ""He's very low key; he's a policy wonk. He just wants to work for the citizens of Colorado. And that clearly came through.""

A candidate's sexual orientation, she said, was ""not a reason for people to vote for you.""

""Someday,"" she added, ""it won't be a reason for people to vote against you.""

His recent campaign for governor focused on education (Mr. Polis proposed to fund full-day preschool and kindergarten for the entire state), affordable health insurance and renewable energy, and he neither played up nor played down his sexual orientation and his family. Mr. Reis, who has generally shied away from interviews and public appearances, campaigned with him, but sparingly.

Barack Obama endorsed him. President Trump endorsed Mr. Stapleton and tweeted that Mr. Polis was ""weak on crime and weak on borders."" (Mr. Polis responded: Did you ""mean Utah, New Mexico, Wyoming, Nebraska, Kansas, Oklahoma, or Arizona? Those are the only borders Colorado has."") Attack ads warned that Mr. Polis -- branded by conservatives a ""Boulder liberal"" -- wanted to turn Colorado into an progressive paradise imaginatively called ""Radicalifornia.""

It is true that Mr. Polis and his family will remain in Boulder, where he and Mr. Reis were both born, rather than move to the traditional governor's residence in Denver. But in Congress, Mr. Polis voted with Democrats slightly less often than the median House democrat, according to Voteview.

Other openly L.G.B.T. officials have served in Congress, but not many. The last gay governor, Jim McGreevey of New Jersey, stepped down after announcing both his gayness and the affair that led to his resignation. Mr. Polis said that his election -- which is similar only to that of Kate Brown, the openly bisexual governor of Oregon who was re-elected last year -- ""can show L.G.B.T. youth that their orientation or gender identity shouldn't stand in the way of whatever they want to achieve in life, including public service.""

But in his own political lifetime there was good reason to think that it could.

Colorado's First First Gentleman

""How would it be when we arrived in Washington? Would we be treated differently?"" Mr. Reis wondered when Mr. Polis was first elected to federal office in 2008. Politics has always required its practitioners to negotiate deals and deal-breakers, the spoken and the unspeakable. When Mr. Polis was elected to the House, he and Mr. Reis -- before kids, before dog -- road-tripped to Washington through the American South, stopping in Amarillo, Tex., and swinging up through Pigeon Forge, Tenn., to see Dollywood.

They recalled stopping at a steakhouse in Amarillo for dinner one night. ""We might be the only Jewish people in town but they probably understand that,"" Mr. Polis told Mr. Reis at the time. ""There's not a lot of gay people but they probably understand that. But no matter what you do in this town, don't say you're a vegan.""

Mr. Reis, a vegan, is slim and baby-faced, with an abiding love of animals and Halloween. He and Mr. Polis met in Boulder in 2002, when Mr. Reis was finishing college. He taught Mr. Polis about Romantic literature; Mr. Polis taught him about baseball. He worked as a freelance writer, volunteered for L.G.B.T. organizations and advocated for animal welfare.

Mr. Reis plans to make animal welfare one of his signature causes as First Gentleman of Colorado -- his new title -- and proceeds from the inaugural ball will support, among other organizations, the Wild Animal Sanctuary in Keenesburg.

""When I first arrived with Jared in Washington I had zero sense of what I was supposed to be, if there was even a definition of what a congressional spouse would be,"" he said. ""I was completely terrified in the beginning to talk to anyone.""

Mr. Polis had been interested in politics for years, but Mr. Reis endured what he called a ""steep learning curve."" He devoted himself to raising their two children, Caspian, now seven, and Cora, now four -- ""the kids are better at working a room than I am,"" Mr. Reis joked -- and slowly grew more comfortable in his place among the congressional spouses, even as something of an odd man out.

""I always likened it to being the toy at the bottom of the cereal box,"" he said. ""Everyone wanted to come up and they all wanted to be friends. They made hilarious comparisons. They said, 'My hairdresser of 30 years is gay.'""

Under the Table

When Mr. Polis made his first congressional run, he came out publicly in a local newspaper article. By then, he and Mr. Reis had been together for years, but because of his political aspirations, Mr. Reis remembered, ""we went out to restaurants and held hands under the table.""

""The reality I think is that ten years ago this was an issue that detractors could bring up to harm a candidate,"" Mr. Reis said. And Mr. Polis has been subjected to slurs and threats; in his first campaign, he received so many pieces of hate mail that he began to tack them up. ""It filled up a whole wall,"" he said.

More of the attacks were anti-Semitic than homophobic, Mr. Polis said -- he is also Colorado's first Jewish governor -- and the vitriol diminished over time. But it is not gone. Mr. Polis mentioned the anti-gay sentiment he faced during last year's campaign: sign defacings in Summit County, letters to the editor in Walsenburg, homophobic slurs written in shaving cream on his car.

He shrugged it off. ""It just looked out of touch and weird and it didn't cost any votes,"" he said. ""People have said far worse in politics.""

If anything, Mr. Polis added, his orientation may have actually mobilized voters who saw in him a fellow traveler outside the status quo, persecuted or maligned: ""I wasn't just another straight white guy who didn't get it.""

His victory is all the more notable for taking place in Colorado, which offers, at the moment, a certain, if largely white, glimpse of the country in miniature, split between Democrats, Republicans and independents. It is historically red but, thanks to an influx of the young and urbane, it's turning purple, if not blue. In the 2018 elections, Coloradans elected not only Mr. Polis; they voted in Joe Neguse, the son of Eritrean immigrants, to Mr. Polis's vacated congressional seat as Colorado's first African-American congressman, and Brianna Titone as the first openly transgender state representative.

The state is not a gay mecca in the way New York, California or Florida are perceived -- ""The district I represent, most of the time I represented it, didn't have a single gay bar,"" Mr. Polis said -- but Colorado holds a central and complicated place in the history of L.G.B.T. rights in the United States. It carries, Mr. Polis said, ""a lot of baggage.""

The first major Supreme Court victory for the gay-rights movement, Romer v. Evans, came in 1996 in response to Amendment 2, a Colorado constitutional amendment that prohibited the passage of laws specifically protecting gays and lesbians from discrimination. The Supreme Court struck down the amendment as unconstitutional, a decision that served as a precedent for later milestones, including Lawrence v. Texas (2003), which decriminalized sodomy nationwide, and Obergefell v. Hodges (2015), which made marriage equality the law of the land.

Colorado also happens to be where the first unchallenged gay marriage license was granted, in 1975, by a Boulder county clerk named Clela Rorex, thanks to the vague wording of the Colorado legal code. It may be the base of Focus on the Family, which preaches family values that do not include homosexuality, headquartered in Colorado Springs, but it also home to the Matthew Shepard Foundation, in Denver.

It was in Lakewood -- just west of Denver -- that Jack Phillips refused to bake a wedding cake for a gay couple at his Masterpiece Cakeshop, leading to another Supreme Court case; the court ruled in Mr. Phillips's favor against the Colorado Civil Rights Commission last year.

""We won't be ordering cake from them,"" Mr. Polis said.

Money Changes Everything

Colorado's progress on gay rights was coaxed into motion by the concerted effort of a number of wealthy and committed Coloradans -- including Jared Polis.

In 1994, Tim Gill, 65, the multimillionaire software developer, established a foundation and poured hundreds of millions into advocacy after being stunned by the victory at the polls of the anti-gay Amendment 2 in 1992. At the time, Mr. Gill said, two-thirds of Coloradans said they didn't know anyone who was gay or lesbian.

Mr. Gill eventually extended himself and his donations into the political arena, and with a like-minded group of megadonors dubbed the Gang of Four, helped to swing Colorado's General Assembly from Republican to Democratic in 2004 -- the same year that 11 states adopted a ballot measure banning gay marriage.

The Gang of Four included Mr. Polis, who was one of the richest members of Congress during his tenure. Before taking office, Mr. Polis was an entrepreneur; he digitized his parents' greeting-card business into the e-card behemoth BlueMountain.com, and founded ProFlowers.com, an online flower-delivery service.

""I think he saw an opportunity when the state was changing for him to become a more active participant,"" said Scott Miller, 39, who is Mr. Gill's husband and with him, the co-chair of the Gill Foundation.

Mr. Gill and Mr. Miller have since supported Mr. Polis's congressional campaigns and his run for governor, although they initially backed one of Mr. Polis's opponents in his first congressional primary. ""My mission in life is to protect as many people as I possibly can in the shortest amount of time,"" Mr. Gill said. ""Essentially, in every case where legislation was passed, there was an L.G.B.T. elected official who helped it.""

Mr. Gill said that while he long believed there would be a gay governor in the U.S., he ""wouldn't have thought it would happen this soon.""

""Jared is particularly interesting because it shows where America has come to,"" he said, ""and that America is a much, much more tolerant place than it was.""

That shift may resonate most strongly with those who have known the country as it was.

For Mr. Miller, who grew up in Colorado's more conservative, red-leaning Western Slope, the election of a gay governor was all the more satisfying for being in his own state. ""For me, on election night, seeing Jared and Marlon up on that stage and him giving his victory speech -- I so much would have loved to have known what that would have felt like back when I was in high school,"" he said.

This rang true even for young local voters, who in the week leading up to the inauguration described feeling elated. Jean Peterson, a paralegal in Denver who turns 26 this week, described watching Mr. Polis's November victory speech with her girlfriend, tears in her eyes.

""It was really moving,"" she said, ""to see him point to his partner and all the support that his partner gave him, to have someone acknowledge their partner ... We were both kind of crying.""

At his inauguration on Tuesday, the Denver Gay Men's Chorus warmed up with ""True Colors"" (Cyndi Lauper, who first recorded it, was booked for the inaugural ball that night) before remarks from local grandees and faith leaders and the new officials were sworn in. Mr. Polis sat with Mr. Reis and their children behind a pane of bulletproof glass, a precaution one veteran Colorado reporter noted he hadn't seen in five previous inaugurations. But when Mr. Polis got up to speak -- after a quick selfie with the crowd -- he addressed divisiveness and diversity only briefly.

""We complement one other, learn from each other, make each other better, and in that work, we respect each other's rights,"" he said.

Then he turned to economics, the environment and health care, and, like the start-up guru he is, declared himself ready to get to work."
78,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/09/opinion/president-trump-border-wall-weak.html,"Mr. Kruse and Mr. Zelizer are the authors of ""Fault Lines: A History of the United States Since 1974.""

For all his bluster, Donald Trump is generally seen by presidential observers as a shockingly weak president. Brought to office in an election in which he lost the popular vote, his approval ratings have remained consistently low. Even with his party in control of the White House and Congress for two years, beyond a typical Republican tax cut, Mr. Trump failed to secure a signature legislative accomplishment.

The president may seem weak, but the presidency remains strong. Mr. Trump has illustrated that even a feeble commander in chief can impose his will on the nation if he lacks any sense of restraint or respect for political norms and guardrails. True, Mr. Trump has not been able to run roughshod over Congress or ignore the constraints of the federal courts. But he has been able to inflict extensive damage on our political institutions and public culture. He has used his power to aggravate, rather than calm, the fault lines that have divided our country.

His ""wall"" government shutdown is the latest example of his misuse of executive power. To end this essentially pointless standoff of his own making, he is exploring the use of national emergency powers to build a wall Congress and a majority of the public don't want.

The Trump administration has provided a new example of an old concept: the ""imperial presidency."" That term, famously used by the historian Arthur Schlesinger Jr. in 1973 to describe the excesses and abuses of the Nixon White House, fell out of use almost as soon as President Richard Nixon fell from grace. The reckoning of Watergate and the first-ever resignation of a president seemed to show that the executive branch was not as uncontrollable as it had once seemed.

Congress enacted a wide range of reforms that promised to restrain presidential power. The War Powers Act of 1973 created mechanisms to ensure that Congress authorized the deployment of American troops abroad. The Budget Reform of 1974 centralized the process used by the House and the Senate to make decisions about spending money so as to make the legislative branch more of an equal of the executive. The Campaign Finance Reform Act of 1974 established a system of public finance for presidential elections along with spending and contribution limits.

The National Emergencies Act of 1976 required the president to offer greater specificity about how and when he or she was going to use emergency declarations. (This is the authority President Trump has reportedly explored as a way of funding his wall.) Intelligence reforms imposed limits on the C.I.A. and F.B.I., whose surveillance and national security operations had greatly enhanced the president's power. Last but not least, the Ethics in Government Act of 1978 sought to watch against a replay of Watergate by establishing the Office of the Independent Counsel to ensure that there would be independent investigations into executive branch corruption.

Despite these reforms, four decades later, the ""imperial presidency"" still seems to be alive and well. What went wrong?

The most familiar challenge stems from the fact that in the midst of national security crises, much of the nation remains willing to allow presidents to respond to its perceived enemies. Despite the War Powers Act and the larger lessons of Vietnam, Congress has continued to allow presidents to send troops into combat without a formal declaration of war. In response to the terrorist attacks of Sept. 11, Congress passed legislation authorizing a vast expansion of the national security system that gave President George W. Bush and his successors access to new organizations, programs and institutions through which to pursue national security goals without congressional support.

Since the 1970s, Democrats and Republicans have sorted themselves by party, with less room for internal dissent and less of a will to criticize or challenge a president from one's own party. Both parties have been willing to grant the president more authority when it served their purpose. The main dynamic for Democrats has centered around party leaders supporting presidents who use executive action, through regulatory orders and rule making, to deal with urgent policy problems that congressional Republicans oppose. Presidents Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton turned to executive power to deal with energy and climate change when Congress refused to do so. President Barack Obama did the same on immigration after congressional obstruction prevented compromise legislation from passing.

Republicans have done much in the same vein, in moments of divided and united government alike. Republicans have also gone a step further to protect the party's electoral interests through the use of, for instance, strict voter-ID laws.

Aggressive presidents also depend on a partisan media to do their work without too much pushback. President Trump has demonstrated how this could be turned into a powerful tool for the White House. Mr. Trump has routinely repeated stories seen on the ""Fox & Friends"" morning program and leaned on conservative cable hosts like Sean Hannity and Lou Dobbs for advice as well. Indeed, the line between the Trump White House and conservative media outlets has become blurred beyond recognition. The former CNBC host Larry Kudlow now serves as head of the National Economic Council, while the former ""Fox & Friends"" host Heather Nauert has been nominated to serve as ambassador to the United Nations. Bill Shine, a former executive at Fox News, now runs the White House Communications Office.

The imperial presidency is, in many ways, propped up by media partisans who insist that the naked emperor has glorious new clothes.

Mr. Trump has revealed that the president can act ""imperially"" because norms matter as much as rules and procedure. The reformers of the 1970s missed the ways in which reforms simply cannot restrain a president who doesn't care about institutions. The most important source of presidential restraint has been the character of the person in office.

For all his flaws, Mr. Nixon was unwilling to tear down the government to save himself. Mr. Trump has revealed that when a president is willing to cross what seemed to be clear lines, no one is there to hold him back.

With Democrats now in control of the House of Representatives and the Mueller investigation seemingly coming to a conclusion as well, Mr. Trump will likely be held to account, in one form or another. But it's important to remember that the ""imperial presidency"" will outlive any one president unless more is done to institute real checks and balances on the office itself.

Congress has the most effective means of putting new limits on the White House through oversight. Many of the tools that Congress needs are right in front of it -- holding serious hearings about the material in a Mueller report or making sure that legislation like the National Emergency Act is enforced -- but it must use them.

If Mr. Trump invokes emergency power to build a wall, Congress needs to respond by passing legislation that will take back some of the power it granted in 1976.

Most important, reforming presidential power will fall on the shoulders of voters. In the end, the most effective check on presidential power is to elect presidents who will exercise their authority with some restraint and respect our democratic institutions. That is the choice voters will have in 2020.

Justice , who had been thought to be the administration's best hope to provide a fifth vote to uphold the law, joined three more conservative members in an unusual jointly written dissent that said the court should have struck down the entire law. The majority's approach, he said from the bench, ""amounts to a vast judicial overreaching.""

The court's ruling was the most significant federalism decision since the New Deal and the most closely watched case since Bush v. Gore in 2000. It was a crucial milestone for the law, the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act of 2010, allowing almost all -- and perhaps, in the end, all -- of its far-reaching changes to roll forward.

Mr. Obama welcomed the court's decision on the health care law, which has inspired fierce protests, legal challenges and vows of repeal since it was passed. ""Whatever the politics, today's decision was a victory for people all over this country whose lives are more secure because of this law,"" he said at the White House.

Republicans, though, used the occasion to attack it again.

""Obamacare was bad policy yesterday; it's bad policy today,"" , the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, said in remarks near the Capitol. ""Obamacare was bad law yesterday; it's bad law today."" He, like Congressional Republicans, renewed his pledge to undo the law.

The historic decision, coming after three days of lively oral arguments in March and in the midst of a presidential campaign, drew intense attention across the nation. Outside the court, more than 1,000 people gathered -- packing the sidewalk, playing , chanting slogans -- and a loud cheer went up as word spread that the law had been largely upheld. Chants of ""Yes we can!"" rang out, but the ruling also provoked disappointment among supporters.

In Loudoun County, Va., Angela Laws, 58, the owner of a cleaning service, said she and her fiancé were relieved at the news. ""We laughed, and we shouted with joy and hugged each other,"" she said, explaining that she had been unable to get insurance because of her and back problems until a provision in the health care law went into effect.

After months of uncertainty about the law's fate, the court's ruling provides some clarity -- and perhaps an alert -- to states, insurers, employers and consumers about what they are required to do by 2014, when much of the law comes into force.

The Obama administration had argued that the mandate was necessary because it allowed other provisions of the law to function: those overhauling the way insurance is sold and those preventing sick people from being denied or charged extra for insurance. The mandate's supporters had said it was necessary to ensure that not only sick people but also healthy individuals would sign up for coverage, keeping insurance premiums more affordable.

Conservatives took comfort from two parts of the decision: the new limits it placed on federal regulation of commerce and on the conditions the federal government may impose on money it gives the states.

Five justices accepted the argument that had been at the heart of the challenges brought by 26 states and other plaintiffs: that the federal government is not permitted to force individuals not engaged in commercial activities to buy services they do not want. That was a stunning victory for a theory pressed by a small band of conservative and libertarian lawyers. Most members of the legal academy view the theory as misguided,if not frivolous.

""To an economist, perhaps, there is no difference between activity and inactivity; both have measurable economic effects on commerce,"" Chief Justice Roberts wrote. ""But the distinction between doing something and doing nothing would not have been lost on the framers, who were practical statesmen, not metaphysical philosophers.""

Justice , in an opinion joined by Justices , and , dissented on this point, calling the view ""stunningly retrogressive."" She wondered why Chief Justice Roberts had seen fit to address it at all in light of his vote to uphold the mandate under the tax power.

Akhil Reed Amar, a Yale law professor and a champion of the health care law, said that it was ""important to look at the dark cloud behind the silver lining.""

""Federal power has more restrictions on it,"" he said, referring to the new limits on regulating commerce. ""Going forward, there may even be laws on the books that have to be re-examined.""

The restrictions placed on the Medicaid expansion may also have significant ripple effects. A splintered group of justices effectively revised the law to allow states to choose between participating in the expansion while receiving additional payments or forgoing the expansion and retaining the existing payments. The law had called for an all-or-nothing choice.

The expansion had been designed to provide coverage to 17 million Americans. While some states have indicated that they will participate in the expansion, others may be resistant, leaving more people outside the safety net than the Obama administration had intended.

Although the decision did not turn on it, the back-and-forth between Justice Ginsburg's opinion for the four liberals and the joint opinion by the four conservatives -- Justice Kennedy and Justices , and -- revisited the by-now-familiar arguments. Broccoli made a dozen appearances.

""Although an individual might buy a car or a crown of broccoli one day, there is no certainty she will ever do so,"" Justice Ginsburg wrote. ""And if she eventually wants a car or has a craving for broccoli, she will be obliged to pay at the counter before receiving the vehicle or nourishment. She will get no free ride or food, at the expense of another consumer forced to pay an inflated price.""

The conservative dissenters responded that ""one day the failure of some of the public to purchase American cars may endanger the existence of domestic automobile manufacturers; or the failure of some to eat broccoli may be found to deprive them of a newly discovered -fighting chemical which only that food contains, producing health care costs that are a burden on the rest of us.""

All of the justices agreed that their review of the health care law was not barred by the Anti-Injunction Act, which allows suits over some sorts of taxes only after they become due. That could have delayed the health care challenge to 2015. The conservative dissenters said that the majority could not have it both ways by calling the mandate a tax for some purposes but not others.

""That carries verbal wizardry too far, deep into the forbidden land of sophists,"" they said.

As a general matter, Chief Justice Roberts wrote that the decision in the case, National Federation of Independent Business v. Sebelius, No. 11-393, offered no endorsement of the law's wisdom.

Some decisions, the chief justice said, ""are entrusted to our nation's elected leaders, who can be thrown out of office if the people disagree with them.""

Justice Ginsburg, speaking to a crowded courtroom that sat rapt for the better part of an hour, drew a different conclusion.

""In the end,"" she said, ""the Affordable Care Act survives largely unscathed."""

Here are some of the biggest stories you might have missed (and some links if you'd like to read further).

The hush-money investigation advances

On Wednesday, in a major step in the investigation of hush-money payments made to two women who said that they had affairs with President Trump, the parent company of The National Enquirer admitted to paying off a Playboy model to protect Mr. Trump's campaign. The tabloid played a crucial role in keeping the women silent ahead of the 2016 election.

The revelations came on the same day that Michael D. Cohen, a former lawyer for Mr. Trump who directly implicated the president in the hush-money scandal during his sentencing, received three years in prison.

Mr. Trump reacted angrily to the relatively short prison sentence of Mr. Cohen, and in a series of Twitter posts on Thursday said that Mr. Cohen failed him as his lawyer because he should have known about campaign finance law. The president also said that he did not direct his lawyer to do anything illegal. In an interview with ABC News on Friday, Mr. Cohen said that ""of course"" the president knew the hush payments were wrong.

In other investigation news, lawyers for Michael T. Flynn, Mr. Trump's first national security adviser, asked a federal judge on Tuesday to spare him prison time for misleading investigators and also suggested that the F.B.I. tricked Mr. Flynn into lying. On Friday, the special counsel's office rejected the suggestion.

The Senate pushes through several important bills

In a stinging bipartisan rebuke of Mr. Trump's defense of Saudi Arabia for its role in the killing of a dissident journalist, the Senate voted to withdraw American military support for the kingdom's war in Yemen.

The Senate also passed an ambitious $867 billion farm bill, and rejected stricter work requirements for food stamp recipients embraced by the House and the president. The legislation provides a safety net for farmers hit with unexpected weather or tariffs, as well as low-income Americans struggling to feed themselves and their families.

In a change of course, Mitch McConnell said the Senate would vote on a substantial criminal justice bill before the end of the year, putting Mr. Trump on the cusp of claiming one of the first truly bipartisan legislative achievements of his presidency. The president's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, was the administration's driving force behind the bill.

Senate Republicans also are working to shift the courts more firmly to the right. Many of Mr. Trump's judicial nominees have been deemed unqualified by the American Bar Association -- and others have proved racially divisive -- but conservative senators are still confirming them.

Democrats start gearing up for 2020

Senators Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders met in Washington to discuss their political intentions but did not reach any accord about their dueling presidential ambitions. It's clear they're both considering seeking the Democratic nomination in 2020.

Julián Castro, the former housing secretary in the Obama administration, announced that he was forming a presidential exploratory committee. The move makes him one of the first contenders to establish a committee in what figures to be a crowded field of Democratic candidates.

Tom Steyer, a Democratic billionaire who called for the impeachment of Mr. Trump, is considering a presidential run himself. His novel approach to staffing a potential campaign includes a LinkedIn page advertising jobs in three of the first four states that kick off the nominating process.

Senator Cory Booker said he would decide about running for president over the holidays. But as he blitzed through New Hampshire last Saturday, he sounded less like a candidate in an early audition than one finishing off a dress rehearsal.

Tensions continue to rise at the border

A White House official said on Friday that the Trump administration was not responsible for the death of a 7-year-old Guatemalan girl who died from dehydration last week while in the custody of the Border Patrol. Her death, which is under investigation, has been widely condemned as a consequence of the Trump administration's staunch immigration enforcement efforts.

Despite efforts by the Trump administration to limit the number of refugees entering the United States, the number of asylum seekers jumped nearly 70 percent from 2017, according to Department of Homeland Security data released on Monday. Nearly 60 percent of all foreigners asking for asylum were people in families.

Even as parts of the president's hard-line immigration agenda have been blocked by Congress and the courts, government data released on Friday revealed that Immigration and Customs Enforcement saw an increase of 11 percent in arrests and deportations of foreigners from the previous fiscal year.

The president has prioritized border security and protecting American jobs, but The Times reported last week that his New Jersey golf course employed an undocumented immigrant as a housekeeper. He's not the only public official who has experienced similar revelations.

State legislatures battle to retain power

Earlier this week, the North Carolina legislature approved a bill that would require new primaries if the state elections board called for a new vote in an election. The measure opens the door for Republicans to consider backing a new candidate in the disputed race in the Ninth Congressional District.

Republicans in Wisconsin and Michigan presented bills last week that would restrict the powers of incoming Democratic governors out of fear of losing the gerrymandered districts they depend on for a trove of seats. In Wisconsin, the outgoing Republican governor, Scott Walker, approved measures Republican lawmakers rushed through in a hastily-called session last week that diminish the power of his Democratic successor.

In New Jersey, Democratic lawmakers are carrying out a power grab in an unusually public fashion: They are seeking to make Republicans a permanent minority by essentially writing gerrymandering into the State Constitution.

The White House was busy this week

In an extraordinary public altercation on Tuesday with the Democratic congressional leaders Senator Chuck Schumer and Representative Nancy Pelosi, President Trump said that he would be ""proud to shut down the government for border security.""

Following a week of speculation, the president announced on Friday that he has selected Mick Mulvaney, his budget director, to serve as his acting chief of staff. The announcement comes after Nick B. Ayers, the vice president's chief of staff, declined the position and said he was leaving the administration on Sunday, and Chris Christie, former governor of New Jersey, took himself out of the running for the job.

Mr. Trump directed federal agencies on Wednesday to steer spending toward certain distressed communities across the country -- part of his administration's push to turn a tax break included in last year's $1.5 trillion tax package into a broader effort to combat poverty and geographic inequality.

When the Trump administration laid out a plan this year that would eventually allow cars to emit more pollution, automakers were the obvious winners. But the hidden beneficiary is the United States oil industry.

81,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/09/opinion/melting-snowballs-and-the-winter-of-debt.html,"The policy obsession that took over Washington now looks even worse

Do you remember the winter of debt?

In late 2010 and early 2011, the U.S. economy had barely begun to recover from the 2008 financial crisis. Around 9 percent of the labor force was still unemployed; long-term unemployment was especially severe, with more than 6 million Americans having been out of work for 6 months or more. You might have expected the continuing employment crisis to be the focus of most economic policy discussion.

But no: Washington was obsessed with debt. The Simpson-Bowles report was the talk of the town. Paul Ryan's impassioned (and, of course, hypocritical) denunciations of federal debt won him media adulation and awards. And between the capital's debt obsession, the Republican takeover of the House, and a hard right turn in state governments, America was about to embark on a period of cutbacks in government spending unprecedented in the face of high unemployment.

Some of us protested bitterly against this policy turn, arguing that a period of mass unemployment was no time for fiscal austerity. And we were mostly right. Why only ""mostly""? Because it's becoming increasingly doubtful whether there's any right time for fiscal austerity. The obsession with debt is looking foolish even at full employment.

That's the message I take from Olivier Blanchard's presidential address to the American Economic Association. To be fair, Blanchard - one of the world's leading macroeconomists, formerly the extremely influential chief economist of the IMF -- was cautious in his pronouncements, and certainly didn't go all MMT and say that debt never matters. But his analysis nonetheless makes the Fix the Debt fixation (yes, they're still out there) look even worse than before.

Blanchard starts with the commonplace observation that interest rates on government debt are quite low, which in itself means that worries about debt are overblown. But he makes a more specific point: the average interest rate on debt is less than the economy's growth rate (""r<g""). Moreover, this isn't a temporary aberration: interest rates less than growth are actually the norm, broken only for a relatively short stretch in the 1980s.

Why does this matter? There are actually two separate but related implications of low interest rates. First, fears of a runaway spiral of rising debt are based on a myth. Second, raising private investment shouldn't be a huge priority.

On the first point: Diatribes about debt often come with ominous warnings that debt may snowball over time. That is, high debt will mean high interest payments, which drive up deficits, leading to even more debt, which leads to even higher interest rates, and so on.

But what matters for government solvency isn't the absolute level of debt but its level relative to the tax base, which in turn basically corresponds to the size of the economy. And the dollar value of GDP normally grows over time, due to both growth and inflation. Other things equal, this gradually melts the snowball: even if debt is rising in dollar terms, it will shrink as a percentage of GDP if deficits aren't too large.

The classic example is what happened to U.S. debt from World War II. When and how did we pay it off? The answer is that we never did. Yet as Figure 1, shows, despite rising dollar debt, by 1970 growth and inflation had reduced the debt to an easily handled share of GDP.

And if interest rates are less than GDP growth, this effect means that debt tends to melt away of its own accord: a high debt level means higher interest payments, but it also means more melting, and the latter effect predominates. A self-reinforcing debt spiral just doesn't happen.

Blanchard's second point is subtler but still important. In general, debt scolds warn not just about threats to government solvency but about growth. The claim is that high public debt feeds current consumption at the expense of investment for the future. And high debt does indeed probably have that effect when the economy is near full employment (although in 2010-2011 more deficit spending would have led to more, not less, private investment.)

But how important is it to suppress consumption to free up resources for investment? What Blanchard points out is that low interest rates are an indication that the private sector sees fairly low returns on investment, so that diverting more resources to private investment won't make that much difference to growth. True, the rate of return on investment is surely higher than the interest rate on safe assets like U.S. Treasuries. But Blanchard makes the case that it's not as much higher as many seem to think.

Does this mean that we should eat, drink, be merry, and forget about the future? No - but private investment isn't the big issue, since it probably doesn't have a very high rate of return. Blanchard doesn't say this, but what we should probably be worrying about instead is public investment in infrastructure, which has been neglected and suffers from obvious deficiencies.

Yet the debt obsession led to less, not more, public investment. Figure 2 shows public construction spending as a percentage of GDP. It rose briefly during the Obama stimulus (partly because GDP was down), then plunged to historically low levels, where it has stayed. For all the talk about taking care of future generations, debt scolds have almost surely hurt, not helped, our future prospects.

Notice, by the way, that I haven't even talked about business-cycle-related reasons to stop obsessing over debt. An environment of persistently low interest rates raises concerns about secular stagnation - a tendency to suffer repeated intractable slumps, because the Fed doesn't have enough ammunition to fight them. And such slumps may reduce long-term growth as well: the experience since 2008 suggests a high degree of hysteresis, in which seemingly short-run downturns end up reducing long-run economic potential.

But even without these concerns, debt looks like a hugely overblown issue, and the way debt displaced unemployment at the heart of public debate in 2010-2011 just keeps looking worse.

82,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/19/business/media/buzzfeed-dossier-lawsuit-trump-steele-russia.html,"A federal judge ruled in favor of BuzzFeed on Wednesday, bringing to a close a defamation lawsuit filed by a Russian technology executive over the website's publication of a dossier containing unverified reports of connections between Donald J. Trump's presidential campaign and the Russian government.

In her ruling, Judge Ursula Ungaro of the United States District Court in Miami, said that BuzzFeed was protected in its publication of the dossier by the fair report privilege, which gives news organizations latitude in reporting on official government proceedings.

""We are thrilled by today's outcome, and thank Judge Ungaro for taking the time to consider this case on the merits,"" Ben Smith, the editor in chief of BuzzFeed News, said in a statement.

The suit was filed by Aleksej Gubarev, the head of XBT, a company based in Luxembourg, and Webzilla, a Florida tech company. Mr. Gubarev and his companies were named toward the end of the dossier, which was compiled by the former British intelligence officer Christopher Steele during the 2016 campaign at the behest of Mr. Trump's political rivals.

""First and foremost, nothing in today's ruling by the court suggests in any way that the allegations concerning Mr. Gubarev, Webzilla, or XBT Holding were true,"" Mr. Gubarev's lead lawyer, Val Gurvits of Boston Law Group, said in a statement. ""Instead, the court ruled on a narrow legal issue, finding that BuzzFeed had a privilege to publish the information even if it was false.""

Days before BuzzFeed's posting of the 35-page document on Jan. 10, 2017, United States intelligence directors briefed President Barack Obama and the president-elect on the dossier. Those briefings constituted what the law calls ""official proceedings,"" providing BuzzFeed with legal protection to publish the dossier as part of an article headlined ""These Reports Allege Trump Has Deep Ties to Russia.""

Mr. Gubarev, a resident of Cyprus, claimed that BuzzFeed had acted recklessly in publishing the dossier, which alleged in its final section that Mr. Gubarev and his company were involved in hacking the Democratic Party.

He filed suit last February, arguing in his complaint that BuzzFeed's decision to publish the dossier was ""perhaps one of the most reckless and irresponsible moments in modern 'journalism.'"" Soon after Mr. Gubarev took legal action, BuzzFeed blacked out his name and those of his companies from the dossier as it appeared on the site.

In her decision, the judge noted that the BuzzFeed article on the dossier included the disclaimer that it included ""specific, unverified, and potentially unverifiable allegations.""

After the ruling, Mr. Gubarev's lawyers told BuzzFeed News that they planned to appeal.

""When we started this case, we knew that it would be a marathon and not a sprint,"" Mr. Gurvits said in his statement. ""We remain convinced that, after appeal, this matter will be presented to a jury and that we will succeed in vindicating the plaintiffs' good names.""

Mr. Smith, the editor, posted a statement on Twitter in praise of the decision: ""As Judge Ungaro affirmed in her ruling, a key principle underlying the First Amendment is that the public has a right to know about actions taken by its government. As we have said from the start, a document that had been circulating at the highest levels of government, under active investigation by the F.B.I., and briefed to two successive presidents, is clearly the subject of 'official action.' Moreover, its publication has contributed to the American people's understanding of what is happening in their country and their government.""

Days before the inauguration of Mr. Trump, BuzzFeed was alone in making the dossier public. A debate raged among journalists and politicians over the ethics of its decision to publish. NBC's Chuck Todd, for one, said on air that BuzzFeed had ""published fake news."" Although a number of news outlets, including The New York Times, had received the report, they decided not to publish the document, because they could not corroborate its contents.

Mr. Smith was staunch in the belief that he was acting in the public good. ""Without the dossier, Americans would have found it difficult to understand the actions of their elected representatives and government officials,"" he wrote in an Op-Ed for The New York Times. The dossier is still live on BuzzFeed.

Mr. Gubarev filed the suit in Broward County, Fla. The case was later transferred to the United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida at BuzzFeed's request. BuzzFeed was represented by Davis Wright Tremaine and Roy Black.

Mr. Trump condemned the fact that the dossier had been made widely available. ""Are we living in Nazi Germany?"" he said on Twitter the day after it was posted. And in a news conference, he called the BuzzFeed a ""failing pile of garbage."""
83,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/09/opinion/jorge-ramos-trump-wall.html,"Mr. Ramos is an anchor for the Univision network and the author of ""Stranger: The Challenge of a Latino Immigrant in the Trump Era.""

Donald Trump wants more than a wall.

The president, once again, has created his own reality, manufactured a crisis, invented an invasion, criminalized immigrants, made up facts and, in a nationally televised speech on Tuesday, argued for a new wall at the United States-Mexico border. ""How much more American blood must we shed before Congress does its job?"" he asked from the White House.

Mr. Trump is not the first president to ask for money for a wall. George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush built fences and walls along the southern border. Barack Obama maintained the resulting system of roughly 700 miles of physical barriers. So why don't we want Mr. Trump to build his wall? What is different?

The difference is that Mr. Trump's wall is a symbol of hate and racism, it would be completely useless, and it does not address any national emergency.

The $5.7 billion requested by the Trump administration to build 234 more miles of walls and fences would be an enormous waste of time and money. Beginning with the first, 14-mile stretch of border fencing, built between San Diego and Tijuana in the early 1990s, undocumented immigrants have shown they can adapt very fast and move to areas with no border barriers. Deserts in Arizona and open areas along the Rio Grande in Texas are now a favorite point of entry. The same thing would happen with a new Trump wall.

We also know that almost half of all undocumented immigrants arrive by plane or with a visa. They come legally as tourists or visitors and simply overstay their visas. The tallest fence cannot stop that.

Nor would a new wall prevent the flow of illegal drugs entering the country, as Mr. Trump claimed in his speech. Most drug seizures happen at ports of entry. And as long as we have more than 28 million Americans regularly using illegal drugs, we will have drug dealers in Mexico and the rest of Latin America moving their products to the most profitable market in the world.

The White House claims that 4,000 suspected terrorists were arrested along the southern border last year. That is simply wrong: A vast majority were detained at airports. Just six were actually caught crossing illegally by foot.

I have recently traveled to the border in California and Texas, and I can report that contrary to what the president said in his speech, there is no invasion. The undocumented population has not grown in a decade; in fact it has fallen to 10.7 million. And despite the presence of violent drug cartels on the Mexican side, the American border towns are among the safest in the country.

What is undeniable is the humanitarian crisis in Tijuana. But it is a crisis created in part by Mr. Trump. Record numbers of desperate families, fleeing violence, corruption and extreme poverty, have been arriving in caravans to our southern border. Instead of their asylum requests being promptly processed, as established by international and United States laws, only a few are allowed in every day. This policy of cruelty by design has unjustly affected children and the most vulnerable people in our hemisphere. These refugees certainly do not pose a danger to our national security.

There is no need for a new wall -- except, of course, in Mr. Trump's mind. The closest he got to building his wall was in January 2018, when Democratic senators negotiated a compromise for a wall in exchange for legislation on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. Then the White House unexpectedly walked away from the deal.

Would the Democrats revisit the offer? Luis Gutierrez, who recently retired from the House of Representatives after 26 years, once explained to me that it was like paying a ransom for a kidnapping. If the White House brings up the deal this time, it will put the Democrats in a moral dilemma: Protect the Dreamers -- maybe including siblings and families -- and, in the process, open the government. But the wall would be an essential element of any new deal.

It won't be easy. It is no longer 2018. Things have changed dramatically. Democrats control the House and the wall has become toxic. And then, there is the racist thing.

The wall has become a metaphor to Mr. Trump and his millions of supporters. It represents a divide between ""us"" and ""them,"" a physical demarcation for those who refuse to accept that this will be, in just a few decades, a majority of the country will be people of color.

This is about more than just a wall. Mr. Trump promised it in 2015, in the same speech in which he announced his candidacy, the same speech in which he called Mexican immigrants rapists, criminals and drug traffickers. His goal was to exploit the anxiety and resentment of voters in an increasingly multicultural, multiethnic society. Mr. Trump's wall is a symbol for those who want to make America white again.

The chant ""Build that wall, build that wall"" became his hymn -- and an insult not just to Latinos but also to all people who do not share his xenophobic ideals. The wall went from a campaign promise to a monument built on bigoted ideas. That is why most Americans cannot say yes to it. Every country has a right to protect its borders. But not to a wall that represents hate, discrimination and fear.

No, Mexico will not pay for the wall. And it seems Congress won't either. But the concept of America as an unwelcoming country to immigrants and uncomfortable for minorities is already here.

In a way, Mr. Trump already got what he wanted. He is the wall.

A Briefcase for Robert Mueller

While the results of his investigation will be explosive no matter his findings, the special counsel, Robert Mueller, has managed to remain, against all odds, remarkably under the radar since he began the Russia probe last year -- and the same is true of his wardrobe, which has been lauded for both in its unfaltering formality (his jacket's single button is always done up) and its subtlety (no crazily patterned ties in sight). His dependably well-tailored navy suits and white shirts even persuaded The New Yorker to call him a style icon last spring. A stealthy but stylish briefcase, to carry his many, many papers feels fitting. This Valextra version features details that only a connoisseur will recognize -- rich chestnut-colored cross-grain leather, a secret pocket or two and an absence of any telltale logos.

In the penultimate scene of the film ""Crazy Rich Asians"" -- the first blockbuster with a primarily Asian-American cast since ""The Joy Luck Club"" in 1993 -- the movie's American heroine Rachel Chu (Constance Wu) beats her steely potential mother-in-law, Eleanor Sung-Young (Michelle Yeoh), at her own game: mah-jongg.

This Hermès mah-jongg set seems an appropriate thank-you gift for this handing over of the family jewels.

A Singular Suitcase for Michelle Obama

The former first lady's book ""Becoming"" -- with its personal admissions, unfiltered opinions and honest accounts about making toast -- is one thing. The ""Becoming"" book tour, with its four-figure tickets, sold-out arenas, celebrity friends (Oprah Winfrey, Tracee Ellis Ross, Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie) and stadiums full of fans seeking hints of a 2020 presidential bid, is entirely another. When the standing ovations end each night, what will Obama wheel to her hotel suite? How about something sleek, modern and monogrammed?

An Italian Delicacy for Michael Kors

They share a love of leopard print, blackout sunglasses and building mega-brands. But when Michael Kors purchased Versace from its founding family for over $2.1 billion in September, how much of an Italian lesson did he really get? Sure, he may be familiar with Versace's archives, but what about the local cuisine? Kors can quickly get up to speed by tasting the sweetly spiced and lard-covered Prosciutto di Carpegna, made from pigs raised in the northern and eastern parts of the country, not far from Milan. Each ham takes some 20 months to produce, and the soft, silky slices are newly available in the United States.

The Scent of Pencils for Elena Ferrante

Few authors have written more eloquently and wrenchingly about female friendship than Elena Ferrante. Now that the first four of her Neapolitan Novels have been turned into the HBO mini-series ""My Brilliant Friend"" -- with the promise of more installments to come -- we will once again be plunged into the world of Elena and Lila. While much about Ferrante remains a mystery, any writer would surely appreciate this tongue-in-cheek fragrance diffuser by Anya Hindmarch, which contains ceramic reed ""pencils"" that soak up a lightly woody scent to perfume the air around it.

The World (in Miniature) for Colin Kaepernick

The effects of the quarterback Colin Kaepernick's decision to kneel during the national anthem in 2016 have rippled through the country and beyond, sparking a much-needed debate about both the N.F.L. and our nation at large. This year, Kaepernick was awarded Amnesty International's Ambassador of Conscience Award and Harvard's W.E.B. Du Bois Medal as he continues work on his Know Your Rights campaign. He likely already has access to free Nikes from here to eternity -- he starred in the brand's 30th-anniversary campaign for Just Do It -- but for a man who has the weight of the world on his shoulders, a minimalist globe gives an appreciative nod in his direction.

A Punching Bag for Hannah Gadsby

In ""Nanette,"" the breakout special by the Tasmanian comedian Hannah Gadsby, she admits just how vehemently she dislikes -- in fact, truly hates -- Pablo Picasso. This bit serves as the crescendo of her wider takedown of the masochism and misogyny she sees embodied in many revered Modern artists. While her set is a serious commentary on the biases of art history, it is also deeply, darkly funny. A work by the artist Zoë Buckman, who often explores the pain and ecstasy of the feminine experience -- through pieces including boxing gloves adorned with old wedding dresses and intricate punching bags accented with French tea towels -- feels like an appropriate, and potentially useful, gift.

An Oscar Dress for Lady Gaga

The 2018 awards season, in light of the #MeToo movement, was appropriately subdued. But knowing that Lady Gaga will make the rounds next year, and probably receive multiple nominations for ""A Star is Born,"" it seems likely that the 2019 season will bring with it a renewed sense of theatricality. But what will Gaga wear to the Oscars? Her ensembles as of late have telegraphed power and purpose -- see the oversize Marc Jacobs suit she wore at the Elle Women in Hollywood ceremony in October -- and this one-shouldered bronze gown feels fittingly regal.

A Helpful Gadget for Elon Musk

Last month, Elon Musk's private rocket company, SpaceX, received approval from the F.C.C. to send over 7,500 satellites into space, with the intent to create a global wireless internet network. This follows a year of controversy for Musk: There was the storm he stirred up with his comments about the rescue of the Thai soccer team in July, and then in August, the tweet that later forced him to publicly step down as the chairman of Tesla (he is still C.E.O.). This Molekule air purifier, which uses both filters and light to break apart pollutants instead of simply capturing them, would be a worthy accessory to help him clear the air, so to speak -- for as long as he's still based on Earth, that is.

Futuristic Frames for Kerby Jean-Raymond

In November, Kerby Jean-Raymond, the designer behind the New York-based label Pyer Moss, won the CFDA/Vogue Fashion Fund prize -- an award that recognized his unique ability to presciently capture the zeitgeist and comment on the state of black culture with his radically joyful collections. His shows touch on not only the present day (the Black Lives Matter movement) but also the past -- his recent spring 2019 show, for example, referenced the ""Green Book"" of Jim Crow America while also envisioning a world free from a constant veil of racism. For the man who has smartly mined the past and present, and has hopefully given us a glimpse of the future, a pair of glasses to help see it all clearly.

85,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/09/world/americas/guatemala-corruption.html,"MEXICO CITY -- Almost a dozen years ago, a panel of international prosecutors backed by the United Nations arrived in Guatemala. Their goal: to team up with the Guatemalan attorney general's office, strengthen the rule of law and combat the criminal networks that had taken hold after the country emerged from more than three decades of civil war.

It was a bold experiment in outsourcing justice, but given Guatemala's fragile democracy, its weak institutions and the extent of corruption in the country, the government was prepared to cede sovereignty.

Since the International Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala began its work in 2007, it has peeled back layers of corruption, helped strengthen the courts and professionalized the attorney general's office, winning the approval of the Guatemalan people and sending powerful politicians, leaders of organized crime and businessmen to jail.

But when a 2017 inquiry into illegal campaign financing focused on President Jimmy Morales directly, he began to stifle the work of the commission, known as Cicig, according its Spanish initials.

This week, Mr. Morales attempted to shut Cicig down entirely by breaking the agreement with United Nations -- a decision reversed by the country's highest court on Wednesday.

Mr. Morales has defied the court in the past. If he does so this time, Mr. Morales would plunge the country into a constitutional crisis.

Here are some key questions about what this could mean for the country.

Why is the anti-corruption panel so important?

Since the commission began its work, its cases have shown how private groups have hijacked many of the state's functions to enrich themselves.

The corruption schemes cut a wide swath across the government, tainting legislators, judges, and municipal officials, and infiltrating Guatemala's customs agency, its main public health care provider, a major port, its passport office and the communications ministry.

But the commission's contribution toward strengthening the rule of law in Guatemala goes beyond disrupting these schemes and jailing corrupt politicians and their allies.

Guatemala is a vastly unequal country where half the children are malnourished and rural areas are neglected. The country needs effective government agencies to deal with those problems, but corruption saps the state's ability to improve people's well-being.

More broadly, Cicig's work in Guatemala has been a powerful example of a successful anti-corruption battle in Latin America, where citizens have increasingly expressed revulsion against entrenched graft and impunity.

What led to the crisis this week?

Under the leadership of Iván Velásquez, a Colombian prosecutor who arrived in 2013, Cicig has worked closely with two attorneys general.

In 2015, it exposed a customs fraud scheme led by the president, Otto Pérez Molina, who was forced to resign after months of street protests. Disgust with the political class led to the election that year of Mr. Morales, a former television comedian who ran as an outsider on the slogan ""not corrupt, nor a thief.""

At first, Mr. Morales allied himself with the anti-corruption movement, promising to work with Cicig and appointing a cabinet of young reformers.

But that changed after Cicig charged Mr. Morales's brother and son in a fraud scheme. And once Cicig accused Mr. Morales himself -- along with some of Guatemala's most powerful business people -- of campaign finance violations, the president tried to stifle its ability to work. He removed some of its police investigators, forced Mr. Velásquez out of the country, refused to renew the visas of some prosecutors and announced that the commission's mandate would not be renewed when it expires this September.

Because of the agreement with the United Nations, though, the Guatemalan government did not expel Cicig.

That changed this week, when the government declared on Monday that it was withdrawing from the agreement and gave Cicig's international staff 24 hours to leave the country. In response, the country's highest court on constitutional matters threw out the government's decision.

Why did the government act now?

Elections. The country votes for a new president and congress in June. Although Mr. Morales is ineligible for re-election, he and his allies will oppose any candidate who supports Cicig and the continuation of its investigations into government corruption. Mr. Morales will lose immunity once he steps down from office.

With Cicig out of the picture, the government may find it easier to pressure electoral authorities not to allow presidential candidates who can cause trouble for it -- such as Thelma Aldana, the former attorney general who worked with Mr. Velásquez to bring the highest profile prosecutions.

What is the United States' role in this?

Washington has been the commission's main source of funding, along with Canada and European countries. The Obama administration was a strong supporter of Cicig, seeing its role in strengthening the rule of law in the region as central to American interests, among them stemming the flow of migrants and drugs from Central America.

That support has cooled under the Trump administration, which has been lobbied heavily by the Morales government.

On Tuesday, the United States Embassy in Guatemala City came out in support of Cicig.

""The U.S. government is concerned about the future of anti-corruption efforts in Guatemala,"" the statement said. ""Rule of law, reduced corruption and an end to impunity are key to security, stability, and prosperity, not only in Guatemala, but throughout the region.""

What happens next?

It is unclear. If the Guatemalan government perceives that it can continue to defy the court, then it will block the return of Cicig's international staff, who have left the country for their safety. Without Cicig's prosecutors, the attorney general's office may struggle to try the cases it has built with the commission.

Allies of Mr. Morales in the Guatemalan Congress and the courts are maneuvering to remove three of the constitutional court's five magistrates. If that effort is successful, then the last formal check on the government's power will be lifted.

That leaves only the international community, including the United States, and Guatemalans themselves to pressure the government to uphold the rule of law."
86,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/10/world/asia/afghanistan-air-force.html,"MOGHKHAIL, Afghanistan -- The A-29 attack plane was a white speck in the bright skies over eastern Afghanistan as it launched a dummy bomb that exploded just yards from the target, a wrecked truck. ""Spot on!"" said an American adviser watching the exercise.

The plane's Afghan pilot had been guided by an Afghan coordinator on the ground -- but only after previous bombing runs had struck well wide of the truck.

Eleven years after the United States began building an air force for Afghanistan at a cost now nearing $8 billion, it remains a frustrating work in progress, with no end in sight. Some aviation experts say the Afghans will rely on American maintenance and other support for years.

Such dependence could complicate President Trump's moves to extricate the United States from the 17-year-old war against Taliban insurgents -- a war in which they lately appear to be gaining ground.

""It would be a home run if we got to 60 to 65 percent"" self-sufficiency for the Afghan Air Force, said retired Air Force Brig. Gen. John E. Michel, who commanded the air training mission in 2013 and 2014. ""You have to have a realistic view of how hard this is.""

For years beginning with the Obama administration, part of the American exit strategy has been to build and train the Afghan military -- including the air force -- to fight the insurgents on its own.

That strategy appeared to be undermined in December when Mr. Trump was said to have ordered preparations for half the 14,000 American troops in Afghanistan to come home.

At the same time, American military officials have been warning that the Afghans remain dangerously unprepared.

""If we left precipitously right now, I do not believe they would be able to successfully defend their country,"" Marine Lt. Gen. Kenneth McKenzie Jr., nominated to lead the United States Central Command, told Congress last month.

Today, American-led coalition aircraft carry out roughly five times as many airstrike missions as the Afghan Air Force -- more than 6,500 last year alone. When insurgents overrun outposts or districts, it typically takes American warplanes and American-trained commando units to drive them back.

Airstrikes from Afghan aircraft have killed civilians at a disproportionately higher rate than American ones.

""The Afghan Air Force, while it is improving, has not in any sense offset the need for more and more U.S. air presence, and that's a little discouraging,"" said Anthony H. Cordesman, a security analyst with the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington.

""There is no plan to create an Afghan Air Force as yet that could replace the role of the U.S. air component,"" he said.

By any measure, the Afghan Air Force is far more capable than the deteriorating, 20-aircraft force of 2007. About 265 American-trained Afghan pilots now fly 118 aircraft supplied by the United States, American trainers said. The fleet is projected to double by 2023. A separate Special Mission Wing flies special operations missions.

Last month, Afghan pilots flew their first night attack missions. In June, they conducted their first combat airdrop. In March, the air force fired its first laser-guided bomb in combat, with 600 more fired since.

Afghan aircraft now regularly ferry troops and supplies and provide close air support. They also help evacuate casualties.

But in interviews, United States Air Force commanders declined to predict when Afghans would fly with only minimal American support. They cited the unpredictability of building a modern air force in an undeveloped country consumed by war.

A recent aviation journal article described the training mission as ""building an aircraft in flight while it's getting shot at.""

A report last year by the Defense Department's inspector general, while citing improvements, said American commanders could not effectively track Afghan progress because ""they have not defined the intended end state"" of the air program.

Brig. Gen. Joel Carey, who commands a NATO-led training mission for Afghanistan, said he was focused on ""taking bite-sized chunks and consolidating gains.""

One goal is to reduce reliance on American-led airstrikes. But those airstrikes rose by roughly 40 percent last year to help counter a Taliban offensive that some Afghan officials estimated had inflicted more than 30 deaths a day on Afghan forces in recent months.

When Taliban fighters overran much of the city of Ghazni in August, it took American-led coalition warplanes and American-trained Afghan commando units to reclaim the strategic city, with support from Afghan aircraft.

Maj. Gen. Barre R. Seguin, a senior United States Air Force commander in Afghanistan, said the number of Afghan airstrikes would grow as the American government supplied more aircraft. Lt. Col. Koné Faulkner, a Pentagon spokesman, said the Afghan share of overall strikes had increased in the past two years.

But Afghan ground commanders complain that calls for Afghan air support often go unheeded. In August, an Afghan military base in the northern province of Faryab was overrun by Taliban fighters after commanders had begged in vain for air support and helicopter resupply.

""They kept saying: 'We'll be there in an hour,'"" said First Lt. Mohammad Reza. ""But they betrayed us and never came.""

Lt. Gen. Mohammad Shoaib, the Afghan Air Force commander, said the force was not yet big enough to cover the entire country in the face of persistent Taliban attacks.

Discussing a recent mission failure, he cited the time needed to plan missions and identify targets, as well as delays caused by bad weather, difficult terrain, communications problems and concerns about civilian casualties.

""Afghanistan is a war zone,"" General Shoaib said. ""It's a challenge.""

American trainers have built an Afghan Army that relies heavily on air power that the air force might not be able to provide for years, said John F. Sopko, the special inspector general for Afghan reconstruction.

""The Afghan Air Force doesn't have the assets and capabilities yet to meet all operational requirements nationwide,"" he said.

Another concern is civilian casualties. In July, the United Nations said the Afghan Air Force had been responsible for 52 percent of civilian casualties caused by airstrikes in the first half of 2018, despite having conducted far fewer strikes than coalition aircraft. The United Nations also said insurgents had been responsible for two-thirds of all civilian casualties.

General Shoaib and General Carey said American and Afghan aircrews followed strict procedures to limit civilian casualties, with pilots often pulling away from confirmed enemy targets for fear of hitting civilians.

But Patricia Gossman, a senior Afghanistan researcher for Human Rights Watch, said the Afghan and United States militaries did not always conduct adequate civilian casualty investigations, making it difficult to correct mistakes.

Some decisions on aircraft choices also have been faulted. Aviation experts have criticized a decision to phase out the old workhorses of the Afghan forces -- Russian-made Mi-17 helicopters -- for American-made UH-60 Black Hawks.

Mr. Michel, the retired general, said the Mi-17 was ""the perfect helicopter"" for Afghanistan because it can carry more troops and supplies than the Black Hawk and is less complicated to fly.

""Let's be candid,"" he said of the switch. ""That was largely done for political reasons.""

American commanders said obtaining spare parts for the aging, Russian-made copters was difficult. Of the 47 Mi-17s assigned to the Afghans, only 20 are operational.

Mi-17s flew half the fleet's 28,000 sorties last year, but the first Black Hawk did not fly until May. The plan to provide 81 Black Hawks will not be complete until 2030, Mr. Sopko said.

Maj. Salim Faqiri, who has flown both aircraft, said that the Russian helicopter was more powerful but that the Black Hawk was more maneuverable and performed better in dusty landing zones.

The United States has supplied Afghanistan with three types each of helicopters and propeller planes. Afghans have been trained to maintain and repair aircraft, and to assemble and load munitions. In many cases, Afghans are now training fellow Afghans.

""They can do a lot on their own -- the normal stuff,"" said Air Force Lt. Col. Sam McIntyre. ""We're trying to push them to the next level.""

Another adviser, Air Force Col. Chris Goodyear, said that, realistically, ""We have to go at the pace the Afghans are capable of carrying things.""

But even as the training mission shows progress, it has been dogged with problems.

In 2013, the Pentagon abandoned a $486 million fleet of 20 G-222 medium-lift cargo planes provided to the Afghans, selling 16 planes for scrap metal at 6 cents a pound.

Last spring, the Pentagon said that more than 150 Afghans sent to the United States for training -- including air trainees -- had gone absent without leave.

At least eight Afghan military helicopters crashed last year, according to a tally by The New York Times. Asked about Taliban claims that the choppers were shot down, General Carey said the crashes were under investigation.

Although Afghan and American commanders say they have tried to crack down on corruption, the use of air force aircraft as personal taxis by Afghan political bigwigs remains a problem. American commanders say theft of aviation fuel delivered by Afghan contractors is another.

General Shoaib predicted that the air force would be self-sufficient -- except for maintenance -- in three or four years. Some military analysts are less optimistic.

Bill Roggio, who edits the Long War Journal, said the Afghan Army would not need an air force if it could take and hold ground. Since 2017, Taliban insurgents have held more Afghan territory than at any time since the American invasion in 2001.

""The Taliban doesn't have an air force,"" Mr. Roggio said. ""They do quite well without it."""
87,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/10/theater/candide-sound-of-music-hair.html,"BERLIN -- Leonard Bernstein called his ""Candide"" an American valentine to Europe. That Voltaire-inspired romp, which premiered on Broadway in 1956, is one of several classic American musicals unfurling on German-speaking stages this season.

Wait. Did I say ""musical""?

The jury is still out on how to classify Bernstein's ""Candide."" The composer himself, who kept revising the work until 1989, hoped that ""Candide"" might turn out to be an entirely new musical form altogether. For the director Barrie Kosky, who leads the Komische Oper Berlin, the peculiar mixture of opera, operetta and musical that is ""Candide"" adds up to the novel genre of ""existential vaudeville,"" according to an interview in the playbill.

Productions of ""Candide"" tend to be heavy on powdered wigs and painted backdrops. With one outrageous exception -- a hairpiece the size of a Buick appears briefly -- the Berlin staging dispenses with foppish frivolities in favor of something far darker and closer to the spirit of Voltaire's original.

The Komische Oper has a long history of presenting musicals and operettas alongside operatic staples. In the past, Mr. Kosky has succeeded in freshening up repertory staples, working his sophisticated magic on ""West Side Story"" and ""Fiddler on the Roof."" However, as much as this ""Candide"" sparkles, it is also a production that takes its director -- and us, by extension -- to the brink.

An endless carousel of war, plague, inquisition, rape, earthquake and torture, ""Candide"" unfolds in a landscape of natural catastrophe and human carnage, as Voltaire's everyman tests the philosophical doctrine of optimism and conclusively decides that this is not the best of all possible worlds.

With Bernstein's magnificent, highly changeable music given a full-steam-ahead rendition by the house orchestra, led by the young Canadian conductor Jordan de Souza, the scenes tumble forth nightmarishly with a manic energy thanks to Otto Pichler's elaborate choreography. Yet despite the pessimism -- and possible nihilism -- that Mr. Kosky highlights, there is plenty of humor, and even pathos.

In the title role, Allan Clayton uses a bright, resilient voice to parry at the slings and arrows of fortune, while Nicole Chevalier's hard-nosed Cundegonde harbors few of her lover's illusions. Alongside these young singers, two stage veterans, Franz Hawlata and Anne Sofie von Otter, are winningly sardonic as Voltaire/Dr. Pangloss and the Old Lady.

The action in ""Candide"" jerks us from Europe to the New World and back, as the protagonists spend much of their time in exile. And while Mr. Kosky's production doesn't seem set in a particular epoch, the staging does contain references to current events, including the ongoing refugee crisis and the Islamophobic backlash it has produced in much of Europe. A Muslim couple clothed in rags and clutching plastic bags is brought before the Inquisition and executed. At the end of the first act, Candide undertakes his journey to Paraguay in a rubber dinghy on choppy seas. Such topicality can seem heavy-handed, but it bridges the gap between the ugly world that Voltaire satirized and our own.

A very different sort of Broadway musical set in Europe is ""The Sound of Music,"" from 1959, the world-famous blockbuster that vies with Mozart for being the most famous export of Salzburg, Austria.

""Sound of Music"" kitsch practically runs through the medieval alleyways of that alpine city. One place you won't find it, though, is on the stage of the Salzburger Landestheater, where the Rodgers and Hammerstein classic has been given a sober and elegant staging by the directors Andreas Gergen and Christian Struppeck.

I admit that my first glimpse of Maria sprawling on AstroTurf (""The hills are alive..."") briefly had me in stitches. But once the fake grass is rolled offstage, the production grows uncommonly serious and effective. The fluid, uncluttered staging, with sets and costumes by Court Watson, is blessedly free of the schlock that has accumulated on the musical like edelweiss over the past 60 years.

Hovering over the domestic drama of the von Trapps is the Nazi nightmare that will soon descend. The Third Reich is frequently invoked through brief newsreels of Hitler and a flash-forward to 1945. At the musical's climax, S.S. men descend into the auditorium and block the exits. It's a far cry from ""Springtime for Hitler.""

Aside from the cleareyed production, Milica Jovanovic's charismatic and mischievous Maria is the best reason to see this ""Sound of Music."" She channels Julie Andrews, especially while singing, yet also succeeds in making the role her own, in her subtly wry and sexy performance. Other standouts include Axel Meinhardt as the theater impresario Max Dettweiler and the no-nonsense Franziska Becker as Captain von Trapp's erstwhile fiancée, Elsa Schrader. As for the rigid paterfamilias, Uwe Kröger, a veteran to the role, delivered far more dramatically than vocally. The seven von Trapp children, several of whom will be switched out over the course of the run, were adorable without being cloying.

The Landestheater is a state-run cultural venue that encompasses dramatic and musical theater, opera and dance. Outside of Salzburg's storied, elite summertime festival, it's one-stop shopping for culture in the city of Mozart. Given the shrinking size of pit bands on Broadway, one of the main advantages of seeing musicals in a theater designed for opera is hearing the score performed by a full orchestra. The Mozarteumorchester Salzburg, led by Robin Davis, made Richard Rodgers's rapturous and infectious music sound fuller and grander than it probably has since the film version from 1965.

""The Sound of Music"" is as close to the quintessential Broadway musical as they come. Astoundingly, only eight years separate it from ""Hair,"" the ""tribal love rock musical"" that shattered all the rules in 1967. ""Hair"" is a centerpiece of the season at the Altes Schauspielhaus in Stuttgart, Germany.

In the late '60s, the musical broke new ground not only because it featured onstage nudity from a racially diverse cast, but also because it dispensed with plot almost entirely, introducing a bold style of a musical untethered from the traditional expository demands of theater. In our day, its influence can be seen -- for better or worse -- in the profusion of jukebox musicals, although none have ever topped Galt MacDermot's original score.

""Hair"" first arrived in Germany in 1968, and I wouldn't be surprised if many in the gray-haired audience in Stuttgart had seen it back then. Klaus Seiffert's lively production often feels like a nostalgia trip, complete with a tie-dyed set and psychedelic projections, despite references to both President Barack Obama and President Trump. One idea Mr. Seiffert suggests but never really develops is that we're watching as Berger, one of the show's main characters, relives his memories of the era as an aging hippie.

Luckily, the spirited musical performances (featuring an otherworldly theremin) save the production from sliding into sentimental tedium. The 14 actors who make up the ""tribe"" of hippies act, sing and dance with cohesion and vitality, even if the production as a whole often lacks spontaneity; it's really only during a reprise of ""Let the Sun Shine In"" during the curtain call that those in the large cast get to let their hair down.

Even so, the skilled performers ooze innocence, joy and exhilaration. As with the productions in Berlin and Salzburg, it felt as if Europe were sending America a valentine back."
88,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/10/opinion/pelosi-trump-lobbying-democrats.html,"Mr. Edsall contributes a weekly column from Washington, D.C. on politics, demographics and inequality.

Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the idealistic class of 64 Democratic House freshmen are armed with a reform agenda.

This includes H.R. 1, a 571-page bill that addresses voting rights, corruption, gerrymandering and campaign finance reform as well as the creation of a Select Committee on the Climate Crisis -- a first step toward a ""Green New Deal.""

Proponents of this ambitious project face a determined adversary, however -- the top ranks of the interest group establishment, skilled in co-opting liberal members of Congress and converting initiatives to square with the interests of corporate America.

The upper stratum of the Washington lobbying community often exercises de facto veto power over the legislative process, dominating congressional policymaking, funneling campaign money to both parties and offering lucrative employment to retiring and defeated members of the House and Senate.

Lobbyists exercise this power across the course of a member's career. ""Whoever is elected is immediately met with a growing lobbying onslaught by the same big players,"" write Lee Drutman, a senior fellow at New America, Matt Grossmann, a political scientist at Michigan State and Tim LaPira, a political scientist at James Madison University, who have contributed a chapter to ""Can America Govern Itself?"" a book edited by Francis Lee and Nolan McCarty that is coming out in June.

Within the federal lobbying community -- a $3.37 billion industry in 2017 -- Drutman, Grossmann and LaPira write

a limited number of organizations at the very top of the resource distribution have escalated their political investments in ways that increasingly distinguish them from the rest of the pack.

This population of groups at the top of the distribution is becoming increasingly stable over the last two decades. This group of top organizations -- which we call the top tier -- is positioning itself as a distinct class.

The authors argue that the first tier lobbying organizations

are analogous to the current generation of very wealthy families who now pay for every conceivable tutor so that their children can be advantaged in applying to elite prep schools and colleges, which are now more and more essential to getting ahead in our increasingly economically stratified society. In both circumstances, financial resources and social connections build up over time, reinforcing stratification. Money does not guarantee outcomes. But it helps reinforce inequalities by widening the gap between the very top and everyone else.

The ability of this elite constituency to meet politicians' demands for campaign contributions and other resources, the authors argue, has allowed Congress to ignore traditional ""populist concerns regarding dominant economic interests"" as members of the House and Senate ""continue their high-dollar fund-raisers and constant meetings with lobbyists.""

Despite his right-wing populist campaign and his September 2017 promise -- ""Our framework includes our explicit commitment that tax reform will protect low-income and middle-income households, not the wealthy and well-connected"" -- Trump supported and signed into law the $1.5 trillion Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. This extraordinarily regressive legislation decisively favors the rich and corporate interests.

As the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center has noted, as a result of the Trump tax bill higher income households will receive

larger average tax cuts as a percentage of after-tax income, with the largest cuts as a share of income going to taxpayers in the 95th to 99th percentiles of the income distribution. On average, in 2027 taxes would change little for lower- and middle-income groups.

The Trump administration's drive to deregulate workplace safety rules and to undermine unions also reflects the impact of the Washington lobbying elite.

By definition, lobbies at the highest rungs of the ladder spend more than those lower down, but ""the differences are staggering,"" Drutman and his colleagues write. The top 100 lobbying groups represent 0.89 percent of the 11,272 registered lobbies, but they ""consistently have at least one-third of the in-house lobbyists in Washington, and hire about one in five contract lobbyists from multi-client lobbying firms."" The way it plays out over time, according to Drutman, is that 90 to 95 percent of the top 100 associations and firms represent business interests, as opposed to labor, consumers, or environmentalists. The top 100 spent $1.047 billion in 2017, or a little less than a third of total lobbying dollars that year, according to data provided to The Times by the Center for Responsive Politics.

The upper ranks of the Washington lobbying community are most effective at blocking enactment of legislation, as opposed to winning approval of new laws. This is the very power -- the crucial power -- that prevents successful legislative initiatives from improving the lives of those in the bottom half of the income distribution.

Raymond La Raja and Brian Schaffner, political scientists at the University of Massachusetts and Tufts, in their 2015 book, ""Campaign Finance and Political Polarization: When Purists Prevail,"" argue that legislative inaction inherently benefits the affluent and hurts the less advantaged: ""A strong case has been made that policy gridlock exacerbates wealth inequality through a basic failure to adjust policies to new economic and demographic realities,"" they write, like globalization and automation, which have disproportionately penalized unskilled and semiskilled labor.

La Raja and Schaffner add that

Partisan polarization tends to exacerbate problems of economic inequality because political stalemate makes government less responsive to the needs of poorer citizens.

In 2017, the most recent year with complete data, the top 10 lobbying associations -- which include the United States Chamber of Commerce, the National Association of Realtors, the Business Roundtable and the Pharmaceutical Research & Manufacturers of America -- spent a total of $291.2 million on lobbying, according to Open Secrets.

In the simplest terms, the pattern of campaign contributions (calculated by Open Secrets) provides insight into the motives of the interest groups and corporations -- those represented by the major lobbying groups -- that are most concerned with shaping public policy.

In the 2017-18 election cycle, securities and investment firms gave a total of $60,566,716, split 53-46 percent between Democrats and Republicans; real estate gave $52,205,352 (51 to 48); accountants, $11,807,757, (46 to 51); the health industry, $159,255,037, (54.6 to 45); and lobbyists themselves contributed $25,828,243, (46 to 53).

The stakes of this competition are substantially higher than those involved in picking individual candidates because ultimately they determine entire classes of winners and losers.

Instead of building solidarity, study after study shows that as the gulf between rich and poor widens, voters become increasingly mean spirited and hostile to the welfare state, progressive taxation and regulations designed to protect consumers, workers and the environment.

""People who have experienced higher inequality during their lives are less in favor of redistribution,"" write Christopher Roth and Johannes Wohlfart, economists at the University of Warwick in Britain and Goethe University in Germany, in their November 2018 paper, ""Experienced Inequality and Preferences for Redistribution."" They are ""less likely to support left-wing parties and to consider the prevailing distribution of incomes to be unfair.""

In another essay from November 2018, ""Inequality and Participative Democracy. A Self‐Reinforcing Mechanism,"" Ioannis Theodossiou and Alexandros Zangelidis, economists at the University of Aberdeen in Scotland, describe the way income inequality leads to political apathy and back again:

Greater income inequality alienates and discourages people from engaging with common affairs, thus leading to lower political participation. Yet, lower electoral participation leads towards a less equitable distribution of income. Hence, this study reveals a self‐reinforcing mechanism where the unequal distribution of income leads to political exclusion, which in turn leads to more inequality.

In other words, increasing inequality undermines support for a progressive agenda -- the agenda most likely to improve the life chances and conditions of the least well off.

Steven Pearlstein, a columnist at the Washington Post, in his 2018 book ""Can American Capitalism Survive?"" describes this negative feedback loop succinctly:

As a society, we are now caught in one of those self-reinforcing, downward spirals in which the erosion of social capital, government dysfunction, rising inequality and slowing rates of economic growth are all feeding off each other, with more of one leading to more of all the others.

Pearlstein continues:

Income inequality and political polarization have become mutually reinforcing, creating the vicious circle that now manifests itself daily in the erosion of norms around civility and truth telling, the declining trust in political institutions, legislative gridlock and political dysfunction.

Unsurprisingly, such problems lead to ever more disquieting outcomes.

Anthony Chen, a sociologist at Northwestern, wrote by email:

Weakened opposition is one reason why business influence over political and regulatory decisions seems greater today than it did before.

In addition, Chen argued,

one of the big political advantages that business enjoys is that it is continually able to recruit good players and send them to play every game worth playing in the American political and legal system. And there are a lot of games worth playing. Those games might entail having key language inserted into a piece of legislation as it gets finalized by Congress, or sending a top-notch legal team to Federal District Court when a favorable way of interpreting a particular statutory provision is potentially at stake, or making sure that business views are amply reflected in the EPA's notice-and-comment rule-making process. And those are just some of the games that are being played at the federal level.

Still, the newly elected Democratic House majority does not enter the fray without some effective tools of its own. Perhaps most important is the changing source of campaign money.

Earlier this month, two reporters for The Times, Stephanie Saul and Rachel Shorey, reported that

Democratic candidates in the general election collected nearly $296 million in small donations, more than three times the $85 million collected by Republicans.

ActBlue, a liberal internet-based nonprofit fund-raising organization, told Saul and Shorey that

it helped raise $1.6 billion in the 2017-18 election cycle, including money it collects for interest groups and state candidates. The average donation was $39.67.

The growth of small donor contributions online has lessened the dependence of Democratic candidates on the network of Washington-based PACs and lobbyist-run fund-raisers. The question now, Walter Shapiro, a fellow at the Brennan Center, writes, is whether Democrats ""can withstand the inevitable pressure to adapt to business as usual in Washington by resisting the traditional advice to court big-money contributors.""

La Raja of warned in an email that

A potentially larger challenge in any Democratic effort to reduce inequality is that allied interest groups and individual donors -- as progressive as they are -- focus on issues that are not necessarily about reducing inequality for the poor and working class. Instead, the emphasis is often on social issues such as abortion and civil rights, or protecting the environment.

Jesse Rhodes, also a political scientist at the University of Massachusetts, questioned in an email whether Democratic donors support the goal of reducing economic inequality:

I think that, all things considered, there is probably more tension than alignment with this goal. To be sure, donors tend to be more ideological than non-donors, so donors to Democratic candidates and/or the Democratic Party are going to be fairly liberal on average. At the same time, donors, particularly significant donors, are likely to be fairly affluent, and therefore heavily invested in the status quo.

Democratic campaign contributors, Rhodes continued, would in all likelihood be

supportive of progressive policies that would reduce economic inequality at the margins -- e.g. shoring up Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, supporting increases in the minimum wage, and so forth -- but I'm skeptical that they would be enthusiastic about more dramatic policy proposals that would require large tax increases on high incomes.

The larger question in the wake of the 2018 elections is whether the forces that propelled Democrats into the majority in the House are powerful and persistent enough to force a shift from the rightward direction of policymaking that has held sway over a significant stretch of the past 40 years.

The 2018 election outcome demonstrated that the left has regained momentum and enthusiasm, but the interest group elite -- the prime movers of the regressive distribution of income described by Drutman, Grossmann and LaPira -- have demonstrated exceptional staying power.

""Business groups are simply more numerous and better resourced than any other type of interest group,"" Chen writes in ""In the Private Interest? Business Influence and American Democracy,"" which also appears as a chapter in ""Can America Govern Itself?""

Corporations and trade groups are far more likely than citizen groups to employ hired lobbyists and former government officials, and the average spending of corporations and trade groups on lobbying and campaign contributions routinely exceeds that of citizen groups by several multiples.

Especially in the case of the finance industry, Chen writes,

there is rapidly accumulating evidence that campaign contributions deliver a definite and non-trivial improvement in the probability of obtaining a favorable vote.

According to Bloomberg, three major business groups -- the United States Chamber of Commerce, the Business Roundtable and the National Association of Realtors -- invested over $50 million in lobbying to win passage of the trillion dollar Trump tax cut.

If newly ascendant Democrats are to have a chance in their struggle against the power brokers of the lobbying community, they will have to maintain and expand their current House majority and eventually win the Senate. Perhaps most important, the party must avoid the repetition of past flameouts.

Previous implosions include the elections of 1978 and 1980 that crushed the Democratic surge in the wake of Watergate and the 2010 Republican wave election that brought an abrupt halt to the idea that a new Democratic majority had dawned after President Barack Obama's victory in 2008.

Democrats need a leader who can power through the internal contradictions that their multihued, multicultural rainbow coalition presents.

They need their own populist playbook and a presidential candidate equipped to forcefully campaign on it, someone whose personality -- bravura, charisma, and bullheadedness -- can seal for even a short while the cracks and schisms that push the party in a hundred different directions.

My guess is that this will require the Democrats and their presidential nominee to resourcefully confront -- to creatively reformat -- issues of race and immigration, gender and sexual identity that Republicans have exploited with great success to peel away swing voters. This may be where a candidate's charisma -- his or her ability to elicit committed followership -- becomes indispensable. The issue is less whether the party should or should not move left, but how a party of the left presents itself to and recruits an Election Day majority from a heterogeneous and deeply conflicted national audience.

The danger for Democrats is that intensifying public hostility to President Trump may hand them the White House in 2020 before they have fully cultivated a leadership cadre equipped to address the conflicts that have torn the party apart in the past -- a cadre that must also be strong enough to do battle with the increasingly powerful moneyed class and its voracious lobbying elite.

89,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/10/world/middleeast/mike-pompeo-speech-obama.html,"CAIRO -- Secretary of State Mike Pompeo scathingly repudiated President Barack Obama's approach to the Middle East on Thursday, using a speech in Cairo to reject what he called the previous administration's timidity toward Islamic extremism and misguided outreach to Iran.

A decade after Mr. Obama delivered a landmark speech, also in Cairo, that offered an olive branch to Iran and urged autocrats to permit greater freedoms, Mr. Pompeo offered his own reset, based on unquestioned American leadership and an alliance of Arab authoritarians to counter Iran.

The United States will use those alliances ""to expel every last Iranian boot"" from Syria, he said.

Mr. Pompeo's assertion of American purpose in the Middle East comes at a moment when Washington's will to lead has been widely questioned.

President Trump's sudden announcement, issued via Twitter on Dec. 19, that he planned to withdraw 2,000 American troops from Syria caused consternation. So far in Mr. Pompeo's nine-nation tour of the region that started Tuesday, he has had to reassure jittery nations about the pace of that withdrawal.

In the region, the Syrian decision has created a diplomatic tangle with Turkey and, since the resignation of Defense Secretary Jim Mattis over the Syria announcement, has led to fears among allies that Mr. Trump is not on the same page as his national security team."
90,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/10/world/middleeast/mike-pompeo-speech-middle-east-obama.html,"CAIRO -- Secretary of State Mike Pompeo laid out a new manifesto for American action in the Middle East on Thursday, telling a university audience here that ""the age of self-inflicted American shame is over"" and that the United States would take a far more activist role in the region, despite fears that President Trump's decision to pull troops out of Syria marks a new phase of withdrawal.

Mr. Pompeo delivered a scathing -- and quite personal -- rejection of President Barack Obama's approach to the Middle East, excoriating Mr. Obama for ""fundamental misunderstandings"" about the region that ""underestimated the tenacity and viciousness of radical Islamism.""

And he described a policy of containment of Iran's power, pressing for allies in the region to isolate the country. He vowed to ""expel every last Iranian boot"" from Syria, but offered no plan to achieve that goal at a moment that the small American force of 2,000 troops is scheduled to get out.

The seeming contradiction between Mr. Trump's impulsive announcement that United States forces would leave Syria and Mr. Pompeo's declaration that ""when America retreats, chaos follows"" confounded many in the region. They say they cannot reconcile the declaration with the president's Dec. 19 tweet that his only reason for remaining in Syria was the defeat of the Islamic State, a job he said had been completed.

Only three months ago, Mr. Trump's national security adviser, John R. Bolton, promised that American forces would not leave Syria until the Iranians were out of the country.

So far in Mr. Pompeo's nine-nation tour of the region that started Tuesday, he has had to reassure jittery nations who have interpreted the president's instincts as the definition of retreat. Mr. Pompeo spent much of the day in Cairo trying to explain the new strategy, arguing that it does not take troops on the ground to influence events.

Mr. Pompeo picked the timing and locale of his speech for dramatic effect: It was almost exactly a decade after Mr. Obama delivered a landmark speech at another university in Cairo, offering an olive branch to Iran and urging autocrats to permit greater freedoms.

Mr. Obama later conceded that his administration had done a poor job of turning the lofty rhetoric of that speech into action on the ground. And much of his strategy was swept away in the 2011 Arab spring, with the upheavals it brought to the region.

Mr. Pompeo offered his own reset, based on unquestioned American leadership and an alliance of Arab authoritarians to counter Iran, without dwelling at all on human rights issues. The word ""rights"" does not appear in Mr. Pompeo's text.

Iran immediately rejected the speech.

""Whenever/wherever U.S. interferes, chaos, repression and resentment follow,"" the Iranian foreign minister, Mohammad Javad Zarif, posted on Twitter hours after Mr. Pompeo spoke. ""The day Iran mimics U.S. clients & @SecPompeo's 'human rights models' -- be it the Shah or current butchers -- to become a 'normal' country is the day hell freezes over.""

Mr. Pompeo's assertion of American purpose in the Middle East comes at a moment when Washington's will to lead has been widely questioned.

The decision to withdraw from Syria has created a diplomatic tangle with Turkey and, since the resignation of Defense Secretary Jim Mattis over the Syria announcement, has led to fears among allies that Mr. Trump is not on the same page as his national security team.

While Mr. Obama spoke with the air of the professor he once was, Mr. Pompeo stressed his military background, Christian faith and fondness for plain speaking. ""It is a truth that isn't often spoken in this part of the world, but I'm a military man by training, so I'll put it bluntly: America is a force for good in the Middle East. Period.""

Mr. Obama's era was time of disastrous misjudgments, he said. ""What did we learn from all this?"" he said. ""When America retreats, chaos follows. When we neglect our friends, resentment builds. When we partner with enemies, they advance.""

Former Obama officials sprang to defend their legacy.

""Listening to Secretary Pompeo's speech is like listening to someone from a parallel universe,"" said Robert Malley, Mr. Obama's coordinator for the Middle East. He called the speech ""a self-congratulatory, delusional depiction of the Trump administration's Middle East policy.""

Jeffrey Prescott of National Security Action, a group led by former Obama officials, said it showcased the Trump administration's obsession with Iran and with Mr. Obama. ""Pompeo sees his audience as the region's autocrats rather than its people,"" he said.

The speech met with polite applause from a selected audience at the American University in Cairo. But it will be warmly welcomed by autocrats like President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi of Egypt, who met with Mr. Pompeo earlier Thursday.

Mr. Pompeo made no direct reference to rampant human rights abuses in Egypt under Mr. Sisi, or to the estimated 60,000 political opponents human rights groups say are languishing in Egyptian jails.

There was a one-line reference to Yemen, where the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, has spearheaded a ruinous war that has driven the country to the brink of famine. He made no reference to the Palestinians, but repeatedly stressed America's ties to Israel.

Where Mr. Pompeo found hope in the region, it was mostly in closer links between American allies, or in overtures to Christians.

""Who could've believed a few years ago that an Israeli prime minister would visit Muscat?"" he said. ""Or that a Roman Catholic pope would visit this city to meet with Muslim imams and the head of the Coptic faith?""

An Israeli minister cried, he said, after the Israeli national anthem was played at a sports tournament in the United Arab Emirates. ""She could not have been happier,"" he said.

After the speech, Mr. Pompeo drove out to a soaring new Coptic cathedral at the New Administrative Capital, a signature project of Mr. Sisi that is under construction 30 miles east of Cairo, in the desert."
91,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/10/world/middleeast/pompeo-speech-obama.html,"The speech on Thursday by Secretary of State Mike Pompeo at the American University in Cairo, laying out the Trump administration's Middle East objectives, was strikingly at odds with a famed speech made by President Barack Obama in the same city nearly a decade ago.

Mr. Pompeo blamed the prior White House administration for ""fundamental misunderstandings"" that ""adversely affected the lives of hundreds of millions of people in Egypt and across the region.""

Mr. Obama's own speech in 2009 reads a little like an inversion of the Trump administration's view. Here are some points of comparison:

A 'New Beginning'

""I have come here to seek a new beginning between the United States and Muslims around the world,"" Mr. Obama said, a theme that became the focus of much of his message to the Middle East. His policy aimed to ""acknowledge the past"" and work toward shared goals ""based on mutual interest and mutual respect.""

""Human history has often been a record of nations and tribes subjugating one another to serve their own interests. Yet in this new age, such attitudes are self-defeating. Given our interdependence, any world order that elevates one nation or group of people over another will inevitably fail.""

Mr. Pompeo criticized the prior administration's ""reluctance to wield our influence"" and asserted that under the Obama administration, the United States had been ""falsely seeing ourselves as a force for what ails the Middle East.""

""Now comes the real 'new beginning.' In just 24 months, the United States under President Trump has reasserted its traditional role as a force for good in this region, because we've learned from our mistakes.""

Israel and a Palestinian state

Mr. Obama adamantly supported a two-state solution, asserting America's ""unbreakable"" bond with Israel while condemning Israeli policies that he said had undermined efforts to resolve one of the world's most protracted conflicts.

""So let there be no doubt: The situation for the Palestinian people is intolerable. America will not turn our backs on the legitimate Palestinian aspiration for dignity, opportunity and a state of their own.""

""Israelis must acknowledge that just as Israel's right to exist cannot be denied, neither can Palestine's.""

Mr. Pompeo said little about the peace process and made no mention of a two-state solution, stating that the ""Trump administration will also continue to press for a real and lasting peace between Israel and the Palestinians."" Messages of support for Israel were woven prominently throughout the address.

""We have adhered to our word. President Trump campaigned on the promise to recognize the city of Jerusalem -- the seat of Israel's government -- as the nation's capital. In May, we moved the U.S. Embassy there. These decisions honor a bipartisan congressional resolution from more than two decades ago.""

Cooperation With Iran

Mr. Obama opened the door to talks with Iran in 2009, acknowledging ""a tumultuous history"" and arguing that cooperation with Tehran was in the region's interests.

""Rather than remain trapped in the past, I have made it clear to Iran's leaders and people that my country is prepared to move forward. The question, now, is not what Iran is against, but rather what future it wants to build.""

Mr. Pompeo focused much of his speech on denouncing Iran, and criticized Mr. Obama's willingness to negotiate with Iranian leaders.

""Our desire for peace at any cost led us to strike a deal with Iran, our common enemy.

""America's economic sanctions against the regime are the strongest in history, and will keep getting tougher until Iran starts behaving like a normal country.""

Combating Terrorism

Mr. Obama did not use the words ""terrorism"" or ""terrorist,"" opting for ""violent extremists"" to describe radical militant groups who carry out attacks in the name of Islam.

""America is not -- and will never be -- at war with Islam.""

Mr. Pompeo called Mr. Obama's portrayal of these groups ""a dire misjudgment"" that had helped spread Islamic State militants in Syria and Iraq. He said now, ""America has confronted the ugly reality of radical Islamism.""

""We grossly underestimated the tenacity and viciousness of radical Islamism, a debauched strain of the faith that seeks to upend every other form of worship or governance.""

Democracy and Human Rights

Mr. Obama tried to walk a line between promoting democracy and supporting authoritarian leaders. He stressed free speech, the rule of law, women's rights and religious tolerance:

""No system of government can or should be imposed upon one nation by any other. That does not lessen my commitment, however, to governments that reflect the will of the people.

""Each nation gives life to this principle in its own way, grounded in the traditions of its own people. America does not presume to know what is best for everyone, just as we would not presume to pick the outcome of a peaceful election.""

Mr. Pompeo made little mention of democracy and no mention of human rights. He conspicuously avoided criticism of America's authoritarian allies, most notably Saudi Arabia.

Unflattering History

President Obama called Iraq ""a war of choice,"" acknowledged the American role ""in the overthrow of a democratically elected Iranian government"" and asserted that colonialism and Cold War politics had denied Muslim-majority nations rights and opportunities.

Mr. Pompeo took the opposite approach:

""America is a force for good in the Middle East. Period.

""The age of self-inflicted American shame is over, and so are the policies that produced so much needless suffering.""

The Use of Religion

Mr. Obama quoted the Quran, the Bible and the Talmud, used Arabic phrases and generally wove religion throughout the speech to argue that Islam, like Christianity and Judaism, promotes tolerance and nonviolence:

""There is also one rule that lies at the heart of every religion -- that we do unto others as we would have them do unto us. This truth transcends nations and peoples -- a belief that isn't new; that isn't black or white or brown; that isn't Christian, or Muslim or Jew.""

""It's a faith in other people, and it's what brought me here today.""

Mr. Pompeo, an evangelical Christian, began his address with a nod to his faith. He then criticized Mr. Obama for what he called ""an eagerness to address only Muslims, not nations"" that ""ignored the rich diversity of the Middle East, and frayed old bonds.""

Military Withdrawal

One clear point of agreement between Mr. Pompeo and Mr. Obama: a plan to withdraw troops. In 2009, for Mr. Obama, that meant focusing on Iraq and Afghanistan and a transition to supporting local forces.

""America has a dual responsibility: to help Iraq forge a better future -- and to leave Iraq to Iraqis. I have made it clear to the Iraqi people that we pursue no bases, and no claim on their territory or resources. Iraq's sovereignty is its own.""

""Make no mistake: we do not want to keep our troops in Afghanistan. We seek no military bases there.""

Mr. Pompeo focused on President Trump's announcement that American troops would withdraw from Syria, where they have been part of a coalition fighting the Islamic State. He said now was the time for other partners to step in.

""President Trump has made the decision to bring our troops home from Syria.

""But this isn't a change of mission. We remain committed to the complete dismantling of the ISIS threat and the ongoing fight against radical Islamism in all its forms. But, as President Trump has said, we are looking to our partners to do more in this effort going forward."""

Good morning.

President Trump makes another push for a border wall, China's censors look beyond domestic platforms and a Baby Shark version becomes a global hit. Here's the latest:

Trump heads to the U.S. border with Mexico.

The trip to McAllen, Tex., a border community, is meant to press for funding for a wall.

President Trump said he would ""probably"" declare a state of emergency, which would allow him to circumvent Congress to find funds for his wall -- and allow him a face-saving way to sign government spending bills that don't pay for it.

If the government doesn't reopen by Saturday, the shutdown will become the longest in 43 years.

At stake: The partial government shutdown has left about 800,000 federal workers furloughed or working without pay. Here's a state-by-state look at the impact. And it has halted one of the federal government's most important public health activities: inspections of thousands of industrial sites for pollution violations.

Word of the day: furlough. A leave of absence (usually authorized, often used in the military), derived from the Dutch word verlof, meaning permission.

One more thing: President Trump cancelled his trip to Davos, Switzerland, for the annual World Economic Forum, citing the ""Democrats intransigence"" on border security.

Junk food companies influence China's nutrition policies.

In 1978, Coca-Cola was among the first foreign companies allowed into China. Shortly after, came the International Life Sciences Institute, or ILSI.

The global organization is paid for by the biggest names in snack foods -- including Nestlé, McDonald's, Pepsi and Coca-Cola -- and has helped shape much of China's science and public policy on obesity. In fact, it runs its operations from inside the government's Centre for Disease Control and Prevention offices in Beijing.

As a result, two new studies have found, Chinese health campaigns aimed at tackling obesity almost always promote exercise and rarely mention the value of cutting calories or reducing consumption of processed foods.

Today: More than 42 percent of adults in China are overweight or obese, according to Chinese researchers, more than double the rate in 1991. And in Chinese cities, nearly a fifth of all children are obese, according to government surveys.

China's censorship efforts expand to global platforms.

One man spent 15 days in a detention center. Police officers threatened another's family. A third was chained to a chair for eight hours of interrogation.

Their offense: posting on Twitter.

Chinese authorities, in an escalation of the country's online suppression, are starting to control content on social media platforms blocked in China and invisible to the majority of people there.

The crackdown is unusually broad and punitive. While past censorship has targeted prominent users, the current push includes no-name Twitter lurkers with few followers, which experts say is a drastic shift in the government's approach.

Why it matters: Twitter, though banned, plays an important role in the discussion of issues in China. A small but active community uses software to circumvent the government's blocks to reach a last refuge of political debate.

Pompeo takes shots at Obama's Middle East policies.

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, in a speech in Cairo, declared that the U.S. would take a more activist role in the region. He also rejected much of President Barack Obama's human-rights-based approach there, outlining an approach that is based on a close alliance with authoritarian rulers.

Mr. Pompeo -- whose remarks came almost exactly a decade after Mr. Obama delivered a landmark speech in the same city -- denounced the former president for underestimating ""the tenacity and viciousness of radical Islam"" and his policies on Iran. Here are the many ways Mr. Pompeo departed from Mr. Obama.

Confusion: Mr. Pompeo apparently sought to reassure jittery nations with his declaration that ""when America retreats, chaos follows"" and that the U.S. would ""expel every last Iranian boot from Syria,"" but the effect was confounding to many, coming weeks after President Trump's impulsive announcement that United States forces would leave Syria.

Go deeper: The U.S. has spent $8 billion to build a strong Air Force in Afghanistan but it is still struggling, which could complicate President Trump's efforts to pull out of the country.

Oceans are warming faster than we thought.

In a new analysis published Thursday, scientists found that the oceans are heating 40 percent faster than the U.N. estimated five years ago, a finding with dire implications for climate change. It also concluded that ocean temperatures have broken records for several straight years.

A few months ago, a version of a study also found that the world's oceans were heating faster, which we reported here in the Briefing. But the study contained calculation errors that caused its authors to revise their estimates down. Now, the revision is much closer to the new consensus.

Why it matters: The oceans have always provided a critical buffer against the effects of climate change by absorbing most of the heat trapped by greenhouse gas emissions. Warmer oceans can lead to more powerful storms and increased stress on coral reefs.

Here's what else is happening

China: Beijing's ambassador to Canada said, in an opinion piece for an Ottawa-based newspaper, that ""white supremacy"" was behind calls to release two Canadians detained in China, further straining relations between the two countries.

South Korea: President Moon Jae-in said that the North Korean leader Kim Jong-un's recent visit to China signaled that a second summit meeting with President Trump was imminent.

Australia: A 48-year-old man was charged with sending 38 suspicious, potentially hazardous packages to foreign consulates in Sydney, Melbourne and Canberra. The authorities didn't offer a motive for his actions but, if convicted, he faces up to 10 years in prison.

El Chapo: The trial of Joaquín Guzmán Loera offered a riveting look at the Mexican kingpin's personal life, as the F.B.I. revealed private messages between him and his wife and mistress. They were obtained by Mr. Guzmán's I.T. expert, who became an undercover informant.

Venezuela: President Nicolás Maduro was inaugurated for a second term after an election last year that was widely considered illegitimate -- and despite a plummeting economy and skyrocketing violence, hunger and migration. Our team explains how he has clung to power.

Baby Shark: A version of the infectious children's song made the Billboard Hot 100 this week. The South Korean educational brand that released it, Pinkfong, now has as many Top 40 hits as Jimi Hendrix. (Doo doo doo doo doo doo.)

Back Story

The game is afoot this weekend for the Baker Street Irregulars, a literary society devoted to Sherlock Holmes that is holding its annual dinner in New York City.

Founded in 1934, the Irregulars are named for a group of street urchins who assisted Holmes in some of Arthur Conan Doyle's 60 stories about the fictional detective.

The group, which is invitation only, has about 300 members around the world and publishes a quarterly journal of Sherlockian scholarship.

The Irregulars' dinner tonight is part of a five-day celebration in Manhattan featuring a lecture, a memorabilia sale and parties with other groups of Sherlock Holmes fans, including the Baker Street Babes. (The first female members of the Irregulars weren't admitted until the early 1990s.)

The event is timed to coincide with Holmes's birthday, which enthusiasts have generally agreed is Jan. 6 -- although the reasoning is far from elementary.

93,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/10/us/politics/the-inaccuracies-in-pompeos-cairo-speech.html,"Secretary of State Mike Pompeo's criticism of the Obama administration's response to Iran's ""Green Movement"" was exaggerated, and his claim that the Trump administration has been ""clear"" about withdrawing troops from Syria ignored clearly contradictory statements.

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, in a major speech in Cairo on Thursday, rebuked the Obama administration's policies in the Middle East and hailed the accomplishments of the Trump administration.

""It's the truth, lowercase 't,' that I'm here to talk about today,"" Mr. Pompeo said. ""It is a truth that isn't often spoken in this part of the world, but because I'm a military man by training, I'll be very blunt and direct today: America is a force for good in the Middle East. We need to acknowledge that truth, because if we don't, we make bad choices -- now and in the future.""

Yet Mr. Pompeo's speech was not always accurate. Here's a fact-check.

What Mr. Pompeo Said

""America's reluctance, our reluctance, to wield our influence kept us silent as the people of Iran rose up against the mullahs in Tehran in the Green Revolution.""

This is exaggerated.

In June 2009, thousands of protesters took to Iran's streets to dispute the election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad and called for more political freedom, clashing with riot police officers. President Barack Obama's response was muted, but he did speak about the ""Green Movement,"" or ""Green Revolution.""

""Like the rest of the world, we were impressed by the vigorous debate and enthusiasm that this election generated, particularly among young Iranians. We continue to monitor the entire situation closely, including reports of irregularities,"" Robert Gibbs, Mr. Obama's press secretary, said in a statement on June 13, the day election results were announced and protests erupted.

At a news conference two days later, Mr. Obama said he was ""deeply troubled by the violence that I've been seeing on television. I think that the democratic process -- free speech, the ability of people to peacefully dissent -- all those are universal values and need to be respected.""

Saying the United States would continue to engage in dialogue with Iran, Mr. Obama added, ""I think it would be wrong for me to be silent about what we've seen on the television over the last few days."" Mr. Obama continued: ""To the youth of Iran, I want them to know that we in the United States do not want to make any decisions for the Iranians, but we do believe that the Iranian people and their voices should be heard and respected.""

In subsequent news conferences, interviews and official statements, Mr. Obama continued to emphasize that the United States should not be seen as interfering in Iran's election but condemned the violence directed at the protesters and called for freedom of political expression.

Reasonable people can argue whether the Obama administration did or said enough to support the protests, but Mr. Obama was not ""silent.""

What Mr. Pompeo Said

""When the mission is over, when the job is complete, America leaves. Today in Iraq, at the government's invitation, we have approximately 5,000 troops where there were once 166,000.""

This needs context.

Mr. Pompeo's numbers are accurate, but most of the troop withdrawals occurred under Mr. Obama -- whose foreign policy decisions the secretary of state had condemned moments earlier in his speech.

In October 2007, there were 166,000 troops in Iraq, the peak of the American military presence in the country. Troop levels declined every year from 2009 to 2012, under Mr. Obama, with the last combat convoy fighting in the Iraq war leaving in December 2011.

The rise of the Islamic State, however, led Mr. Obama to send troops back to Iraq, with some 4,600 American service members deployed in Iraq in July 2016. An estimated 5,000 troops remained in Iraq as of December 2018.

What Mr. Pompeo Said

""There's no contradiction whatsoever. This is a story made up by the media.""

This is misleading.

Asked in a news conference about conflicting statements on President Trump's plan to quickly withdraw troops from Syria, Mr. Pompeo insisted that administration officials have been ""very clear.""

Yet Mr. Trump and other officials have given contradictory statements on whether the Islamic State has been defeated, and shifted the timeline for withdrawal from ""now"" to when the Islamic State has been defeated.

On Dec. 19, Mr. Trump announced the withdrawal and declared victory over the Islamic State on Twitter, adding, ""Our boys, our young women, our men, they're all coming back and they're coming back now. We won.""

Defense Department officials told The New York Times that Mr. Trump ordered the withdrawal to be completed within 30 days. The Wall Street Journal and The Washington Post reported that the departure would be ""rapid.""

Four days later, Mr. Trump said the withdrawal would be ""slow"" and ""highly coordinated"" and maintained that ""our troops are coming home!"" On Dec. 31, Mr. Trump acknowledged that the Islamic State was not completely defeated, and repeated that troops would return home ""slowly.""

The Times reported that Mr. Trump extended his timetable to four months, though Mr. Trump denied that in a January cabinet meeting.

Mr. Trump's national security adviser, John R. Bolton, told reporters on Jan. 6 that American forces would remain until the complete defeat of the Islamic State and until Turkey guaranteed the safety of Syrian Kurds. That same day, Mr. Trump echoed Mr. Bolton's statement and said that troops ""won't be finally pulled out until ISIS is gone."""
94,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/21/opinion/mattis-resignation-trump.html,"Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis, who submitted his resignation on Thursday, was the last ""adult in the room"" of the Trump administration -- or so claim a small army of pundits, who now worry that the president, finally unchecked, will unleash an unvarnished, unpredictable America First foreign policy on the world.

There's no arguing that Mr. Mattis is an admirable man who did his best to counter an erratic president. The question is whether he succeeded in his mission.

Though Mr. Mattis ostensibly left because he disagreed with Mr. Trump's decision to withdraw from Syria, in his letter of resignation he makes clear that it was really about the accumulation of slights and compromises that over his two-year tenure left him and his worldview sidelined.

Mr. Mattis's original plan may have been to subtly guide the ship of state through treacherous international waters for four years. The president's heedlessness and, especially, his disregard for the United States' strategic alliances, partnerships and reputation made that scenario infeasible.

If Mr. Mattis had ever hoped that veteran military figures like himself could rein in the president, that illusion was shattered in April with the ignominious departure of Gen. H.R. McMaster as national security adviser.

Mr. Mattis and the president occasionally agreed -- for instance, on the United States' withdrawal from the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty. Initially, he and General McMaster got Mr. Trump to denounce torture (grudgingly), walk back the spurning of NATO, recertify the Iran nuclear deal (twice) and, to some extent, stiffen his position on President Vladimir Putin of Russia and sporadically acknowledge Russia's meddling in the 2016 election.

But Mr. Trump did not consult Mr. Mattis before withdrawing from the Iran nuclear deal or suspending joint United States-South Korea military exercises in June, at the Singapore summit -- moves Mr. Mattis opposed. He ignored Mr. Mattis's request that the White House secure congressional authorization before launching airstrikes in 2017 in retaliation for Syrian chemical weapons attacks. Mr. Mattis's opposition to moving the United States Embassy in Israel from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem di not seem to register, for even a second, with the president.

Unlike some of his fellow cabinet members, Mr. Mattis never demeaned himself before the president in an effort to get his way. Since early in the administration, when Mr. Mattis alone declined to indulge Mr. Trump the ritual adulation he demanded during an inane public cabinet meeting, it was clear the secretary of defense held the president in dubious regard.

For a while, even as the failures mounted, Mr. Mattis seemed to be holding the line: He looked like a Spartan Marine helping rescue America from a willfully ignorant, libertine businessman. Then, by early 2018, Mr. Trump started to gain confidence on foreign affairs and perhaps detect in Mr. Mattis -- whom he initially fetishized as ""Mad Dog,"" the archetypal military tough guy, reportedly to Mr. Mattis's chagrin -- a note of condescension. The president pushed out Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and General McMaster, Mr. Mattis's de facto allies, and replaced them with Mike Pompeo and John Bolton, two more simpatico hawks.

As secretary of defense, Mr. Mattis still had bureaucratic control of the American military and its assets. But that afforded him only the power of delay and limited obstruction -- not a practical veto or even, necessarily, a strong voice at the table in the White House Situation Room, especially with Mr. Pompeo and Mr. Bolton backing the president's every play.

That much was on display when the president ordered thousands of troops to the Mexican border this fall to repel the ""caravan"" of immigrants he said were mounting an ""invasion"" -- a flagrantly cynical ploy to rile up his political base ahead of the midterms. Mr. Mattis seemed to understand that the deployment would amount to a technical breach of the Posse Comitatus Act, which restricts the use of the military for internal law enforcement; he sought to minimize the number of troops involved and slow-rolled the deployment. Publicly, however, he defended the move as ""humanitarian,"" proclaiming that ""we don't do stunts,"" and ultimately acquiesced.

Nor was he much for cabinet infighting. Mr. Mattis could have tried to outmaneuver Mr. Bolton -- who has wanted him gone for some time -- and stay in his job, discreetly devising stratagems for eluding dangers posed by Mr. Trump's erratic behavior and blunting objectionable military initiatives.

James Schlesinger, secretary of defense when President Richard Nixon was self-medicated and irrational in the later days of Watergate, supposedly short-circuited Mr. Nixon's major national security decision-making authority. But he had obliging senior colleagues, including Henry Kissinger, the secretary of state.

Mr. Schlesinger was also a famously cocky civilian willing to circumvent the constitutional chain of command. Mr. Mattis is cut from more regimented cloth. As commanding officer of the United States Central Command in 2013, he was candid with President Barack Obama about his reservations concerning the administration's conciliatory approach to Iran and quietly left his post early.

Even as prominent Republicans as well as Democrats criticized Mr. Trump's nationalistic, anti-Europe displays in Brussels and Helsinki, Mr. Mattis offered no more than deflective, anodyne remarks. Although he admirably dragged his feet on barring transgender troops, holding a military parade and starting a space force, more interference might only have nourished Trumpian delusions about a ""deep state.""

The turning point for Mr. Mattis came when he backed the administration's obdurate refusal to accept the C.I.A.'s assessment that the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, had most likely ordered the murder of the Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Increasingly, when Mr. Mattis hasn't appeared marginalized, he has looked tamed and compromised. Even before the Syria drawdown was announced, it was time for him to go.

Mr. Mattis is undoubtedly a patriot, and a proud one. Out of office and having left of his own accord, he could now serve his country as a praetorian critic. Mr. Trump's nominee to replace him is likely to be a pliant sycophant. But the present moment is propitious for an admired soon-to-be ex-official to air dire misgivings about the strategic state of the country. A galvanized Democratic majority intent on holding Mr. Trump and his administration in check is about to take over the House, and the heretofore craven Senate is showing signs of resistance. The adult who is leaving the room may now, finally, speak truth to power and be heard.

95,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/04/us/politics/trump-wall-shutdown.html,"WASHINGTON -- At first, he vowed to ""take the mantle"" for closing part of the federal government. Then he blamed Democrats, saying they ""now own the shutdown."" By Friday, President Trump was back to owning it again. ""I'm very proud of doing what I'm doing,"" he declared.

Two weeks into the showdown over a border wall, Mr. Trump is now crafting his own narrative of the confrontation that has come to consume his presidency. Rather than a failure of negotiation, the shutdown has become a test of political virility, one in which he insists he is receiving surreptitious support from unlikely quarters.

Not only are national security hawks cheering him on to defend a porous southern border, but so too are former presidents who he says have secretly confessed to him that they should have done what he is doing. Not only do federal employees accept being furloughed or forced to work without wages, they have assured him that they would give up paychecks so that he can stand strong.

Never mind how implausible such assertions might seem. The details do not matter to Mr. Trump as much as dominating the debate. After an oddly quiescent holiday season in which he complained via Twitter about being left at home alone -- ""poor me"" -- he has taken the public stage this week clearly intent on framing the conflict on his own terms.

People close to the president described him as emboldened since members of Congress returned to Washington after the break, giving him not only a clear target to swing at but helping him focus on a fight that he is convinced is a political winner.

Although surveys at first showed more Americans blaming him for the shutdown than Democrats, later polling showed the fault more evenly split. And the voters he cares most about, his core conservative supporters, are more enthusiastic than the public at large. He has told people that ""my people"" love the fight, and that he believes he is winning.

In the past three days, Mr. Trump has appeared in public three times to get his version of the story out while Democrats celebrated their takeover of the House. At a lengthy cabinet meeting on Wednesday, an appearance with border patrol union leaders on Thursday and a news conference with Republican congressional leaders in the Rose Garden on Friday, he engaged in quintessentially Trumpian stream of conscious discussions that ranged widely and unpredictably.

At one point, he argued that the Soviet Union was right to invade Afghanistan in 1979 to stop terrorists, a revisionist version that provoked a strong reaction in Kabul and earned a sharp rebuke from the often supportive editorial page of The Wall Street Journal, which said, ""We cannot recall a more absurd misstatement of history by an American President.""

At another point, Mr. Trump mocked India for doing no more in Afghanistan than building a library, which generated headlines in New Delhi about the ""jab"" at its prime minister, not to mention more head scratching because, according to Indian news media, the country has not built a library in Afghanistan in many years.

He repeatedly claimed that the new trade agreement he has negotiated with Mexico and Canada means that Mexico really is paying for the wall, even though the pact has yet to be approved by Congress and has no direct connection to border security. He has made misleading claims about how many terrorists might be coming across the border.

Mr. Trump's version of events differed even from the other people in the room at Friday's meeting at the White House. When Democratic congressional leaders emerged after two hours, they described a ""contentious"" session with no meaningful progress as the president threatened to keep the government closed for ""months or even years."" When Mr. Trump emerged shortly afterward, he described a ""very, very productive meeting"" and predicted the standoff could be ""fixed very quickly.""

One person briefed on the meeting said that White House officials viewed the conversation as the first civil discussion that had taken place between the two sides and it left some of Mr. Trump's aides hopeful. The president said he would have Vice President Mike Pence; Kirstjen Nielsen, the homeland security secretary; and Jared Kushner, his son-in-law and senior adviser, meet with Democrats over the weekend.

But there were questions about his own side of the aisle. Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, unlike other congressional Republican leaders, was not present for the Rose Garden news conference. ""He's running the Senate,"" Mr. Trump explained, even though the Senate had adjourned hours earlier and Mr. McConnell's spokesman said the senator did not know about the news conference.

The president nonetheless was feeling energized by support he said he had received for the fight -- including the very federal employees who are not being paid as a result of the partial shutdown.

""A lot of people that you think are upset -- and certainly they're not thrilled -- but they say, 'Sir, do the right thing, we need border security,'"" Mr. Trump said. ""And these are people that won't be getting paid.""

As for his predecessors, he said, ""This should have been done by all of the presidents that preceded me and they all know it. Some of them have told me that we should have done it.""

By all public accounts, Mr. Trump had not spoken with his living predecessors since his inauguration until former President George Bush died last month. Mr. Trump called Mr. Bush's son, former President George W. Bush, to offer condolences, but the subject of the wall did not come up, according to Mr. Bush's office. A few days later, Mr. Trump encountered his predecessors for the first time since taking office at the elder Mr. Bush's funeral, but he sat quietly without talking with them during the service.

The younger Mr. Bush built miles of wall and fencing along the Mexico line while he was president, but said it could not cover the entire border and insisted that enforcement should be coupled with an overhaul of immigration law to permit many people in the country illegally to stay. Former President Barack Obama has repeatedly criticized Mr. Trump's proposed wall, and former President Jimmy Carter has said technological improvements would be more effective at protecting the border.

As he careened from subject to subject and assertion to assertion this week, an energized Mr. Trump seemed to be enjoying himself. He went for more than an hour and a half on Wednesday and another hour on Friday.

""Should we keep this going or not, folks?"" he asked reporters at one point before noticing that it was a cold January day in the Rose Garden.

""Should we keep this going a little bit longer?"" he asked again. ""Let me know when you get tired.""

One thing Mr. Trump was not was tired."
96,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/04/us/mexico-wall-policy-trump.html,"EL PASO -- At a migrant shelter near the Mexican border, three girls from Guatemala -- sisters aged 10, 9 and 6 -- coughed and sniffled. One of them clung to both a teddy bear and a large bottle of Pedialyte, to soothe her dehydration and flu.

The girls' mother, Nelcy, 28, said her daughters got sick not during their long journey to the border in the back of a pickup truck, but during the 12 days they spent at two crowded government detention facilities before arriving at the privately run shelter in Texas. ""It was very cold, especially for the children,"" said Nelcy, who would only be identified by her first name. ""My children got sick. They gave us aluminum blankets, but it wasn't enough.""

The shelter network here run by the nonprofit Annunciation House is now receiving roughly 200 new migrants a day, the same number it saw in an entire week only a year ago. The number of migrants traveling as families crossing the border from Mexico exceeded 25,000 in November, the highest numbers ever recorded.

Like Nelcy and her daughters, the new arrivals from Central America are coming in much sicker, after being held far longer than ever before in bare-bones government detention facilities never intended for children. Asylum seekers bottled up in Mexico are jumping fences and throwing rocks at officers, who are firing tear gas to push them away. Hundreds of migrants have been released on city streets in recent weeks, uncertain of where to go. Two sick migrant children have died while in custody.

A crisis of the kind President Trump has long warned of is beginning to take shape along the country's 1,900-mile border with Mexico. A border security network built over a period of decades to handle large numbers of single men has in the past several years been inundated with women and children, and as the number of families has peaked in recent months, the system has increasingly been unable to accommodate all of them.

Much of the growing chaos, say many of those who work along the border and in some of the government's own security agencies, is a result of a failed gamble on the part of the Trump administration that a succession of ever-harsher border policies would deter the flood of migrants coming from Central America.

It has not, and the failure to spend money on expanding border processing facilities, better transportation and broader networks of cooperation with private charities, they say, has led to the current problems with overcrowding, health threats and uncontrolled releases of migrants in cities along the border.

""It's the complete, 100 percent focus on harsher options that will deter the influx, with a disregard for managing what's happening,"" said a Department of Homeland Security official who spoke on the condition of anonymity for fear of being fired. ""We have a lot more families, a lot more unaccompanied children, and the focus has just been on how can we deter, rather than how can we handle.""

Mr. Trump has made it a priority to end what he calls the practice of ""catch and release,"" but the policy of holding large numbers of migrants in detention has led to capacity problems. The Obama administration had a policy of releasing migrants who were considered safe and likely to appear in court in order to make room for others who were a higher priority for detention, but the Trump administration has largely eliminated that practice.

The number of detainees at Immigration and Customs Enforcement facilities has reached its highest point ever, according to figures provided by the agency, with an average daily population of 45,200 single adults and family units.

The result is the recent need to release large numbers of migrants, many simply dropped off at bus stations. About 600 migrants were dropped off with no advance planning in El Paso during the last full week in December. Similar releases have happened in recent days and weeks in Arizona and California.

The homeland security official said the administration could have done more to improve the situation and avoid the recent mass drop-offs, such as working more closely with nonprofit groups. ""They could have put more resources down there, either monetary or physical,"" the official said. ""There are things you could do to manage it so that it's not just, 'We're overwhelmed. We're releasing them.'""

The administration blames Congress and the courts for creating a system that encourages families who do not qualify for asylum to apply for the status anyway, often living in the country for months or years as their applications move through the courts. Kirstjen Nielsen, the homeland security secretary, has been critical of court rulings that make it difficult to hold migrants with children in detention for long periods -- creating what officials say is a loophole that is encouraging migrants to bring their children on long, treacherous journeys from Central America.

""Secretary Nielsen has been saying for over a year to anyone who would listen -- especially members of Congress -- that our frontline men and women don't have the adequate resources needed for the number of aliens we are apprehending,"" Katie Waldman, a spokeswoman for the Homeland Security Department, said in a statement. ""This humanitarian crisis is driven by activist court rulings and poorly written laws that incentivize the smuggling of illegal immigrants under the age of 18.""

At the direction of the White House, the Department of Homeland Security has churned out a series of aggressive initiatives aimed at discouraging migrants from coming. Most of them have been quickly blocked by the courts.

Last year, the government announced it would arrest close to 100 percent of all those who crossed the border illegally and separate them from their children -- a measure that was blocked by the courts and rescinded. Later, the administration tried to prevent migrants from applying for asylum anywhere but at legal border crossings, and then limited the number of migrants it would process each day at those border stations. That policy created logjams and escalating tensions at border stations from Texas to California, though part of it, too, was enjoined by the courts.

Some of those involved in the policymaking said that there was open acknowledgment within the government that the newest policies under development -- a plan that would require asylum seekers to wait in Mexico through the duration of their immigration cases, and one to build tent cities along the border to house more families -- were either likely to face an immediate court injunction or were so costly that they could not be justified to taxpayers. But the officials said they were under orders from the White House to push forward.

""It's like, 'O.K., why are we working on this if it's just another lawsuit in the making?'"" said a second Homeland Security official, who also spoke on the condition of anonymity. ""Everybody knows that it's going to be challenged in the courts and likely struck down. I don't think the people at the top feel like they have a choice. They just do what they are asked to do.""

The situation has become more tense in recent weeks as ICE authorities, who in the past were careful to coordinate with volunteer shelters when releasing migrants, have instead begun dropping them in large numbers in the streets in Texas, Arizona and California, forcing city officials and charity groups to scramble.

""We're dealing with the symptoms of the root cause, which is the lack of a rational immigration policy from Washington, and both sides are culpable,"" said Dee Margo, the mayor of El Paso.

City officials have been told that the government may soon increase the number of migrants released in El Paso to 500 daily. ""That may be a killer, that may be a real challenge for us to be able to deal with,"" Mr. Margo said.

The government itself is dealing with some of the most acute problems -- housing large numbers of families in border processing centers built to handle single men.

In Yuma, Ariz., 87 percent of migrants apprehended in the current fiscal year were traveling as a family, and 50 percent of them were children. Expenditures have shot up 600 percent since last year, with the money being spent on diapers, feminine care products, snacks and juice, said a Border Patrol official in the state who was not authorized to speak on the record.

While the Yuma office was approved for some overtime funding and additional agents, requests for a modular facility to house children and families have been denied, the official said. The new building would add more showers to the current number, which is three, as well as add beds and play rooms for children.

The administration's aggressive focus on deterrence has built up the frustration of the migrants themselves. After trying to jump the fence at Tijuana and fleeing a wave of tear gas on New Year's Eve, Fernando Duarte, a 22-year-old Honduran, was among those hurling rocks at Border Patrol officers. He said he was determined to try again.

""They are very wrong if they think tear gas will keep me from trying,"" Mr. Duarte said. ""I am trying to get a better future and a little gas won't stop me.""

Nowhere has the growing desperation of migrants been more apparent than in Tijuana. The high volume of migrants from Central America arriving there has collided with the Trump administration's decision to ration the number of asylum requests processed each day. Private shelters in Tijuana managed by local Christian and Catholic groups are near capacity, pushing new migrants into tent cities and improvised shelters that lack proper sanitation.

""The ones that are waiting for the door to open, they're waiting three or four months,"" said Victor Clark Alfaro, the director of the Binational Center for Human Rights in Tijuana. ""Others are getting desperate and prefer to try to cross illegally.""

In November, municipal leaders in Tijuana opened an improvised shelter at the Benito Juarez Sports Complex that turned, as Mr. Clark Alfaro put it, into a ""Central American ghetto."" The conditions there grew increasingly dismal as winter brought cold weather and rain, and about 6,000 people were crowded into the stadium at one point, far beyond its capacity of roughly 2,000. The city shut down the shelter. As a replacement, the government opened a new shelter in El Barretal on the east side of Tijuana.

The Barretal shelter is a large compound where hundreds of sleeping tents are lined up on the clean concrete floor. Freshly laundered clothes hang from balconies and staircases.

Inside, Isabel Lázaro Díaz, 30, finished the meal she had waited in a long line for: grilled chicken, rice and beans.

""On the way here, I regretted it a thousand times,"" she said of her decision to leave her native Guatemala with her 5-year-old son, adding of Mr. Trump, ""What he is doing is making us feel frustration and despair and putting us in a closed box with four closed walls, no entry or exit."""
97,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/21/us/politics/pentagon-syria-iraq-kurds.html,"WASHINGTON -- The Pentagon is considering using small teams of Special Operations forces to strike the Islamic State in Syria, one option for continuing an American military mission there despite President Trump's order to withdraw troops from the country.

The American commandos would be shifted to neighboring Iraq, where an estimated 5,000 United States forces are already deployed, and ""surge"" into Syria for specific raids, according to two military officials who spoke on the condition of anonymity.

The strike teams are one of several options -- including continued airstrikes and resupplying allied Kurdish fighters with arms and equipment -- in a new strategy for Syria that the Pentagon is developing as officials follow the order Mr. Trump gave on Wednesday for a military drawdown even as it tries to maintain pressure on the Islamic State.

The Pentagon will deliver the options to Mr. Trump for approval within weeks -- well before Defense Secretary Jim Mattis steps down at the end of February. Mr. Mattis resigned on Thursday, in part because of Mr. Trump's decision to overrule his senior advisers and withdraw troops from Syria.

Officials at the Pentagon said the plans sought to maintain American support for the Syrian Democratic Forces, a Kurdish-led militia of Arab and Kurdish soldiers who have proved to be the most successful ground fighters against the Islamic State.

But the local forces and their Western allies continue to be tested around the town of Hajin in eastern Syria, where the Islamic State is holding on to a last slice of territory. Though Mr. Trump has boasted about the Islamic State's defeat, the militant group has for months endured airstrikes and offensives by the American-backed Syrian fighters -- and has even conducted deadly counterattacks into Hajin's surrounding districts.

Under the cover of a sandstorm in October, the Islamic State nearly overran an American Special Forces team and a group of Marines outside of Hajin, wounding two American troops, a third military official said.

The group tried the same tactic again in November, waiting for a sandstorm to mask its movements, and nearly captured Gharanij, a nearby town.

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called the Trump administration's progress against the Islamic State ""extraordinary.""

""We've made the caliphate in Syria go away,"" Mr. Pompeo told National Public Radio on Friday.

""And we're very proud of that,"" he said.

Mr. Pompeo also spoke on Friday with President Barham Salih of Iraq about continued efforts to fight the Islamic State, said Robert Palladino, a State Department spokesman.

Two military officials said that the United States Central Command was planning to position a force across the border in Iraq that can return to Syria for specific missions when critical threats arise.

Derek Chollet, a former assistant defense secretary in the Obama administration, said the Pentagon could ""rename these guys, and call them a counterterrorism force.""

The Pentagon did not comment on Friday about the options. In an earlier statement, Dana W. White, the Defense Department spokeswoman, said the American military ""will continue working with our partners and allies to defeat ISIS wherever it operates.""

""The campaign against ISIS is not over,"" Ms. White said in the statement.

In 2014, when the United States began launching airstrikes in Iraq and Syria, the Islamic State controlled an area across the two countries that roughly amounted to the size of Britain. American Special Operations forces were deployed to Syria in October 2015.

By last month, the Islamic State's territory was reduced to the small pocket around Hajin -- about 1 percent of the ground it used to control.

Last week, the Syrian Democratic Forces retook the center of Hajin, forcing the militants to fall back to the town's outskirts. But the Islamic State's remaining hold on roughly 20 miles of territory has forced Defense Department officials to cull options for keeping what is left of the international campaign against the extremists from falling apart.

That will include weighing whether United States airstrikes can remain effective without American targeting guidance from the ground, and whether they would defend Kurdish forces only from the Islamic State -- and not other militants.

Officials are also discussing whether the Kurdish-led force can fight without the weapons, ammunition and other supplies that will end once the American military leaves. Even allowing the Syrian Kurds to keep guns and heavy weapons provided by the United States would break the Pentagon's 2017 pledge that the arms would be reclaimed once combat ended.

The decisions are being prepared over the year-end holidays and will be made in the coming weeks, officials said.

In April, the Pentagon began building a rough withdrawal plan from Syria after Mr. Trump threatened to leave. At the time, Mr. Mattis and other officials convinced the president to dig in.

But even that plan called for a phased departure of troops from Syria -- one that would take months, not within 30 days as is now being discussed.

French and British Special Operations forces are expected to remain in Syria after the American troops leave, according to one official. But their different military tactics, combined with the loss of American resupply routes for food and ammunition, are expected to encumber the mission.

The British Ministry of Defense said in a statement on Thursday that ""much remains to be done, and we must not lose sight of the threat"" from the Islamic State.

Officially, there are 2,000 American troops in Syria. It is likely, however, that hundreds more are there in a mix of support units, Special Operations Forces, mechanics and engineers. All are part of a web of bases, outposts and airfields spread across the northeastern corner of Syria, a model similar to those in Iraq and Afghanistan."
98,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/05/opinion/sunday/trump-impeachment.html,"The presidential oath of office contains 35 words and one core promise: to ""preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States."" Since virtually the moment Donald J. Trump took that oath two years ago, he has been violating it.

He has repeatedly put his own interests above those of the country. He has used the presidency to promote his businesses. He has accepted financial gifts from foreign countries. He has lied to the American people about his relationship with a hostile foreign government. He has tolerated cabinet officials who use their position to enrich themselves.

To shield himself from accountability for all of this -- and for his unscrupulous presidential campaign -- he has set out to undermine the American system of checks and balances. He has called for the prosecution of his political enemies and the protection of his allies. He has attempted to obstruct justice. He has tried to shake the public's confidence in one democratic institution after another, including the press, federal law enforcement and the federal judiciary.

The unrelenting chaos that Trump creates can sometimes obscure the big picture. But the big picture is simple: The United States has never had a president as demonstrably unfit for the office as Trump. And it's becoming clear that 2019 is likely to be dominated by a single question: What are we going to do about it?

The easy answer is to wait -- to allow the various investigations of Trump to run their course and ask voters to deliver a verdict in 2020. That answer has one great advantage. It would avoid the national trauma of overturning an election result. Ultimately, however, waiting is too dangerous. The cost of removing a president from office is smaller than the cost of allowing this president to remain.

He has already shown, repeatedly, that he will hurt the country in order to help himself. He will damage American interests around the world and damage vital parts of our constitutional system at home. The risks that he will cause much more harm are growing.

Some of the biggest moderating influences have recently left the administration. The defense secretary who defended our alliances with NATO and South Korea is gone. So is the attorney general who refused to let Trump subvert a federal investigation into himself. The administration is increasingly filled with lackeys and enablers. Trump has become freer to turn his whims into policy -- like, say, shutting down the government on the advice of Fox News hosts or pulling troops from Syria on the advice of a Turkish autocrat.

The biggest risk may be that an external emergency -- a war, a terrorist attack, a financial crisis, an immense natural disaster -- will arise. By then, it will be too late to pretend that he is anything other than manifestly unfit to lead.

For the country's sake, there is only one acceptable outcome, just as there was after Americans realized in 1974 that a criminal was occupying the Oval Office. The president must go.

Achieving this outcome won't be easy. It will require honorable people who have served in the Trump administration to share, publicly, what they have seen and what they believe. (At this point, anonymous leaks are not sufficient.) It will require congressional Republicans to acknowledge that they let a con man take over their party and then defended that con man. It will require Democrats and progressive activists to understand that a rushed impeachment may actually help Trump remain in office.

But if removing him will not be easy, it's not as unlikely as it may sometimes seem. From the beginning, Trump has been an unusually weak president, as political scientists have pointed out. Although members of Congress have not done nearly enough to constrain him, no other recent president has faced nearly so much public criticism or private disdain from his own party.

Since the midterm election showed the political costs that Trump inflicts on Republicans, this criticism seems to be growing. They have broken with him on foreign policy (in Saudi Arabia, Yemen and Syria) and are anxious about the government shutdown. Trump is vulnerable to any erosion in his already weak approval rating, be it from an economic downturn, more Russia revelations or simply the defection of a few key allies. When support for an unpopular leader starts to crack, it can crumble.

Before we get to the how of Trump's removal, though, I want to spend a little more time on the why -- because even talking about the ouster of an elected president should happen only under extreme circumstances. Unfortunately, the country is now so polarized that such talk instead occurs with every president. Both George W. Bush and Barack Obama were subjected to reckless calls for their impeachment, from members of Congress no less.

So let's be clear. Trump's ideology is not an impeachable offense. However much you may disagree with Trump's tax policy -- and I disagree vehemently -- it is not a reason to remove him from office. Nor are his efforts to cut government health insurance or to deport undocumented immigrants. Such issues, among others, are legitimate matters of democratic struggle, to be decided by elections, legislative debates, protests and the other normal tools of democracy. These issues are not the ""treason, bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors"" that the founders intended impeachment to address.

Yet the founders also did not intend for the removal of a president to be impossible. They insisted on including an impeachment clause in the Constitution because they understood that an incompetent or corrupt person was nonetheless likely to attain high office every so often. And they understood how much harm such a person could do. The country needed a way to address what Alexander Hamilton called ""the abuse or violation of some public trust"" and James Madison called the ""incapacity, negligence or perfidy"" of a president.

The negligence and perfidy of President Trump -- his high crimes and misdemeanors -- can be separated into four categories. This list is conservative. It does not include the possibility that his campaign coordinated strategy with Russia, which remains uncertain. It also does not include his lazy approach to the job, like his refusal to read briefing books or the many empty hours on his schedule. It instead focuses on demonstrable ways that he has broken the law or violated his constitutional oath.

Trump has used the presidency for personal enrichment.

Regardless of party, Trump's predecessors took elaborate steps to separate their personal financial interests from their governing responsibilities. They released their tax returns, so that any potential conflicts would be public. They placed their assets in a blind trust, to avoid knowing how their policies might affect their own investments.

Trump has instead treated the presidency as a branding opportunity. He has continued to own and promote the Trump Organization. He has spent more than 200 days at one of his properties and billed taxpayers for hundreds of thousands of dollars.

If this pattern were merely petty corruption, without damage to the national interest, it might not warrant removal from office. But Trump's focus on personal profit certainly appears to be affecting policy. Most worrisome, foreign officials and others have realized they can curry favor with the president by spending money at one of his properties.

Saudi Arabia has showered the Trump Organization with business, and Trump has stood by the Saudis despite their brutal war in Yemen and their assassination of a prominent critic. A Chinese government-owned company reportedly gave a $500 million loan to a Trump-backed project in Indonesia; two days later, Trump announced that he was lifting sanctions on another well-connected Chinese company.

These examples, and many more, flout Article 1 of the Constitution, which bans federal officeholders from accepting ""emoluments"" from any foreign country unless Congress approves the arrangement. Madison, when making the case for an impeachment clause, spoke of a president who ""might betray his trust to foreign powers.""

Then, of course, there is Russia. Even before Robert Mueller, the special counsel, completes his investigation, the known facts are damning enough in at least one way. Trump lied to the American people during the 2016 campaign about business negotiations between his company and Vladimir Putin's government. As president, Trump has taken steps -- in Europe and Syria -- that benefit Putin. To put it succinctly: The president of the United States lied to the country about his commercial relationship with a hostile foreign government toward which he has a strangely accommodating policy.

Combine Trump's actions with his tolerance for unethical cabinet officials -- including ones who have made shady stock trades, accepted lavish perks or used government to promote their own companies or those of their friends -- and the Trump administration is almost certainly the most corrupt in American history. It makes Warren G. Harding's Teapot Dome scandal look like, well, a tempest in a teapot.

Trump has violated campaign finance law.

A Watergate grand jury famously described Richard Nixon as ""an unindicted co-conspirator."" Trump now has his own indictment tag: ""Individual-1.""

Federal prosecutors in New York filed papers last month alleging that Trump -- identified as Individual-1 -- directed a criminal plan to evade campaign finance laws. It happened during the final weeks of the 2016 campaign, when he instructed his lawyer, Michael Cohen, to pay a combined $280,000 in hush money to two women with whom Trump evidently had affairs. Trump and his campaign did not disclose these payments, as required by law. In the two years since, Trump has lied publicly about them -- initially saying he did not know about the payments, only to change his story later.

It's worth acknowledging that most campaign finance violations do not warrant removal from office. But these payments were not most campaign finance violations. They involved large, secret payoffs in the final weeks of a presidential campaign that, prosecutors said, ""deceived the voting public."" The seriousness of the deception is presumably the reason that the prosecutors filed criminal charges against Cohen, rather than the more common penalty of civil fines for campaign finance violations.

What should happen to a president who won office with help from criminal behavior? The founders specifically considered this possibility during their debates at the Constitutional Convention. The most direct answer came from George Mason: A president who ""practiced corruption and by that means procured his appointment in the first instance"" should be subject to impeachment.

Trump has obstructed justice.

Whatever Mueller ultimately reveals about the relationship between the Trump campaign and Russia, Trump has obstructed justice to keep Mueller -- and others -- from getting to the truth.

Again and again, Trump has interfered with the investigation in ways that may violate the law and clearly do violate decades-old standards of presidential conduct. He pressured James Comey, then the F.B.I. director, to let up on the Russia investigation, as a political favor. When Comey refused, Trump fired him. Trump also repeatedly pressured Jeff Sessions, the attorney general, to halt the investigation and ultimately forced Sessions to resign for not doing so. Trump has also publicly hounded several of the government's top experts on Russian organized crime, including Andrew McCabe and Bruce Ohr.

And Trump has repeatedly lied to the American people. He has claimed, outrageously, that the Justice Department tells witnesses to lie in exchange for leniency. He has rejected, with no factual basis, the findings of multiple intelligence agencies about Russia's role in the 2016 campaign. He reportedly helped his son Donald Trump Jr. draft a false statement about a 2016 meeting with a Russian lawyer.

Obstruction of justice is certainly grounds for the removal of a president. It was the subject of the first Nixon article of impeachment passed by the House Judiciary Committee. Among other things, that article accused him of making ""false or misleading public statements for the purpose of deceiving the people of the United States.""

Trump has subverted democracy.

The Constitution that Trump swore to uphold revolves around checks and balances. It depends on the idea that the president is not a monarch. He is a citizen to whom, like all other citizens, the country's laws apply. Trump rejects this principle. He has instead tried to undermine the credibility of any independent source of power or information that does not serve his interests.

It's much more than just the Russia investigation. He has tried to delegitimize federal judges based on their ethnicity or on the president who appointed them, drawing a rare rebuke from Chief Justice John Roberts. Trump has criticized the Justice Department for indicting Republican politicians during an election year. He has called for Comey, Hillary Clinton and other political opponents of his to be jailed.

Trump has described journalists as ""the enemy of the people"" -- an insult usually leveled by autocrats. He has rejected basic factual findings from the C.I.A., the Congressional Budget Office, research scientists and others. He has told bald lies about election fraud.

Individually, these sins may not seem to deserve removal from office. Collectively, though, they exact a terrible toll on American society. They cause people to lose the faith on which a democracy depends -- faith in elections, in the justice system, in the basic notion of truth.

No other president since Nixon has engaged in behavior remotely like Trump's. To accept it without sanction is ultimately to endorse it. Unpleasant though it is to remove a president, the costs and the risks of a continued Trump presidency are worse.

What now?

The most relevant precedent for the removal of Trump is Nixon, the only American president to be forced from office because of his conduct. And two aspects of Nixon's departure tend to get overlooked today. One, he was never impeached. Two, most Republicans -- both voters and elites -- stuck by him until almost the very end. His approval rating among Republicans was still about 50 percent when, realizing in the summer of 1974 that he was doomed, he resigned.

The current political dynamics have some similarities. Whether the House of Representatives, under Democratic control, impeaches Trump is not the big question. The question is whether he loses the support of a meaningful slice of Republicans.

I know that many of Trump's critics have given up hoping that he ever will. They assume that Republican senators will go on occasionally criticizing him without confronting him. But it is a mistake to give up. The stakes are too large -- and the chances of success are too real.

Consider the following descriptions of Trump: ""terribly unfit;"" ""erratic;"" ""reckless;"" ""impetuous;"" ""unstable;"" ""a pathological liar;"" ""dangerous to a democracy;"" a concern to ""anyone who cares about our nation."" Every one of these descriptions comes from a Republican member of Congress or of Trump's own administration.

They know. They know he is unfit for office. They do not need to be persuaded of the truth. They need to be persuaded to act on it.

Democrats won't persuade them by impeaching Trump. Doing so would probably rally the president's supporters. It would shift the focus from Trump's behavior toward a group of Democratic leaders whom Republicans are never going to like. A smarter approach is a series of sober-minded hearings to highlight Trump's misconduct. Democrats should focus on easily understandable issues most likely to bother Trump's supporters, like corruption.

If this approach works at all -- or if Mueller's findings shift opinion, or if a separate problem arises, like the economy -- Trump's Republican allies will find themselves in a very difficult spot. At his current approval rating of about 40 percent, Republicans were thumped in the midterms. Were his rating to fall further, a significant number of congressional Republicans would be facing long re-election odds in 2020.

Two examples are Cory Gardner of Colorado and Susan Collins of Maine, senators who, not coincidentally, have shown tentative signs of breaking with Trump on the government shutdown. The recent criticism from Mitt Romney -- who alternates between critical and sycophantic, depending on his own political interests -- is another sign of Trump's weakness.

For now, most Republicans worry that a full break with Trump will cause them to lose a primary, and it might. But sticking by him is no free lunch. Just ask the 27 Republican incumbents who were defeated last year and are now former members of Congress. By wide margins, suburban voters and younger voters find Trump abhorrent. The Republican Party needs to hold its own among these voters, starting in 2020.

It's not only that Trump is unfit to be president and that Republicans know it. It also may be the case that they will soon have a political self-interest in abandoning him. If they did, the end could come swiftly. The House could then impeach Trump, knowing the Senate might act to convict. Or negotiations could begin over whether Trump deserves to trade resignation for some version of immunity.

Finally, there is the hope -- naïve though it may seem -- that some Republicans will choose to act on principle. There now exists a small club of former Trump administration officials who were widely respected before joining the administration and whom Trump has sullied, to greater or lesser degrees. It includes Rex Tillerson, Gary Cohn, H.R. McMaster and Jim Mattis. Imagine if one of them gave a television interview and told the truth about Trump. Doing so would be a service to their country at a time of national need. It would be an illustration of duty.

Throughout his career, Trump has worked hard to invent his own reality, and largely succeeded. It has made him very rich and, against all odds, elected him president. But whatever happens in 2019, his false version of reality will not survive history, just as Nixon's did not. Which side of that history do today's Republicans want to be on?

99,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/16/business/education-dept-cancels-plan-for-new-student-loan-system-and-will-try-again.html,"Just seven months before the scheduled release of a new technology system intended to simplify the repayment process for more than 35 million federal student loan borrowers, the Education Department is scrapping its plan and starting over.

The government is the primary lender for students who borrow for college, but it relies on eight outside contractors to service its $1.3 trillion portfolio. Those companies send out monthly bills, collect payments and guide former students through a repayment process that can take decades.

All of the servicers' contracts expire next year. The Education Department planned to use that opportunity for a major overhaul that would replace its fragmented system with a more streamlined one.

Education Secretary Betsy DeVos described the agency's vision last year and called for proposals from vendors to build it. In September, the department named the companies that would advance to the next round of bidding.

But seven companies, including Navient, filed legal challenges over the contracting process, saying it was filled with procedural errors. The Education Department ""improperly created an unlevel playing field"" by heavily altering its plans late in the process, Navient said in a lawsuit in October in the United States Court of Federal Claims.

Navient and others asked the department to cancel its project proposal and restart the solicitation process. On Friday, the agency agreed to do that. It said in a court filing that it would post a new contract solicitation next month.

That puts the agency up against a tight deadline. Several of its servicing contracts expire in June. The department had hoped to have much of its new system built by then -- an already challenging goal that now seems impossible.

Liz Hill, an Education Department spokeswoman, said the agency still planned to make ""major improvements"" to its student loan system next year. The agency can extend its existing servicing contracts, she said, and will do so as needed.

""The department continues to take steps to ensure the smoothest transition possible for federal student loan borrowers,"" Ms. Hill said.

A Navient spokesman declined to comment on the agency's decision.

The Education Department began planning to overhaul its servicing system more than four years ago, during the Obama administration. Bureaucratic challenges and political infighting have slowed it at nearly every step, according to those who have followed the process closely.

""It's been a disaster,"" said Colleen Campbell, the associate director for postsecondary education at the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning group. ""The servicers really don't want to change from what the system is now.""

Student loan debt has more than doubled in the last decade, eclipsing every other kind of consumer debt besides mortgages. For many young adults, it is their largest financial obligation, and it can become a crippling one.

The government offers dozens of repayment options, including income-based plans that are supposed to keep payments affordable. But guiding borrowers through the complex thicket of plans can be complicated.

Federal loan servicers have for years faced accusations and lawsuits over collection tactics that critics have said are often shoddy and sometimes illegal. Two of them, Navient and the Pennsylvania Higher Education Assistance Agency, are fighting lawsuits from state attorneys general who say the companies made mistakes that added millions of dollars to borrowers' tabs.

Navient is also the subject of a high-profile lawsuit by the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. The company has denied any wrongdoing.

The Education Department hoped that its new system would fix some of the servicing problems through better technology and a more standardized process. The core of its overhaul is a planned new website that would help borrowers better manage their accounts and understand their payment choices.

""Repaying a student loan should not be complicated and it should not be frustrating,"" Ms. DeVos said at an industry conference last month. ""You can pay your car loan on your phone and manage your mortgage on an app. A student loan should be just as easy to handle.""

That remains the department's vision, but putting it into practice now seems likely to take years longer than planned.

""We're stuck with the system we have, which is incredibly frustrating, because everyone knows the system is bad and no one likes the system,"" Ms. Campbell said. ""This means we just have to keep kicking the can down the road."""
100,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/14/us/politics/trump-food-restaurants.html,"WASHINGTON -- President Trump was in a Washington food fracas before he was even elected.

He landed in the middle of two lawsuits in the summer of 2016 with restaurateurs who had backed out of opening establishments in the Trump International Hotel near the White House, and by 2017 was tangling with the owners of the Cork Wine Bar, who claimed the hotel amounted to unfair competition.

Those were on top of his eating fried chicken eaten with a fork, and an unfortunate taco bowl incident. His first meal as commander in chief was an overcooked steak with ketchup, which set off a minor freakout among food critics. Local restaurants waited in vain to serve a new president, who they soon discovered prefers burgers and the White House meatloaf at home.

Of the myriad Obama administration policies and practices that have been upturned by Mr. Trump, his approach to dining and nutrition is clearly not the most significant. But it has left a notable mark on the culture of the White House and the nation's capital.

Gone are the days of local chefs parading through the East Wing, running cooking demonstrations on the South Lawn or making sweet potato agnolotti for a White House state dinner. A culinary diplomacy program at the State Department has been closed. Beyond the White House gates, Trump administration officials have increasingly found themselves in the cross hairs of liberal rage while dining out.

""It has changed a lot,'' said Victor Albisu, who owns Poca Madre and Taco Bamba and who cooked at the White House under Presidents George W. Bush and Barack Obama. ""I have not cooked for anybody in the administration. It's a polarizing time for people, and a table full of food and drinks is the place to put aside those differences. I think this has been a net loss for everyone.""

The change reflects Mr. Trump's lifestyle and political differences from the previous administration. The Obamas took an unusual interest in eating out and food policy -- refashioning school lunch menus was one of Michelle Obama's central causes. So far, the only restaurant the Trumps are known to have frequented in Washington is the steakhouse at the Trump Hotel.

Mr. Trump, a proud and well-documented non-foodie, prefers fast food and overflowing bowls of ice cream to charred brussels sprouts or shakshuka from Washington restaurants with wait-lists. Mrs. Trump, who does not share her husband's eating habits -- she is partial to fruit and fish, with an occasional weakness for pasta -- has maintained Mrs. Obama's White House kitchen garden, but it has not been the focus of East Wing events.

The exceptions are Ivanka Trump, the president's daughter, and her husband, Jared Kushner, who dine out at some of the city's hot spots: Chez Billy Sud, Fiola Mare, RPM Italian and Le Diplomat. They have also found a comfortable landing spot at Cafe Milano, an outpost of bipartisan consumption of overpriced pasta.

The Trump's only state dinner so far, honoring President Emmanuel Macron of France, featured American and French touches -- goat cheese gâteau, a rack of spring lamb, burnt cipolline soubise, jambalaya and a nectarine tarte with crème fraîche ice cream for dessert. Among the guests was the celebrated French chef Guy Savoy, who was invited by Mr. Macron -- not to cook but as a member of the official French delegation. It was a rare chef sighting in the White House, even if Mr. Savoy was not in the kitchen.

A number of chefs said that although the Trumps might not be asking, they feared the backlash from liberal patrons if they turned up in Mr. Trump's kitchen. ""I don't know a chef in their right mind who would cook in this White House,"" said Dan Barber, the chef and co-owner of Blue Hill in New York and Blue Hill at Stone Barns in Westchester County in New York, and who served on Mr. Obama's fitness commission.

A spokeswoman for the East Wing declined to comment for this article.

A slow march to culinary diplomacy at the White House

The history of cooking at the White House reflects much about the country's political history.

""Most of the cooks in presidential history have been family cooks, enslaved people, military cooks and African-Americans who were not professionally trained in terms of going to culinary school,"" said Adrian Miller, the author of ""The President's Kitchen Cabinet: The Story of the African Americans Who Have Fed Our First Families, from the Washingtons to the Obamas."" Professional cooks, he said, are ""really more a phenomenon of the modern presidency.""

Over the years, professionals were sometimes called in to help with large events at the White House. ""When my husband needed help for things like Luci Johnson's wedding, he got some chefs to come down and work after they were cleared by the F.B.I.,"" said Carole Haller, the wife of Henry Haller, who served as the White House chef for five administrations.

As first lady, Hillary Clinton shook up formal dinners at the White House by showcasing American cuisine and replacing the traditional butler service -- guests serving themselves from silver platters held by white-gloved staff -- with plated meals. When she became secretary of state, Mrs. Clinton deployed iconic American chefs to work as ""culinary ambassadors"" overseas, and to bring back what they learned about the foodways of other nations.

The Culinary Diplomacy program, which ended with the Obama administration, was the ultimate form of soft diplomacy, its supporters said. When Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Secretary Clinton invited Vice President Xi Jinping of China for a state luncheon, Ming Tsai, a famous Chinese-American chef from Boston, created the menu.

""I escorted V.P. Xi into the Monroe Room to introduce him to the vice president and Secretary Clinton,"" said Capricia Marshall, a former chief of protocol. ""Secretary Clinton then introduced Ming to V.P. Xi and I immediately saw his eyes light up. He was so taken by the gesture, the honor. He and Ming began to speak to one another and not even the interpreter could keep up. It was clear that we had achieved our goal, diplomacy through this culinary engagement. And the meal was spectacular.""

But the ultimate marriage of chefs and politics was made during the Obama White House, when Michelle Obama's policy agenda of improving children's eating met culinary fandom.

""We entered the White House with a very clear objective of trying to lift up food and chefs and the entire culinary world,"" said Sam Kass, a former White House chef and senior policy adviser for nutrition.

""The first thing we started doing was bringing in guests chefs for state dinners,"" he said. ""That was a really big deal, although not everyone loved the concept at the time.""

Among the stars was Marcus Samuelsson, an American citizen who was born in Ethiopia and raised in Sweden, who cooked at a state dinner for Prime Minister Manmohan Singh of India.

The White House garden also became a showcase for chefs, with harvest parties featuring chefs like Tom Colicchio and Rachael Ray on the South Lawn. The ultimate event was the annual Easter egg roll, which under the Obamas became a combination egg hunt and health fair. Celebrity chefs like José Andrés and Spike Mendelsohn were almost White House regulars.

No longer, at least as far as anyone can tell. ""There could be some high-caliber chefs who have been in there and we just don't know it,"" said Eddie Gehman Kohan, who is writing a culinary biography of the Obama White House. ""If you cook there, you're not going to publicize it because a large portion of your clientele will hate you. People are well aware of what the risk is if they are not in a hard Trump area of the country.""

Administration officials meet hostility at dinner

The risks extend to Trump administration officials who have been yelled at by patrons while dining out. Among them are Scott Pruitt, the former Environmental Protection Agency administrator, and Kirstjen Nielsen, the homeland security secretary. Stephen Miller, Mr. Trump's senior policy adviser and a hard-liner on immigration, was heckled and called a fascist at a Mexican restaurant, and later complained that a bartender at another restaurant followed him into the street and raised both middle fingers when Mr. Miller went to pick up a sushi order.

Senator Ted Cruz, Republican of Texas, found himself shouted out of the fancy Italian spot Fiola when he went to dine with his wife, Heidi, after Mr. Cruz's vote to confirm Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court.

""During the Obama years, I remember popular lists featured on various media outlets highlighting all of the Obama's and their administration's favorite culinary hot spots,"" said Kwame Onwuachi, the chef of Kith/Kin, an Afro-Caribbean restaurant on the Wharf waterfront in Washington. ""I would say things are definitely different here at this time.''

Oh, and all those lawsuits? The ones with the restaurateurs were settled, while a federal judge told Cork Wine Bar owners that they failed to make their case, which was dismissed. Check please!"

Good evening. Here's the latest.

1. President Trump made a surprise visit to U.S. troops in Iraq.

It was his first visit to troops stationed abroad in a combat zone.

The trip, shrouded in secrecy, came in the midst of a partial government shutdown and less than a week after Mr. Trump announced plans to withdraw all troops from Syria and about half of those stationed in Afghanistan.

The president's decision on Syria led to the resignation of his defense secretary, Jim Mattis.

Mr. Trump told reporters on the ground at Joint Base al Asad that he had no plans to withdraw troops from Iraq. Instead, he said, the U.S. may use Iraq as a military base to carry out operations on Syria and fight the Islamic State.

Separately, the partial government shutdown was triggered by a stalemate over the president's demand for funding to build a wall along the southern border. Here's what you need to know about it.

2. Stocks snapped their losing streak.

Early reports of a strong holiday season for retailers and reassuring news from Washington and Moscow pulled Wall Street from the brink of a bear market. Above, the New York Stock Exchange.

Stocks posted their best day since 2009, as sales data showed spending by U.S. consumers remains vibrant and Russia signaled that it was willing to help keep oil prices higher.

Investors were also reassured by a White House official's statement that Jerome H. Powell's job as Federal Reserve chairman was ""100 percent"" safe.

3. President Trump's retreat on the environment is unfolding in consequential ways.

In two years, Mr. Trump has unleashed a large-scale rollback of environmental regulations, promoting the changes as creating jobs, freeing business from government intervention and helping the economy grow.

Our journalists examined the many ways regulatory changes are affecting communities across the nation.

The impact of the changes is being felt across the U.S., imperiling progress in cleaning up the air and water.

In California, farm workers are being sickened by a pesticide that the Obama administration tried to ban. In the heart of West Virginia's coal country, the state's largest inland waterway is being contaminated with a pollutant that can wipe out aquatic life. In Houston, a coal-burning power plant is getting a free pass to continue spewing harmful levels of sulfur dioxide into the air. Above, a pipeline in North Dakota.

4. New Ebola treatments often fail to reach those who need them, The Times has found.

In eastern Congo, violence and clashes between government forces and a militia group are hampering efforts to contain the lethal virus.

Our correspondent followed a team of health workers to a militia-controlled village in Congo where a woman had died from Ebola. Their quest: to persuade the insurgents to allow health workers in to treat the villagers. Above, in the Kanyihunga district.

""We're afraid they might kill us,"" one health worker said.

5. An imaginary boundary may soon become real.

For the past 20 years, people, goods and livestock have been able to come and go as they pleased between Britain and the Republic of Ireland, because both are members of the E.U.

But Britain's looming exit from the European bloc, known widely as Brexit, threatens to make the old border real again.

The result: trade disruptions, tariffs and friction that could reinvigorate conflict between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland.

""It would be a real backward step,"" one Irish dairy farmer told us. ""Back to the Dark Ages.""

6. Archaeologists uncovered a horse frozen in time.

Saddled and ready to go, a purebred that perished centuries ago near Pompeii has been uncovered.

The petrified horse, wearing a bronze-plated military saddle, is the latest discovery at the site near Mount Vesuvius, which erupted and buried the area in lava and ash in A.D. 79.

Other finds this year include a shrine with wall paintings that hint at Roman life in the first century; the skeleton of a man who had fled the eruption only to be buried by a rock; and a well-preserved fresco on the wall of a house.

Archaeologists are excavating the surroundings of a prestigious villa, with plans to open it to the public.

7. Movie makeup is evolving.

Artists who transformed Christian Bale into a startling likeness of Dick Cheney for ""Vice,"" above, relied on advances in materials and technology for creating prosthetics.

For the biography of the former vice president, artists pored over photos and videos, paying particular attention to Mr. Cheney's most prominent features, like the silhouette of his nose and the dimple on his chin. (Read our review of ""Vice."")

We take a look at the process, and at the evolution of movie makeup, from ""Frankenstein"" through ""The Elephant Man.""

""The most successful makeups aren't the ones where you're trying to completely hide the actor,"" one artist told us.

9. The Year in Pictures 2018, at first glance, is indeed a retrospective of the year we are about to leave behind.

But if many of the photographs seem, on closer inspection, like a recurring nightmare, it's because they are. Most of the crises, conflicts and natural disasters they capture aren't new, but have dragged on from previous years.

And if we look even more closely, we realize these are in fact photographs about the future. Above, competing in the 2018 Olympic Games in Pyeongchang, South Korea.

Take a look for yourself.

10. Finally, evidence that the pen is mightier than pixels.

The fountain pen has been imperiled by disposable ballpoints, and the keyboard seemed positioned to kill it off entirely.

But reformulated inks and redesigned pens, above, are finding a new audience among writers who are rediscovering the tactile pleasure of paper. Hands don't cramp. Thoughts promise to pour out easily.

""People describe drawing ink into their pen from an ink bottle and wiping the nib as a Zenlike experience,"" one aficionado told us.

By any measure, 2018 was another Year of Trump. From his efforts to remake the American economy to his go-it-alone trade war to his curious pro-Putin foreign policy to the at least 17 investigations underway into his various activities, President Trump dominated the news as few of his predecessors have done. But by the end of his second year, the prospects that he would achieve his economic goals were in grave doubt as growth slowed and the stock market swooned.

A 40-Seat Rebuke of an Unpopular President

Since Inauguration Day, Mr. Trump's approval rating, according to the monthly Gallup poll, has averaged 39 percent (a record low for a new president). Voters emphatically registered their disappointment in the midterm elections. As statistical analyses of past midterm elections have shown, the approval rating of the president is more closely correlated to midterm success than the state of the economy is.

This year was no exception. In the House of Representatives, Republicans lost 40 seats (or possibly 41; one race has yet to be called). Meanwhile, Democrats picked up seven governorships. Although the Democrats had a net loss of two seats in the Senate, not one Democrat running for the upper chamber in a state carried by Hillary Clinton lost, while Democrats won in seven states carried by Mr. Trump. Happily, all of this occurred in the context of the highest turnout of eligible voters since 1914.

Alarming Churn in the White House

As the departure of Defense Secretary Jim Mattis illustrated, the chaos at the Trump White House is striking relative to past presidents. In two years, 65 percent of the president's most senior aides have departed. That's the highest of any president since Ronald Reagan, and it's similar to the turnover experienced by many of Mr. Trump's predecessors over an entire four-year term. (President Barack Obama had the lowest turnover, at 24 percent.)

Other fun facts: Mr. Trump has had five communications directors, and with the appointment of Mick Mulvaney as acting chief of staff, Mr. Trump has now had three, a record for the first two years of an administration. Mr. Trump has seen 10 departures from his cabinet, compared to four for Mr. Obama and one for President George W. Bush.

Another Boast Debunked

""I will be the greatest jobs producer that God ever created.""

-- Donald Trump shortly after the 2016 election

Mr. Trump takes to Twitter frequently to extol the pace of job growth, which has, indeed, been solid. The problem with Mr. Trump's victory lap is that job growth during his administration has been slightly slower than it was during the last 22 months of Mr. Obama's tenure: 4.2 million Americans hired under Mr. Trump versus 4.8 million under Mr. Obama. More worrisome is that Mr. Trump's policies have done little to help manufacturing workers, whose votes in key states helped elect him; their share of total employment has not improved.

A Paltry Raise for the Middle Class

While jobs capture the headlines, an equally important measure is wages. There, the news is not good. Real wages (after adjusting for inflation) have barely grown under Mr. Trump; President Obama fared modestly better. And the principal beneficiaries of the wage increases that have occurred have been Americans with incomes in the top 10 percent and in the bottom 10 percent.

The former is not surprising; the latter has to do in large part with high demand for unskilled workers (think of the pay increases put in place by Amazon and Wal-Mart) together with increases in the minimum wage by many states. That has left the middle 80 percent of Americans with wages that continued to decline in real terms through 2017 and only inched up in 2018. This will prove yet another challenge for Mr. Trump as he tries to convince voters in 2020 that his economic program is working.

Billions in Tax Cuts, but Not the Promised Growth

The centerpiece of Mr. Trump's program was the $1.9 trillion tax cut that was passed in December 2017 amid promises of an immediate investment boom. So far, that has proved a mirage.

Yes, investment did jump in the first half of 2018 -- when you provide huge tax subsidies for investment, it's no surprise that companies will do more of it. But that surge evaporated in the third quarter. Goldman Sachs is predicting a less than 5 percent increase in investment next year.

For new investment to raise the economy's growth rate over a longer term, it would have to climb to a much higher level and stay there, which appears unlikely. So much for the argument, presented in a letter from nine respected conservative economists to Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, that the tax cut would raise the growth rate for G.D.P. to 3 percent to 4 percent.

A Debt Bigger Than the G.D.P.

The tax cut, combined with an equally formidable new spending bill, is producing one of the biggest peacetime federal budget deficits. As low as $439 billion in 2015, the fiscal gap is now on track to exceed $1 trillion in 2020. Over the coming decade, that could mean $16 trillion more in federal debt.

If all the tax law's provisions are extended, the ratio of debt to gross domestic product for the United States will exceed 100 percent for the first time since World War II. Among the many unpleasant consequences of that: Annual interest on the national debt will be higher than the cost of defense and also of Medicaid by about 2022.

The Worsening Global Outlook

In recent weeks, the United States stock market has lost all of its gains since September 2017 -- gains that Mr. Trump claimed resulted from his economic policies. The stock market is on track for its worst December since 1931. What's going on? After a burst of economic optimism, investors have turned bearish, and chatter about a coming recession is becoming more common.

Since June, JPMorgan has cut its global growth forecast from 3.2 percent to 3 percent. That may not sound like much, but it's an estimated $170 billion of lost output. China is feeling shaky and Europe -- grappling with problems ranging from Brexit to weak Italian banks -- is faltering. As for the United States, perhaps only Mr. Trump believes we will achieve the promised 3 percent plus growth next year; about 2.5 percent seems more realistic, and some economists expect an even greater slowdown.

A Bad Sign for the Economy

The Federal Reserve did all it could to telegraph December's rate increase. Yet the stock market promptly swooned. That was because the Fed only modestly cut back on its expectations for interest rate increases in 2019, to two from the three previously forecast. But the futures markets, which have historically been better predictors than the Fed itself, foresee no rate increase next year and a cut in 2020.

That's good news for those who will be borrowing for homes or cars, but it's a bad signal for the economy as a whole, because it suggests that economic weakness may be coming. It's particularly bad news for Mr. Trump, who could find himself running for re-election in a slowdown or even a recession. After four years in office, it's going to be very hard for him to pin that on Mr. Obama or the Democrats.

Apprehensions at the Border Remain Low

If your only source of news was Mr. Trump's tweets, you might assume that illegal immigrants are flooding across the borders of the United States. The reality is different. Since 2000, when about 1.6 million people were apprehended at the southwestern border, the total has plummeted and is now hovering around 400,000.

It's true that the mix has changed: Fewer Mexicans attempt to cross as their country's economy improves, but violence and poor economic conditions have sent many families from Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador heading north. I'll spare you the usual argument about the contribution that immigrants make to America, but here's one interesting fact: The incarceration rate for illegal immigrants is only half that of people born in this country -- and that includes those jailed for immigration offenses.

Doing Their Best to Sabotage Obamacare

Less noticed amid Trump news has been slipping enrollment in the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare. From a peak of 12.7 million enrollees in 2016, sign-ups through the exchanges have been declining.

The total for 2019 is projected to be approximately 11.4 million, according to Charles Gaba, an analyst who follows Obamacare closely. He attributes that decline, in part, to ""sabotage."" The requirement that all Americans have health care has essentially been gutted. The open enrollment period was cut by half. Funding for ""navigators"" who help people enroll, was slashed. Advertising was reduced by 90 percent. And a federal judge in Texas recently issued a decision that could invalidate Obamacare altogether.

The only good news is that after several years of hefty raises by insurance companies fearful of losing money on the new product, premium increases have slowed significantly and may fall slightly in 2019.

103,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/26/world/middleeast/syria-future.html,"BEIRUT, Lebanon -- Turkey is threatening to invade Syria to eradicate Kurdish fighters. Syrian forces are rolling toward territory the Americans will soon abandon. Israel is bombing Iran-backed militias deep inside Syria. And Russia could soon move to crush the last vestige of the Syrian anti-government insurgency.

The Syria that the United States military is vacating on President Trump's orders is a Balkanized version of the country that plunged into a calamitous civil war nearly eight years ago.

Now, with the American troop withdrawal and the demise of the insurgency against President Bashar al-Assad, Iran and Russia will be even freer to flex their power in Syria.

""Welcome to the post-American Middle East,"" Richard N. Haass, a longtime diplomat and president of the Council on Foreign Relations, said in a Twitter post on Wednesday.

A look at the changing complexities of the Syria conflict:

What could postwar Syria look like?

After years of bloodshed set in motion by the Arab Spring protests that had inspired hope for democratic change, the most likely Syrian future, Middle East analysts project, is a far more brittle version of what existed before the war: Mr. Assad leading a repressive government puppeteered by Russia and Iran.

Both countries are longtime allies of Mr. Assad's. By rescuing him with Russian airpower and Iranian manpower, they have embedded themselves even further.

Shiite Iran, which competes with Sunni powers led by Saudi Arabia for influence across the region, has sent tens of thousands of Iranian and proxy fighters to Syria. It is building Shiite shrines and strengthening Shiite militias that it hopes to use as leverage against Israel.

Russia, which already exerted considerable political influence in Syria, holds sway over its foreign policy, military and security services. That is part of the price Moscow exacted for having protected Mr. Assad, a brutal autocrat once described by Western leaders as finished.

What do Russia and Iran get in return?

Although they may find staying in Syria costly, frustrating and unpopular back home, Russia and Iran have secured an advantage from outlasting the United States: regional clout.

For both countries, this is ""the dream scenario,"" said Daniel Benaim, a fellow focusing on the Middle East at the Center for American Progress, a liberal research group in Washington. ""They get to tell the story that they've been telling to every actor on the ground -- America's friends and America's foes alike -- that America is no longer a reliable partner in the Middle East.""

Why were American soldiers in Syria?

Two thousand Americans were deployed in northeast Syria, collaborating with Kurdish-led forces to wipe the Islamic State from the area. But that partnership angered neighboring Turkey, which sees the autonomy-minded Kurds as a dangerous enemy.

How -- or even if -- the fight against the Islamic State in Syria will now proceed remains unclear. An estimated 30,000 Islamic State adherents are believed scattered in the country.

Many experts anticipate that a hasty American pullout could spawn another major battle, either as Turkey moves to crush its Kurdish foes, or as Mr. Assad's forces retake the northeast, or both.

It is possible that the Kurds and Mr. Assad could come to a deal first. If not, a new round of fighting could send new waves of refugees -- Kurds and others -- fleeing toward Iraq in a new round of mayhem that could also help incubate the Islamic State's revival.

""That's absolutely a possibility, the risk of total chaos,"" said Aron Lund, a Syria analyst and fellow at the Century Foundation, a think tank, ""when the thing that's been keeping the situation stable -- not saying it was good or bad, but stable -- just disappears in a puff of smoke.""

Who will occupy the territory vacated by the Americans?

According to the Institute for the Study of War, Russia, Iran and Iran-backed militias, including the Lebanese Shiite group Hezbollah, are well-positioned to seize territory in northeast Syria abandoned by the United States. They occupy 29 nearby positions, according to the group, and a further seven across the Iraq border.

The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which tracks Syria's war via a network of citizen monitors, said on Sunday that the Syrian government had dispatched thousands of fighters toward the Islamic State's last patches of territory in the northeast.

What remains of the anti-Assad insurgency?

The last major redoubt of the rebels opposed to Mr. Assad are crowded into Idlib Province in northwestern Syria, neighboring Turkey. Russia may help Mr. Assad's forces retake the province eventually. But Russia also is expected to first negotiate with Turkey, which has supported anti-Assad groups and has a vested interest in what happens along its border with Syria.

How have the changes affected Israel?

Analysts say Iran can now link Shiite partners in Iraq, Syria and Lebanon in a unified front against Israel. In Syria, Iran and Hezbollah aim to strengthen a military presence near the Golan Heights, annexed by Israel after it was captured in the 1967 war.

Israel has made clear it will not tolerate an increased threat from Syria, which the Israelis demonstrated on Tuesday with airstrikes near Damascus.

The Russians, who have good relations with Israel, have tacitly allowed it to conduct such operations in the past. Still, the Kremlin protested on Wednesday what it called Israel's ""gross violation"" of Syrian sovereignty.

How is Iran Changing Syria?

The Iranian-led Shiite partnership in Syria faces a basic shortcoming: few Shiites in a Sunni-majority country. Still, Iran has extended its influence among both Syrian fighters and civilians.

In some parts of Syria, Iran has distributed cash to pay for housing to people displaced by the war; in others, it has established Shiite shrines that, according to the Observatory, have drawn visitors from Iran, Iraq and Syria.

Defying the Syrian government's historic secularism, Iran and Hezbollah have infused parts of the country with a strikingly religious tint. It was rare in the past, for example, to see celebrations for Ashura, a major Shiite holiday, in non-Shiite areas of Damascus. Now, however, Ashura parades and rituals are much more visible.

Some soldiers in the historically secular Syrian army have become more religious after joining Iran-backed Shiite militias. Others have switched to such militias for nonreligious reasons. Fighters in Iran-backed groups receive better pay and more days off than the army offers, and joining a Shiite militia does not necessarily mean converting to Shiism. But it is a marked shift from the old way.

""It's no longer purely secular,"" said Ali Rizk, a Beirut-based analyst who writes about Iran. He said Iran and Hezbollah have spread their Shiite beliefs among some of the Syrian forces. ""It's only human -- after all, these units were coordinating with each other, fighting side by side.""

Are Russians welcomed in Syria?

Russia has cemented ties with Syrian leaders, strengthened relations with Turkey and eclipsed the United States as the power to contend with in the Middle East.

The Russians have also demonstrated a canny understanding of Syrian sensitivities -- dispatching military policemen from Russia's predominantly Sunni Muslim Chechnya region, for example, to negotiate rebel withdrawals and keep the peace in Sunni areas retaken by Mr. Assad's side.

On a visit to the formerly insurgent-held southern suburbs of Damascus in October, three Russian military policemen were patrolling with a green armored vehicle that bore the Russian flag. Syrians greeted them in Arabic, sometimes throwing in a ""privyet"" -- ""hi"" in Russian.

Many have welcomed the Russians, preferring them to the government's security enforcers or to Shiite militiamen backed by Iran. Those in the area who still opposed the government said they were heartened in the spring, when a YouTube video showed Russian military policemen arresting Syrian soldiers accused of looting. Then, in June, when Shiite militiamen arrested two Sunni men, the Russians pressured the militias into releasing them, residents said.

The incidents helped persuade residents that Russia has no interest in stoking Sunni-Shiite frictions, and could counter any moves by Mr. Assad's forces to exact revenge on the opposition.

""Iran has a sectarian project,"" said Ahmed al-Buqa'a, 55, who had three sons fight with the rebels, ""but Russia doesn't care about people's ethnic and religious backgrounds.""

Could Russia and Iran diverge over Syria's future?

Iran and Russia are already in a competition, with Russia wanting a self-supporting Syrian government weaned from Russian military and financial help, and Iran preferring something weaker, analysts said. Both countries have already begun placing advisers in Syrian security agencies, said Joost Hiltermann, the Middle East program director for the International Crisis Group.

But both face challenges to staying in Syria. Neither can afford Syria's reconstruction, which by some reckonings could exceed $200 billion.

The Russians ""want to find an exit from Syria basically, militarily, leaving in place their two bases and their own people within the security apparatus, and Russian companies to help with reconstruction,"" Mr. Hiltermann said. ""They don't want to get bogged down militarily.""

The Iranian government has faced opposition to its military adventures in Syria at home, where the economy has been deeply strained by American sanctions.

Danielle Pletka, senior vice president for foreign and defense policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative Washington research group, said the Iranians had so far exercised power deftly in Syria, ""but it's going to be a lot harder for them to do that given the economic straits they're in.""

Both patrons may find Syria's stability hard to re-establish under Mr. Assad. Already, peaceful protests against him have been staged in areas where he has reasserted control, analysts said.

""Peacetime will present challenges that the war let him paper over,"" said Alexander Bick, a lecturer and research scholar at Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies who oversaw Syria issues at the National Security Council under the Obama administration.

""The Russians are very keenly aware,"" he said, ""that Assad's position is fragile, the economy is totally destroyed, and politically it's a mess."""
104,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/31/briefing/border-wall-nfl-new-years-eve.html,"Good morning,

We start the final day of 2018 with the continuing government shutdown, a look at the changing demographics of Southern California and an investigation into the C.I.A.'s shadow war in Afghanistan.

Both sides dig in on budget impasse

With the partial government shutdown now in its second week, President Trump has reassured allies that he won't yield on his request for $5 billion in funding for a border wall. But negotiations with Democratic leaders are at a standstill, and each side says the ball is in the other's court.

What's next: Democrats are preparing to pass a bill to fund the government as soon as they take control of the House on Thursday. However, uncertainty over what Mr. Trump might sign threatens to extend the shutdown, which affects 800,000 federal workers and has shuttered parts of nine cabinet-level departments.

Another angle: The concrete wall that Mr. Trump has repeatedly called for isn't actually a wall and hasn't been viewed as such since ""early on in the administration,"" the departing White House chief of staff, John Kelly, said in an interview. Mr. Kelly's last day on the job is today.

A conservative bastion in California is swept away

Democrats flipped four Republican-held congressional seats last month in Orange County, which had been a Republican stronghold for decades.

The results reflected an increase in the number of immigrants, nonwhite residents and college graduates that has transformed the Los Angeles region, a Times analysis of demographic data going back to 1980 shows.

Notable: The shift is viewed by leaders in both parties as a warning sign for Republicans, as suburban communities like Orange County are likely to be battlegrounds in the 2020 elections and beyond.

C.I.A.-led forces leave trail of abuse in Afghanistan

Afghan forces trained and overseen by the Central Intelligence Agency have managed to hold the line against militant groups including the Taliban and the Islamic State.

But the forces have also operated outside battlefield rules intended to protect civilians, conducting night raids, torture and killings. Some Afghan and U.S. officials say the campaign is alienating the Afghan population and undermining American efforts to strengthen Afghan institutions.

How we know: For months, The Times has investigated complaints -- at times almost weekly -- that the C.I.A.-sponsored units have conducted raids on or killed civilians. The Times went to the sites of half a dozen raids, often less than 24 hours after the forces had left.

How McKinsey became entangled in a major bribery case

In 2006, Boeing hired the prestigious consulting firm to evaluate a proposal to mine titanium in India, through a foreign partnership financed by the Ukranian oligarch Dmitry Firtash.

McKinsey's evaluation included a PowerPoint slide that described the potential partner's strategy for winning mining permits, which included bribing Indian officials.

The mining venture never materialized, but the PowerPoint slide, now known as Exhibit A, is a critical piece of evidence in the tangled international battle over the extradition of Mr. Firtash, who has been charged in the U.S. with bribery.

Why it matters: The case exposes what McKinsey and other American consulting firms risk as they conduct business in countries where ethical standards are not the same as those at home.

He was a brash Brazilian-born and Lebanese- and French-educated engineer who flourished at Renault. In 1999, he went to Japan with plans to carry out an American-style restructuring of a failing Nissan. He wasn't expected to succeed, but he did.

Now, just as unexpectedly, Carlos Ghosn is in a Tokyo jail, accused of failing to report millions of dollars of income.

Here's what else is happening

Syria withdrawal: Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina suggested on Sunday that President Trump's plan to pull American troops from Syria within 30 days had been slowed. Mr. Graham, a Republican critic of the president's decision, said that he felt ""a lot better"" about it after a lunch at the White House.

And now for the Back Story on ...Lighting the way to 2019

The new year will arrive in a wave around the world tonight, beginning at the international date line, an imaginary marker in the Pacific that signals the change of one calendar day to the next.

One hour later, the new year will begin in Sydney, Australia. Hong Kong and Beijing will enter 2019 after four hours, Moscow after nine, Paris after 11 and London after 12 -- the same as what was once known as Greenwich Mean Time, home to the prime meridian, halfway around the world from the international date line.

After 17 hours, 2019 will begin in New York, where hundreds of thousands of revelers will gather in Times Square -- one of the world's brightest outdoor spaces, with a long history of neon lights and signs.

The famous ball that will drop there at midnight is lit by 32,256 LEDs, or light-emitting diodes. LEDs maximize efficiency by emitting light in one direction, as opposed to older sources that push out light and heat everywhere.

In the mid-1980s, when officials redesigning Times Square sought to battle urban blight and crime, minimum levels of brightness became a part of the zoning code. With it, a new type of measurement was introduced: the LUTS, for Light Unit Times Square.

That's it for this briefing. We'll be off tomorrow but will return on Wednesday. Happy New Year!

105,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/02/us/politics/voting-gerrymander-elections.html,"Voting rights and partisan gerrymandering, traditionally the preoccupation of wonky party strategists and good-government groups, have become major flash points in the debate about the integrity of American elections, signaling high stakes battles over voter suppression and politically engineered districts ahead of the 2020 presidential race.

When Democrats take the majority in the House on Thursday, the first bill they plan to introduce will be broad legislation focusing on these issues. Early drafts of their proposals include automatic voter registration, public elections financing and ending gerrymandering by using independent commissions to draw voting districts.

But action and anger go far beyond Congress. With voters increasingly aware of the powerful impact of gerrymandering and doubtful about the fairness of elections, voting issues have become central to politics in key states including Florida, Georgia, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.

Questions about the health of American democracy are being raised in areas once thought to be wholly nonpartisan, as reflected in a court battle over whether the Trump administration is trying to use a question about citizenship on the 2020 census to undercount Democratic constituencies and limit their political clout.

Voters in five states last year passed ballot questions shifting the power to draw political districts away from partisan lawmakers.

In widely criticized lame-duck sessions of the Wisconsin and Michigan Legislatures, Republicans raced to strip powers from new Democratic governors, partly to protect their ability to gerrymander after the 2020 census.

In Florida, voters approved a ballot initiative to restore voting rights for more than a million convicted felons, while in Georgia, questions about the legitimacy of the victory by the Republican governor, Brian Kemp, revolved around allegations that his office suppressed the votes of minorities in the state.

At issue, many voting experts say, is a momentous clash between demographic changes that are slowly and powerfully reshaping the American electorate, making it younger, more diverse and more favorable for Democrats, and the entrenched power of Republican lawmakers, who see restrictions on voting and partisan redistricting as ways to hold on to political power.

""What they're trying to do is construct a system where a minority of the voters can actually obtain majority power,"" said former Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr., who sued states over voting rules during the Obama administration.

Republicans say the influence of gerrymandering is overblown. They argue that Democrats fail to win seats in proportion to their popular votes because Democratic voters are clustered in urban districts. Republicans defend voting restrictions like ID laws as popular with majorities in both parties and needed to ensure confidence in elections.

That concerns about gerrymandering have gone mainstream was underlined last month when President Barack Obama said he would join forces with a group Mr. Holder leads, the National Democratic Redistricting Committee. It was formed in 2017 in response to many state legislatures shifting sharply to the right on abortion, taxes, education and collective bargaining. Democrats contend those shifts were built on Republicans' securing majorities at the state level through extreme gerrymandering after the 2010 census.

The Republican State Leadership Committee, which helped secure many of those statehouse victories, argues the initial races were run in districts drawn by Democrats in previous decades. Matt Walter, the committee's president, said some of the 2018 ballot measures to make redistricting less partisan were quietly backed by groups that seek to elect more Democrats.

""Cleverly worded ballot measures regarding redistricting are often nothing more than Democrat politics wrapped in some sort of illusion of citizen-participated good government,"" he said.

Indeed, Democrats have also benefited from partisan maps in states like Maryland. Still, when Democrats in New Jersey recently sought to benefit from midterm gains and overhaul how legislative maps are drawn, Mr. Holder and other fair-voting groups opposed it. The proposal was scrapped.

In the November elections, Democrats gained more House seats than they have in any midterm since Watergate, picking up 40 seats. But the gains might have been even bigger, election experts said, if Republican gerrymanders hadn't been drawn to withstand a blue wave.

In Ohio, Republicans won 52 percent of the overall votes for Congress, but they retained 11 of the state's 16 House seats.

In North Carolina, Republicans won 50 percent of the popular congressional vote, but 9 out of 12 seats, not counting one still in dispute.

""It's the result of digitally diabolical gerrymandering,"" said Gov. Roy Cooper, a Democrat.

North Carolina has been ground zero for what critics call aggressive Republican attacks on democracy, including a strict voter ID law, extreme partisan gerrymandering and a power grab during a lame-duck session of the legislature after Mr. Cooper's election in 2016. Courts have overturned many of these efforts.

The governor echoed critics of gerrymandering who say that putting lawmakers in safe districts leads to partisan polarization, because incumbents fear only a primary challenge from the extremes and lack any incentive to reach across the aisle.

""It has prevented progress in North Carolina on closing the health care gap,"" Mr. Cooper said. ""I think in Washington it has torpedoed common sense immigration reform."" In June, the United States Supreme Court sidestepped the question of whether partisan gerrymandering was unconstitutional.

Republican supermajorities in both of the state's legislative chambers have overridden 22 of Mr. Cooper's vetoes. In November, Democrats flipped enough seats in the General Assembly to limit Republicans to simple majorities, restoring the governor's veto authority. Rather than wait for the new legislature to convene in January, Republicans met this month to override two of Mr. Cooper's vetoes of voting laws.

Phil Berger, the president of the State Senate, said critics accusing North Carolina Republicans of undermining democracy ignore the fact that the party won its majorities in 2010 using maps drawn by Democrats. The laws enacted since then, including voter ID, reflect the will of the majority, he said.

""The Democrats have a geographic problem,"" Mr. Berger said, referring to the clustering of Democratic voters in a handful of cities. ""Our view is we were returning North Carolina to more of the mainstream.""

If North Carolina was the template, Republican lawmakers in Wisconsin and Michigan both met in lame-duck sessions last year to strip powers away from incoming Democratic governors. Speaker Robin J. Vos of the Wisconsin State Assembly was candid about his motives for checking the incoming governor, Tony Evers, the former state superintendent of schools. ""We are going to have a very liberal governor who is going to enact policies that are in direct contrast to what many of us believe in,"" he said in early December.

Wisconsin's legislative maps, drawn in 2011, protected Republican supermajorities even after Gov. Scott Walker, a Republican, was defeated last year. Republican candidates for the State Assembly won just 46 percent of the popular vote, but they captured 64 percent of the chamber's seats.

Barry Burden, a political scientist at the University of Wisconsin, called the results ""a beautiful gerrymander"" because Republicans were protected even in a bad year for their party.

In Michigan, however, most of the Republican pushback against the election results fizzled, either because bills died in the legislature or were vetoed by former Gov. Rick Snyder.

According to the Brennan Center for Justice, 24 states, most Republican-led, have introduced restrictions that have made access to voting harder since 2010.

Wendy R. Weiser, director of the Democracy Program at the Brennan Center, said there was a correlation between states that have restricted voting and those with high African-American turnout in 2008, the first year Mr. Obama was elected, as well as those that recorded large increases in Hispanic population in the 2010 census.

""The more a state saw an increase in political participation by African-Americans or an increase in the Latino population, the more likely they'd introduce new laws cutting back on voting access,"" she said.

At the same time, many states have expanded voting access in recent years. Midterm voters in Nevada passed automatic registration for those receiving a driver's license, and Maryland authorized same-day registration at the polls. In New York, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo is calling for an overhaul of the state's voting laws, considered among the most archaic in the country.

At the opposite end of the spectrum, advocates of restrictions such as voter ID laws say they are needed to prevent fraud, despite multiple studies showing in-person fraud is extremely rare. A federal appeals court that struck down North Carolina's voter ID law in 2016 said it was drafted to target blacks ""with almost surgical precision.""

One of the Republicans defeated at the polls last year, Kris W. Kobach, lost a race for Kansas governor after being rebuked in federal court for insisting without evidence that noncitizen voting was widespread. Mr. Kobach had led the commission to look into President Trump's baseless claim that millions of undocumented immigrants voted in 2016. It disbanded without documenting his claim.

Polls show Americans are increasingly concerned about the structure of elections. Only 51 percent believed that elections are fair and open in a July Ipsos poll. A Pew Research Center survey in October found wide partisan gaps over easing access to voting, with more Democrats than Republicans favoring the ability to register on Election Day, the restoration of felons' voting rights and the automatic registration of all eligible voters.

The issue has become a galvanizing one for Democratic candidates.

Kamala Harris, the senator from California and a likely Democratic presidential candidate, tweeted last week: ""As states across the country are actively making it harder for Americans to vote, my Democratic colleagues are committed to strengthening access to the ballot box. Reinvigorating the Voting Rights Act, expanding early voting, and automatic registration are a place to start.""

In November, voters in Colorado, Missouri, Michigan and Utah approved changes to limit the role of partisanship in drawing congressional and legislative districts. Ohio passed a similar measure in May.

But in Missouri, Gov. Michael L. Parson, a Republican, opposed the popular vote to turn over mapmaking to a ""nonpartisan state demographer,"" which could increase Democratic representation. The governor called for the measure's repeal.

Missouri reflects the way even popular elections often fail to settle voting-related disputes. In Florida, Democrats say Republicans are already looking for ways to avoid carrying out the initiative allowing people convicted of felonies to vote.

Mr. Holder, who is among the Democrats considering a presidential run, said issues about voting and democracy are now central to American politics.

""Health care will clearly be the primary issue,"" he said. ""But I think if you're looking for a top-five issue, this one has broken through and will be something people will talk about and make their decision about who they're going to vote for."""
106,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/17/magazine/democrats-trump-investigation.html,"At noon on Jan. 3, the 435 members of the House of Representatives of the 116th Congress will convene for the first time in the Capitol. The chaplain will offer a prayer, the clerk will lead the chamber in the Pledge of Allegiance and a roll-call vote will be held to elect Nancy Pelosi speaker of the House. Then the new speaker will grasp the gavel and swear in the representatives-elect -- their right hands raised, some of them clutching Bibles or Torahs or Qurans in their left. There will be speeches and family photos and, among the Democrats, who will now be in the majority, much celebration. But before any of that happens, Representative Elijah Cummings will have sent out letters.

One letter will have been jointly addressed to Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker, demanding the age, gender, country of origin and current location of every child who was separated from his or her parents under the Trump administration's immigration policy. Another will have gone to Pat Cipollone, the White House counsel, asking for the identities of any senior White House officials who have used -- as Hillary Clinton once did -- nongovernment email accounts to conduct official business.

The White House chief of staff will have received a letter, also addressed to the heads of multiple federal agencies, requesting information and documents about the use of government-owned aircraft for personal travel and private aircraft for official travel. Outside the government, the Trump Organization will have received one asking for a complete accounting of all the payments it has received from foreign governments or foreign-government-owned entities since Donald Trump's election. Each letter will have been written on stationery bearing the seal of the House of Representatives Committee on Oversight and Government Reform and signed with Cummings's looping signature over the word: ""Chairman-designate.""

Elected to the House in 1996, Cummings, 67, represents a majority-African-American district anchored in Baltimore. He is a son of two former sharecroppers turned Pentecostal ministers; his bald head and booming baritone project a ministerial -- and authoritative -- presence. Until now, Cummings's greatest national renown came in 2015: During the riots that followed Freddie Gray's death from injuries he sustained in a Baltimore police van, Fox News broadcast live coverage of the congressman walking through the city's streets, bullhorn in hand, urging calm and shouting at protesters to go home.

""I'm not trying to do anything extraordinary,"" Cummings told me of the letters. ""I'm trying to do what the Constitution says I'm supposed to do."" It was election night, and he was at a small party in Baltimore, where he had just been informed by a colleague, Representative John Sarbanes of Maryland, that the networks were declaring that Democrats would have a majority in the House of Representatives for the first time since 2011. ""Mr. Chairman!"" Sarbanes said in breaking the news.

The midterm results effectively brought an end to Trump's legislative agenda, or at least the parts of it that Democrats find objectionable. But the victory gives Democrats little legislative power of their own. If by some miracle any Democrat-authored House bill makes it through the Republican-controlled Senate, Trump's veto pen awaits.

What the House Democrats will have, however, is oversight authority: the ability to hold hearings and request documents and, if necessary, issue subpoenas to uncover and expose all the incompetence and misconduct and outright corruption that they suspect permeates the executive branch under the current occupant of the White House. ""Make no mistake, Democrats will honor our constitutional responsibility to exercise oversight of the Trump administration and get the American people the answers they deserve,"" Pelosi said in a statement. ""Voters delivered a check and balance on the president that will hold him and his administration accountable for the abuses of power and culture of corruption that have consumed Washington."" Trump is already besieged by the investigation led by Robert Mueller, the special counsel, into Russian interference in the 2016 elections and by multiple probes by the United States attorney's office for the Southern District of New York into his family business. In January, he will face a Democratic-controlled House of Representatives that suddenly has the power to open a third investigative front against him -- power that will reside, in large part, in Cummings's office.

That power is both broad and subtle. The Oversight and Government Reform Committee's mandate is investigation,across the whole range of federal government operations -- and even into the private sector. (The three-year congressional investigation into the use of steroids in Major League Baseball in the 2000s was a House Oversight production.) Other committees have the power to investigate, too, but none have so expansive a remit. ""Oversight,"" says former Representative Henry Waxman of California, the Democratic chairman of the committee from 2007 to 2009, ""has jurisdiction over the world.""

This has given Cummings's predecessors a unique ability to shape the public perception of recent presidencies -- particularly when, as will be the case in January, it is a president of the other party. Many of the familiar details of the George W. Bush administration's outing of the covert C.I.A. agent Valerie Plame, emergency-response failures during Hurricane Katrina and disastrous reconstruction of Iraq were ferreted out by Waxman, who led the Oversight and Government Reform Committee for the last two years of Bush's second term. The congressional investigations of the Obama administration -- into claims that the Internal Revenue Service targeted Tea Party groups and that the Justice Department allowed guns to be illegally trafficked across the Mexican border -- that dominated Fox News chyrons after Republicans took back the House in 2011 were started by Waxman's Republican successor, Darrell Issa.

As a rule, the Oversight and Government Reform Committee is a sleepy place when the same party controls Congress and the White House. But even by these standards, the committee's performance during the first two years of the Trump administration has been unusual. Under the chairmanship of Representative Jason Chaffetz of Utah and then, after Chaffetz resigned in June 2017 and took a job at Fox News, Representative Trey Gowdy of South Carolina, the committee essentially turned a blind eye toward the executive branch. On matters big (like the firing of the F.B.I. director, James Comey, or the administration's botched response to Hurricane Maria) and comparatively small (like Trump's decision to revoke the security clearance of the former C.I.A. director John Brennan), the Oversight Committee did not seem interested in doing much real oversight.

""If the president's party on Capitol Hill becomes subservient to the executive branch and just becomes an appendage of that, then Congress basically loses its meaning,"" Tom Davis, the Virginia Republican who was chairman of the committee during part of Bush's presidency, from 2003 to 2007, told me. ""We turn into a parliamentary operation."" Norman Ornstein, a congressional scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, puts it even more bluntly. ""Looking back over the first two years of the administration,"" he says, ""I can't point to a single example, House or Senate, where any committee or subcommittee actually fulfilled its role of doing oversight.""

Over the past two years, as the committee's ranking member, Cummings issued 64 subpoena requests; they were requests because the minority party can't issue subpoenas without the majority's approval. Chaffetz and Gowdy rejected them all. And even when Chaffetz or Gowdy did ask the Trump administration for information, they didn't push very hard. ""I was able to get them to jointly request documents that we needed to do our job,"" Cummings told me, ""but when the administration basically said, 'Screw you' -- and the administration basically said that to every request -- they refused to back it up with a subpoena."" Indeed, the first requests Cummings will send out as the incoming Oversight chairman -- the letters about family separation, nongovernment emails and government-owned aircraft for personal travel -- will be those that Chaffetz and Gowdy jointly sent with him over the past two years and that the administration largely ignored.

At the time, Cummings counseled his Republican colleagues to put aside the politics of the moment and to think long-term. ""I get in these guys' ears, and I talk to them heart to heart,"" Cummings says. ""I told them, 'Trump is 72. I'm 67. You all are still young guys. Why are you trying to carry this guy's water? After he's dead, you're going to be living with this [expletive].' ""

Congress's oversight responsibilities originated from an incident on Nov. 4, 1791, when a 1,400-soldier military expedition led by Arthur St. Clair, then governor of the Northwest Territory and a former general officer in the Continental Army during the Revolutionary War, was routed in what is now Ohio by a confederacy of warriors from three Native American tribes. Nearly 700 soldiers were killed and 300 wounded. The House of Representatives established a select committee to investigate the defeat and authorized it to ""call for such persons, papers and records as may be necessary to assist their inquiries."" President George Washington was initially concerned that Congress had overstepped its bounds. But after Washington's cabinet -- including Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson and Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton -- unanimously counseled him otherwise, he agreed to cooperate with the investigation, turning over the documents that had been requested.

In the 226 years since the committee investigated -- and ultimately absolved -- St. Clair, Congress has performed its oversight and investigative functions with varying degrees of enthusiasm, competence and responsibility. For every Senate investigation into the Teapot Dome scandal -- which brought down Albert Fall, Warren Harding's secretary of the interior, in 1923 for accepting hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes from oil barons -- there's Senator Joseph McCarthy's use of his chairmanship of the Committee on Government Operations in the 1950s to search for Communists in the government.

In the decades after Watergate, both the Senate and the House conducted rigorous, and bipartisan, investigations into topics including intelligence-agency abuses and military-procurement fraud, producing meaningful reforms in the process. That heyday came to an end, however, when Republicans took back the House in 1995, giving them control of it for the first time in 40 years. Once Newt Gingrich was installed as House speaker, he merged several House committees with responsibilities to monitor government agencies into a single panel, naming it the Government Reform and Oversight Committee.

The new committee had the broadest oversight jurisdiction of any in Congress -- a power Gingrich quickly weaponized against the Clinton administration. He filled over half the G.O.P.'s committee seats with freshmen who arrived on the wave of his Republican revolution, and in 1997 made Representative Dan Burton of Indiana its chairman. An ardent Clinton foe, Burton had already proposed investigating the suicide of the deputy White House counsel Vince Foster -- Burton infamously conducted amateur forensics tests, reportedly by shooting melons in his backyard -- and how much money the White House was spending on postage to respond to letters that children had written to the Clintons' pet cat, Socks.

In his six years as chairman, Burton issued more than 1,000 unilateral subpoenas and demanded everything down to the White House holiday-card list. But his Javert act ultimately became too much even for Republicans. For all his exertions, Burton proved unable to find concrete evidence of serious wrongdoing on the part of the Clinton administration. He repeatedly undermined himself, as in 1998 when one of his top aides -- Trump's future deputy campaign manager David Bossie -- released transcripts of the jailhouse phone conversations of Hillary Clinton's old law partner and former Associate Attorney General Webb Hubbell, who was convicted of fraud for overbilling clients, that seemed to implicate Clinton in the overbilling. Democrats later showed that the transcripts had been misleadingly edited, and Bossie was pressured to resign. ""We'd just put our foot out,"" recalls Henry Waxman, who was the top Democrat on the committee during Burton's chairmanship, ""and he'd trip over it."" Gingrich eventually stopped giving sensitive investigative assignments to Burton's Oversight Committee.

In 2003, Tom Davis took over as the Oversight Committee chairman and established what became the standard mode of low-key defense when the chairman's own party is in the White House. ""I had to show the party flag,"" Davis says of fighting off some Democratic demands for investigations of the Bush administration. But when it came to big issues -- like the Bush administration's slow and poorly executed response to Hurricane Katrina in 2005 or the disgraced lobbyist Jack Abramoff's contacts with President Bush and other White House officials -- Davis, much to the consternation of some of his fellow Republicans, led rigorous investigations. ""He had a concern about oversight,"" Waxman says, ""and he thought the questions we wanted to pursue were legitimate and worthwhile.""

After Democrats took back the House in the 2006 midterms, Waxman became Oversight Committee chairman. He was an aggressive but careful investigator; unlike Burton, he didn't initiate an inquiry at the first whiff of scandal, nor did he succumb to some of his Democratic constituents' blood lust. ""I'd go to some of the Democratic clubs back home, and people would say, 'Why haven't you imprisoned George W. Bush?' "" Waxman recalls. ""I had to tell them we don't have the power to imprison people. There was a widespread belief that there's a prison right there in the Capitol.""

But Waxman's investigations into the failures of the Coalition Provisional Authority in Iraq, profiteering by the military contractor Blackwater and the Federal Emergency Management Agency's dangerous policy of housing families displaced by Hurricane Katrina in trailers with unhealthful levels of formaldehyde, among others, harked back to the heyday of post-Watergate oversight. His hearings calling executives from A.I.G. and Lehman Brothers to testify about their role in the 2008 financial crisis helped lay the groundwork for Congress's most substantial attempt in decades to rein in the financial sector, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.

One of Waxman's most trusted lieutenants on the Oversight Committee was Cummings, who proved so adept at political theater that Waxman and his staff often relied on him to ask the most crucial questions of hostile witnesses testifying before the committee. Even today, Oversight veterans speak in awed tones about a 2007 hearing when Cummings questioned the State Department's inspector general, Howard Krongard, about claims that he impeded a federal investigation into Blackwater. During testimony, Cummings informed Krongard that committee staff had discovered that Krongard's brother was at a Blackwater advisory board meeting in Williamsburg, Va.: ""This meeting is taking place right now,"" Cummings said, ""as we speak."" Krongard resigned from the State Department a few weeks later. ""It was like a Perry Mason moment,"" Waxman says.

During their years in the minority, Cummings and his roughly 35-person committee staff, led by its director, David Rapallo, became skilled at conducting investigations without much political or legal leverage. In 2017, a Democratic investigator for the Oversight Committee, scrutinizing Michael Flynn, Trump's first national-security adviser, reviewed Flynn's 2016 security clearance renewal application and noticed that Flynn took a trip to Saudi Arabia in 2015 -- during which he claimed to stay at a hotel that did not exist and to attend a conference that did not occur. Robert Mueller went on to investigate Flynn's suspected efforts to broker a $100 billion energy deal between Saudi Arabia and Russia's nuclear-power agency.

Combing through the unpublished supporting evidence of an inspector general's report, Democratic committee staff found emails that appeared to show that Trump, in spite of his own denials, had ordered the reversal of plans to move the F.B.I. headquarters to a suburban location and off Pennsylvania Avenue, where it currently sits across from the Trump Hotel -- a reversal that would benefit his hotel by preventing commercial developers from building a competing property across the street. ""The Cummings people did a lot of great investigative work without formal tools,"" says Phil Barnett, who was the staff director of the Oversight Committee under Waxman. ""Now they will have formal tools.""

In September, Pelosi invited Cummings to her Capitol office, along with two other Democratic congressmen who, if the party won the House in November, would become chairmen of committees with powerful investigative mandates: New York's Jerrold Nadler, of the Judiciary Committee, and California's Adam Schiff, of the Intelligence Committee. There they were joined by several Democratic representatives who worked previously as prosecutors: Joe Kennedy of Massachusetts, Dutch Ruppersberger of Maryland and Eric Swalwell of California. Pelosi told the group that they shouldn't take the outcome of the midterms for granted. At the same time, she said, the Democrats needed to begin thinking about how they would conduct oversight of the Trump administration -- and the strategizing needed to start now.

Like Cummings, Nadler and Schiff chafed at their committees' Republican chairmen's lack of interest and outright interference during the Trump presidency. Mueller's investigators have spent months building an increasingly sweeping case about Russian meddling in the 2016 elections, implicating and indicting several of Trump's closest associates to date. But under the chairmanship of the Republican Devin Nunes of California, the House Intelligence Committee -- which has a clear constitutional authority to conduct some of the same investigatory work as Mueller -- produced a report that breezily concluded that there was no collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian government and that, contrary to the official consensus of the American intelligence community, the Russian government was not even seeking to help elect Trump. Committee Democrats said they were shut out of the drafting process and publicly condemned the report.

Nunes also initiated parallel investigations of the F.B.I. and the Justice Department for what he claimed was ""criminal activity and fraudulent behavior"" in an effort to hurt Trump's campaign -- investigations that Schiff contends ""I think that the mission for the chairman has been protecting the White House, protecting the president and furthering a political narrative which is completely at odds with the facts,"" Schiff told me.

When Immigration and Customs Enforcement, following a new and unprecedented Trump administration policy, separated more than 2,300 immigrant children from their families at the Southern border this spring, the Republican-led Judiciary Committee did not hold a single oversight hearing for Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, whose agency falls under the committee's oversight jurisdiction. Other committees, too, had their own lists of Trump-administration oversight oversights: the Natural Resources Committee's lack of interest in Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke's suspected ethical and managerial misdeeds, which have been the subject of at least 17 federal investigations, for instance; or the Veterans Affairs Committee's refusal to look into whether three Trump friends, all Mar-a-Lago members, improperly influenced a $10 billion contract to modernize veterans' health care records. ""The oversight job, after two years of Donald Trump,"" says Representative Jamie Raskin, a Maryland Democrat who serves on both the Oversight and Judiciary Committees, ""is like coming upon a 73-car pileup on the highway.""

With so many targets, and so many hungry Democrats, ""there's the potential for oversight fratricide next year,"" says a senior Democratic official on the Intelligence Committee, noting the overlapping jurisdictions of the various committees. There's also the potential for distraction. ""The question is, do you want to be the Breaking News Committee that just investigates the issue of the day?"" asks Swalwell, who sits on the Judiciary and Intelligence Committees. ""Or do you want to look at broader, longstanding core issues?"" At that September meeting and at multiple gatherings of members and their staffs over the subsequent weeks and months, an initial strategy -- and a division of labor -- began to take shape.

Schiff, the incoming Intelligence Committee chairman, will play a major role. One of his top priorities will be protecting -- and assisting -- Mueller's investigation, and one of his first acts in the new Congress will be trying to get to the bottom of one of the more tantalizing mysteries of the whole Russia affair: Whom did Donald Trump Jr. speak to on his phone in between calls setting up the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting with Russians peddling dirt on Hillary Clinton? Trump Jr. claims he can't remember, and the call appears as a blocked number on his phone records. Nunes refused to ask Trump Jr.'s cellular provider for the blocked number. ""That phone call may lead to a place the Republicans didn't want to go,"" Schiff says, ""and so they were unwilling to get the answer."" Schiff wants the answer and will press the provider for it.

Nunes's investigation may not have produced much, but under his leadership, the committee did conduct hundreds of hours of interviews: with Trump Jr., Jared Kushner, Roger Stone and other key figures in the Russia matter. On Nunes's orders, almost all the transcripts have remained in the sole possession of the committee, which has, among other things, kept them out of the hands of Mueller's investigators. Schiff plans to publicly release the remaining transcripts when the new Congress convenes in January.

In November, Michael Cohen, Trump's former lawyer, pleaded guilty to lying to Congress about a Moscow real estate project Trump pursued. Cohen was caught by Mueller's investigators only because he publicly released his opening statement to the Intelligence Committee. Referring to the unreleased transcripts, Swalwell told me: ""I just wonder how many more crimes are just sitting in the basement of the House Intelligence Committee that Mueller doesn't know about because he hasn't seen that they lied to us.""

Schiff is also interested in examining Trump's business dealings -- including whether Russians laundered money through the Trump Organization -- from a counterintelligence perspective. ""What would be most compromising to our nation and our national security is if a hostile foreign power has leverage over the president of the United States,"" Schiff told me. Or as the senior Democratic Intelligence Committee official says: ""Whenever Putin is alone in a room with Trump with just the two of them and their translators, like they were in Helsinki, is Putin reminding him that he has an Excel spreadsheet of how many rubles are parked in Trump Tower?""

One afternoon in late November, Nadler, the incoming Judiciary Committee chairman, was in his congressional office. The walls were bare, save some exposed nails. All the pictures and framed bills that once hung on them were piled in a plastic-lined dumpster in the reception area -- ""Jerry's bucket of achievements,"" Daniel Schwarz, Nadler's communications director, joked. Nadler was in the process of moving to a space closer to the Judiciary Committee's offices.

The congressman from the Upper West Side became the top Democrat on the committee in December 2017 after John Conyers, the long-serving Michigan representative, resigned from Congress over sexual-harassment claims. Nadler has been a Trump bête noire since the 1980s, when, as an assemblyman, he fought to prevent Trump from building a proposed 150-story building in his district, where Trump hoped to live in an apartment on the top floor. After his election to Congress in 1992, Nadler made sure Trump didn't receive federal mortgage guarantees for the project. ""I didn't want him to be the tallest man in the world there,"" Nadler told me. Trump described Nadler in his 2000 book, ""The America We Deserve,"" as ""one of the most egregious hacks in contemporary politics.""

The Judiciary Committee is endowed with the authority to start impeachment proceedings against a president, as committee Republicans did against Bill Clinton in 1998, and as committee Democrats did against Nixon in 1973. Nadler is thus probably the committee chairman most likely to find himself caught between the expectations of the Democratic base and the political and institutional realities their representatives are now subject to.

""If they're successful at doing their jobs, then they'll bring forth more information about Trump's wrongdoing, and the logical conclusion will be impeachment,"" says Kevin Mack, lead strategist for the liberal billionaire Tom Steyer's group Need to Impeach, which has gathered nearly 6.5 million signatures supporting Trump's impeachment. And if Democrats don't impeach Trump? ""What you're saying by not attempting to stand up for the rule of law is that the rule of law is not the most important thing to you,"" Steyer told me. ""Complaining about something is not doing something about it.""

When Nadler ran to succeed Conyers as the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, his pitch included a leaflet he wrote and distributed to his fellow Democrats, which said that he was ""our strongest member to lead a potential impeachment."" Since clinching the chairmanship, however, Nadler has become much more circumspect, at least publicly, about impeachment. ""It's too early,"" he told me in November. ""It's a very momentous step. It has real consequences."" Even if Robert Mueller or congressional Democrats uncover what he concludes are impeachable offenses, Nadler told me, he would want to begin impeachment proceedings only if he believes that, by the end of the process, there would be an ""appreciable fraction of the Trump voters"" who support Trump's impeachment.

""You don't want to tear the country apart,"" Nadler said. ""You don't want a situation where for the next 30 years half the country is saying, 'We won the election; you stole it from us.' "" He added an interesting caveat, however: ""Now notice I didn't say an appreciable fraction of Republican senators. It's the Trump voters. Because it might be -- I'm not saying it is, but it might be -- that the Republican Party becomes so one-sided, or such a cult group in effect, that no matter what the evidence is, no matter what the malfeasances are, they"" -- Republican senators -- ""would never agree to break from the president.""

Still, as he sat in his emptying office, Nadler did not sound like someone eager to lead a potential impeachment. ""The fact that you find impeachable offenses and the fact that you think you can prove impeachable offenses,"" he said, ""doesn't necessarily mean the offenses rise to the level of importance where you should impeach."" When I spoke to Nadler a couple of weeks later, after federal prosecutors said that Trump directed Michael Cohen to make payments in violation of campaign-finance laws to squelch a sex scandal, he still sounded cautious. ""I don't think things have changed, really,"" Nadler said. ""We know a little more, but there's a lot more to know.""

In the days after the election, Nadler began firing off ""preservation letters"" to the White House, the Justice Department and other agencies warning them that ""concealing, removing or destroying"" any documents related to Jeff Sessions's firing or Mueller's investigation ""may constitute a crime."" In January, the committee's first order of business, Nadler said, will be to call Matthew Whitaker, the acting attorney general, to testify; Whitaker, who has a thin legal résumé, was tapped by Trump to replace Sessions and will hold the job until the official nominee for attorney general, William Barr, is confirmed by the Senate. From the moment Whitaker was appointed, Nadler told me, ""It was clear that Trump wanted him to be his hatchet man."" When Whitaker comes before the committee, Nadler said, he will ask him: ""Have you told Mueller not to follow some line of inquiry? Have you told him not to indict somebody? What instructions have you given to him, if any? Have you communicated with the White House about these matters in any way or with the president's lawyers in any way? What have you told them? Those kinds of questions.""

Nadler's to-do list goes far beyond Whitaker. There is the Justice Department's decision not to defend the Affordable Care Act in a lawsuit brought by Republican state attorneys general; the Trump administration's family-separation policy; whether the White House improperly interfered with the F.B.I.'s background check into Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.

""In the last two years, the Republicans in Congress, their basic idea has been: Let the Trump administration do what it wants, let there be no oversight,"" Nadler said. In a normal presidency, this would have been problematic, but with Trump in the White House, Nadler argued, ""there are real challenges to the democratic norms that we haven't seen the likes of since the Civil War."" The result, he said, is that ""we have a real crisis now.""

On the last Thursday in November, the House Oversight Committee held what was most likely its final hearing of the year, and Cummings's final hearing as the ranking member. It was devoted to the 2017 hurricane season and the Trump administration's response to Hurricane Maria, and Cummings believed it was long overdue. He initially asked Gowdy to hold hearings on the matter back in September 2017, nine days after Maria devastated Puerto Rico. Gowdy refused and continued to turn down requests for a hearing for more than a year. Now Gowdy had finally scheduled the hearing in the lame-duck session on a day Democrats were holding their leadership elections. As a result, when the hearing began, only six of the committee's 41 members were present.

""Our Republican colleagues have promised to accommodate us, and I appreciate it,"" Cummings said when it was his turn to speak, ""but they would not move the hearing to a different day, and they would not even move up the start time by 30 minutes so we could ask Administrator Long our questions."" He was referring to the head of FEMA, Brock Long, who was testifying that day. He lit into Gowdy. ""I greatly respect the chairman, as a person, as an attorney and as a friend, but this is not transparency, this is not accountability and this is certainly not oversight.""

If Cummings is perceptive of the tactics being used against him to defend a president, it's because, not so long ago, he was the one doing the protecting. He became the top Democrat on the committee when Republicans took back the House in the 2010 midterms, and the new chairman, Darrell Issa, promised to hold hundreds of hearings into the Obama administration. Cummings was the first line of defense against the coming investigative onslaught. ""Mr. Cummings was very smart and deliberate and methodical, and was a perfect foil to Darrell,"" says Kurt Bardella, Issa's former spokesman and later a spokesman for Breitbart, who last year renounced the G.O.P. and became a Democrat. Cummings batted back Republicans' most incendiary charges against Obama by pointing to the lack of any real evidence, and repeatedly provoked Issa into own goals, like the time Issa received negative coverage for ordering Cummings's microphone cut off when Cummings tried to make a statement at the end of a hearing.

Cummings proved a similarly effective opponent to Gowdy on the special committee investigating the 2012 attack on the United States mission in Benghazi, Libya -- which Gowdy led and on which Cummings was the top Democrat -- and then to Chaffetz, who succeeded Issa as Oversight Committee chairman. Cummings's friends are quick to point out that Issa, Chaffetz and Gowdy will not be serving in the next Congress. ""They all quit after having to deal with Elijah!"" Waxman says.

""Darrell pursued headlines,"" Bardella told me. ""He wanted visibility and publicity."" During the Trump presidency, he argues, ""Cummings can focus on substance, and the reality is, they have so much more to work with on substance than we did. Our approach was, there could be corruption, there could be waste, fraud and abuse. We already know those things exist with Trump. There's no fishing expedition required.""

And yet, those Obama-era investigations made an indelible mark on politics. Congressional Republicans may never have been able to prove that Obama's I.R.S. unfairly singled out Tea Party groups for scrutiny; or that Eric Holder tried to hide the facts about a failed Justice Department investigation into gunrunning along the Mexican border, called Fast and Furious, that resulted in the death of a Border Patrol agent; or that Hillary Clinton, as secretary of state, tried to cover up a bungled response to the Benghazi attack -- but you might not know this if you spend much time on conservative media or the Trump rally circuit.

Burton's probing of the Clinton administration occurred in the old-media landscape of the 1990s, when the expectations of the press -- and of the public -- were that for a congressional investigation to be considered successful, it needed to produce the factual goods. But Issa and his successors, by virtue of right-wing-media megaphones like Fox News (which was in its infancy during the Clinton years) and Breitbart, were able to conduct investigations as a kind of post-truth theater, where proving charges was less important than making them, loudly and repeatedly. By the time of the 2016 presidential campaign, a Fairleigh Dickinson University survey found that 44 percent of Republicans and a full half of Trump supporters believed it was ""definitely true"" that ""as secretary of state, Hillary Clinton knew the U.S. Embassy in Benghazi was going to be attacked and did nothing to protect it.""

The challenge of conducting oversight in this post-truth political environment is not lost on Cummings and other Democrats. ""I watch Fox News every now and then,"" Cummings told me, ""and the reason why I watch Fox News is, I'm trying to see how they can twist things around and make them sound so like the Democrats have some conspiracy against the president -- and they do a good job of it."" Democrats worry about what will happen if they turn up concrete evidence of presidential wrongdoing in their investigations and a sizable portion of the electorate simply refuses to believe it.

It's also very likely that Trump, having already broken so many other norms, will have few qualms about breaking the norm of cooperating, or even feigning cooperation, with congressional investigations. ""If the president treats the Congress the way he has Bob Mueller, we can expect the administration to respond to many of our requests with stonewalling and invective,"" Schiff says. ""It's very possible the administration will decide they're not going to compromise on anything, and litigate everything."" David Bossie, the Dan Burton aide who stepped down for misleadingly editing and releasing the Hubbell transcripts, remains an informal adviser to Trump; he has gone so far as to suggest in a recent interview with Jacqueline Alemany of The Washington Post that the White House should encourage people subpoenaed by House Democrats to plead the fifth or even flee the country. Congressional Republicans have also sent a message by picking Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio, perhaps Trump's most staunch and outspoken defender on Capitol Hill, to serve as the top Republican on the Oversight Committee. ""When the caucus picked Jordan,"" Tom Davis says, ""they really picked confrontation.""

The most disheartening prospect for Democrats is what that confrontation could ultimately reveal: just how little leverage -- political and legal -- a divided Congress has in a fight with a president like Trump. If Trump administration officials refuse to comply with subpoenas, Democrats could vote to hold them in contempt of Congress. But that's a largely toothless gesture. Even if the House does succumb to the Democratic base's desire and impeaches Trump, the G.O.P.-controlled Senate would almost certainly never convict. What's more, impeachment could backfire. ""You don't want to reward an offender like the president with martyrdom,"" Eric Swalwell, who's currently exploring his own presidential run in 2020, told me. ""That would be the worst outcome -- that he gets more popular, that his base grows because of it.""

Surveying the task ahead of him, Cummings says, ""This will be one of the hardest things I've ever done."" On a recent afternoon, he sat in his congressional office and contemplated the possibility that he'd fall short. In the past year and a half, Cummings was hospitalized for nearly five months because of a serious knee infection and complications from a heart-valve replacement. ""My saddest thought,"" he said, ""is that there will be damage done which will not be corrected during my lifetime and perhaps for a long time.""

Democrats realize that they'll have to wage their battle in the court of public opinion -- and Cummings believes that will require eventually winning over at least some of his Republican colleagues to his side. ""There is one incentive for them: love of country and democracy,"" he said. ""We have to try to help them get there. We have to try to help their constituents see what they're doing and what they're not doing and try to bring them back to some sense of normalcy.""

Seated at the top of the dais in the Oversight Committee hearing room at the sparsely attended hearings into Hurricane Maria last month, Cummings tried to get a head start on doing just that. He noted how FEMA hadn't been responsive to his entreaties for information over the last two years. He told Long, the FEMA head, that his attitude would have to change and that he expected answers to a new a batch of questions before the end of the year -- after which Cummings would be the one holding the gavel.

""I guarantee you, Administrator Long,"" Cummings said, raising his hand and pointing a long, knobby finger, ""this hearing will not be your last before this committee."""
107,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/21/us/politics/trump-military-syria-mattis-afghanistan.html,"WASHINGTON -- Over the course of 24 extraordinary hours this week, 17 years of American military policy was thrown out the window as President Trump spurned his defense secretary's plea to keep United States troops in Syria and began the long process of pulling out of Afghanistan.

On Friday morning, America's 1.3 million active-duty service members woke up to a new reality: Their leader, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, had resigned over the Syria withdrawal and Mr. Trump's rejection of international alliances, and everything he and other military leaders had told them through three presidencies had suddenly been abandoned.

Terrorists must be challenged abroad before they end up here at home? No longer. Americans must defend their friends and stand up to authoritarians in places like Russia and Iran? A thing of the past.

As Mr. Trump overturned the post-9/11 national security consensus, the reverberations spanned the globe. In northeastern Syria, Special Operations troops who just the day before were fighting in the dirt around Hajin, the last Islamic State stronghold in the country, were now telling their Kurdish allies that they would be leaving them alone in the fight.

A continent and an ocean away at the Pentagon, the 26,000 men and women who work there digested Mr. Mattis's resignation letter, in which he laid out, in stark terms, that he was leaving because the commander in chief did not believe in ""the strength of our unique and comprehensive system of alliances and partnerships"" that has preserved peace for decades.

And in Afghanistan, half of the 14,000 Marines and soldiers there were learning that they would soon begin leaving the war, which has claimed almost 2,300 American military lives since 2001.

""U.S. Quietly Builds Helipad on Roof of Embassy in Afghanistan"" read the headline in Friday morning's Duffel Blog, the satirical site that is read daily at the Pentagon, in a reference to the iconic Vietnam War photo of the evacuation of Americans from Saigon.

The notion of retrenchment rankled American service members who are used to the idea of an activist United States military that promotes freedom and democracy and protects the weak around the world.

""Everyone has been saying that Trump didn't want to visit the troops in war zones because he questions the mission there,"" said Jon Soltz, an activist Iraq war veteran who remains in the National Guard. ""I think it's the other way around. He's scared to go to Iraq or Afghanistan, like he was scared to go to Vietnam, so he pretends to question the mission.""

Mr. Trump promised to find a replacement for Mr. Mattis soon, and Defense Department officials on Friday suggested a list that includes Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina; Energy Secretary Rick Perry; Senator Tom Cotton, Republican of Arkansas; the Navy secretary, Richard V. Spencer; the deputy defense secretary, Patrick Shanahan; and Jack Keane, the retired four-star general who was vice chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

Whoever Mr. Trump selects will have to guide the Defense Department's men and women through a new inward-looking way of conducting military policy, one that seeks to avoid messy international entanglements, particularly those in war zones.

Syria

At MacDill Air Force Base in Tampa, Fla., Gen. Joseph L. Votel, the head of United States Central Command, was on the phone last weekend with Pentagon leaders, trying to figure out how to talk Mr. Trump out of his decision to withdraw American troops from Syria.

His commander in chief was, essentially, ordering him to abandon the fighting force -- the Syrian Kurds -- that had been the most effective in working with the American military in the fight against the Islamic State. The move would also cede influence in Syria to Russia and Iran.

By Monday, aides said that General Votel appeared to have accepted that Mr. Trump was not going to budge. During a staff meeting, an officer asked General Votel if American troops were coming home, according to a Defense Department official with knowledge of the meeting. General Votel gave a grim smile and did not answer.

The next day -- Tuesday -- General Votel called a handful of officers into his office and told them that the president had decided to withdraw all troops from Syria. In Washington, Mr. Trump's top advisers were still trying to talk the president out of the decision, but Central Command had its marching orders, first among them to inform the Kurds.

On Tuesday night in Tampa, General Votel called his Kurdish friend Mazlum Kobane. For years, General Votel has held weekly conversations with Mr. Kobane -- the commander in chief of the Kurdish group, known as the Syrian Democratic Forces -- a man the Americans had come to trust for always keeping his word.

On Wednesday morning, even after receiving word that the Americans would be leaving them, Kurdish fighters continued to battle against the Islamic State in northern Syria, Defense Department officials said, gaining two acres of ground near Hajin.

Afghanistan

The Trump administration's order to start withdrawing roughly 7,000 troops from Afghanistan in the coming months is an abrupt shift in the war there, America's longest.

Mr. Trump has made no secret of his distaste for the Afghanistan war, and he had to be talked into the Pentagon's Afghanistan strategy last year, which called for a troop increase to 14,000. Like his predecessor, Barack Obama, Mr. Trump has been loath to continue pouring American blood and treasure into a war that by all accounts, except the Pentagon's, is a stalemate.

Unlike his predecessor, Mr. Trump made the decision to begin his drawdown without notifying either the Afghan government or the United States' NATO partners, who have also put their blood and treasure into the American war effort there.

""We have seen the reports,"" Oana Lungescu, the NATO spokeswoman, said in an email. She added that ""our engagement is important to ensure that Afghanistan never again becomes a safe haven for international terrorists who could threaten us at home.""

Niger, Mali and Chad

Hundreds of American troops in Africa will be reassigned, and the number of Special Operations missions on the continent is set to fall sharply under an existing Trump administration strategy to shift the focus from terrorist threats to traditional ""great power"" challenges from nations like China and Russia.

Defense Department officials say they expect most of the troop cuts and mission reductions to come from Central and West Africa, where Special Operations missions have focused on training African militaries to combat the growing threat from extremist Islamist militant groups.

The decision to cut back on troops in Africa follows an ambush in Niger last fall that killed four American soldiers and an attack in southwestern Somalia that killed another in June.

South Korea

Mr. Trump has told South Korean leaders that he wants them to double the amount of money they pay for American troops on the peninsula, a demand that the Seoul government is rejecting. Just as Mr. Trump has questioned why the United States and South Korea need to conduct joint military exercises, so too has he questioned why Seoul is not paying more to have American troops on hand.

Under an agreement that is set to expire at the end of the year, South Korea pays $830 million a year for the close to 30,000 American troops stationed on the peninsula. Defense Department officials say that Mr. Trump has asked for $1.6 billion per year."
108,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/24/us/politics/trump-tweets-christmas-eve.html,"WASHINGTON -- President Trump modified his favorite campaign slogan in a defensive response to a shifting worldview on Monday, tweeting ""AMERICA IS RESPECTED AGAIN!"" even as lawmakers and foreign allies alike braced for the potentially destabilizing effects of his policy decisions on national security.

He also said Saudi Arabia would ""spend the necessary money needed to help rebuild Syria, instead of the United States."" It was not immediately clear how or when that would happen, or whether it was in addition to the $100 million that Saudi Arabia sent the United States in October for Syria reconstruction.

Ensconced in the White House with no official Christmas Eve plans but to host a meeting on border security and track Santa Claus on military radar, Mr. Trump showed no sign of slowing a Twitter storm amid a government shutdown, a departing defense secretary and cratering stock market. He even lamented, ""I am all alone (poor me).""

His posts were replete with grievances about funds for border security, the Federal Reserve chairman, Democrats critical of his relationship with American allies and Brett McGurk, the departing special envoy for the coalition fighting the Islamic State.

""To those few Senators who think I don't like or appreciate being allied with other countries, they are wrong, I DO,"" Mr. Trump wrote in a pair of tweets critical of Jim Mattis, his outgoing Defense Secretary. ""What I don't like, however, is when many of these same countries take advantage of their friendship with the United States, both in Military Protection and Trade.""

Mr. Trump added that ""General Mattis did not see this as a problem. I DO, and it is being fixed!""

Mr. Mattis's resignation letter on Thursday served as a rebuke of the president's sharp demands of America's allies and softened approach toward some of its adversaries. Only over the weekend did Mr. Trump realize that Mr. Mattis's letter was a critique of the president's policies, leading to him to accelerate Mr. Mattis's departure.

Mr. Mattis's resignation was triggered by Mr. Trump's abrupt decisions last week to pull troops from Syria and Afghanistan. Those moves have plunged some of the United States' longest allied partners into uncertainty as they grapple with an American leader who largely treats those relationships as bottom-line business transactions.

Global leaders have also echoed Mr. Mattis's rebuke of Mr. Trump's worldview.

""I very deeply regret the decision made on Syria,"" President Emmanuel Macron of France said during a news conference on Sunday. ""To be allies is to fight shoulder to shoulder. It's the most important thing for a head of state and head of the military. An ally should be dependable.""

Mr. Trump also repeated his demand for a border wall, which Democrats have refused to fund, prompting a stalemate that has shutdown much of the government. And he again castigated the leadership of Jerome Powell, the Federal Reserve chairman, as markets continued a sell off.

""The only problem our economy has is the Fed,"" Mr. Trump said. ""They don't have a feel for the Market, they don't understand necessary Trade Wars or Strong Dollars or even Democrat Shutdowns over Borders.""

But the bulk of his ire was directed at foreign policy critics and fallout over his ""America First"" approach.

He described Mr. McGurk as an Obama-era appointee, and accused him of ""loading up airplanes with 1.8 Billion Dollars in CASH & sending it to Iran"" as part of the nuclear deal that world powers struck with Tehran -- an agreement from which Mr. Trump has withdrawn the United States.

Mr. Trump has repeatedly made this misleading claim about money the United States transferred to Iran in 2016. The Obama administration did not directly give money to Iran as part of the 2015 nuclear deal; instead the United States unfroze billions in assets as part of a decades-long debt dispute, $1.7 billion of which was transferred in cash in 2016. The payment was indirectly tied to the nuclear deal.

Mr. McGurk, who worked under the administration of President George W. Bush as well as President Barack Obama, led the delicate, 14-month negotiations with Iran that prompted the release of Jason Rezaian, the Washington Post journalist. This summer, Mr. McGurk was the target of assassination threats from Iranian-backed militias and demonstrators in Iraq.

Over the weekend, Mr. Trump suggested on Twitter that Mr. McGurk was a grandstander. The envoy resigned in protest over the Syria decision, which he said had blindsided United States officials and allies in the Middle East, including American-backed Kurdish soldiers who are fighting the Islamic State."

First, the new episode of ""The Argument"" podcast is out, and it's a debate about marijuana legalization. Fair warning: I'm more negative about legalization than many of you probably are.

U.S. out. Barack Obama's Syria policy was the biggest foreign-policy failure of his presidency. The results were tragic, and the process was notably flawed for a White House that mostly ran well.

Obama announced in 2012 that Syria's use of chemical weapons would be ""a red line"" -- but then did little to punish President Bashar al-Assad of Syria when he gassed his own people. Even some Obama administration officials were frustrated by the mixed signals and indecision.

But Obama and the aides who continue to defend his policy are right about one big thing: There were no easy answers in Syria. When Assad began killing his fellow Syrians to put down a rebellion, the United States had no clear way of stopping him, absent another potentially catastrophic Middle Eastern war. Obama's approach to Syria failed, yet any alternate approach may have failed as well.

Yesterday, President Trump put his own stamp on Syria policy, and it was not encouraging. Against the advice of his advisers -- and, in some cases, to their surprise -- Trump will pull out the remaining 2,000 American troops within 30 days.

As part of the announcement, Trump claimed victory, saying that the extremist Islamic State had been defeated. And he can fairly take credit for overseeing military victories against it. But many experts believe that an American withdrawal may now allow the Islamic State to regain some of the central Syrian regions it once controlled.

Only nine days ago, Brett McGurk, who helps lead Syria policy under Trump, suggested a pullout would be ""reckless."" In September, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis similarly suggested that ""blindly"" deciding to leave would be a mistake. And yesterday a couple of high-profile Republicans in Congress blasted the move.

For all of their differences, both Trump and Obama have shown a welcome reluctance to risk American lives for an uncertain -- or nonexistent -- benefit. But that reluctance still needs to be paired with a strategic vision. In Syria, and most everywhere else, Trump seems to lack that vision.

Related. The conservative writer David French likened Trump's decision to Obama's 2011 withdrawal from Iraq, a move many conservatives criticized as motivated more by domestic politics. Leaving Syria gives Vladimir Putin ""the greatest gift"" that Trump has so far given to Russia, French wrote on Twitter.

""There's been remarkable progress against the Islamic State in those three years, but perhaps the hardest part is yet to come: addressing the remnants of the group's core in Iraq and Syria,"" Joshua Geltzer and Christopher Costa, two former counterterrorism officials, write in The Times. ""We've yet to figure out fully how to turn the corner from degrading groups like Al Qaeda and the Islamic State to actually defeating them.""

The move undercuts American allies like the governments of Iraq, Afghanistan and the Kurds, explains Kori Schake, a former national security official under George W. Bush. Her piece in The Atlantic is headlined ""Trump Just Screwed Up the One Thing He Did Better Than Obama.""

And The Times terrorism reporter Rukmini Callimachi notes that this isn't the first time American officials have prematurely proclaimed ISIS's defeat.

110,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/27/briefing/iraq-antarctica-reid-hoffman.html,"Good morning,

We start today with a look at President Trump's visit to Iraq, a big day on Wall Street, and a major investigation into the effects of the administration's environmental policies.

President Trump makes a surprise trip to Iraq

The president traveled with his wife, Melania, to Al Asad Air Base on Wednesday, where he visited U.S. troops and defended his decision to withdraw from Syria. It was the president's first trip to troops stationed in a combat zone.

Mr. Trump said the U.S. might station commandos on Iraq's border with Syria, to launch raids and other missions into that country, a strategy the Pentagon proposed after the American withdrawal was announced last week.

Explainer: With the U.S. withdrawal, Iran and Russia will be freer to flex their power in the region. We looked at how Syria's nearly eight-year civil war is evolving.

The markets bounce back

Driven by reports of a strong holiday shopping season, U.S. stocks roared back on Wednesday after being pushed to the brink of a bear market.

The S&P 500 rose nearly 5 percent, its best day since 2009, and the Dow Jones industrial average climbed 1,086 points, its biggest single-session point gain ever.

Markets were mixed in Asia today, but investors in Europe seemed more cautious. Futures markets suggest that Wall Street will open lower.

Closer look: The S&P 500 still looks set for its worst annual performance since the financial crisis a decade ago. Despite Wednesday's positive signs, investors are concerned by the Federal Reserve's decision to continue raising interest rates.

Border facilities are at ""a breaking point""

Kirstjen Nielsen, the secretary of homeland security, said on Wednesday that a ""dramatic increase"" of Central American migrants at the southwestern border was straining the system designed to handle them.

She also said that her agency would increase medical screenings of children after the death of a Guatemalan boy in detention this week.

Catch up: Funding for President Trump's border wall is at the center of a spending impasse that led to the partial government shutdown, which is entering its sixth day. Our reporters answered some common questions about the dispute.

What's next: Lawmakers return to Capitol Hill today to resume budget negotiations, although Representative Steve Scalise of Louisiana, the majority whip, told House members that no votes were expected. Reaching a deal could hinge on semantics: What is a wall?

The real-life effects of environmental cutbacks

For nearly two years, President Trump has fought to free American businesses from what he and many of his supporters view as excessive environmental rules.

The story of the Trump administration's deregulation efforts has largely been told from Washington, but an investigation by The Times shows how regular Americans are being affected.

How we know: As part of the investigation, our reporters traveled to four states -- California, North Dakota, Texas and West Virginia -- and found that residents and business leaders were often divided. Some said the Obama administration went too far with new environmental rules, while others worried that the Trump administration's changes would hurt their families, particularly their children.

Go deeper: Nearly 80 Obama-era regulations have been blocked, delayed or targeted for repeal, according to our analysis. Here are some other takeaways.

If you have 20 minutes, this is worth itWhen Ebola rips across a war zone

A small team of health workers, accompanied by our reporter, risked their lives to get to a militia-controlled village in the Democratic Republic of Congo where a woman had died from Ebola.

But the lethal virus was not their biggest fear. ""We're scared of the Mai-Mai,"" a vaccine expert said, using a local term for insurgents. ""We're afraid they might kill us.""

Here's what else is happening

Solo trip across Antarctica: Colin O'Brady, a 33-year-old American, became the first person to cross the continent from coast to coast alone, unsupported and unaided by wind. His 932-mile journey took just under two months.

Alabama election deception: Reid Hoffman, a co-founder of LinkedIn whose money funded Russian-style social media deception in a Senate race last year, has apologized, saying that he hadn't approved the operation and didn't support such tactics.

Ruth Bader Ginsburg: The Supreme Court justice has been discharged from the hospital and is recovering at home after surgery last week to remove two nodules from her lung.

Snapshot: Above, archaeologists unearthed a petrified horse, complete with military saddle, outside the ancient city of Pompeii, Italy, which was destroyed when Mount Vesuvius erupted in A.D. 79. The remains of two other horses were also found.

In memoriam: Larry Eisenberg was one of the most prolific contributors of reader comments on The Times's website, with more than 13,000, mostly in the form of limericks (!). He was 99.

Late-night comedy: The hosts are either off or in reruns this week. Our roundup will return.

What we're reading: This timely, detailed look in The New Yorker at Iraq's campaign of revenge against suspected jihadists. Steven Erlanger, our chief European diplomatic correspondent, says it ""might make one wonder about the point of the American intervention there and the scale of inhumanity now compared to that under Saddam Hussein."" (There's an audio version, too.)

Now, a break from the news

Cook: This cheese-steak sub isn't a regular sandwich: It's a special treat.

Listen: ""Whack World,"" by the singer and rapper Tierra Whack, is the title song of one of the most praised releases of the year -- a collection of 15 songs, each under a minute long and accompanied by a video. Perfect, our critic said, for ""combat in the attention economy.""

Read: Books from long-running series by Lee Child, Janet Evanovich, James Patterson and Louise Penny maintained their stride over the holidays on our hardcover fiction best-seller list.

Watch: John Mulaney's standup special ""Kid Gorgeous,"" one of our critic's picks for the best comedy of 2018.

And now for the Back Story on ...Revolutionary French fashion

The ""Yellow Vests"" are not the first rebel group in French history to be named after the outfits of the resistance.

Fashion has played a significant role in the heritage, economic development and identity of France, and dress has often signaled and symbolized change.

In the late 18th century, during the French Revolution, a significant component of the uprising sported working-class pantalons -- basically trousers -- instead of the fancy knee breeches, or culottes, worn with heels and stockings by the male aristocracy. The insurgents went down in history as the ""sans-culottes,"" or ""without breeches.""

In 1968, France's student-led rebellions against capitalism and American imperialism (among other isms) redefined associations with berets, turtlenecks, boots and tartan.

In both cases, the visual messaging communicated allegiance as effectively as any slogan or protest poster -- and became an export as successful as Brie or Champagne.

That's it for this briefing. See you next time.

The books provide a fresh perspective on the female fury that fueled the #MeToo movement as well as the limits and the potential of the revolution. In 'Good and Mad,' Traister describes how women's rage -- often masked by tears and comedy or denigrated and diminished, if expressed -- has shaped American history, politics and social movements. In 'Betraying Big Brother,' Fincher illustrates the nascent feminist movement in China by recounting the story of the five feminist activists who were jailed for 37 days in 2015 after handing out stickers protesting sexual harassment. She argues that misogyny is at the core of China's authoritarian regime and that a feminist movement, if not suppressed, could prove to be the country's 'most transformative movement.'""

Should corporations be charged for crimes their employees commit?

That nettlesome question has come back to the fore as law enforcement authorities take aim at Goldman Sachs for its involvement in a vast scandal at a Malaysian investment fund.

The Malaysian government on Monday filed criminal charges against Goldman, accusing the bank of making false and misleading statements when it raised money for the fund, called 1Malaysia Development Berhad, or 1MDB. The immediate consequences of the Malaysian charges against Goldman subsidiaries are likely to be limited, but the action will stir up discussion about how United States prosecutors should proceed and whether they should bring criminal charges against Goldman.

Where the investigations stand

So far, American prosecutors have secured a guilty plea from a former senior Goldman investment banker and filed money laundering and bribery charges against another former employee. It's not clear what sort of action, if any, the Department of Justice will take against Goldman as a firm.

Given the scale of the wrongdoing, prosecutors may seek a punishment that deters similar misconduct. With the help of the two Goldman employees, some $2.7 billion was misappropriated from the $6.5 billion that the bank raised for 1MDB, according to the government's legal documents.

Goldman has said it is cooperating with law enforcement in the United States, and its former chief executive suggested that employees went to great lengths to conceal their involvement in the Malaysian scheme. Michael Duvally, a spokesman for Goldman, said on Monday that the bank would contest Malaysia's charges, adding that they do not ""affect our ability to conduct our current business globally.""

Why are criminal charges against a company such a big deal?

In the past, some companies have a hard time surviving criminal indictments or guilty pleas.

In 1988, Drexel Burnham Lambert, a hard-charging investment bank, pleaded guilty to six felony counts. It filed for bankruptcy in 1990. Wall Street survived Drexel's collapse, and prosecutors continued to file criminal charges against corporations.

That changed after Arthur Andersen was convicted in 2002 of obstruction of justice in a case related to Enron, the energy trading firm. The conviction had a big role in the demise of most of Andersen's operations, a fate that many believed was too severe.

The Supreme Court unanimously overturned the Andersen's conviction in 2005, finding fault with the trial judge's instructions to the jury. The court's decision helped persuade the Department of Justice to favor settlements over prosecutions.

Calls to charge companies returned after the financial crisis of 2008, when there was clear evidence of widespread wrongdoing at banks. But the government feared that the global financial system was still not strong enough to bear the consequences of charges against a large bank and held off taking criminal actions. (It did, however, bring civil actions that resulted in multibillion-dollar fines.)

As the banking system steadied and prosecutors wanted to hold bankers accountable, the Obama administrations started to obtain guilty pleas from banks on criminal charges.

Why didn't the banks run into deep trouble after these actions?

The government tried to limit the collateral damage. Sometimes, prosecutors charged a single foreign subsidiary of a bank rather than its parent company. Waivers were granted that allowed banks to continue doing certain types of business. When a division of a French bank faced a ban on dollar clearing, it paid others to do the activity.

But even if the government softens the blow, guilty pleas still have bite. They strengthen the hand of prosecutors if the company were to commit more wrongdoing. ""If you are on a guilty plea, you are on probation, and the consequences of a violation are more serious,"" says Brandon L. Garrett, a law professor at Duke.

Are criminal charges against Goldman Sachs even likely?

Senior officials in President Trump's Justice Department have not stated publicly their position on the criminal prosecution of companies, but the federal agencies that pursue misconduct so far appear to have a lighter touch, according to a recent article in The New York Times that showed a drop in penalties.

At the same time, if evidence of serious wrongdoing is found at Goldman, prosecutors are likely to take stringent action. Much depends on how many high-level employees were complicit or negligent and whether there were significant weaknesses in Goldman's controls. In their charges against one of the former Goldman bankers, prosecutors said the bank at times prioritized deals ""ahead of the proper operation of its compliance function."" The government, however, has not publicly provided much supporting detail for that assertion.

Short of a guilty plea by Goldman, the Department of Justice could push the bank to enter a deferred prosecution agreement, under which the government outlines charges but asks that they be postponed for a period during which the bank promises to revamp its compliance. Softer still is a non-prosecution agreement, in which the government would not file charges but may still require that the bank commit to an overhaul.

Banks may be too big to jail but individuals are not

Some legal scholars recognize that the government is not going to take the sort of criminal action against banks that could do serious harm to their businesses. As a result, they contend, if prosecutors want to deter wrongdoing on Wall Street, they need to focus on getting jail time for individuals convicted of white-collar crime. ""How do you really put in place some deterrent?"" said Jimmy Gurulé, a law professor at Notre Dame. ""Somebody has to go to prison. But that is as rare as a bank losing its license."""
113,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/21/books/review/betty-ford-the-times-of-my-life.html,"This week, Isabel Wilkerson reviews Michelle Obama's best-selling memoir, ""Becoming."" Obama's book joins a tradition of memoirs by former first ladies. In 1978, Jane Howard reviewed Betty Ford's memoir, ""The Times of My Life.""

Written with Chris Chase, Mrs. Ford's memoir abounds with proof that fate sure can play funny tricks. Her story is already part of American legend -- Middle Western madcap goes east, dances with Martha Graham, returns to Grand Rapids, coordinates fashions for a department store, leads conga lines, marries a diabetic salesman, divorces him after five years. She is married again to an earnest politician who takes her to Washington and leaves her alone a lot during the years ""our gang"" of four towheads is growing up. Betty teaches Sunday school, leads Scout troops, drinks, gets fat, slims down, suffers a pinched nerve in her neck, gets hooked on the pills prescribed by her doctors. Her husband is so uncontroversial he becomes President; his wife astonishes the nation by saying what she thinks, thereby becoming one of the most ""popular"" and ""admired"" women in the world. Imagine, a First Lady who favors gun control and abortion and feminism!

It's too bad this book's last chapter, on her month at the Long Beach Naval Hospital's Alcohol and Drug Rehabilitation Center, couldn't have come first. ""I'm Betty and I'm an alcoholic"" -- a line from one of her group-therapy sessions with sailors -- would have made a smashing opening sentence. Or, better yet, ""I'm Betty and I'm an alcoholic and I've just had my face lifted"" -- a procedure she endured just this fall, after the book had gone to press, because ""I'm sixty years old and I wanted a nice new face to go with my beautiful new life."" Fair enough, though it would be nice to have an icon who could live with her wrinkles. So cheers, in Perrier water with a twist of lime. It's to both authors' credit that these memoirs sound just like Betty Ford herself: as American as a suburban shopping mall. Reading the book is like going to the mall to buy just one thing, and ending up staying all afternoon."
114,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/21/world/asia/afghanistan-war-explainer.html,"Even the most dedicated news junkies can find it difficult to keep up on the war in Afghanistan, now beginning its 18th year.

This guide is for those who could use a refresher or a beginner's-level course on the conflict, in which more than 2,400 Americans have died, including 13 this year.

The American-backed government's situation now is the worst it's been. The United Nations said the first half of 2018 was the deadliest first half of any year in the war so far, with 1,692 civilians killed. And the Taliban hold more territory than at any point since the war began, in 2001.

Why is the United States military still there?

President George W. Bush launched the first missiles in October 2001, about a month after the Sept. 11 attacks. The goals were to destroy Al Qaeda and the Taliban government that protected it, and to ensure the country wouldn't be a safe haven for terrorists.

Seventeen years later, the Taliban are stronger than ever as they fight the Afghan government for control, and American officials fear the country could still offer a home to those plotting attacks on American soil. Even Al Qaeda, which had been all but eliminated years ago, has recently resurfaced.

In 2014, the Pentagon declared an end to American combat operations. But since then, a smaller number of troops have remained to train Afghan forces and carry out counterterror operations against groups like the Islamic State.

In 2017, at the request of Jim Mattis, who resigned as the secretary of defense on Thursday, 4,000 additional troops were added, in hopes of hastening an end to the conflict and preparing Afghan forces for the eventual American withdrawal.

Now, American airstrikes are the heaviest they've been since the height of the war, when American troop levels in Afghanistan peaked out at about 100,000. But on Thursday, President Trump said the United States would withdraw about half of its remaining 14,000 troops.

Who are the Taliban?

The Taliban ruled most of Afghanistan from 1996 to 2001. They aim to establish an Islamic caliphate, an antidemocratic form of government in which women have few rights.

The American military action removed them from power, but they were not completely eliminated. The group has regained strength and continues to control as much as 40 percent of the territory in the country, and many analysts would argue even more.

In July, the Taliban insurgents said they would stop attacking Afghan civilians in suicide attacks. But violence has persisted as they reclaim territory and battle the government for control.

The U.S. military has estimated that there are 20,000 to 40,000 active Taliban fighters. The Afghan military and police, on the other hand, are said to have up to 350,000 members, though are they are plagued with heavy casualties, attrition and desertion.

Where do peace talks stand?

The Taliban has refused to meet with the Afghan government, a Western-style democracy installed after the American invasion, until the insurgency reaches an agreement with the United States on the future of the American military presence, the fate of Taliban prisoners and sanctions imposed on their leaders.

But the Taliban have met with American envoys, and this week's meeting in Dubai was said to be the most substantial peace discussion yet.

""I said that if the menace of terrorism is tackled, the United States is not looking for a permanent military presence in Afghanistan,"" Zalmay Khalilzad, the Trump administration's representative, told the Afghan news outlet ToloNews.

How has the U.S. approach changed under President Trump?

Until this week, not much had been different. Both Mr. Trump and President Barack Obama relied on a mix of military force and diplomatic pressure on Pakistan to crack down on insurgent sanctuaries in that country.

The Trump administration urged American-backed Afghan troops to retreat from rural, Taliban-controlled areas of the country and focus on protecting cities -- much like what happened at times under Mr. Obama and Mr. Bush.

In 2017, Mr. Trump said he had been convinced that ""a hasty withdrawal would create a vacuum for terrorists, including ISIS and Al Qaeda.""

But the president has had little patience for the long-running war, and he has repeatedly said his instinct had been to pull troops out. The expensive war is deeply unpopular in the United States."
115,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/17/world/africa/nigeria-military-abuses.html,"ABUJA, Nigeria -- The message sent on Twitter was clear: When Nigerian soldiers opened fire on rock-throwing protesters in late October, Nigerian officials swiftly defended them, saying their forces had simply done what President Trump told American soldiers to do in the same situation.

The Nigerian military justified its actions by including a video clip of Mr. Trump's remarks about migrants heading toward the American border, in which he warned: ""They want to throw rocks at our military, our military fights back.""

Nigeria's defense came after its soldiers had shot at protesters -- members of a minority Shiite organization -- marching on the outskirts of the capital, Abuja. The military insisted that the soldiers had taken action only after being provoked by the protesters, who hurdled rocks at them. Ten soldiers were injured in the melee, it said. The military also said a total of six protesters were killed during marches.

But a close review of video from the largest and most deadly of the protests, as well as interviews with more than a dozen witnesses, clearly shows the military opening fire on unarmed demonstrators, sometimes shooting indiscriminately into the crowd at close range as people turned and tried to flee.

Photos and videos recorded that day show at least 26 bodies. The group said it had collected a total of 49 bodies during four days of protests.

The killings are the latest example of a military that for years has been accused of human rights abuses, with rarely any punishment or action taken, despite President Muhammadu Buhari's promises to crack down on military violations and restore security in the country.

Since Mr. Buhari came to office in 2015, Nigerian security forces have detained scores of children and babies, raped women living in camps for displaced people and carried out civilian massacres.

Despite the documented abuses, Mr. Trump has strengthened ties with Nigeria. This year, he allowed the sale of warplanes and other equipment to Nigeria that had been blocked by the Obama administration over concerns about human rights abuses.

Before leaving office, President Barack Obama had been prepared to resume the sales. But then the Nigerian military bombed a camp for displaced people, killing dozens of civilians and prompting Mr. Obama to keep the restrictions in place.

Now Mr. Buhari is facing re-election in February, and his critics are pointing to a new unraveling of the security situation across Nigeria that has rattled citizens in all corners of the country.

The Nigerian president has struggled to address a broad range of problems in the military. Its abuses have been carried out not only against protesting Shiites, but also against separatists in the southeast, where the president has launched major military operations. It has used excessive force in the northwest, where he has scrambled fighter jets against gangs roaming the forest.

At the same time, Mr. Buhari's campaign against Boko Haram, the terrorist group that has been at war with the nation for nearly a decade, has suffered crippling failures on the battlefield.

In recent weeks, more than 100 Nigerian soldiers have been killed in at least 20 attacks against military installations, one of which was captured on video and posted online by a Boko Haram faction.

Parts of neighboring countries that have been peaceful for years have suffered attacks by militants, who have emerged armed from their new victories with heavy military equipment confiscated in raids.

Soldiers fighting Boko Haram have complained of low food rations, shoddy equipment and no days off in more than a year, the local news media has reported.

On Friday, the military suspended the operations of Unicef in the areas most affected by Boko Haram, saying that the organization trains and deploys spies to help Boko Haram because it offered programs to help spot human rights abuses by the military. The military later rescinded the suspension.

Mr. Buhari recently traveled to the war zone to rally troops, but he has yet to address the military abuses.

The shooting deaths of Shiite marchers six weeks ago generated little outrage in the country. Mr. Buhari did not condemn the killings, nor did his rivals.

The president's ""turn-a-blind-eye approach has bolstered the military's culture of impunity,"" said Matthew Page, a former top expert on Nigeria for the State Department.

""Nigerians' growing frustration with insecurity -- whether it be kidnapping, armed robbery, communal violence or terrorist attacks -- outweighs the disgust they feel about human rights abuses by security forces,"" he said.

Officials have taken a tougher stance against the Shiite marchers, who belong to a group called the Islamic Movement in Nigeria, than it has against almost any other organization in the country.

Nigeria is a mix of Christians and Muslims, but officials say the group is financed and influenced by Iran. Most Muslims in Nigeria, including Mr. Buhari, are Sunni. The group does not believe the Nigerian Constitution applies to it -- largely because its members do not feel protected by the rule of law. That sentiment has angered officials.

The military said it had killed three people who were blocking the road and trying to steal military equipment, and then another three at the Oct. 29 march who were throwing fuel bottles and large rocks at soldiers.

But the video from the march clearly contradicts those claims. The melee began that day as more than 1,000 marchers approached a military checkpoint. Soldiers arrived to block off the road. An armored vehicle with high-caliber weapons patrolled the highway. After soldiers began to fire, they targeted protesters fleeing the chaos. Many of the injured were shot in the back or legs.

Brig. Gen. John Agim, the spokesman for the Nigerian military, said soldiers had abused no one during the recent marches. He said he had not seen video of the events but was certain that whatever existed had been manipulated to make Nigerian soldiers look bad, calling it ""stage managed.""

The protesters from the group generally ""cause a lot of disruption,"" he said. ""They destroy other people's cars. They block the traffic.""

""When they attack the military, what do you expect soldiers to do?"" he said, adding that the military had retrieved weapons from protesters, including knives and homemade firebombs. ""Of course, there will be a necessary course of action.""

Amnesty International disputed the military's statements, saying its allegations against marchers were an attempt to justify unlawful killings. The military's actions appear to violate international laws, according to Human Rights Watch, which said that Nigerian officials had a pattern of repression against the Shiite group.

Muhammed Sani said he had watched soldiers shoot to death one of his brothers, who had attended the Oct. 29 protest with him, and later learned that another brother had also been killed. He said he had lost friends that day, too.

""Our protests are peaceful, but they kill us anyway,"" he said.

The Islamic Movement in Nigeria, founded about four decades ago and inspired by the Iranian Revolution, has been repeatedly labeled a terrorist threat. In the city of Kaduna, where many of the members live, the group is barred from protesting or assembling. Its places of worship, schools and community centers have been demolished by officials who say the group wants to spark a Shiite revolution and could turn to terrorism.

The recent killings are the latest in a long history of clashes, including a more deadly episode in 2015, when soldiers opened fire on members of the group blocking a road for a religious ceremony.

Nearly 350 people were killed, their bodies buried in a mass grave, and the group's leader was imprisoned. He is still in jail on terrorism charges, despite a federal court order demanding his release.

Many of the marchers on Oct. 29 were protesting his detention.

On a recent visit to a hospital in Abuja, more than 40 injured protesters, all in their late teens or 20s, lay on thin mattresses in a dimly lit ward.

Umar Shittu, a 20-year-old student from Kaduna, sat silently on a bed stained by damp blood and urine, rocking back and forth, his face badly drooped. A bullet had pierced the top of his skull and lodged in his neck.

Fatima Muhammed Sani, 16, was also wounded. She had trailed her mother on many marches in the past and was in the middle of the crowd at the Oct. 29 march when she heard gunfire. She said she had run and suddenly felt a strange sensation in her left thigh. A bullet had fractured her bone. Her movement is likely to be restricted forever.

""If I could walk right now, I would go back to protest again,"" Ms. Sani said. ""I'm ready to sacrifice my life for my leader."""
116,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/18/briefing/michael-flynn-stocks-les-moonves.html,"(Want to get this briefing by email? Here's the sign-up.)

Good morning,

We start with new details about Russia's effort to influence the 2016 election, the sentencing today of Michael Flynn and the continued slump in the stock markets.

Russian influence campaign targeted African-Americans

Two reports published on Monday reveal new details about the Russian effort to sway American opinion before the 2016 presidential election. The research was commissioned by the Senate Intelligence Committee.

While ""other distinct ethnic and religious groups were the focus of one or two Facebook pages or Instagram accounts,"" one of the documents said, ""the black community was targeted extensively with dozens."" Here are five takeaways from the reports.

The background: Russia's influence campaign was directed by the Internet Research Agency, a St. Petersburg company owned by a close ally of President Vladimir Putin. More than a dozen of the company's employees have been indicted as part of the investigation by Robert Mueller, the special counsel.

The details: The reports identified some of the most widely shared images and posts the Internet Research Agency created.

From Opinion: Russian interference is ""a chronic, widespread and identifiable condition that we must now aggressively manage,"" the leader of one of the research teams writes.

Michael Flynn is expected to be sentenced today

President Trump's first national security adviser is set to be sentenced today in the special counsel's investigation of Russian election interference.

Mr. Flynn faces up to six months in prison for lying to federal investigators about his conversations with the Russian ambassador during the presidential transition. But prosecutors have recommended little or no prison time because he has provided ""substantial help"" with inquiries.

The details: An F.B.I. document released on Monday outlines some of Mr. Flynn's lies.

Notable: Mr. Trump has long blamed a ""deep state"" in the government for his troubles. A growing number of people accused of wrongdoing are now adopting that defense.

Stocks hit a new low for 2018

This is shaping up to be Wall Street's worst year since the financial crisis a decade ago, with the S&P 500 down 4.8 percent since January.

Driven by economic uncertainty, the slump is likely to be followed by a Federal Reserve decision to raise interest rates on Wednesday. Such moves are traditionally viewed as having a negative effect on stock prices.

What's next: Markets in Asia and Europe were down today, but Wall Street futures suggest that U.S. markets could open higher.

The impact: As the Fed pushes up borrowing costs, there is increasing concern that growth will slow and that the chances of entering a recession will grow.

In Yemen, fishermen are also under fire

Outrage over the murder of the dissident Jamal Khashoggi by Saudi operatives has drawn attention to the Saudi-led war in Yemen, where airstrikes have targeted weddings, funerals and a school bus. Thousands of civilians have died.

Keith Richards turns 75 today.

There are many who consider this achievement nothing short of a miracle. His career has been littered with one near-death experience after the other.

In 1965, he received an electric shock onstage in Sacramento. He recalled lying in the hospital and overhearing a doctor saying, ""Well, they either wake up or they don't.""

While in the throes of a heroin addiction in the 1970s, he barely escaped several house fires. He once fell asleep at the wheel. He popped in and out of jail on drug possession charges.

In 2006, he fell out of a palm tree in Fiji, fracturing his skull. Two years later, he taunted death once more, snorting his dead father's ashes. ""Ashes to ashes, father to son,"" he wrote in his memoir.

But Richards appears to have mellowed out: Last week, he said he had mostly stopped drinking alcohol. ""It was time to quit,"" he sad. ""Just like all the other stuff.""

Here's to the next 75.

That's it for this briefing. See you next time.

118,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/29/us/politics/medicare-for-all-private-plans.html,"WASHINGTON -- More and more Democrats, fed up with private health insurance companies, are endorsing the goal of a government-run, single-payer system like Medicare for all Americans. But they have discovered a problem. More than one-third of Medicare beneficiaries are in Medicare Advantage plans, run not by the government but by private insurers.

Whether to allow younger Americans to enroll in such private Medicare plans has become a hotly debated political question as Democrats look to 2020.

When liberal Democrats started advocating ""Medicare for all"" more than 25 years ago, Medicare was the original fee-for-service program run by the government. Since then, it has changed in big ways. More than 20 million of the 60 million beneficiaries are in comprehensive Medicare Advantage plans sold by private insurers like UnitedHealth, Humana, Kaiser Permanente and Blue Cross and Blue Shield.

Enrollment in private Medicare plans has shot up roughly 80 percent since 2010. Older Americans are attracted by the prospect of extra benefits, a limit on out-of-pocket costs and a doctor or nurse who can coordinate their care.

""Medicare for all"" has become a rallying cry for progressive Democrats, though it means different things to different people. Supporters generally agree that it is a way to achieve universal coverage with a system of national health insurance in which a single public program would pay most of the bills, but care would still be delivered by private doctors and hospitals.

One-third of Senate Democrats and more than half of House Democrats who will serve in the new Congress have endorsed proposals to open Medicare to all Americans, regardless of age.

A Medicare-for-all bill drafted by Senator Bernie Sanders, independent of Vermont, has been endorsed by 15 Democratic senators, including several potential presidential candidates: Cory Booker of New Jersey, Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, Kamala Harris of California and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts.

In the House, Medicare for all is gaining new support with the election of a number of progressive Democrats. They include Sylvia R. Garcia of Texas, Jahana Hayes of Connecticut, Joe Neguse of Colorado, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Katie Porter of California, Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan.

Although Barack Obama shunned single-payer solutions as president, he praised Medicare for all in a campaign-style speech in September. ""Democrats aren't just running on good old ideas like a higher minimum wage,"" he said. ""They're running on good new ideas like Medicare for all.""

Billy Wynne, a health care lobbyist who used to work for Senate Democrats, said: ""The literal meaning of 'Medicare for all' would include Medicare Advantage. But that is not what most supporters of Medicare for all have in mind.""

The champions of Medicare for all generally see insurance companies as part of the problem, not the solution.

""There are a lot of insurance companies and medical companies that are advocating for their own best interests, and those best interests are usually money, and not people's health,"" Representative-elect Deb Haaland, Democrat of New Mexico and a supporter of Medicare for all, said in an interview. ""We need a national public health care system, which would be more affordable in the long run, and the outcomes might be better.""

Wendy Kaplan, 53, of Evanston, Ill., who has found family coverage under the Affordable Care Act rather expensive, said she liked the idea of Medicare for all.

""In principle,"" said Ms. Kaplan, a Democrat, ""I feel that health insurance should be available to everyone. Single payer is a great idea in principle. I don't think health care should be a for-profit endeavor. My biggest reservation is whether our government could be competent at running something like that.""

Large majorities of Medicare beneficiaries say in surveys that they are satisfied with their coverage.

With a Republican president and a Republican-controlled Senate, proposals for a major new health care entitlement have no chance of becoming law in the next two years. But they show how an idea long relegated to the sidelines is edging back into favor with some Democrats and could be embraced by the party's nominee in the next presidential election.

President Trump and other Republicans have mocked the idea of Medicare for all, saying it could ruin the program for older Americans and generate huge costs for the federal government. It would ""come at a staggering cost to taxpayers,"" said Alex M. Azar II, the secretary of health and human services.

Christine Vilord, an Idaho schoolteacher who described herself as a moderate Republican, said she could support a Medicare-for-all program of national health insurance even if it meant a small increase in taxes. She said she realized the need for such a program in October when her 25-year-old daughter was in a severe auto accident that left her unable to walk for two months.

Asked if his vision of Medicare for all included private Medicare Advantage plans, Adam Green, a founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, an advocacy group, said: ""No, absolutely not. Why would it? Medicare for all, in the end, means fundamental systemic change. People would no longer be at the mercy of for-profit insurers that make money by denying people care.""

Mr. Sanders and Representative Pramila Jayapal, Democrat of Washington and a chairwoman of the Medicare for All Caucus in Congress, see no need for private Medicare Advantage plans.

Vedant Patel, a spokesman for Ms. Jayapal, said her vision of Medicare for all was the traditional Medicare program, not private plans. ""The purpose of Medicare for all is defeated if there are other plans people can buy into,"" he said.

Josh Miller Lewis, a spokesman for Mr. Sanders, said: ""We would get rid of duplicative health insurance. Our version of Medicare would cover most procedures. There would be no need for a Medicare Advantage program.""

Other lawmakers support expanding Medicare, but do not want to disrupt coverage for consumers who like the insurance they have.

""Millions of Americans who rely on employer-sponsored insurance and Medicare Advantage are satisfied with their coverage,"" said Representative Rosa DeLauro, Democrat of Connecticut.

She and Representative Jan Schakowsky, Democrat of Illinois, introduced a bill in mid-December to provide comprehensive universal coverage through an enhanced version of traditional Medicare. They would allow people to enroll in Medicare Advantage plans. But, Ms. DeLauro said, ""it is my hope that we have designed our new health care program so well that individuals will choose"" it over Medicare Advantage.

Under their bill, large employers could continue providing insurance to employees if the coverage and benefits were comparable to those in the government program. By contrast, under Mr. Sanders's bill, it would be unlawful for an employer to provide coverage that duplicates the benefits in the government's ""universal Medicare program.""

Some health policy experts have suggested building a national health insurance program on Medicare Advantage rather than on the traditional fee-for-service Medicare program.

""Medicare Advantage for all -- that would be a much more politically feasible and a uniquely American spin on single payer,"" said John K. Gorman, a former Medicare official who is a consultant to many insurers. ""It would be Medicare paying all the bills, but it would be privately administered by heavily regulated plans that would effectively serve as utilities."""
119,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/29/us/politics/michelle-obama-stacey-abrams-politics.html,"ATLANTA -- Sit down with groups of black women in Atlanta as this tumultuous political year draws to a close, and two names dominate the conversation: Michelle Obama and Stacey Abrams, and what they revealed in 2018 about how power is gained and thwarted.

In gatherings of friends, in book clubs and discussions across the city, women said they were struck by seeing their own life experiences reflected in the possibilities and constraints faced by Ms. Abrams, whose narrow loss in the Georgia governor's race they are still mourning, and Mrs. Obama, who just published the best-selling memoir ""Becoming.""

They related to how Ms. Abrams and Mrs. Obama defied people who questioned if they were good enough to succeed. How Mrs. Obama won over the white Democratic establishment -- but only after enduring attacks and caricatures that sometimes left her shaken. How Ms. Abrams did not tone down her words to please anyone, and how Mrs. Obama felt she had to.

In a city that showcases African-American achievement and influence, reading Mrs. Obama's memoir was a bittersweet reminder for these women of a time when a black president and first lady seemed a culmination of a long struggle for power. It comes as Democratic women here are wrestling with outrage over widespread allegations of voter suppression in the governor's race, fear that Ms. Abrams's loss may disillusion black voters they coaxed to the polls, and hope that the next time victory could be within reach.

""I think America can take Michelle Obama,"" said Kia Smith, who gathered with three other young professional friends at a Starbucks for what became a searing exchange about the promise and burden of being black women. ""The story makes us feel good. And she's on the daytime shows, she dances with Ellen, she goes on Jimmy Kimmel, she's fun, she's not a threat.

""But someone like Stacey Abrams, who is smart, who is bipartisan, but who is unapologetic about fairness and justice -- that's a threat. And that also lets me know that we're not really ready for the political power of black women.""

Across town, in a neighborhood where yards are still planted with defiant Stacey Abrams signs, the Pearls literary club convened an extra session this month to discuss ""Becoming."" They zeroed in on the theme of striving against denigration and self-doubt. The room of older women, with Ph.D.s and law degrees among them, traded stories of being told, like Mrs. Obama, that they did not belong.

Just as Mrs. Obama's guidance counselor dismissed her chances of getting into Princeton, a Wellesley College dean informed Ruby Thomas, now a judge, that she shouldn't be there.

""She called me into her office and explained to me why I wasn't qualified to be there,"" Ms. Thomas remembered. ""I tell that story to young girls, who need to know that people are going to judge you, but they are going to misjudge you.""

That, in turn, reminded the women of a time when Ms. Abrams was invited to the governor's mansion as one of many high school valedictorians, only to be stopped by a guard who didn't believe she was a guest.

They relished what Donna Akiba Sullivan Harper, a professor of English at Spelman College, called Mrs. Obama's ""sassiness"" in the book -- an outspokenness that the first lady held in check after early criticism of her as angry or abrasive.

""Do you think her honesty increased because of the things said by the person who now occupies the White House?"" Professor Harper asked the room of women, who deliberately avoided mentioning President Trump by name. When one referred to the ""gentleman in the White House,"" the otherwise decorous group hooted.

Ms. Smith and her friends, some of whom were also reading ""Becoming"" in their book clubs, welcomed an unleashed Mrs. Obama as well. But they said they struggled, as she did, with the stigma of caricature.

""There are these extra steps that we as black women have to go through to make sure we're not appearing angry, aggressive, mean, nasty, insubordinate,"" said Alexis Watt, who works as a communications and social media consultant. ""We have this stereotype that black women are angry, but we have every right to be angry.""

Both generations of women who spoke in interviews said they were fighting despair at the contrast between the Trump White House and the barrier-breaking Obama White House.

A guest at the Pearls gathering brought her 6-year-old, born the year President Barack Obama was re-elected. Her name: Renaissance.

At Starbucks, Jasmine Mitchell said to her friends, ""We felt as though we were winning all around. We got complacent. We were so naïve.""

So the Abrams run raised hopes that a black woman they embraced might win -- with their help. From the historic Sweet Auburn market not far from Martin Luther King's Ebenezer Baptist Church, in beauty parlors and black-owned restaurants, every black woman who spoke to me had somehow tried to turn out votes, whether by canvassing, texting, rousting their voting-age children or cajoling their employees and co-workers.

Along with years of efforts to register voters and an extensive field operation by political professionals and grass-roots groups, they boosted black voter turnout in Georgia higher than even the 2016 presidential election, and helped Ms. Abrams come within 55,000 votes of victory -- the closest governor's race since 1966. Lucy McBath, a black Democrat who ran on gun control after her son was killed, flipped the very House seat in the Atlanta suburbs that Jon Ossoff, hailed as a 30-year-old political wunderkind, had spent millions to pursue in a failed bid in a special election last year.

Now they are trying to figure out how to regroup.

""It's like when you take a test and you study for it a long time and you have that feeling -- 'I'm going to pass' -- and then, after the numbers came out, it was a terrible feeling to see you didn't pass the test,"" said Charmika Spencer, owner of the Jakotes beauty salon. ""How do we move forward?""

Deborah VanTrece, a prominent Atlanta chef, hashed over that very question at her restaurant, Twisted Soul Cookhouse & Pours.

""It feels like we slipped through there one time and they sealed those cracks to make sure it never happens again,"" she said, referring to Mr. Obama's victory.

Several of the women expressed fear the attention to black women's political clout could fade, their accomplishments could be undone, and their efforts to organize and mobilize voters could prove too exhausting in a system that feels rigged against them.

""While I would love to clean up this mess, and I feel like I know exactly what to do, I'm like, 'You learn how to clean it up yourself,'"" said LaShondra Butler, a friend of Ms. Watt's, referring both to black men and society at large. ""They so often look to black women to be the nanny of every situation.""

Nonetheless, the conversations soon turned to resilience and the need to start early on the work of persuading voters for the 2020 elections. ""I have this perspective where you fail forward -- even when you lose, you build political power and momentum,"" said Ms. Smith, whose job at a nonprofit includes digital organizing.

To Sheila Butler, who has worked as a waitress for 22 years at the Busy Bee, an Atlanta soul food institution, the answer is simple, even though Mrs. Obama ruled out political ambitions in her book: ""I'm keeping my fingers crossed for Michelle Obama and Oprah Winfrey. I want them to run for president.""

The women at the Pearls book club wound down their contemplation of Mrs. Obama and Ms. Abrams by offering optimism tempered with realism.

""We soon learned, we were back to where we started -- almost,"" said Ernestine Pickens-Glass, a retired professor of English at Clark Atlanta University, who hosted the book club. ""But I don't think African Americans are ever going to accept the way things used to be."""
120,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/23/us/politics/chief-justice-john-roberts-supreme-court.html,"WASHINGTON -- In his first 13 years on the Supreme Court, Chief Justice John G. Roberts Jr.'s main challenge was trying to assemble five votes to move the court to the right though there were only four reliably conservatives justices.

Now he faces a very different problem. With the retirement of Justice Anthony M. Kennedy and his replacement by Justice Brett M. Kavanaugh, the chief justice has the votes he needs on issues like abortion, racial discrimination, religion and voting. At the same time, he has taken Justice Kennedy's place as the swing vote at the court's ideological center, making him the most powerful chief justice in 80 years.

But all of that new power comes at a dangerous time for the court, whose legitimacy depends on the public perception that it is not a partisan institution. ""We don't work as Democrats or Republicans,"" Chief Justice Roberts said in 2016, and he reiterated that position in an extraordinary rebuke of President Trump last month.

He seemed to underscore that point again on Friday, joining the court's four-member liberal wing, all appointed by Democratic presidents, to reject a request from the Trump administration in a case that could upend decades of asylum policy. Earlier this month, he drew sharp criticism from three conservative colleagues for voting to deny review in two cases on efforts to stop payments to Planned Parenthood.

The Trump administration has tested the chief justice with a series of applications and petitions asking the court to ignore its ordinary procedures in cases on issues like the census and climate change. After what has often appeared to be intense behind-the-scenes negotiations, Chief Justice Roberts has so far assembled coalitions that mostly denied the requests, often over the dissents of two or three of his most conservative colleagues.

The court's newest member, Justice Kavanaugh, did not note a dissent in any of those cases, suggesting that he was following Chief Justice Roberts's lead. That changed on Friday in the asylum case, casting the new dynamic at the court into sharp relief.

Controlling the pace of change on a court whose conservative wing is eager to move fast will be the central problem of the next phase of Chief Justice Roberts's tenure, said Daniel Epps, a law professor at Washington University in St. Louis.

""If he's smart, and he is, what he's probably thinking is, 'I do have a substantive agenda of things I want to accomplish. But it's a lot easier to do that when the court retains its legitimacy. Let's do as much as we can get away with, but maybe that's a little less than some of my colleagues to my right think we can get away with,'"" Professor Epps said.

Leading the court through an ideological minefield at a time of intense political partisanship will tax the leadership of Chief Justice Roberts, who has earned the respect if not affection of his colleagues during his time as the court's leader. He is a skilled administrator with a light wit and exceptional legal skills. But some justices say they miss the ""old chief"" -- Chief Justice William H. Rehnquist, his predecessor, who had a knack for not taking himself too seriously.

Chief Justice Roberts is more apt to consider his place in history and has spoken about spending quiet nights at the court contemplating the portraits of his 16 predecessors.

""They're probably looking down at me with either bemusement or amazement,"" Chief Justice Roberts told C-Span in 2010. ""From time to time, I find it a useful reminder of the role of the court and the role of the chief justice.""

He has spoken admiringly of Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes and his deft management of a clash with President Franklin D. Roosevelt. It arose in 1937, when Roosevelt, unhappy with Supreme Court decisions striking down his New Deal programs, announced a plan to add justices to the court.

""One of the greatest crises facing the Supreme Court since Marbury v. Madison was F.D.R.'s court-packing plan,"" Chief Justice Roberts said in 2015 at New York University, ""and it fell to Hughes to guide a very unpopular Supreme Court through that high-noon showdown against America's most popular president since George Washington.""

""There are things to learn from it,"" he said, and he has seemed to apply those lessons to a series of clashes with Mr. Trump, who has attacked the very idea of judicial independence.

The president seems determined, moreover, to confront and antagonize the Chief Justice Roberts, a surprising tactic in light of the chief justice's conservative roots and respect for executive authority.

In response, Chief Justice Roberts has become increasingly more assertive.

A week after Justice Kavanaugh took his seat on the court, Chief Justice Roberts made rare public comments on ""the contentious events in Washington of recent weeks,"" referring to his new colleague's brutal confirmation hearings, and then last month publicly tangled with Mr. Trump.

After the president responded to an administration loss in a lower court by criticizing the judge who issued it, calling him an ""Obama judge,"" Chief Justice Roberts issued a sharp public statement. He insisted, against the weight of substantial evidence, that ""we do not have Obama judges or Trump judges, Bush judges or Clinton judges.""

Political science data refute that assertion, as do the fights over judicial confirmations. Indeed, the most recent battle, over Justice Kavanaugh, damaged the court's reputation precisely because the court was portrayed as a political prize.

Chief Justice Roberts is too smart and too steeped in history to believe that politics plays no role in judicial decision making. But he must view the idea that judging is wholly separate from politics as a useful fiction, a worthy aspiration and, most important, crucial to the court's standing.

He certainly returns to the theme often.

""We do not sit on opposite sides of an aisle,"" he said of his colleagues in a speech at the University of Minnesota in October. ""We do not caucus in separate rooms. We do not serve one party or one interest. We serve one nation.""

The court's other four Republican appointees -- Justices Kavanaugh, Clarence Thomas, Samuel A. Alito Jr. and Neil M. Gorsuch -- sent a different message not long after, all attending the annual gala dinner of the Federalist Society, the conservative legal group.

Chief Justice Roberts avoids such events, though he did send along congratulations by video for the group's 25th anniversary in 2007. Liberal justices have occasionally addressed the annual convention of the American Constitution Society, a liberal group, but court watchers could not recall a show of force like the one by their conservative colleagues in 2018.

Enthusiasm among conservatives for the chief justice has tempered since President George W. Bush nominated him in 2005. They point to his two votes to uphold President Barack Obama's health care law and a leftward drift documented by political scientists.

In the term that ended in June, for instance, Chief Justice Roberts's voting record was almost indistinguishable from that of Justice Kennedy.

There is no question, however, that Chief Justice Roberts's voting record has been generally conservative. On issues of racial discrimination, religion, voting and campaign finance, his views are squarely in the mainstream of conservative legal thinking.

He voted with five-justice majorities in District of Columbia v. Heller, the 2008 Second Amendment decision that established an individual right to own guns; Citizens United, the 2010 campaign finance decision that amplified the role of money in politics; and Shelby County v. Holder, the 2013 voting rights decision that effectively gutted the Voting Rights Act.

And he seethed when Mr. Obama attacked the Citizens United ruling at his 2010 State of the Union address, with several justices in attendance. A couple of months later, he said the event had been ""a political pep rally.""

""I'm not sure why we are there,"" he said. ""The image of having the members of one branch of government standing up, literally surrounding the Supreme Court, cheering and hollering while the court, according to the requirements of protocol, has to sit there expressionless, I think, is very troubling.""

But by casting the decisive vote to save Mr. Obama's signature legislative achievement, the Affordable Care Act, he transformed his reputation. Liberals hailed him as a statesman. Conservatives denounced him as a traitor.

Mr. Trump, years before he ran for president, was in the second group. ""I guess @JusticeRoberts wanted to be a part of Georgetown society more than anyone knew,"" he wrote on Twitter, citing a fake Twitter handle. During his presidential campaign, Mr. Trump called Chief Justice Roberts ""an absolute disaster.""

It is not as if the Roberts court has not handed the president some victories. In June, Mr. Trump won the biggest case of his presidency so far, when Chief Justice Roberts wrote the majority opinion sustaining the administration's order limiting travel from several predominantly Muslim countries.

But other administration initiatives will soon reach the court, and Chief Justice Roberts's legacy will be shaped by how he addresses them.

He is only 63, but he has already led the Supreme Court for more than a dozen years. His last three predecessors had tenures of between 16 and 19 years, but Chief Justice Roberts is likely to stay in office much longer and to leave a correspondingly larger mark. But he has shown that he is prepared to be patient.

Sara C. Benesh, a political scientist at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee, said Chief Justice Roberts has generally tried to move the law in small steps.

""Moderation, not just in terms of ideological moderation but also humility, is kind of his thing,"" he said. ""He seems to write limited opinions. He doesn't reach any further than he has to. He clearly distinguishes between what he is doing as a judge and what he might believe in terms of policy.""

.

The court will have to soon decide whether to hear two sets of cases concerning Trump administration initiatives to revoke protections for unauthorized immigrants brought to the United States as children and to bar transgender people from military service.

If the justices decide to hear one or both of the cases, what has so far been a sleepy term would become much more significant. While Chief Justice Roberts may be inclined to avoid politically charged issues and quietly rebuild his court's authority, it takes only four votes to add a case to its docket.

Even if he wants to avoid major controversies for now, his more conservative colleagues may not let him.

121,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/22/us/politics/trump-two-years.html,"WASHINGTON -- When President Trump grows frustrated with advisers during meetings, which is not an uncommon occurrence, he sits back in his chair, crosses his arms and scowls. Often he erupts. ""Freaking idiots!"" he calls his aides. Except he uses a more pungent word than ""freaking.""

For two years, Mr. Trump has waged war against his own government, convinced that people around him are fools. Angry that they resist his wishes, uninterested in the details of their briefings, he becomes especially agitated when they tell him he does not have the power to do what he wants, which makes him suspicious that they are secretly undermining him.

Now, the president who once declared that ""I alone can fix"" the system increasingly stands alone in a system that seems as broken as ever. The swirl of recent days -- a government shutdown, spiraling scandals, tumbling stock markets, abrupt troop withdrawals and the resignation of his alienated defense secretary -- has left the impression of a presidency at risk of spinning out of control.

At the midpoint of his term, Mr. Trump has grown more sure of his own judgment and more cut off from anyone else's than at any point since taking office. He spends ever more time in front of a television, often retreating to his residence out of concern that he is being watched too closely. As he sheds advisers at a head-spinning rate, he reaches out to old associates, complaining that few of the people around him were there at the beginning.

Mr. Trump is said by advisers to be consumed by the multiplying investigations that have taken down his personal lawyer, campaign chairman, national security adviser and family foundation. He rails against enemies, who often were once friends, nursing a deep sense of betrayal and grievance as they turn on him.

""Can you believe this?"" he has said as he scanned the torrent of headlines. ""I'm doing great, but it's a war every day.""

""Why is it like this?"" he has asked aides, with no acknowledgment that he might have played a role. The aides, many of whom believe he has been treated unfairly by the news media, have replied that journalists are angry that he won and proved them wrong. He nods in agreement at such explanations.

As the president vents, he constantly rattles off what he sees as underappreciated accomplishments. ""Look what I did for Mexico and Canada,"" he has told allies. ""Look what's happened with terrorism.""

The portrait that emerges from interviews with about 30 current and former administration officials, personal friends, political allies, lawmakers and congressional aides suggests a president who revels in sharp swings in direction, feels free to disregard historic allies and presides over near constant turmoil within his own team as he follows his own instincts.

White House officials did not respond to requests for comment. But as the president struggles to find a way forward, the path is about to become much more hazardous. As tumultuous as events have been so far, Mr. Trump's first two years may ultimately look calm compared to what lies ahead.

In less than two weeks, Representative Nancy Pelosi of California will take the speaker's gavel held until now by Representative Paul D. Ryan of Wisconsin, and subpoena-wielding House Democrats will be empowered to investigate Mr. Trump's family, business, campaign and administration. At some point after that, he will face the results of whatever Robert S. Mueller III, the special counsel, finds about campaign ties to Russia and obstruction of justice.

At some point after that, Ms. Pelosi may come under enormous pressure from her liberal base to open an impeachment inquiry, and many Republicans anticipate a battle over whether Mr. Trump committed high crimes and misdemeanors even if they hold enough votes in the Senate to block removal. Amid all that is a rising budget deficit that will shrink Mr. Trump's domestic options and signs of a possible economic downturn that would undercut his most potent bragging point.

""Nothing he's going to face in the next two years is going to be like the challenges of the previous two years,"" said Michael Steel, a longtime adviser to Republicans like Mr. Ryan and former Speaker John A. Boehner. ""Given the staff turnover and the increasing feeling that the president is encircled or cornered by legal and political enemies, it's entirely possible it gets worse, not better.""

Yet even with a 38 percent approval rating in Gallup polling, Mr. Trump has dominated the national conversation as no other modern president has, and his base thrills at his fights with the establishment, seeing him as a warrior against self-satisfied elites who look down on many Americans. Determined to maintain that base, he has insisted -- despite the seemingly long odds -- on his pledge of a border wall, aware that abandoning his signature campaign promise would make him less authentic, the quality that his voters often cite as his appeal.

As a result, a partisan war may be just what he wants. He has privately told associates that he is glad Democrats won the House in last month's midterm elections, saying he thinks that guarantees his re-election because they will serve as a useful antagonist. That may be bravado, but history provides some support. Bill Clinton and Barack Obama, his Democratic predecessors, both endured even bigger midterm setbacks and went on to win re-election.

""It's absolutely fair to say that it's better to have Nancy Pelosi as a foil than Paul Ryan as a foil,"" said Marc Short, the president's former legislative affairs director. ""It's better for the party and it's better for unity."" He added, ""The reality is the Democrats could overplay their hand.""

Both sides gamely talk about possible cooperation on issues like rebuilding the nation's tattered network of roads, bridges and other infrastructure. ""The opportunity in the era of divided government is to work with both sides to get something done for the country,"" said Representative Josh Gottheimer, Democrat from New Jersey and co-chairman of the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus.

Recent days showed the possibilities when Congress overhauled the criminal justice system, the most significant bipartisan domestic legislation of Mr. Trump's tenure. Mr. Trump has hopes of winning bipartisan support for his new trade deal with Mexico and Canada. But one congressional Democrat said the party has gone from thinking it could make discrete deals with Mr. Trump to believing he must be stopped at all costs because he is so dangerous.

Mr. Trump has struggled with fellow Republicans lately too. They objected loudly to his decisions to draw down troops from Syria and Afghanistan and pushed through a Senate resolution essentially rebuking his handling of Saudi Arabia after the assassination of the dissident Jamal Khashoggi. The departure of Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, who protested the troop pullouts and Mr. Trump's cavalier approach to America's alliances, sent shudders through Republican ranks.

House conservatives, meanwhile, revolted against Mr. Trump when he seemed to retreat on his demand for border wall funding to avert a government shutdown. At the same time, Senate Republicans, who had voted unanimously to keep the government open without the wall money Mr. Trump had demanded, were angry when he reversed course and refused to sign such a measure.

Such conflict comes with a cost. Mr. Trump has a way of stepping on his own successes. The border wall fight overshadowed his signing of the criminal justice overhaul. The abrupt way he decided to withdraw from Syria overshadowed the military victories against the Islamic State. Mr. Trump's focus during the midterm campaign on a caravan of migrants overshadowed the positive economic story he had to tell before the latest stock market gyrations.

""When he's talking about the economy, he's gotten a much more positive reaction,"" said David Winston, a Republican pollster. ""Obviously on other topics he hasn't been able to get it to the point where he's able to create an overall job approval. The question is do you address weaknesses or do you play to your strengths?""

Always impulsive, the president increasingly believes he does not need advisers, according to people close to him. He is on his third chief of staff, third national security adviser, sixth communications director, second secretary of state, second attorney general and soon his second defense secretary. Turnover at the top has reached 65 percent, according to the Brookings Institution.

Some left in a cloud of corruption allegations, including his health and human services secretary, his Environmental Protection Agency chief and, most recently, his interior secretary. Others left after clashing with Mr. Trump. Mr. Mattis was the last of the so-called axis of adults seen by some as tempering a volatile president, following the ouster of Rex W. Tillerson as secretary of state, H. R. McMaster as national security adviser and John F. Kelly as chief of staff.

""Rex Tillerson and Jim Mattis are two of the finest people ever to serve in government,"" said Steve Goldstein, who was under secretary of state until he was fired along with Mr. Tillerson. ""They were very close and worked hard at trying to do what was best for the country, and sometimes that meant being brutally honest with folks at the White House.""

But Fred Fleitz, who worked for nearly six months this year as chief of staff for John R. Bolton, the current national security adviser, said the new team is more cohesive and better suited to Mr. Trump than one constantly undermining him.

""He came in as the ultimate outsider and he brought in some unorthodox policies that worked and he tried some things that didn't work, and one of the things that didn't work was bringing in some staffers who didn't work like McMaster and Tillerson,"" Mr. Fleitz said.

In a recent public talk, Mr. Tillerson said out loud what others say in private, that Mr. Trump often pushes for actions that exceed his authority and does not like it when told he cannot do something. He bristles at constraints and expresses envy of autocrats like President Xi Jinping of China who do not have to deal with independent power centers like the Federal Reserve or the courts.

In recent days, Mr. Trump has asked aides whether he can fire Jerome H. Powell, the Fed chairman he appointed, telling advisers that Mr. Powell will ""turn me into Hoover,"" a reference to the Great Depression-era president. During a meeting with German car executives this month, Mr. Trump threatened to impose higher fuel efficiency standards on their imported cars than required on American vehicles even though aides told him he could not do that.

And he can be hard on his staff. He regularly curses at them, some say. Even his humor can be abrasive. When Larry Kudlow, his economics adviser, returned after a heart attack this year, the president ribbed him in front of aides. ""Larry, you're here six weeks and you had a heart attack?"" Others laughed uncomfortably.

More recently, the president has told associates he feels ""totally and completely abandoned,"" as one put it, complaining that no one is on his side and that many around him have ulterior motives. That extends even to his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who was credited for helping push through the criminal justice bill, praise that Mr. Trump took note of.

Longtime associates said Mr. Trump's relationship with his children has grown more removed and that he feels he does not have a friend in the White House. He disagrees with Mr. Kushner and Ivanka Trump much of the time, but cannot bring himself to tell them no, leaving that instead to Mr. Kelly, according to former aides. That made Mr. Kelly the heavy, they said, and therefore the target of their ire until he was finally forced out.

Mr. Trump has spent far less time lately with older friends. The sense of isolation was on display at this month's holiday parties when he appeared for a few minutes, took a few perfunctory photographs with preselected guests and then disappeared back upstairs rather than mingle. He is spending this preholiday shutdown weekend alone since Melania and Barron Trump went ahead to Florida without him.

Mr. Trump still views the presidency through the lens of a television showman. He told his staff that he wanted a fireworks display over Mount Rushmore. Before signing the farm bill, he posted a goofy video of himself at the 2005 Emmy Awards dressed in overalls and a straw hat, holding a pitchfork and singing the theme song to the old television show ""Green Acres.""

For election night in November, he insisted on throwing a lavish party in the East Room and originally wanted aides to be on display for his guests, a simulation of officials gathering election return information like aides did at Trump Tower in 2016. When White House officials warned that a party would look discordant given the likelihood of losing the House, he insisted on going forward anyway.

By all accounts, Mr. Trump's consumption of cable television has actually increased in recent months as his first scheduled meetings of the day have slid back from the 9 or 9:30 a.m. set by Reince Priebus, his first chief of staff, to roughly 11 many mornings. During ""executive time,"" Mr. Trump watches television in the residence for hours, reacting to what he sees on Fox News. While in the West Wing, he leaves it on during most meetings in the dining room off the Oval Office, one ear attuned to what is being said.

Of late, allies concede, the news has been particularly grim. He was infuriated by his former personal lawyer, Michael D. Cohen, who pleaded guilty to organizing an illegal scheme to pay hush money to women to keep quiet about alleged affairs with Mr. Trump before the 2016 election, a scheme he said Mr. Trump had directed.

Still, for all the reports of a fuming president alarmed at possible impeachment, Mr. Trump rarely expresses such specific anxiety out loud, associates said. Instead he expresses frustration, anger, mania -- all of which aides read like tea leaves to discern what lies beneath.

""It will be a challenge not to be consumed by it,"" Mr. Short said. ""It would only be human when it's the coverage leading the news every day to be distracted, but it will be important to have the internal discipline not to be.""

No one outside of Mr. Mueller's office, of course, knows for sure what he will report but so far he and other prosecutors have drawn a devastating picture of a president surrounded by people who have lied to the authorities, cheated on their taxes, skirted campaign finance laws and secretly worked for foreign interests. The question is what Mr. Mueller will say about Mr. Trump.

""Does he create a story that the man never put the presidency first?"" asked Doris Kearns Goodwin, whose newest book, ""Leadership: In Turbulent Times,"" chronicles four presidents. ""There has to be a narrative. The individual things may not hit the people who support him but if there's an overall narrative, people may understand.""

Mr. Trump has not helped himself with decisions that opponents use to draw a narrative of a president unusually deferential to Russia, including his withdrawal of troops in Syria, which drew the public approval of President Vladimir V. Putin.

""Mueller will decide whether there's collusion with the Russians on the election,"" said Mayor Rahm Emanuel of Chicago, a former White House chief of staff to Mr. Obama. ""But we can now say there's collusion with the Russians on foreign policy, and it's not to America's benefit.""

More recently, Mr. Trump has taken to spending time reminiscing about the happier days of his candidacy and his 2016 victory. He spent the fall showing different groups of visitors what he calls his love letters from North Korea's iron-fisted dictator, Kim Jong-un, expressing admiration for Mr. Trump. And he still takes joy in aspects of the job, primarily those that demonstrate power. ""The roads closed for me!"" he declared to friends earlier this year after a motorcade ride.

But those highs have been hard to recapture. The days are filled with conflict, much of it of his own making. More advisers are heading for the door. The divisions are widening, not closing. If it is a ""war every day,"" there are no signs of peace.

""What I'm trying to figure out is where does it end,"" Mr. Goldstein said. ""The language gets coarser on all sides. The respect for the office of the presidency seems less to me than it was. How do we move people back? Or are we in the new reality?"""
122,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/26/briefing/stocks-migrants-yemen.html,"Good morning,

Today is Boxing Day in Britain and some Commonwealth countries, but it's back to work in the U.S. We're watching the markets as they reopen, the death of a second migrant child at the southwestern border, and new details about Donald Trump's draft deferment during the Vietnam War.

Eyes are back on the markets

Trading resumes on Wall Street today after a Christmas break and, before that, a four-day sell-off that threatens to end the longest bull market on record. Losses of more than 20 percent are the official marker of a bear market, and the S&P 500 is down 19.7 percent from its high on Sept. 20.

President Trump's repeated criticism of the Federal Reserve chairman, Jerome Powell, and an attempt last weekend by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to reassure markets have contributed to the volatility.

Trading in Asia was mostly flat today, and futures markets suggest a mixed day in the U.S.

Explainer: ""The real risk is not that insurmountable challenges knock the economy off course,"" our senior economics correspondent writes. ""It is that poor leadership converts moderate economic shocks into a crisis.""

From Opinion: The columnist Paul Krugman asks whether White House policies ""matter for the economy, or for the stock market (which isn't at all the same thing).""

Another migrant child dies in U.S. custody

On Tuesday, an 8-year-old boy from Guatemala became the second child to die in detention at the southwest border in less than three weeks. It is unclear if his death was the result of the care he received in the U.S., of an arduous journey or of some combination of the two.

The response: A White House spokesman said the boy's death was ""very sad"" and that the administration was seeking more information.

Yesterday: President Trump reiterated his call for $5 billion to fund a border wall, a demand at the center of a partial government shutdown. No legislative action to address the shutdown is expected before Thursday.

The details: Mr. Trump has said his wall is already under construction. We mapped the current fencing and what the administration has done so far.

America's fingerprints on the war in Yemen

For decades, the U.S. has sold tens of billions of dollars in arms to Saudi Arabia on the unspoken premise that they would rarely be used.

But American weapons and support have figured prominently in the Saudi-led air war in Yemen, where strikes have killed more than 4,600 civilians.

That toll has contributed to a debate in Washington about the pitfalls of the U.S. alliance with Saudi Arabia under Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.

Catch up: Saudi Arabia entered the war in 2015, allying with the United Arab Emirates and a group of Yemeni factions trying to oust Houthi rebels from northern Yemen. At least 60,000 Yemenis have died.

Go deeper: The conflict has pushed millions to the brink of starvation. In October, Times journalists documented the crisis.

A foot doctor's ""favor"" to the Trump family

In 1968, a podiatrist in Queens who rented an office from Donald Trump's father, Fred Trump, diagnosed the future president with bone spurs in his heels, leading to his medical exemption from the military during the Vietnam War.

The podiatrist, Dr. Larry Braunstein, died in 2007, but his daughters told The Times that he often talked of coming to the younger Mr. Trump's aid as a favor to the father. Donald Trump, who had earlier been declared available for service, was 22 at the time.

How we know: No paper evidence has been found to corroborate the version of events described by the Braunstein family, who also suggested there was some involvement by a second podiatrist, Dr. Manny Weinstein. The Times began looking into the president's draft record again when an anonymous tipster suggested that a podiatrist who rented from Fred Trump had provided the medical documentation for a deferment.

Background: An investigation by The Times in October showed the extent to which Fred Trump assisted his son over the years, including by giving him the equivalent today of at least $413 million.

If you have 6 minutes, this is worth itThe relentlessness of modern parenting

Intensive parenting has been the norm in the upper middle class since the 1990s. And people across class divides appear to have adopted it as an ideal, even if they don't have the means to carry it out.

Social scientists say the change has a powerful driver: economic anxiety.

Here's what else is happening

A still-vulnerable Indonesia: Despite progress in detecting tsunamis early, at least 429 people were killed and nearly 1,500 were injured in last weekend's disaster.

Japan defies whaling ban: The country said today that it would withdraw from an international agreement and resume annual whale hunts in the Antarctic. An international moratorium on whaling took effect in 1986.

A message from the pope: During his Christmas Day address, Pope Francis said that all humans are part of an extended holy family that has lost its sense of fraternity.

Protests in Sudan: Widespread demonstrations called for President Omar Hassan al-Bashir to step down. Mr. Bashir has been in power since a military coup in 1989.

Kevin Spacey case advances: The actor will be charged with a felony after an accusation of sexual assault that was made public last year, the authorities said.

Navy scraps an age-old penalty: A law that takes effect on Jan. 1 will, among other things, eliminate the punishment of ""diminished rations"" -- bread and water -- for American sailors.

Snapshot: Above, the annual Hyde Park Christmas Day Swim in the icy waters of the Serpentine lake in London. It's called the Peter Pan Cup because J.M. Barrie, who wrote ""Peter Pan,"" swam the 100-yard course in 1903.

The artists we lost: We offer a tribute to notable actors, musicians, writers and dancers who died this year, using their own words.

Late-night comedy: Our columnist looked back at a year in which the occasional nonpolitical joke felt like water in the desert.

What we're reading: This examination of the Internal Revenue Service by ProPublica and The Atlantic. Albert Sun, an assistant editor, calls it ""an eye-opening look at how the once-feared tax agency has been so strangled by budget cuts from Congress that it no longer has the capacity to make even blatant tax dodgers pay their share.""

Now, a break from the news

Cook: These chiles rellenos combine two classic Mexican preparations.

And now for the Back Story on ...Potato chips and the electric diet

Potato chips first showed up in The Times 120 years ago today, in a rather ethnocentric article reprinted from The Baltimore Sun listing typical breakfast menus for upper-class families in Puerto Rico.

If chips before lunch seem slightly unorthodox, a later mention was even more startling. In 1912, The Times reported that a French scientist had concluded that a jolt of electricity -- 1,000 volts -- was equal in food value to a porterhouse steak and potato chips.

Just four months before, an article detailing the theory began with a quotation from the scientist that was shocking on any number of levels: ""If a man is hungry, give him electricity. If he asks for bread or beefsteak, put him in the electric chair and turn on the current.""

The 1,000-volt diet never caught on -- given a choice between the electric chair and potato chips, the hungry invariably go for the chips.

That's it for this briefing. See you next time.

123,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/22/us/government-shutdown.html,"ROCKY MOUNTAIN NATIONAL PARK, Colo. -- The visitors' centers at Rocky Mountain National Park were locked and dark on Saturday. Drivers breezed through gates without stopping at tollbooths to pay the park's $25 entrance fee. And as adventurers switchbacked up the snowy roads toward the park's sledding hills and backcountry ski terrain, they encountered a new sign: ""ROAD CLOSED.""

So began the opening hours of the latest shutdown for a federal government that has become familiar with furloughs, and a country that has almost come to shrug off stalemates and spending fights -- at least at first.

""It's an annoyance, but you can work around it,"" said Desmond Hadlum, who drove in with his wife, Ann, to go snowshoeing. They stopped a park ranger at the entrance gate to ask about the shutdown.

""So far, so good,"" the ranger replied.

But the shutdown's effects -- especially visible on Saturday at closed or unstaffed National Park Service sites, and at checkpoints at airports and the nation's borders as officers stood guard without pay -- will be magnified once the standoff seeps past Christmas, when federal offices would ordinarily be open and staffed with the approximately 380,000 employees who have been told to stay home while President Trump and Congress try to reach a spending accord.

[Read: Government Shutdown to Continue for Days as Senate Adjourns Until Thursday]

An additional 420,000 or so employees, their duties classified as essential, were ordered to work without pay during what some elected officials, including Mr. Trump, said could be a protracted battle over the president's insistence on $5 billion for a wall along the border with Mexico.

But the impasse in Washington changed little on Saturday along the border, where a United States Customs and Border Protection helicopter hovered over the Rio Grande. Border Patrol pickup trucks kicked up dirt as they drove on unpaved roads, with one bouncing across the flood levee, the same structure where Mr. Trump said he aims to construct the border wall he pledged during his campaign. At the Anzalduas International Bridge, vehicles were lined up for inspection by American officers who were not certain when they would receive their next paychecks.

""They're going to do their job like they're supposed to,"" said Art Del Cueto, the vice president of the National Border Patrol Council, a labor union. ""Nothing changes, except they don't get paid.""

In Washington, a bar near congressional offices, the Capitol Lounge, offered a modest respite for federal workers: $5 cocktails during the shutdown. One option -- a blend of Montezuma Blue tequila, orange juice and grenadine -- was christened ""Mexico Will Pay for This,"" a nod to the dispute over the wall.

[Read: GoFundMe Campaign to Build Border Wall Raises Millions, Riles Migrant Advocates]

But most federal employees are scattered across the country, far from Capitol Hill. In interviews on Saturday, some said they were frustrated by the political gridlock that left their finances uncertain.

""The big thing is, it's already a very tough job,"" said Justin Tarovisky, a correctional officer at the United States Penitentiary Hazelton, in northern West Virginia. ""But when you know that you've got to go to work and you're not going to be paid for it -- or it's going to be late, no matter what -- it really brings you down.""

The blue-shirted officers of the Transportation Security Administration, who were expected to screen 41 million passengers this holiday, stood beside body scanners and X-ray machines on Saturday after spending the previous days girding for a shutdown.

""It's a job,"" said Daniel Defosse, a T.S.A. worker, as he stacked plastic bins at Bradley International Airport in Windsor Locks, Conn., just after the Senate adjourned on Friday. ""It comes with the territory, honestly.""

Others were more exasperated, like the T.S.A. officer who sat at a guard desk nearby, staring at a computer screen and clicking a mouse.

""What would you think if you didn't get paid?"" said the officer, who would not give his name but said he felt frustrated and resigned over a shutdown he feared would last a while.

As for the political leaders whose bickering triggered the shutdown, he had one word: ""Selfish.""

Some members of Congress, especially lawmakers from the Washington area, expressed sympathy for the workers, and the Senate on Friday unanimously approved a measure that would compensate federal workers ""at the earliest date possible after the lapse in appropriations ends, regardless of scheduled pay dates.""

But Representative Mark Sanford, Republican of South Carolina whose tenure in Congress will end next month, said few lawmakers were focused on the repercussions of a shutdown on federal workers, particularly because of the government's history of ultimately paying its employees.

""It's not as if these folks don't get paid -- it's just that there's a lag and a delay in doing so,"" Mr. Sanford said.

Federal workers, and their labor unions, broadly condemned the shutdown and the consequences of its timing. J. David Cox Sr., the national president of the American Federation of Government Employees, the largest union for federal workers, called the shutdown ""a dereliction of duty by Congress and the president.""

Despite the government's record of offering back pay to its workers, current and former employees said any uncertainty was worrisome, particularly for the lowest-paid employees.

""They're not sitting on a huge pile of cash for an emergency,"" said Joyce Vance, who was the United States attorney for the Northern District of Alabama during the shutdown in 2013, which affected the entire government and lasted 16 days. ""People can't pay their rent, they can't put food on the table.""

During the 2013 shutdown, about 850,000 workers were furloughed each day. Soon after, the Obama administration estimated ""the largest direct cost"" of the shutdown was work that went unperformed -- and the $2 billion the government eventually paid them.

Some parts of the government were suffering no consequences from this latest iteration of a shutdown. The Defense Department, for example, was operating normally because Congress had already approved its funding.

But some federal agencies warned that the disruption's effects would spread. The Smithsonian Institution could close its museums, as well as the National Zoo in Washington, early next year if no agreement is reached. And the Environmental Protection Agency's acting administrator told employees there was enough remaining money for the E.P.A. ""to operate for a limited period of time.""

Tourists in Atlanta did not benefit from any leftover dollars that kept parts of the government open a little longer. People who tried Saturday visits to the birth home of the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., were met with a closed door and a Park Service sign.

""AREA CLOSED,"" it read. ""Because of a lapse in federal appropriations, this national park facility is closed for the safety of visitors and park resources.""

In Colorado, as in Atlanta, visitors were more perplexed than annoyed. In Estes Park, near Rocky Mountain National Park, there were worries among some merchants that a prolonged shutdown could dry up holiday business if tourists stayed away. Visitors wondered whether the park would still be open if a blizzard clobbered the roads.

Outside the shuttered Beaver Meadows Visitor Center, three Sri Lankan friends who attend college in North Dakota took photos of one another against a backdrop of stunning snowy peaks and said the shutdown hadn't dampened their experience. They had driven down for winter break, and had already spotted elk and mountain goats.

In a way, Gihan Gamage, 26, said the chaos in Washington reminded him of home.

""We have our own political mess. We didn't have a prime minister for a month,"" he said. ""I thought it was like a Third World country thing. It's the same story."""
124,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/21/business/economy/harlan-county-republican-welfare.html,"HARLAN, Ky. -- Gov. Matt Bevin skillfully worked the room at the old courthouse building here in Harlan, one more town-hall meeting in the long campaign toward next year's election. He deplored the parlous state of a half-mile stretch of U.S. 421 and said $802,000 would be spent to rebuild it. He commiserated with the man who wanted to know how he should deal with the bears tearing through his trash bins, now that it's forbidden to shoot them.

The line that got the governor a standing ovation, however, was about Medicaid. More precisely, about his plan -- so far frustrated by the courts -- to require thousands of able-bodied Medicaid recipients between 19 and 64 to work, get training or perform community service for 20 hours a week to keep their health insurance.

""Yeahs"" rippled across the room as the governor extolled the value and dignity of work, which propelled him from a hardscrabble youth in rural New Hampshire to the governor's mansion in Frankfort. ""People tell me it's too much to ask,"" he noted, incredulously, about his plan to demand that people on Medicaid get a job. ""Baloney.""

And the line from Ronald Reagan got chuckles all around: ""The worst thing you can hear,"" the governor told Harlan's gathered residents, is ""I'm from the government and I'm here to help.'""

Mr. Bevin's distaste for government is not news. His insurgent campaign to take the Kentucky governorship in 2015 was heavy on attacks on government spending. What's more notable is the people's applause. Harlan County residents rely on government programs more than pretty much anybody else.

Harlan County is the nation's fifth most dependent on federal programs, according to the government's Bureau of Economic Analysis. In 2016 some 54 percent of the income of the county's roughly 26,000 residents came from programs like Social Security and Medicaid, food stamps -- formally known as SNAP, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program -- and the earned-income tax credit. That is up from 28 percent in 1990.

Where Government Assistance Has Grown

Federal assistance has grown all over the U.S., but particularly in Appalachia and the South, where many people now get more than a third of their income from the government.

Surrounding counties are similarly dependent. Part of a coal-mining region in long, inexorable decline, this pocket of the nation exemplifies a political paradox: Why are so many American voters hostile to the government hand that feeds them?

""The SNAP card works every month; the kids eat two meals a day, but people don't think about where the food comes from and go vote for Republicans,"" said Larry King, a farmer who is chairman of the Democratic Party in nearby McCreary County, whose residents get 55 percent of their income from federal transfers.

It's not just about Kentucky. Research by Dean Lacy at Dartmouth College on the presidential elections in 2004, 2008 and 2012 found that states receiving more federal spending for every tax dollar they contributed were more likely to go Republican.

The phenomenon produced a 2004 best seller, Robert Frank's ""What's the Matter With Kansas?"" It argued that Republicans drew working-class voters to their platform against taxes and spending not with economic arguments, but by appealing to their conservative cultural preferences -- against gay rights, abortion rights, affirmative action and gun control.

The contradiction has only become more pronounced over time. As Americans have grown more reliant on federal programs over the last 50 years, they have increasingly embraced the Republican Party, a trend put in stark relief by President Trump's 2016 victory. Of the 10 states in which government transfers account for the largest share of income, seven voted for Mr. Trump. Speaking to the economic and social anxieties of blue-collar white voters over immigration, trade and demographic change, Mr. Trump has championed tax cuts for the well-to-do paired with benefit cuts for the struggling voters in his base.

Nowhere has the strategy worked better than Kentucky. In a new book, ""The Government-Citizen Disconnect,"" Suzanne Mettler, a political scientist at Cornell University, observes that Mitch McConnell was known as a pro-civil rights, union-friendly moderate as a county executive in Louisville in the late 1970s. As federal transfers grew from around 10 percent of the income of the average Kentuckian in 1970 to 24 percent in 2016, seven percentage points more than the national average, the ideology of Mr. McConnell, the Senate majority leader -- and the rest of Kentucky's congressional delegation -- moved sharply to the right.

And local Democrats -- who once thrived in heavily unionized mining towns -- gradually lost ground. In 2015 Mr. Bevin became only the second Republican since the 1970s to take the governorship. And in 2016, Republicans captured the State Assembly and for the first time gained full control of Kentucky's executive and legislative branches.

Transfers from the federal government account for more than half of residents' personal income in 11 counties across the country. Ten are in eastern Kentucky; another is in West Virginia. Nine of those sit in Kentucky's Fifth Congressional District, which was the first in the nation to declare a winner on election night, Nov. 6: Harold Rogers, a Republican who has held the seat since 1981. He won 79 percent of the vote.

Even excluding health insurance -- which some experts argue should not count -- people in this patch of Appalachia draw between a fifth and a third of their income from the public purse.

Perhaps the politics of welfare is changing -- up to a point. Democrats made big gains this year in elections for the House and several statehouses, running largely on the promise that they would protect the most recent addition to the safety net: the Affordable Care Act, including the expansion of Medicaid in many states. But championing the safety net does not necessarily resonate in the places that most need it.

Take Daniel Lewis, who crashed his car into a coal truck 15 years ago, breaking his neck and suffering a blood clot in his brain when he was only 21. He is grateful for the $1,600 a month his family gets from disability insurance; for his Medicaid benefits; for the food stamps he shares with his wife and two children.

""Every need I have has been met,"" Mr. Lewis told me. He disagrees with the governor's proposal to demand that Medicaid recipients get a job. And yet, in 2016, he voted for Mr. Trump. ""It was the lesser of two evils,"" he said.

About 13 percent of Harlan's residents are receiving disability benefits. More than 10,000 get food stamps. But in 2015 almost two-thirds voted for Mr. Bevin. In 2016 almost 9 out of 10 chose Mr. Trump.

Conservative values surely run strong in this county of many churches and only one liquor store. But the politics of Harlan, a storied Democratic enclave whose yearlong strike against the Duke Power Company's coal-mining interests in 1973 is seared into union lore, can't be explained simply by voters' cultural leanings.

As Professor Mettler points out, the people who rely most on government transfers are least likely to vote. Only 31 percent of Kentucky's electorate voted in 2015; only 16 percent voted for Mr. Bevin. Participation was lowest in the counties most dependent on federal aid. The governor's victory was not propelled by the neediest Kentuckians.

A cognitive disconnect is at play: People often don't link benefits they rely on with the idea of government welfare. Professor Lacy's research, for instance, suggests that ideology and identity influence how people perceive their benefits, and can outweigh their personal experience of such assistance. He finds that Democrats and African-Americans, but not whites or Republicans, were much more likely as groups to feel they were benefiting from government programs in 2012, when Mr. Obama was president, than during the George W. Bush administration in 2008.

But Harlan's experience suggests that the steepest barrier keeping voters from embracing the government payments that help them get through the day comes from fundamental mistrust. It's not necessarily that people here don't understand they benefit. They fear that Washington -- so distant from rural America -- does not understand their plight or have their interests in mind.

""People in Harlan County have been on the front lines of the war on poverty for 50-plus years and can see its actual effects,"" said Preston Jones, the 31-year-old assistant director at the Pine Mountain Settlement School, over the mountain from Harlan. ""It is degrading.""

Mr. Jones, a Republican who not long ago was a Democrat, speaks from a deep well of grievance over the fact that generations of Harlan residents have had to turn to the government for sustenance. That sentiment mixes in with a vague but powerful resentment across the county toward a political system that people here blame for allowing, encouraging even, the decline of coal, its economic backbone.

Harlan is one of the poorest counties in the nation. It has been poor for a long time. The typical household takes in barely $25,000 -- less than half the national median. Opiate abuse is rampant. Over the last century or so, the population has shrunk by more than two-thirds.

Coal still provides some of the best jobs in the county, paying about $1,550 a week, on average -- more than twice the average county wage. But it employs fewer than 600 people. Fewer than 4,000 work the coal mines in all of eastern Kentucky, down from over 15,000 in the early days of the Obama administration. In Harlan County, little more than a third of working-age residents have a job.

Data from Mark Muro and Jacob Whiton at the Brookings Institution's Metropolitan Policy Program shows that as the coal industry has withered since 2010 -- squeezed out by natural gas as cheaper fuel for power generation -- productivity in terms of economic output per Harlan County worker has shrunk by an average of 8.6 percent a year.

There are few open storefronts downtown, mostly occupied by disability lawyers and pawn shops. ""The biggest business for a long time was the U-Haul rental business as people moved out of state,"" said Jay Nolan, who runs a string of newspapers based in London, some 70 miles northwest. ""In Harlan you had to wait for days to get one.""

Many people blame Mr. Obama's Clean Power Plan for killing coal and credit their vote for Mr. Trump to his promise that he would revitalize the industry. Some are skeptical of a government that saved Detroit's automakers but not Appalachia's lifeline. And this feeling is going to be hard to shake.

Harlan has few answers to its economic tribulations: few roads linking it to the world's markets, few good broadband links, few college graduates, few investors willing to risk their money there. ""Most of the kids from here who have a chance to go to university never come back,"" said Colby Kirk, executive director at One Harlan County, a nonprofit economic development group serving the area.

Success, when it happens, happens on a small scale. This year, the Harlan County Chamber of Commerce gave its business-of-the-year award to a fledgling coal-mining company that has grown to 220 jobs, almost twice as many as last year.

Therein lies a monumental obstacle to transforming the politics of America's safety net. As small towns lag behind prosperous urban centers along the coasts, as rural communities shed businesses and jobs, and as their residents turn to welfare as a last line of sustenance, the more they will resent Washington's inability, or unwillingness, to stem the decline."
125,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/21/style/glitter-factory.html,"Each December, surrounded by wonderlands of white paper snowflakes, bright red winterberries, and forests of green conifers reclaiming their ancestral territory from inside the nation's living rooms and hotel lobbies, children and adults delight to see the true harbinger of the holidays: aluminum metalized polyethylene terephthalate.

Aluminum metalized polyethylene terephthalate settles over store windows like dazzling frost. It flashes like hot, molten gold across the nail plates of young women. It sparkles like pure precision-cut starlight on an ornament of a North American brown bear driving a car towing a camper van. Indeed, in Clement Clarke Moore's seminal Christmas Eve poem, the eyes of Saint Nicholas himself are said to twinkle like aluminum metalized polyethylene terephthalate (I'm paraphrasing). In homes and malls and schools and synagogues and banks and hospitals and fire stations and hardware stores and breweries and car dealerships, and every kind of office -- and outside those places, too -- it shines. It glitters. It is glitter.

What is glitter? The simplest answer is one that will leave you slightly unsatisfied, but at least with your confidence in comprehending basic physical properties intact. Glitter is made from glitter. Big glitter begets smaller glitter; smaller glitter gets everywhere, all glitter is impossible to remove; now never ask this question again.

Ah, but if you, like an impertinent child seeking a logistical timetable of Santa Claus' nocturnal intercontinental journey, demand a more detailed definition -- a word of warning: The path to enlightenment is littered with trade secrets, vapors, aluminum ingots, CIA-levels of obfuscation, the invisible regions of the visible spectrum, a unit of measurement expressed as ""10-6 m"" and also New Jersey.

:･ﾟ✧

Humans, even humans who don't like glitter, like glitter. We are drawn to shiny things in the same wild way our ancestors were overcome by a compulsion to forage for honey. A theory that has found favor among research psychologists (supported, in part, by a study that monitored babies' enthusiasm for licking plates with glossy finishes) is that our attraction to sparkle is derived from an innate need to seek out freshwater.

Glitter as a touchable product -- or more correctly, an assemblage of touchable products (""glitter"" is a mass noun; specifically, it is a granular aggregate, like ""rice"") -- is an invention so recent it's barely defined. The Oxford English Dictionary principally concerns itself with explaining glitter as an intangible type of sparkly light. Until the invention in the 20th century of the modern craft substance, one could either observe something's glitter (the glitter of glass), or hold something that glittered (like, say, ground up glass). Tinsel, which has existed for centuries, does not become glitter when cut into small pieces. It becomes ""bits of tinsel."" The tiny, shiny, decorative particles of glitter we are familiar with today are popularly believed to have originated on a farm in New Jersey in the 1930s, when a German immigrant invented a machine to cut scrap material into extremely small pieces. (Curiously, he did not begin filing patents for machines that cut foil into what he called ""slivers"" until 1961.) The specific events that led to the initial dispersal of glitter are nebulous; in true glitter fashion, all of a sudden, it was simply everywhere.

A December 1942 article in The Times -- possibly the first mention in this newspaper of the stuff -- advised New York City residents that pitchers of evergreen boughs, placed in their windows for the winter holidays, would offer ""additional scintillation"" if ""sprinkled with dime-store 'glitter' or mica."" The pitchers were to replace Christmas candles, which the wartime Army had banned after sunset -- along with neon signs in Times Square and the light from the Statue of Liberty's torch -- after determining that the nighttime glow threw offshore Allied vessels into silhouette, transforming them into floating U-boat targets.

Most of the glitter that adorns America's name brand products is made in one of two places: The first is in New Jersey, but the second, however, is also in New Jersey. The first, the rumored farm site of glitter's invention, refused to answer any of my questions. ""We are a very private company,"" a representative said via email. The second is Glitterex.

゜・．✧

Glitterex was founded in 1963. Babu Shetty, 69, joined the company as president and C.E.O. in 1999, though he had been working to develop some of its glitter products since the 1970s, when he came to the U.S. from Mumbai to earn an advanced degree. His Ph.D. is in Polymer Science and Engineering. He jokes that he fell into the plastic business because it was recommended to Dustin Hoffman's character in ""The Graduate.""

He also did not want me to visit his glitter factory. The jovial Mr. Shetty told me over the phone that people have no idea of the scientific knowledge required to produce glitter, that Glitterex's glitter-making technology is some of the most advanced in the world, that people don't believe how complicated it is, that he would not allow me to see glitter being made, that he would not allow me to hear glitter being made, that I could not even be in the same wing of the building as the room in which glitter was being made even if I signed a nondisclosure agreement, that even Glitterex's clients are not permitted to see their glitter being made, that he would not reveal the identities of Glitterex's clients (which include some of the largest multinational corporations in the world; eventually, one did consent to be named: thank you, Revlon, Inc.), and that, fine, I was welcome to come down to Glitterex headquarters to learn more about what I could not learn about in person.

The glitter factory is located in a beige business park, a short walk from the office of a company that makes sidewalks for airports and a nut plant. Inside the Glitterex vestibule, a glass display case bursted with glitter-suffused products that I agreed to not describe, even vaguely. Aside from the display, there were scant other hints of the building's glorious purpose.

That is, until one entered the bottling warehouse itself, which looked like an industrial manufacturing plant colonized by pixies. The concrete floor was finely coated with what appeared to be crushed moonbeams. The forklift winked with shiny crimson flecks. The metal coils of the conveyor belt shone with a rainbow crust. And yet, the space gave the impression of being tidy and well-swept, not unlike a Dust Bowl kitchen if the prairie topsoil had been Technicolor. Near the entrance, metal shelves taller than a man were laden with over one thousand jumbo jars of glitter samples arranged by formulation, color, and size: emerald hearts, pewter diamonds, and what appeared to be samples of the night sky collected from over the Atlantic Ocean. There were neon sparkles so pink you have only seen them in dreams, and rainbow hues that were simultaneously lilac and mint and all the colors of a fire. On one shelf, hundreds of jars of iridescent white fairly glowed. The prettiest shade was slightly violet.

My guides through the glitter kingdom were Lauren Dyer, a Glitterex manager, and Jeet Shetty, who works alongside his father. The biggest seller, they told me, is always silver. They unscrewed several jars so I could compare different silvers side-by-side: sparkly silver and silver that flashed with the power of a thousand suns.

I met the elder Mr. Shetty in a conference room in the front of the office, where, beneath a glittering silhouette-style wall hanging of the pre-9/11 New York City skyline, he breezed through several advanced textbooks' worth of chemical engineering in an attempt to tell me what glitter was.

""This polyester film"" he began, picking up a strip of clear material, about five inches wide, ""people might know as mylar. It's the same polymer as used in a water bottle, so F.D.A.-approved. If you cut this you'd get a clear glitter."" The bulk of Glitterex glitter is made from plastic, though some varieties come from other sources, like aluminum. Clear glitter looks like tiny pieces of a dead jellyfish. ""Then,"" he said, ""we go into the next iteration of a substrate, where the clear film is metalized."" He picked up a shining silver strip of material. ""Potato chips bags start with the same polyester film; it's metalized with aluminum.""

Metalization, he explained, is the process by which aluminum is deposited on both sides of the film. This made sense in theory, but how could aluminum could go from being not on the film to being on the film without at least some Scotch tape? ""They evaporate aluminum and deposit it on it,"" said Mr. Shetty. This made sense in theory, but how could aluminum be evaporated? ""It's a very, very thin layer. They put it in a vacuum chamber, then evaporate the aluminum,"" said Mr. Shetty. ""With heat,"" his son added. ""What are they evaporating out of it?"" I asked. ""Aluminum,"" said Mr. Shetty.

I have no idea how humans figured out how to do that, or why it occurred to them to even try, but it sounds expensive.

The primary functions of glitter are, of course, aesthetic; glitter exists so that glitter can be put on things that do not have glitter on them: Popsicle sticks, stuffed animals' irises; Newt Gingrich. In 2011, the then-presidential candidate was the first prominent target of a ""glitter bomb"" protest when a 24-year-old activist named Nick Espinosa doused him with rainbow sparkles at a book signing event. It was not Mr. Espinosa's first time employing mass quantities to make a point; a year prior he had dumped 2,000 pennies in front of a Republican gubernatorial candidate to protest the lowering of Minnesota's minimum wage. It may also not have been, strictly speaking, a true glitter-bombing -- news outlets at the time ran a photo of Mr. Espinosa holding up a bag of shiny party confetti -- but the concept stuck.

There are a couple ways to achieve a rainbow effect on individual glitter particles, so useful for politics. Holographic glitter is made by embossing a fine pattern onto film, so that the surface reflects different colors of light in different directions -- there is nothing intrinsically rainbow-colored about the glitter itself. Contrast this with more subtle iridescent glitter, which reveals various luminous colors depending on the angle at which it is viewed, and is made from a multilayered clear film, composed of polymers with different refractive indexes.

How many layers is multi?

""Two hundred and thirty three,"" said Mr. Shetty, and grinned as he waved an almost invisible sheet of plastic. ""It gets very technical,"" he warned. ""You know, the visible spectrum, and all.""

I nodded, indicating I followed.

""Each layer is half the wavelength of light,"" he said.

""WHAT?"" I wailed.

・．✩・。

If you want to make something a cool color, it is almost always imperative that the color you select is one that human brains can process. The colors of the visible spectrum, arranged in order from longest to shortest wavelength, are red, orange, yellow, green, blue, indigo, violet. How do we perceive them? Something about cones in our eyeballs. What do the cones detect? Light waves in lengths between about 400 and 700 nanometers. How long is a nanometer? The width of a human hair is the size of about 80,000 to 100,000 of them. What is the perfect thing to say to shatter my fragile sanity? ""Each layer is over 230 nanometers,"" said Mr. Shetty.

Because red has the longest wavelength, the layers of red iridescent film are the thickest; violet iridescent layers are the thinnest. Mr. Shetty began tilting the clear film backward. ""That's the red,"" he said, as it flashed red. He continued tilting. ""At some point it'll go to green,"" he said, just as the film flashed green, then blue, then violet. He picked up another clear sheet and began to tilt it. This one skipped red and green, starting with a blue flash and then moving to violet, before appearing clear again. ""What happens below violet is UV,"" he said. ""You don't see it.""

""So an animal would see something there that I can't see?"" I asked.

""If it can see in the ultraviolet range, yes,"" he said.

The difference in thickness of the iridescent film strips was imperceptible by touch.

There are other more obvious size differences, of course. Craft glitter is the thickest and least technologically advanced. (To remove it, Mr. Shetty recommends soap and water or fabric softener sheets, to combat the plastic's static cling.) The finest cosmetic glitter is used in products designed for lips.

It's impossible to recreate the light-catching effect of glitter without using tiny particles of something, which means that if an object looks glittery upon close inspection (a credit card design; an N.F.L. helmet; a jet ski paint job), there are good odds that it contains glitter. Researchers and zookeepers sometimes mix glitter with animal feed to track animals (polar bears; elephants; domestic cats) via sparkly feces. Plywood manufacturers insert hidden layers of colored glitter in their products to prevent counterfeiting. Because glitter is difficult to remove completely from an area into which it has been introduced, and because individual varieties can be distinguished under a microscope, it can serve as useful crime scene evidence; years ago the F.B.I. contacted Glitterex to catalog samples of its products. The average American, said Mr. Shetty, sees glitter every day. Most of it is hexagonal.

The tiniest glitter Glitterex makes is 50 by 75 microns (a micron is one thousandth of a millimeter). The minimum order size the company will fill is enough to supply sparkle to ""half a million bottles"" of nail polish by Mr. Shetty's estimation (10 pounds). Prices vary depending on particle size, the formulations and combinations of polymers involved, but at the upper end -- which is to say: the smaller end -- a 10-pound plastic bag of glitter costs about $1,000. The company offers over 10,000 varieties.

This was all very forthright, but it did not explain the air of oppressive secrecy that seems to permeate the glitter industry. Did Glitterex worry I would describe its equipment so accurately that readers might construct their own machines to manufacture their own glitter in bulk quantities? Mr. Shetty said that, trade secrets aside, confidentiality is a top-down requirement from clients. Companies do not want others in their industry to know what glitters are in their products, to prevent competitors from making identical formulations.

When I asked Ms. Dyer if she could tell me which industry served as Glitterex's biggest market, her answer was instant: ""No, I absolutely know that I can't.""

I was taken aback. ""But you know what it is?""

""Oh, God, yes,"" she said, and laughed. ""And you would never guess it. Let's just leave it at that."" I asked if she could tell me why she couldn't tell me. ""Because they don't want anyone to know that it's glitter.""

""If I looked at it, I wouldn't know it was glitter?""

""No, not really.""

""Would I be able to see the glitter?""

""Oh, you'd be able to see something. But it's -- yeah, I can't.""

I asked if she would tell me off the record. She would not. I asked if she would tell me off the record after this piece was published. She would not. I told her I couldn't die without knowing. She guided me to the automotive grade pigments.

For people who love glitter, there is wonderful news: all the modern plastic glitter that has ever been created is still right here with us. According to Dr. Victoria Miller, a materials science and engineering professor at North Carolina State University, the plastic film from which most glitter is made takes about 1,000 years to completely biodegrade on Earth.

Because each particle is less than five millimeters long, plastic glitter falls under the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's definition of microplastic -- a category of material that has lately become a focus of environmental advocacy. (In 2015, for instance, President Obama signed an act banning plastic microbeads from rinse-off cosmetics.) While the research is conclusive that the world's oceans are a cold stew of man-made microplastics, the effect of their presence is not fully understood. NOAA's ""Ocean Facts"" webpage warns that these particles pose ""a potential threat to aquatic life,"" but states that ""not a lot is known about microplastics and their impacts yet."" A more fundamental problem, said Dr. Miller, is that, like all plastics, ""glitter is a petroleum product. It comes directly from fossil fuels, and fossil fuels are a very finite resource and we're using them to make completely disposable things."" (There are natural sources of glittery effects, too, like mica, a substance used in many cosmetics. It is mainly harvested from India, frequently in illegal mines, by children.)

In short, Dr. Miller was adamant that glitter is ""not good"" for the environment, but she did not advocate a ban. ""I think we've got bigger fish to fry,"" she said.

So: what is glitter?

A manipulation of humans' inherent desire for fresh water. An intangible light effect made physical. Mostly plastic, and often from New Jersey. Disposable by design but, it turns out, not literally disposable. A way to make long winter nights slightly brighter, despite the offshore presence of Germans. An object in which the inside of a potato chip bag meets the aurora borealis.

I asked Jeet and Babu to answer the question.

""I would say they're small decorative particles,"" said Jeet. ""But that's not really correct because there are other small decorative particles.""

His father's answer was simpler: ""Since we're a glitter manufacturer, anything we do is now called 'glitter.'""

So that's what it is.

126,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/30/opinion/new-years-day-emancipation-proclamation.html,"Mr. Jackson is the founder and president of the Rainbow PUSH Coalition.

""Then Moses said to the people, 'Commemorate this day, the day you came out of Egypt, out of the land of slavery, because the Lord brought you out of it with a mighty hand.'"" -- Exodus: 13:3.

Late in the night of Dec. 31, in African-American churches across the country, congregants gather to welcome the new year. They sing songs of freedom and overcoming. They testify to how far their faith has brought them and how much faith and courage they will need to face another year.

The tradition is called Watch Night, and it dates back 156 years to when President Abraham Lincoln set forth an essential document of freedom that most Americans have probably never read or thought much about: the Emancipation Proclamation.

The night before the proclamation went into effect on Jan. 1, 1863, free blacks in the North and their enslaved brothers and sisters in the South sat vigil in churches, in shabby slave shacks and in moonlit plantation woods to watch, pray and hope throughout the night to hear news that Lincoln's promises of freedom had been officially issued and millions of our ancestors were legally free.

The president kept his word -- although two more years of slaughter and civil war lay ahead. African-Americans emerged from that long night of waiting and watching with the right to pick up arms and join the military struggle to save the Union as soldiers and aboard ""vessels of all sorts."" The proclamation declared that those enslaved in the Confederacy were now ""forever free,"" and the might of the United States government, ""including the military and naval authority thereof, will recognize and maintain the freedom of such persons, and will do no act or acts to repress such persons, or any of them, in any efforts they may make for their actual freedom.""

The proclamation was the most consequential executive order in the history of the United States. It should be celebrated and honored.

For every American who cherishes freedom and democracy, New Year's Day should mean far more than college bowl games and parades. The nation must revive and reclaim the true meaning and significance of Jan. 1, Emancipation Day.

This Jan. 1 is even more significant in that the year 2019 marks the 400th anniversary of the first documented African slaves' forced arrival on the shores of the New World that was to become the United States of America. This anniversary year should be a time of commemoration and celebration, reflection -- and action -- on how far we have come and how far we must still travel to reach the mountaintop.

The journey from slavery to freedom was largely completed in 1865 with the adoption of the 13th Amendment. The march from freedom to equality is far from over.

I spent Christmas morning -- as I have for more than 40 years -- visiting and praying with the inmates and staff at Cook County Jail, the sprawling warehouse of the poor and dispossessed on the West Side of Chicago. As I looked out over the faces crowded into the jail's gym, I saw that they were overwhelmingly black and brown.

Although African-Americans make up just 24 percent of the population of Cook County, nearly 74 percent of the jail's population is black.

This story of inequality was four centuries in the making. It began in August 1619, when some 20 frightened, bewildered and beleaguered Africans arrived in Jamestown, Va., as prizes that had been pirated from Spanish ships on the open seas.

Even as revolutionary Americans rebelled against the British monarchy, declaring all men created equal, the founding fathers at the Constitutional Convention bowed to the South with three slave compromises that still haunt our nation: permitting the international slave trade; counting slaves as three-fifths of a person for congressional representation; and establishing the Electoral College, giving the South congressional representation disproportionate to its voter eligibility.

Yet in the darkness of chattel slavery, the enslaved were able to sustain enough of their humanity to maintain a light of hope for a better day, for freedom and for equality. African-Americans were able to see the dimly lit outlines of a more just social, economic and political order, even during slavery, apartheid and centuries of discrimination. But black people did not wait for freedom to fall from the sky. The Colonial era and beyond bristled with slave rebellions and resistance.

The lies, myths and insanity of white supremacy contaminated the soil and the soul of America. The Academy said African-American minds were inferior. The medical establishment said our bodies were inferior; the church, our morality. The banks determined that we were unworthy for loans or investment. These barriers have yet to be completely broken down. We are free but unequal. Yet still we rise.

History is an unbroken continuity that cannot be denied. Americans should not hide from the past nor engage in an extended exercise of rehashing 400 tragic years. Although there can be no plan for the future without comprehending the past, we cannot go forward while only looking backward.

2019 must be about the vision of a fully equal society.

In the coming year, we must set goals and a timetable for the most profound and in-depth corrective action program in history and show what true equality for all Americans means and looks like.

We must examine how much such repair will cost, what failure to repair has already cost, and the continuing cost to the nation in terms of human and economic underdevelopment if we fail to even the playing field for African-Americans and other people of color.

In 2020, there will be another presidential election. As the candidates campaign in the next two years, they must be challenged to share their vision of what an equal, nondiscriminatory, multiracial, multiethnic, multireligious and nonsexist society looks like, and how they propose to take us there.

In the meantime, we the people -- red, brown, yellow, black and white -- must do what African-Americans have done for 400 years, from bondage to emancipation, from lynch mobs to great migrations, from the back of the bus to Rosa Parks, from the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. on the balcony of the Lorraine Motel in Memphis to President Barack Obama on the balcony of the White House.

Keep hope alive.

127,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/24/opinion/trump-economy-stock-market.html,"Two years ago, after the shock of Donald Trump's election, financial markets briefly freaked out, then quickly recovered. In effect, they decided that while Trump was manifestly unqualified for the job, temperamentally and intellectually, it wouldn't matter. He might talk the populist talk, but he'd walk the plutocratic walk. He might be erratic and uninformed, but wiser heads would keep him from doing anything too stupid.

In other words, investors convinced themselves that they had a deal: Trump might sound off, but he wouldn't really get to make policy. And, hey, taxes on corporations and the wealthy would go down.

But now, just in time for Christmas, people are realizing that there was no such deal -- or at any rate, that there wasn't a sanity clause. (Sorry, couldn't help myself.) Put an unstable, ignorant, belligerent man in the Oval Office, and he will eventually do crazy things.

To be clear, voters have been aware for some time that government by a bad man is bad government. That's why Democrats won a historically spectacular majority of the popular vote in the midterms. Even the wealthy, who have been the prime beneficiaries of Trump policies, are unhappy: A CNBC survey finds that millionaires, even Republican millionaires, have turned sharply against the tweeter in chief.

But market behavior has, until recently, been a different story.

The reality that presidential unfitness matters for investors seems to have started setting in only about three weeks (and around 4,000 points on the Dow) ago. First came the realization that Trump's much-hyped deal with China existed only in his imagination. Then came his televised meltdown in a meeting with Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer, his abrupt pullout from Syria, his firing of Jim Mattis and his shutdown of the government because Congress won't cater to his edifice complex and build a pointless wall. And now there's buzz that he wants to fire Jerome Powell, the chairman of the Federal Reserve.

Oh, and along the way we learned that Trump has been engaging in raw obstruction of justice, pressuring his acting attorney general (who is himself a piece of work) over the Mueller investigation as the tally of convictions, confessions and forced resignations mounts.

But let's play devil's advocate here: Does all this Trump chaos matter for the economy, or for the stock market (which isn't at all the same thing)? At first sight, it's not all that obvious.

After all, aside from the prospect of trade war, none of Individual-1's tantrums, unpresidential as they are, have much direct economic impact. Even the government shutdown will impose only a modest drag on overall spending.

And even trade war might not do that much harm, as long as it's focused mainly on China, which is only one piece of U.S. trade. The really big economic risk was that Trump might break up Nafta, the North American trade agreement: U.S. manufacturing is so deeply integrated with production in Canada and Mexico that this would have been highly disruptive. But he settled for changing the agreement's name while leaving its structure basically intact, and the remaining risks don't seem that large.

So why do investors seem to be losing their what-me-worry attitude? It's not so much what Trump is doing, as what he might do in the future -- or, perhaps even more important, what he might not do.

The truth is that most of the time, presidential actions don't matter much for the economy; short-term economic management is mainly up to the Fed. But when bad things happen, we do need the White House to step up. In 2008 and 2009, it mattered a lot that officials of both the outgoing Bush administration and the incoming Obama administration responded competently and intelligently to the financial crisis.

Unfortunately, there's no reason to expect a comparable degree of competence if something goes wrong again.

Consider how the Trumpistas have responded to falling stocks. So far these are just a minor economic bobble. Yet Trump himself, having claimed credit when stocks were rising, has flown into a rage and lashed out; hence the attacks on Powell. Meanwhile, top officials are still claiming that last year's tax cut was a triumph in the teeth of the evidence, and issuing bizarre statements -- via Twitter -- about the health of the banks, which nobody was questioning.

Now imagine how this administration team might cope with a real economic setback, whatever its source. Would Trump look for solutions or refuse to accept responsibility and focus mainly on blaming other people? Would his Treasury secretary and chief economic advisers coolly analyze the problem and formulate a course of action, or would they respond with a combination of sycophancy to the boss and denials that anything was wrong? What do you think?

Let's be clear: There isn't an obvious crisis-level threat looming at the moment. But growth is slowing, and as the bumper stickers don't quite say, stuff happens. And if and when it does, the people who would be supposed to deal with it are the gang that can't think straight. Merry Christmas.

128,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/20/opinion/editorials/jim-mattis-resignation-syria.html,"The editorial board represents the opinions of the board, its editor and the publisher. It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section.

Defense Secretary James Mattis is stepping down as Defense Secretary, a day after President Trump overruled him and other top national security advisers by ordering the rapid withdrawal of all 2,000 American ground troops from Syria. Mr. Mattis, a retired four-star general, said in his letter of resignation that his views on a number of foreign policy and defense matters were fundamentally at odds with those of the president.

Mr. Mattis did not specifically mention the president's seemingly impulsive decision on Syria, but he and other top aides were clearly caught by surprise. With Mr. Mattis's departure, the last of the original group of grounded professionals who have, with at least partial success, restrained Mr. Trump on foreign and defense policy are now gone.

It was less than three months ago that John Bolton, the national security adviser, spelled out a broader mission for the American troops in Syria.

At the time, it sounded like an authoritative statement of official policy. Only, as is so often the case with Donald Trump's chaotic presidency, it apparently wasn't.

On Wednesday, Mr. Trump summarily overruled Mr. Bolton and the rest of his national security team with his abrupt and dangerous troop withdrawal decision. The move, detached from any broader strategic context or any public rationale, sowed new uncertainty about America's commitment to the Middle East, its willingness to be a global leader and Mr. Trump's role as commander in chief.

It apparently was the final straw for Mr. Mattis, who has walked a tightrope for the past two years between his training and his conscience, and the whims of his president.

Soldiers have a duty to follow their leader and carry out lawful orders. But success depends on trusting that the leader knows what he's doing and where he's going.

Sending conflicting orders to soldiers on the battlefield, as Mr. Trump and his administration are doing, not only hampers morale and undermines allied forces like the Syrian Kurds, it could also risk getting American soldiers killed or wounded for objectives their commanders had already abandoned.

Even some of Mr. Trump's most ardent supporters were alarmed. ""It is a major blunder,"" a Republican senator, Marco Rubio of Florida, wrote on Twitter. ""If it isn't reversed it will haunt this administration & America for years to come.""

Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, who generally supports Mr. Trump, said he and others in the national security establishment were ""blindsided"" by the announcement. He called for congressional hearings on the decision.

This isn't the first time the president and his administration have sent mixed messages. During the 2016 campaign, Mr. Trump promised to withdraw troops from Syria and has been looking for a way do it ever since. In April, he gave the Pentagon more time to complete the mission, which since the Obama era has been strictly focused on finishing off the Islamic State. Then Mr. Bolton arrived on the job and declared that ""we're not going to leave as long as Iranian troops are outside Iranian borders, and that includes Iranian proxies and militias.""

As late as Monday, James Jeffrey, the State Department's Syria envoy, told the Atlantic Council that the United States would stay in Syria until ISIS was defeated, Iranian influence was curbed and there was a political solution to the Syrian civil war.

But on Wednesday, Mr. Trump undercut his advisers, and American interests, by reversing course and declaring in a tweet, ""We have defeated ISIS in Syria, my only reason for being there during the Trump Presidency.""

There was no attempt to use the leverage of an American withdrawal to achieve any specific political or military goal.

Mr. Trump's assertion that the Islamic State is defeated is absurd. ""We have won against ISIS,"" he boasted in a video. The ability of the terrorists to strike has been significantly degraded and much of the territory they claimed for their so-called caliphate has been liberated. But the group still retains a pocket of land on the Syria-Iraq border and has roughly 20,000 to 30,000 fighters, according to military researchers. As Mr. Jeffrey said Monday, ""The job is not yet done.""

No one wants American troops deployed in a war zone longer than necessary. But there is no indication that Mr. Trump has thought through the consequences of a precipitous withdrawal, including allowing ISIS forces to regroup and create another crisis that would draw the United States back into the region.

An American withdrawal would also be a gift to Vladimir Putin, the Russian leader, who has been working hard to supplant American influence in the region and who, on Thursday, enthusiastically welcomed the decision, saying, ""Donald's right."" Another beneficiary is Iran, which has also expanded its regional footprint. It would certainly make it harder for the Trump administration to implement its policy of ratcheting up what it calls ""maximum pressure"" on Iran.

Among the biggest losers are likely to be the Kurdish troops that the United States has equipped and relied on to fight the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. Turkey's president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, considers many of the Kurds to be terrorists bent on destroying his country. In recent days he has vowed to launch a new offensive against them in the Syrian border region. Mr. Trump discussed his withdrawal decision in a telephone call with Mr. Erdogan on Friday.

The American withdrawal worries Israel, anxious about Iran's robust military presence in Syria, and Jordan, which bears a considerable burden from Syrian refugees who fled the fighting across the border. While Israel withheld criticism of Mr. Trump's decision, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said his government would escalate the fight against Iranian-aligned forces in Syria once the Americans leave.

Decisions of such consequence normally are thoroughly vetted by a president's national security advisers. But congressional lawmakers said there were no signs that any process was followed, and a senior White House official, refusing to discuss internal deliberations, said Wednesday, ""The issue here is the president made a decision.""

Judging from the timing and tone of Mr. Mattis' letter of resignation, the president made that decision alone.

129,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/20/us/politics/food-stamps-trump-administration-snap.html,"WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration announced on Thursday that it would seek to put in place more stringent work requirements for adults who rely on food stamps, even as the president signed a sweeping farm bill in which lawmakers had rejected stricter rules.

By moving to limit the ability of states to issue waivers to people who say they cannot make ends meet under the requirements for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, the Agriculture Department found another route to create restrictions, bypassing Congress and drawing immediate criticism that the proposed rule was sure to harm Americans below the poverty line.

The administration, which along with conservatives had fought to include stricter work requirements in the farm bill, continued to argue that food stamps were never meant to be a way of life and that able-bodied adults should be able to find jobs in a healthy economy.

""Long-term reliance on government assistance has never been part of the American dream,"" Sonny Perdue, the agriculture secretary, said in a statement. ""Moving people to work is common-sense policy, particularly at a time when the unemployment rate is at a generational low.""

The $867 billion farm bill, a huge piece of legislation intended to provide relief for farmers and the poor, encountered a number of obstacles this year as it faced scrutiny from conservative lawmakers who pushed for an overhaul in how the food program's participants would be evaluated.

In the end, Republican and Democratic negotiators decided to drop two proposals introduced by conservatives and publicly championed by President Trump: one that would have imposed further work requirements on adults using SNAP, and another that would have closed a loophole allowing states to waive the requirements in areas with high unemployment rates.

The proposed rule drew ire from Democrats, who accused the Trump administration of steamrollering a rare bipartisan compromise and ignoring Congress's mandate to leave the program and its 40 million recipients untouched.

""After a very rough back and forth on that particular issue, basically we left the program alone without restricting people from being able to get it,"" said Representative Raúl M. Grijalva, Democrat of Arizona, one of the negotiators on the bill's bicameral committee. ""Now you have Secretary Perdue doing essentially what was, in a bipartisan way, agreed not to do. He needs to know what the intent of Congress is and follow it.""

Senator Debbie Stabenow of Michigan, the top Democrat on the Senate Agriculture Committee, accused Mr. Perdue in a bluntly worded statement of ""blatantly"" ignoring the bipartisan farm bill and disregarding ""over 20 years of history giving states flexibility to request waivers based on local job conditions.""

Liberal groups joined in the criticism. In a statement, Robert Greenstein, the president of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning Washington think tank, said the administration's decision threatened to cut off basic food aid to hundreds of thousands of people, many of them aged 18 to 49, who could use the help.

""The administration may portray its proposal as a reasonable 'work requirement,'"" Mr. Greenstein said. ""But as noted, most states don't offer these people any job, training opportunity or slot in a work program, and people who are 'playing by the rules' and looking hard for a job are cut off nonetheless.""

By contrast, House Republicans, who had included tougher work requirements in their version of the farm bill, cheered the decision, and argued that the final, bipartisan version left the door open for Mr. Perdue to intervene.

Representative Patrick T. McHenry of North Carolina, the Republicans' chief deputy whip, denied that the move amounted to a partisan circumvention of Congress.

""I think a fresh view from the Department of Agriculture at that process and at that data is a healthy and good thing,"" he said. ""Was it a partisan move when the Obama administration expanded the waivers?""

Representative K. Michael Conaway, Republican of Texas and the chairman of the House Agriculture Committee, praised the department's move. Mr. Conaway said that the proposal demonstrated ""the importance of state accountability and recipient success.""

But even Mr. Conaway had recently suggested that Mr. Perdue had no place to sidestep Congress and ""wave a magic wand.""

""So, it's our job to fix it,"" Mr. Conaway said in an interview with a farming publication while negotiations were underway in September, ""and then once we get the law fixed, it's the secretary's responsibility to implement the new law, not fix the existing broken system that's allowing waivers to be abused.""

A healthier economy helped reduced SNAP usage by about three million people from November 2016 to March 2018, according to the most recent data from the Agriculture Department. In campaign rallies, Mr. Trump has used exaggerated terms to describe the reduction, which began before he took office.

At the same time, his administration has targeted the program's benefits: In February, seeking to cut $21 billion from the federal deficit over the next decade, the administration proposed a system that would force many participants to substitute half of their benefits for a ""Harvest Box"" that contained a selected menu of canned goods, ""shelf stable"" milk and pasta. That proposal met immediate backlash.

In September, individuals with SNAP benefits received an average benefit of $123 a month, compared with $245 for families, according to the most recently available government data. With the new rules, the Agriculture Department is focusing on able-bodied adults without dependents, who can access SNAP for only three months in a three-year period unless they are working at least 80 hours a month. The proposal would call for a more stringent review of the process those participants undergo to obtain a waiver to extend that time limit, often because of bad economic conditions or similar hardships.

By the time the farm bill passed without the conservative-championed measures in place, Mr. Perdue had already signaled that he would use his regulatory power to introduce restrictions.

""I strongly advise all states"" using such waivers, Mr. Perdue wrote in a draft letter to governors last month, ""to review your policy choices concerning when and where to request these waivers."""
130,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/23/books/paper-printers-holiday-sales-books-publishers.html,"This year has been, much to everyone's surprise, a blockbuster for the publishing industry. Despite the relentless news cycle, readers have bought books in droves. Hardcover sales are up, and unit sales at independent bookstores have risen 5 percent. Multiple titles -- Bob Woodward's ""Fear,"" Bill Clinton and James Patterson's ""The President Is Missing"" and Michelle Obama's ""Becoming"" -- have passed the million-copy mark, while there is also a surprisingly strong appetite for literary fiction.

But what should be good news for publishers, agents and authors has created headaches during the crucial holiday sales season, as printing presses struggle to keep up with a surge in demand, creating a backlog that has led to stock shortages of popular titles.

Several of this year's most critically acclaimed novels, including Lisa Halliday's ""Asymmetry,"" Richard Powers's ""The Overstory"" and Rebecca Makkai's ""The Great Believers,"" were listed as out of stock on Amazon the week before Christmas after inventory ran low because publishers could not to reprint copies quickly enough. Best-selling and critically lauded nonfiction titles like David W. Blight's biography of Frederick Douglass, Samin Nosrat's cookbook ""Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat"" and Ben Reiter's ""Astroball"" were also unavailable on Amazon, with some titles showing shipping dates of two to four weeks from now.

The industrywide paper jam has been building for months -- a result of shrinking and consolidation among printing companies, the collapse of one of the major printers this summer, global paper shortages and a tightening job market that's made it difficult for printers to hire additional seasonal workers. But it has become increasingly acute and visible at the industry's peak sales season, when consumers are shopping for must-read titles to give as gifts, and finding that Amazon's virtual shelves are bare.

For authors whose books have been out of stock in the run up to the holidays, it can be hard to recover the lost royalties and sinking Amazon rankings. In a Facebook message, Ms. Makkai urged readers to shop at independent stores for her novel after Amazon listed it as out of stock and indicated it wouldn't ship until after Christmas. ""This whole situation is rotten, and my press is doing everything they can, but ugh, this is really, really bad timing,"" she wrote.

Agents and authors say part of the problem is that publishers and retailers have become more risk averse. Publishers are printing smaller first runs, partly because retailers are ordering fewer copies initially, waiting to see which titles take off to avoid making the wrong bet and getting stuck storing unsold inventory. In the past, it was often easy to get another batch of books printed in a week or two if a title sold unexpectedly well, but these days some publishers say it can take one or two months.

On top of that, the seemingly bottomless appetite among readers for a handful of blockbuster titles has tightened the bottleneck at the printing presses, consuming what little slack there was in the system. Mr. Woodward's ""Fear"" has sold nearly two million copies in all formats, while Mrs. Obama's ""Becoming,"" which came out in November, has sold 3.8 million copies.

""The capacity is so tight that if you get a book that takes off like 'Becoming,' you have to stop what they were printing and print more 'Becoming,' then whatever they were printing is late,"" said Dennis Abboud, the chief executive of ReaderLink, the main book distributor to Target, Walmart and other outlets. ""Then the train is really off the rails.""

At the same time, publishers have been caught off guard by a handful of surprise best sellers, literary titles from lesser-known authors that are now in short supply the week before Christmas, the worst possible time to be out of stock.

""All of the sudden, there's just no capacity,"" said the literary agent Chris Parris-Lamb, who represents Ms. Halliday. ""The books that become outliers, the ones that are actually selling, then they become a victim of their own success.""

The backlog is so severe that it is spilling over into next year, causing publishers to shift the release dates for some January books because they can't print copies in time. At Penguin Random House, at least a dozen titles scheduled for early 2019 have been pushed back, typically by a few weeks, according to a company executive. Other publishers said that a handful of titles were being delayed because of the backlog at the printers.

""In the macro, business is healthy and there are plenty of books on shelves across America for people to buy,"" said Michael Cader, a book industry analyst and the founder of Publishers Marketplace. ""But if it's your book and there's demand and it's out of stock, that's very painful.""

Every year during the holidays, a handful of unexpected breakout books sell out of stock, frustrating consumers and the authors who wrote them, but leaving the industry as a whole unscathed. But this year the shortages are more widespread, and the factors driving them are more systemic and harder to mitigate.

""It's more complex than it's been in the past. You can't just count on making a phone call to your printer and saying this book is taking off, let's do a press run this week,"" said Adam Rothberg, senior vice president of corporate communications at Simon & Schuster. ""This is the new normal for the foreseeable future.""

Madeline McIntosh, the chief executive of Penguin Random House U.S., said that most of the company's in-demand titles were available through other outlets, despite being out-of-stock at some major retailers, and noted that ""at this time of year, we are always working through issues related to spiking holiday demand for hot books.""

The biggest cause of the bottleneck, publishers and agents say, is consolidation and collapse among printing companies. One large printing company, Edward Brothers Malloy, shut down this summer. Next year, two of the largest printers in the United States, Quad Graphics and LSC Communications, are expected to merge, which publishers worry will lead to fewer options for printing services.

The printing industry has its own problems, including paper shortages and price increases. And the low unemployment rate has made it harder for printers to hire additional workers. Quad Graphics, which has 55 print-production centers and 22,000 employees worldwide, ""has experienced staffing challenges due to record low unemployment,"" according to a company spokeswoman.

Surprisingly, some of the current chaos has come about because the publishing industry is not only stable but seems to be thriving. After years of declining print sales, hardcover and paperback editions have been rising recently, while e-book sales have fallen. Publishers' revenues from hardcover sales rose 3.5 percent in the first 10 months of this year, while revenue from digital books fell 3 percent in the same period, according to the Association of American Publishers.

Some big publishers have been investing in print infrastructure and inventory management in recent years, expanding their warehouses and improving their ability to refill orders from retailers quickly, but they have little control over the printing presses, where capacity has shrunk.

The effects are reverberating across the industry. This fall, W. W. Norton had to scramble to salvage an author's book tour when they learned that books wouldn't be available on his October publication date because the printers were overbooked. The author, James M. Scott, had more than a dozen events planned in October to promote his book, ""Rampage: MacArthur, Yamashita and the Battle of Manila,"" but the printer couldn't deliver books until roughly a month later.

Norton was able to get a small batch of books to sell at the events, before the first print run was ready, but at great cost: It involved taking unbound pages, gathering them by hand and having them bound and shipped overnight to the event sites.

""It's an editor's nightmare,"" said John Glusman, vice president and editor in chief of Norton.

Norton also struggled to meet unexpected demand for Mr. Powers's novel ""The Overstory,"" which was released in April with a first printing of 25,000 copies. Sales continued to climb throughout the year, and they got a boost when the novel was a finalist for the Man Booker Prize.

In mid-October, worried that stock would run out just before the holidays, Norton ordered a 10th printing of the book, an additional 10,000 copies. A priority rush order typically takes two weeks, but Norton was told that it would take two months. The new editions arrived at the publishers' warehouse on Dec. 17, but those copies still needed to get to retailers in time for holiday purchases. Norton just ordered an 11th printing, which will bring the total copies in circulation to 115,000.

Still, it may be too late for some holiday shoppers.

""Demand has delightfully exceeded expectations,"" Mr. Glusman said. ""Is there such a thing as too much demand?""

The print shortages have left both large and small retailers scrambling, though a huge company like Amazon can more easily absorb the impact of lost sales than a small independent store.

Barnes & Noble's stores have been hit with ""limited quantities, delays in publication dates, and more just-in-time minute-by-minute delivery that has driven delivery expense,"" said Tim Mantel, Barnes & Noble's chief merchandising officer.

Independent bookstores have also been struggling to meet demand for unexpected best sellers, though many placed more robust orders this year in anticipation of holiday shortages.

Catherine Bock, the book buyer at Parnassus Books in Nashville, said the store has run out of a handful of popular titles, including ""Asymmetry"" and ""Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat.""

Robert Sindelar, the managing partner of Third Place Books in Seattle, said it's been unusually difficult to restock popular titles this year. His store ran out of the Frederick Douglass biography before Thanksgiving. It sold out of ""Salt, Fat, Acid, Heat"" about a week ago. It recently got a small shipment of the title, but those were already presold, he said. ""We probably could have sold another 100 of that one,"" he said.

Ms. Nosrat, whose cookbook came out in April and has sold nearly 300,000 copies, said she and her agent realized in early December that copies of her book would most likely sell out before the holidays, even after an additional domestic printing this fall of 30,000 copies.

""I feel like I got punched in the gut a little bit,"" Ms. Nosrat said. ""But I'm aware that this is a rare and lucky problem to have."""
131,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/27/nyregion/trump-asylum-immigrants-ban.html,"Adou Kouadio, a citizen of Ivory Coast, arrived at the Texas border in early 2016 and asked for asylum, claiming that he had been threatened after supporting a political opponent of his country's president.

But for the nearly three years that his request has remained under consideration, Mr. Kouadio, 43, has been detained by the American authorities, first in Texas and later in New Jersey. In August, he petitioned a court for help.

On Thursday, a federal judge in Manhattan said the government had violated Mr. Kouadio's rights.

""This nation prides itself on its humanity and openness with which it treats those who seek refuge at its gates,"" the judge, Alvin K. Hellerstein of Federal District Court, wrote. ""By contrast, the autocracies of the world have been marked by harsh regimes of exclusion and detention. Our notions of due process nourish the former spirit and brace us against the latter.""

Detaining Mr. Kouadio for 34 months without a bail hearing violated his due process rights as an nonresident immigrant arriving at the border, ""limited as those rights are,"" the judge said in a ruling some legal experts also considered a rebuke of the Trump administration's strict immigration policies.

Mr. Kouadio, who was first detained under the Obama administration, is now entitled to a bond hearing within 14 days, the judge ruled, at which the government has to show he poses a danger to the public or is a flight risk in order to continue his detention.

The judge added that Mr. Kouadio's detention without an opportunity for bail was too long. ""His right to liberty is as valuable to him as it is to any U.S. citizen, and he has a constitutional right to a bail hearing that should no longer be denied to him.""

In February, the United States Supreme Court ruled that under the immigration laws, people held in immigration detention, even for years, were not entitled to periodic hearings on whether they may be released on bail. But the Supreme Court did not decide whether the Constitution required such hearings, and sent the case back to a lower court to consider that issue.

Judge Hellerstein, a 1998 Clinton appointee, noted that Mr. Kouadio's case ""squarely presents the constitutional question"" which the Supreme Court had not answered: ""whether an indefinitely lengthy detention of a nonresident alien seeking asylum without a bond hearing violates the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.""

Mr. Kouadio was detained on Feb. 21, 2016, at the El Paso border crossing, the judge noted, where he expressed his desire to seek asylum. Several weeks later, an asylum officer found that Mr. Kouadio had demonstrated a credible fear of persecution in Ivory Coast based on his political opinions, the judge said.

That March, the government initiated proceedings to deport Mr. Kouadio, but the process was subjected to repeated delays, Judge Hellerstein noted. (The case was moved to New York so Mr. Kouadio could have better access to an interpreter and to his family, the opinion says.)

The judge noted that Mr. Kouadio had never been arrested or convicted, there was little risk of flight and the case did not present national security concerns.

Mr. Kouadio's lawyers, Craig Relles and Steven Haskos, have said that their client, who had once worked for his country's former president, Laurent Gbagbo, had his life threatened by supporters of Mr. Gbagbo's successor, Alassane Ouattara, the current president.

Mr. Relles said on Thursday that Judge Hellerstein was ""sending a message to the Trump administration that fundamental due process is alive and well.""

Legal experts agreed that the ruling was important.

Lucas Guttentag, who teaches law at Stanford and Yale and was a former top adviser in the Department of Homeland Security under President Obama, said the ruling recognized that ""asylum applicants at our border are constitutionally entitled to due process and cannot be jailed for years without any hearing.""

Stephen Legomsky, a law professor at Washington University in St. Louis and the former chief counsel for Citizenship and Immigration Services in the Obama administration, added that the decision was an ""implicit criticism"" of the Trump administration's policies, ""in the sense that it is a clear rejection of the administration's preference for long-term detention of asylum seekers.""

The United States attorney's office in Manhattan had argued in court papers that Mr. Kouadio had been lawfully detained, and under Supreme Court precedent was not entitled to a bond hearing. ""Under the circumstances of this case, Kouadio has received all of the process he is due,"" the office wrote.

The office had no comment on the ruling. The United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement said it could not respond to a request for comment because of the government shutdown."

He was stationed at the time at Fort Dix, in New Jersey, but his position as a major general's aide brought him regularly to Washington, where Ms. Frei lives.

In the time before they met, the two texted often and then eventually talked every night on the telephone. That gave them a lot of time to get to know each other, so that when they did finally meet, ""We had a 12-hour first date,"" Mr. Duchek said.

The two had found that they had much in common, and both admire the kindness that they see in each other.

""It's what I love most about her: She never has a mean word to say about anyone,"" he said.

She realized she could rely on him, always. ""When you really need him there, he shows up,"" Ms. Frei said. ""He doesn't complain and it was so eye-opening for me to be in a relationship where I know I can count on that person.""

In July, she brought him to her family's lake cabin in Minnesota. ""In the first minute, my mom said to my dad, 'This is it. This is the one,'"" Ms. Frei said.

Ms. Frei recalls having had some trepidation about how her new boyfriend would feel about being thrust into the family's traditional -- and mandatory -- Independence Day talent show. He did 100 push-ups for his talent. ""It was such a weird situation, and he just took it head-on and enjoyed it and totally rocked it,"" she said.

""It was the moment I really, really knew I wanted to spend the rest of my life with Ben,"" she added.

133,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/31/us/politics/presidential-campaigns-2020.html,"It's nearly two years until Election Day 2020, but Elizabeth Warren is forming her exploratory committee right on schedule, if recent history is any guide.

The 2020 presidential race is happening -- now, today, before 2018 is even over. On Monday, Senator Elizabeth Warren, Democrat of Massachusetts, became the first major candidate to enter the contest, announcing that she was forming an exploratory committee.

In modern politics, forming the committee, which facilitates early fund-raising, is seen as an all-but-official announcement that a person is running for the presidency. Julián Castro, the former federal housing secretary and San Antonio mayor, also formed one this month. Several other candidates are expected to join the race in the coming weeks. (A congressman from Maryland, John Delaney, has been running since 2017. Read more about him here.)

And President Trump, never one to shy away from political combat, has also gotten an early jump on the 2020 race, naming a campaign manager last February and flouting precedent by raising money for his re-election during the midterm campaign.

With the election more than 670 days away, this can all feel a little ridiculous. But that does not make it unusual. A glance at recent history suggests that the candidates are roughly on schedule.

[Make sense of the people, issues and ideas shaping American politics with our newsletter.]

It was not always this way. In 1960, John F. Kennedy did not announce his candidacy until 11 months before Election Day. As recently as the 1992 election, Bill Clinton did not formally enter the presidential contest until just over a year before the general election. But since then, campaigns have grown longer, bloating into nearly two-year affairs.

Here is a look back at some candidates who jumped in early, how they did it and whether it did them much good:

Hillary Clinton: April 2015. Donald Trump: June 2015

2016: Rumblings began in mid-December 2014

By this time four years ago, former Gov. Jeb Bush, Republican of Florida, had made an early move in the 2016 presidential race. In mid-December 2014, he said he would ""actively explore"" a presidential run, announced plans to create a political action committee and spent time calling donors. (Mr. Bush, of course, did not win in the end.)

But it was Senator Ted Cruz of Texas, the eventual runner-up to Mr. Trump in the Republican primary, who was the first major candidate to formally announce a presidential bid, in March 2015. The future Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton, declared ""I'm running for president"" soon after, in April 2015.

In the end, all of them lost to Mr. Trump, who did not announce his candidacy from the atrium of Trump Tower in Manhattan until June 2015.

[Here's how presidential campaigns became two-year marathons.]

Mitt Romney: April 2011. Barack Obama: Incumbent

2012: Candidates waited until springtime 2011

The 2012 election got off to a slow start, although it was widely expected that Mitt Romney, who had run in 2008, would again seek the Republican nomination. But few of the Republicans lining up to run against President Barack Obama were willing to formally claim an early stake in the race.

Former Gov. Tim Pawlenty of Minnesota became the first major Republican to enter the race, announcing an exploratory committee in March 2011. But he would not win the party nomination.

Mr. Romney, the former governor of Massachusetts, announced his own exploratory committee in April 2011 and would eventually emerge as the Republican standard-bearer against Mr. Obama, who won re-election.

John McCain: November 2006. Barack Obama: January 2007

2008: And you thought this year was fast?

If you think there wasn't enough room between the midterm election and the start of presidential campaigns this year, look no further than the 2008 election cycle.

For the first time in more than half a century, the presidential race did not include an incumbent -- either the president or the vice president -- on the ballot. And the campaigning started so early that it bumped up against the midterms.

Tom Vilsack, a Democrat who was the governor of Iowa, announced his intention to run for president the week of the 2006 midterms and made it official by the end of November. John McCain, the senator from Arizona who would go on to capture the Republican nomination, formed his presidential exploratory committee that same month.

By January 2007, when Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton launched their exploratory committees, the field was already crowded with candidates. It was a breathtakingly fast start to a presidential race that would propel Mr. Obama to the White House.

John Kerry: December 2002. President Bush: Incumbent

2004: The nominee went early

Going into the 2004 election, George W. Bush was the incumbent president, but that did not dissuade prospective Democrats from campaigning.

John Kerry, the senator from Massachusetts, established himself as an early contender: In early December 2002, he went on NBC's ""Meet the Press"" to declare that he was creating an exploratory committee. By January, a flood of other candidates had entered the race.

Initially, Mr. Kerry's early move paid off: He bested the other Democratic candidates to become the party's nominee for president. But he, too, lost to the incumbent president as Mr. Bush secured a second term.

Al Gore: January 1999. George W. Bush: March 1999

2000: Started early, ended late

The unforgettable 2000 presidential race that ended with a recount in Florida began with the long-shot candidacy of a liberal senator from Minnesota.

The senator, Paul Wellstone, announced an exploratory committee as early as April 1998, more than two years before the election. In a solicitation letter to Democrats during his short-lived campaign, he wrote, ""Nov. 7, 2000, probably seems a long time away to you. (It does to me!)""

Al Gore, then the vice president of the United States, was the favorite for the Democratic nomination and announced his first formal step toward running for president on Jan. 1, 1999. The future President Bush announced his exploratory committee two months later, in March 1999.

But there was another notable candidate that election cycle: Donald J. Trump. Encouraged by ""amazing"" polls, ""unbelievable"" news media interest and a ""huge"" ground swell of public support, he announced an exploratory committee to run for president in October 1999. He suggested that Oprah Winfrey would be his vice president.

That campaign didn't take off. But we know how this story goes. Mr. Trump made it to the White House, where he has uprooted American politics -- and opened the door to the wide field of candidates who will fight to challenge him in 2020. It starts now.

135,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/31/us/politics/elizabeth-warren-2020-president-announcement.html,"Senator Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts Democrat and a sharp critic of big banks and unregulated capitalism, entered the 2020 race for president on Monday, becoming the first major candidate in what is likely to be a long and crowded primary marked by ideological and generational divisions in a Democratic Party desperate to beat President Trump.

In an 8:30 a.m. email to supporters on New Year's Eve -- 13 months before the first votes will be cast in the Iowa caucuses -- Ms. Warren said she was forming a exploratory committee, which allows her to raise money and fill key staff positions before a formal kickoff of her presidential bid. Ms. Warren also released a video that leaned on the populist, anti-Wall Street themes that are sure to be central to her campaign message.

[Make sense of the people, issues and ideas shaping American politics with our newsletter.]

""I've spent my career getting to the bottom of why America's promise works for some families, but others, who work just as hard, slip through the cracks into disaster,"" she said in the video. ""And what I've found is terrifying: these aren't cracks families are falling into, they're traps. America's middle class is under attack.""

""But this dark path doesn't have to be our future,"" she continued. ""We can make our democracy work for all of us. We can make our economy work for all of us.""

The race for the 2020 Democratic nomination is poised to be the most wide open since perhaps 1992, with the party leaderless and lacking obvious front-runners. After a midterm election that saw many women, liberals, minorities and young Democrats win, the primaries and caucuses next year are likely to be fought over not only who is the most progressive candidate but also which mix of identities should be reflected in the next nominee.

Ms. Warren, 69, is among the best-known Democrats seeking to take on Mr. Trump, who has already announced his re-election campaign, but she also faces challenges: recent controversy over her claims to Native American heritage, skepticism from the party establishment and a lack of experience in a presidential race.

Two potential top-tier candidates who have run before, former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. and Senator Bernie Sanders, are eyeing 2020 and are expected to disclose their plans this winter. Yet both men carry political baggage and would be in their late 70s on Election Day 2020, and many Democrats say they want a fresh face as their next nominee.

More than three dozen Democratic senators, governors, mayors and business leaders are also weighing bids -- most of whom have not sought the White House before. The race is expected to draw several women and nonwhite contenders as well as liberal and more moderate politicians -- making for the most diverse field in history. Several Senate colleagues of Ms. Warren are likely to enter the race soon: Kamala Harris of California, Cory Booker of New Jersey and Kirsten Gillibrand of New York.

Getting a jump on the competition, Ms. Warren plans to head to early voting states in the coming weeks, including Iowa, which holds its first-in-the-nation caucus in early February 2020. According to a person familiar with Ms. Warren's thinking, the timing of her announcement had been decided weeks in advance.

[How early do presidential campaigns start? Earlier than you may think.]

Ms. Warren has ascended rapidly in politics. A longtime bankruptcy law professor at Harvard who never held public office before 2013, Ms. Warren became the first woman elected to the Senate from Massachusetts after defeating a self-styled moderate Republican incumbent, Scott Brown, with a populist message based on advocacy for strict Wall Street regulation. Now, just six years later, Ms. Warren is stepping into the 2020 race, particularly well regarded among liberal activists who often criticized Hillary Clinton, the 2016 Democratic nominee, as insufficiently tough on bankers and Wall Street firms that had been allies and donors to her.

""How did we get here?"" Ms. Warren said in her announcement video. ""Billionaires and big corporations decided they wanted more of the pie, and they enlisted politicians to cut them a fatter slice.""

Ms. Warren has both assets and possible drawbacks in a White House run. Strategists for several other likely Democratic candidates say private polling found Ms. Warren's political brand -- as a warrior against big banks and other powerful corporate interests -- to be exceptionally strong with Democratic primary voters. Her signature initiative in recent months has been a sweeping bill to crack down on government corruption, effectively adapting her longtime focus on private-sector greed for the public-sector scandals of the Trump era.

But Ms. Warren has also become a favorite target of conservatives, who have sought to brand her as an out-of-touch liberal from academia. In 2012, the political director for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce said Ms. Warren represented a ""threat to free enterprise"" and, this year, two Democratic senators -- facing difficult re-election races in states Mr. Trump won in 2016 -- took the unusual step of distancing themselves from Ms. Warren, their own colleague.

There is also the issue of her decades-old claim of Native American ancestry. Mr. Trump regularly slurs Ms. Warren as ""Pocahontas,"" a reliable applause line at his rallies. In October, Ms. Warren released results of a D.N.A. test showing strong evidence that she has Native American pedigree dating ""6-10 generations ago."" Not only did the test not quiet her critics, it puzzled many Democrats and angered leaders of several Native American tribes who said Ms. Warren's actions contributed to a harmful narrative that blood, not cultural kinship, determines tribal affiliation.

The blowback over the D.N.A. test has caused some longtime supporters to question Ms. Warren's political acumen, since any Democratic nominee seeking to oppose Mr. Trump would have to deftly navigate his constant barbs and often inflammatory rhetoric.

""The biggest risk in engaging a bully is that bullies don't usually stop, regardless of what the truth is,"" Charles Chamberlain, executive director for the progressive political group Democracy for America, said earlier in December. The group began a ""Run Warren Run"" campaign in 2014 to encourage her to seek the 2016 presidential nomination, but was caught off guard by the D.N.A. test decision.

""When you can't win an argument,"" he added, ""then sometimes it's not worth having that argument.""

A Quinnipiac University poll in mid-December underscored Ms. Warren's strengths as a primary candidate, finding her better-known and better-liked by Democrats than any other candidate who had not run for president before. Three in five Democrats had a favorable opinion of her, compared with just 12 percent who viewed her unfavorably, a ratio outdone only by Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders.

But the same poll pointed to Ms. Warren's likely challenges. Voters at large were far more divided in their views of her: Only about 30 percent viewed her favorably, with 37 percent holding an unfavorable view and the rest undecided.

Another poll, taken recently by CNN and the Des Moines Register, found Ms. Warren in fourth place in Iowa, the leadoff caucus state, with 8 percent of the vote, far back from Mr. Biden and Mr. Sanders and slightly behind Representative Beto O'Rourke of Texas.

To the extent that Democratic primary voters are inclined to cast their ballots tactically -- in favor of a candidate who appears likeliest to beat Mr. Trump in the general election -- Ms. Warren may have some serious convincing to do. If the clarity and intensity of her political message have made her a hero to many liberals, it may have left a less-favorable first impression elsewhere that could be difficult to change. And Ms. Warren is regarded with anxiety or worse by much of the Democratic political establishment, including some Senate colleagues who complain that she has pursued an inflexible agenda on matters like bank regulation, at the cost of party unity.

During her Senate years, Ms. Warren has demonstrated the most influence as a member of the Banking Committee, aggressively questioning leaders of the financial industry about excesses and abuses; seeking accountability for the Great Recession; and challenging the Obama and Trump administrations to take tougher lines on regulations and trade policy. In 2015, Ms. Warren sunk the nomination of Antonio Weiss, the Wall Street banker selected by the Obama administration to serve as third-ranking official at the Treasury Department, taking on her party on the grounds that Mr. Weiss, the former head of investment banking for Lazard, was too closely connected to the financial services industry to serve in public office.

Ms. Warren is not known for shepherding major legislation successfully through Congress, though Democrats were never in control of both chambers during her time there. In recent years, Ms. Warren has also tried to shore up her foreign policy credentials: securing a spot on the Senate Armed Services Committee after the 2016 presidential election, and taking high-profile trips to visit troops with Republicans such as Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Senator John McCain of Arizona.

""Whether our leaders recognize it or not, after years as the world's lone superpower, the United States is entering a new period of competition,"" Ms. Warren said in a foreign policy speech at American University in November. ""Democracy is running headlong into the ideologies of nationalism, authoritarianism and corruption.""

The map of states with early nominating contests appears, at least on the surface, to be an inviting one for Ms. Warren: The race begins in Iowa, where Farm Belt populism long defined Democratic politics, before moving to her political backyard of New Hampshire. During the midterm elections, she got a rousing reception in Nevada, an early state that suffered grievously in the 2008 financial crisis, and where rhetoric lashing Wall Street and major mortgage lenders tends to resonate.

Ms. Warren's prospects in the race may also depend, in part, on which other Democrats decide to run. Several other fiery economic populists could join the Democratic field, including Mr. Sanders and Senators Sherrod Brown of Ohio and Jeff Merkley of Oregon, potentially splintering the voters most energized by Ms. Warren's core themes. Should most or all of those candidates stay out, Ms. Warren might face weaker competition on the left.

And like other white liberals in a historically diverse field, Ms. Warren may have to work harder to win over black primary voters in South Carolina, another early voting state, and across the country. African-American Democrats have played a decisive role in settling the last two open contests for the Democratic presidential nomination, and Ms. Warren is expected to be competing against her party's only two black senators, Ms. Harris and Mr. Booker.

In Ms. Warren's video announcing her candidacy, she pointed to the unique discrimination that nonwhite families face -- another sign of how seriously she is taking outreach to minority voters, and particularly black Democrats.

Whatever obstacles her candidacy faces, Ms. Warren may be well positioned to serve as an ideological pole star in a diffuse field of Democratic candidates. And she has a history of surprising skeptics who might have been inclined to view her as a wild-eyed caricature. One of her potential foes for the Democratic nomination, Michael R. Bloomberg, the billionaire former New York City mayor, confided to associates after a chance meeting with Ms. Warren that he found her impressive and smart despite their drastically different views of the economy."
136,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/03/opinion/house-democrats-watergate-1974.html,"Mr. Schmitt is the director of the political reform program at the research organization New America.

Forty-four years ago, in another year of national crisis over a scandal-ridden presidency, an election sent 91 new members to the House. That 1974 wave didn't shift partisan control, but it did create one of the widest Democratic congressional advantages in a half-century.

It also sent to Washington a new kind of member of Congress: entrepreneurial, independent, deeply engaged with his or (in a very few cases) her constituents and district.

The new Congress of 2019 brings the largest shift in favor of Democrats in the House, at 40 seats, since Watergate. The congressional class of 1974 had a few other things in common with the new members elected in 2018. Just as this one brings 26 millennials to Congress, 1974 brought another generation into American politics, the baby boomers, along with a mandate to rein in what had become an ""imperial presidency,"" though the president who inspired that concern had already been airlifted from the White House lawn. They came ready not just to legislate but also to use Congress's oversight powers and reform the institution.

That long-ago wave holds some lessons for the new Congress, particularly the focus on reform. But above all, the newly elected members from both parties should pay attention to the way those 1970s members saw their jobs and their relationship to constituents.

Many of the 1974 class had caught incumbents napping, disconnected from their districts, invisible to voters. The new members worked tirelessly to build a connection to the people, institutions and particular needs of the places they would represent. And after they won, they didn't stop, investing in constituent service, district offices, caseworkers and a high profile at home.

While older members of Congress in the 1970s followed the rule of the former House speaker Sam Rayburn of Texas to ""go along to get along,"" many of the newcomers were impatient policy entrepreneurs, developing quick expertise on issues important to them or their districts and pushing Congress to let their ideas onto the agenda by forcing the all-powerful Rules Committee to let them offer amendments. They soon booted a few of the old Southern Democratic committee chairmen. Like many of this week's new members, they represented suburban districts that could go for either party, and only by developing strong local ties could they hold onto their seats through the waves that elected Ronald Reagan just six years later.

The politicians defeated or superseded by the 1974 wave had lost touch with their constituents because individual members of Congress didn't matter that much. Power came only with seniority. Rank-and-file members didn't have much to do and didn't have to do much.

In 2018, members lost touch for a very different reason: They had grown complacent that they could count on waves of ideology and negative partisanship to carry them through yet another election, the fifth for those first elected in the 2010 wave. They campaigned in broad strokes on national issues such as immigration and the refugee caravan.

Since 2010, they had relied first on the coherent national message of opposition to Barack Obama, then on the small-government ideology of the speaker Paul Ryan and finally on loyalty to Donald Trump, to overwhelm smaller, local allegiances. Even Mr. Trump's endorsements were boilerplate and national, with the same odd capitalization choices: ""strong on Crime & Borders, the 2nd Amendment, & loves our Military & Vets.""

The House Republicans' experiment with continuously nationalized politics didn't work out. Politics operates as two interlocking systems, sort of like your left and right brain hemispheres: One system is local, parochial, individualized, pragmatic, while the other involves big national choices and ideas. Successful politicians and parties operate at both levels. Politics of local interests alone can lead to the kind of logrolling bargains -- you support my farm subsidy and I'll support your oil-drilling tax break -- that create a functioning Congress but risk losing sight of big national obligations such as addressing climate change. But nationalized politics alone strips away the many little points of common ground that cut across polarizing lines of ideology and help make bargains and compromise possible. When the two systems are both healthy, when politicians are engaged both with big ideas and with their own constituents and their concerns, it brings a kind of fluidity to politics that we've seen in more productive periods, such as the 1980s.

If the new members of Congress are able to govern as they campaigned, tirelessly, unafraid of hostile audiences, deeply connected to their districts, focused on improving individual lives, they might eventually pull politics out of the box in which either one party pushes through an entire unpopular agenda or Congress is paralyzed. A newfound focus on the local will also allow new members to bring forward innovations in local government and civic engagement.

But today's politicians face an obstacle that the class of '74 could mostly ignore: the enormous cost of campaigns. Republican members fell out of touch with their districts in part because they were increasingly dependent on a few large national donors, operating through super PACs and political nonprofits such as the Congressional Leadership Fund, which get the bulk of their donations from billionaires in Las Vegas, New York, Texas and Florida. Democrats, too, relied on these outside groups and their own billionaires, but 2018 brought an enormous wave of small donors. And while much of that came from fired-up progressives in solid Democratic districts, even in the highest-profile races, a surprising share came from the candidates' own constituents -- for example, more than 54 percent of Beto O'Rourke's contributions came from Texans. A majority of Democratic challengers also refused corporate PAC money, which often runs through Washington lobbyists.

In 2020 and 2022, these new members will no longer be exciting insurgent challengers but incumbents, probably forced to compromise in ways that some supporters might find disappointing. If the volunteer energy and small-donor support that lifted them to victory in 2018 is missing, their campaigns will look very different. They'll have to turn to corporate PACs again and, much like their predecessors elected in 2006 and 2008, focus their attention on donors rather than their districts, compromising their promises.

The Democratic caucus has announced plans to make a package of political reforms, including the provisions to encourage small donors long championed by John Sarbanes, Democrat of Maryland, their top priority, bearing the symbolic bill number H.R. 1. In addition to highlighting corruption and the corrosive consequences of the post-Citizens United era, such reforms, if they were ever to pass, could give elected officials a way to stay in better touch with their districts, spending more time with voters and that way keeping the vital, diverse local dimension of politics alive even in a time of deep national polarization.

137,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/20/nyregion/cory-booker-dream-united-pac.html,"A prominent donor plans to raise $10 million in the coming months for a new super PAC to boost Senator Cory Booker's expected presidential campaign -- marking the first infusion of big money into the Democratic primary and setting the stage for a reckoning within the party over the role of super PACs.

Steve Phillips, an influential San Francisco-based Democratic donor and activist, said he would formally file paperwork on Thursday to create the pro-Booker super PAC, Dream United. Mr. Booker, who represents New Jersey, has yet to announce whether he is running, let alone whether he would welcome super PAC support.

A first well-funded super PAC of 2020 could aid Mr. Booker in amplifying his message in what is expected to be a historically crowded field, and it speaks to the depth of his support from potential financiers. But such support could also backfire as the grass-roots base of the party is increasingly calling to curtail the political influence of the wealthy.

Mr. Phillips said he had already collected $4 million in commitments. And he suggested he would continue collecting money regardless of whether Mr. Booker wanted his support.

""This is actually bigger than Cory,"" Mr. Phillips, a civil rights lawyer, said in an interview. ""And so those of us who are enthusiastic about what he brings and what he offers the country will continue to work to try to have him become our next president and replace the current president.""

Jeff Giertz, a spokesman for Mr. Booker, said Mr. Booker ""continues to weigh"" a run and that ""any effort to draft him into the race is outside of his control and will not affect his decision.""

He added: ""There has been no activity on his part or that of his team to organize or endorse the creation of a super PAC.""

Whether or not to bless, accept or denounce the support of billionaire and multimillionaire-funded super PACs is expected to be a flash point in the Democratic race.

Senator Bernie Sanders's renouncement of super PAC assistance was a centerpiece of his 2016 campaign -- Saturday Night Live spoofed his berating of the groups -- and others are likely to take a similar stance in 2020, including Senator Elizabeth Warren, according to people familiar with her thinking.

Other candidates are more likely to have super PACs. An effort to draft Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio into the race would likely become a pro-Brown super PAC, if he runs. And talks have occurred about a potential super PAC that would be run by former advisers to Senator Kamala Harris of California -- her team has said they have no plans to encourage or support the formation of one.

Super PACs are appealing because direct donations to presidential primary campaigns are subject to strict limits ($2,700 in 2016). But no limits exist on the amount that can be contributed to super PACs. As a result, critics say such groups distort the democratic process by giving major donors too much sway.

Mr. Phillips said his PAC will focus initially on increasing turnout among minorities and liberal white voters in Southern states, with a particular focus on South Carolina, which will host the first nominating contest in a state with a significant African-American population. His super PAC would skip the first two nominating contests -- in the overwhelmingly white states of Iowa and New Hampshire.

Mr. Phillips, who is African-American, is experienced in mounting early independent spending campaigns in Democratic primaries.

He used a similar strategy on behalf of then-Senator Barack Obama's presidential campaign ahead of the South Carolina primary in 2008, despite receiving a letter from Mr. Obama's campaign asking him to ""discontinue without further delay.""

Mr. Phillips's groups spent $11 million helping Mr. Obama's successful 2008 campaign, even as the future president never embraced his efforts.

""What we did in '08 is likely what we'll do this time around,"" Mr. Phillips said.

Mr. Phillips compared Mr. Booker to former President Obama, saying both have ""the ability to inspire people across the economic spectrum."" He said he hoped that his new PAC ""will be as synergistic as possible"" with a Booker campaign.

Mr. Booker has not yet even formed a formal presidential exploratory committee, though he has flirted with running and said he would consider it over the coming holidays. He has traveled extensively in 2018, visiting two dozen states including Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina. Mr. Phillips said he knew people who interviewed for Booker campaign jobs.

The decision to side with Mr. Booker so early is notable given that Mr. Phillips also has been supportive of Ms. Harris, who is also seen as a likely candidate in 2020. An independent campaign tied to Mr. Phillips spent nearly $400,000 boosting Ms. Harris's 2010 bid for California attorney general, state records show.

Mr. Phillips named two early donors supportive of his pro-Booker 2020 effort: his wife Susan Sandler, a philanthropist who is the daughter of the billionaire Democratic donor, Herb Sandler, and Dr. Gary Michelson, a billionaire philanthropist and surgeon in Los Angeles.

By announcing first, Mr. Philips appears to be trying to corner the market on having the main pro-Booker super PAC.

""It's more efficient for the donor world for there to be one point of contact so we're setting up to play that role,"" he said.

Asked about concerns among some Democrats that a super PAC could backfire, Mr. Philips said, ""I don't think it's going to be a detriment in South Carolina, Georgia, Virginia, Mississippi and Alabama,"" states where he could be involved in.

In 2018, other super PACs affiliated with Mr. Phillips spent more than $2 million on Mike Espy in his failed bid for Senate in Mississippi and millions more for Stacey Abrams in her losing bid for Georgia governor.

In addition to his political activities, Mr. Phillips is the author of ""Brown Is the New White: How the Demographic Revolution Has Created a New American Majority."" In April, he sat down with Mr. Booker for a 75-minute live conversation that included discussing the political coalitions needed for presidential campaigns.

""Not enough people read it,"" Mr. Booker said of Mr. Phillips's book. ""I appreciated your championing of it,"" Mr. Phillips replied."
138,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/20/business/retirement-pensions-social-security-2019.html,"It's going to be a busy year in Washington and state capitals for policymakers working to improve the retirement security of millions of Americans.

New retirement savings options will be on the horizon in 2019 for millions who don't have access to workplace 401(k) plans. Meanwhile, Congress will try to agree on a plan to avert sharp cuts in traditional pension benefits for over a million workers. The long-running battle over regulation to protect investors will enter a new phase when the Securities and Exchange Commission issues new ""best interest"" rules governing investment advice. And the House of Representatives could take up legislation to expand Social Security.

Here is a look at crucial retirement policy topics to watch in the year ahead.

Savings Plans

Workplace retirement savings plans have proved to be the most effective route to help savers, mainly thanks to features like automatic enrollment, regular payroll deductions and matching employer contributions. Yet one-third of private sector workers had no access to an employer-sponsored retirement plan in 2016, according to the Government Accountability Office. The coverage shortfall is greatest among low-income workers and people working for small companies.

But 2019 will be a turning point in covering more workers.

Some states are starting programs that automatically sign up workers who don't have workplace 401(k) accounts or Individual Retirement Accounts. Over time, employers in many of these states will be required to set up automatic payroll deductions for these accounts and enroll workers, although they will not need to make matching contributions.

Oregon started its plan this year; California and Illinois will start in 2019; Vermont, Maryland and Connecticut are preparing programs; and New York has passed legislation and is establishing a board to oversee the start of a state program over the next two years. And this week, New Jersey's General Assembly passed legislation authorizing the creation of a program (the state's Senate is expected to consider the bill early next year).

The states that have approved plans could eventually extend coverage to 15 million workers, AARP estimates.

California's plan alone could cover 7.5 million workers, officials there say. The CalSavers program is in a pilot phase through the end of June, and will be open to all employers beginning July 1; mandatory compliance will phase in with three waves based on employer size.

""The goal is to make sure we stem the tide of the retirement crisis and help Californians realize the dream of a golden retirement,"" says John Chiang, the state treasurer. ""It's not an easy task, because the current marketplace has failed.""

Meanwhile, Congress will take up legislation next year that would make it easier for employers to band together to join a single 401(k) plan that they can offer to employees. These ""open multiple-employer plans"" would be offered by private plan custodians; the aim would be to offer employers low-cost plans featuring simplified paperwork.

How quickly would these multiple-employer plans be offered if legislation were approved? ""Plan providers will need a year to gear up and get infrastructure in place,"" predicts Kathleen Coulombe, a vice president at the American Council of Life Insurers, which supports the legislation. ""I'd expect to see plans launch starting in 2020.""

Which approach is better -- auto-I.R.A. or a multiple-employer plan? ""They are both good ideas, and there's no inconsistency between them,"" says Mark Iwry, one of the architects of a national auto-I.R.A. program that he worked to enact during his time as a senior adviser to the Treasury secretary in the Obama administration. The national auto-I.R.A. would require employers without their own retirement plan to enroll workers.

Mr. Iwry, currently a nonresident senior fellow at the Brookings Institution, sees the two ideas as complementary, with auto-I.R.A.s serving as starter accounts likely to lead many more employers to adopt 401(k) plans.

But Mr. Iwry said the market already had achieved much of the economy of scale and reduced costs promised by multiple-employer plans, with companies sponsoring identical plans using a single low-cost investment lineup and common record-keeping and administration. ""The proposed open M.E.P. legislation is desirable and long overdue,"" he said. ""But in their potential to expand coverage, open M.E.P.s don't hold a candle to auto-I.R.A.s."" That is because auto-I.R.A. programs achieve big gains in plan participation through mandatory employer participation features and automatic worker enrollment; with open M.E.P.s, takeup will depend on whether financial service providers market them aggressively, and employers' appetite to sign up. What's more, not all of these multiple-employer plans will use auto-enrollment.

Mr. Iwry still holds out legislative hope for a national auto-I.R.A. program, noting that the bill's longtime lead Democratic sponsor, Representative Richard Neal, of Massachusetts, is about to become chairman of the powerful House Ways and Means committee.

Saving One Million Pensions

A special congressional committee is racing to head off an insolvency crisis, one that could lead to sharp cuts in pension benefits for over a million workers and retirees, and sink a federally sponsored insurance backup program.

The problem centers on so-called multiemployer pension plans. Over 10 million workers and retirees are covered by 1,400 of these plans, which are created under collective bargaining agreements and jointly funded by groups of employers in industries like construction, trucking, mining and food retailing.

Plans covering 1.3 million workers and retirees are severely underfunded -- the result of stock market crashes in 2001 and 2008-9, and industrial decline that led to consolidation and sliding employment. Cheiron Inc., an actuarial consulting firm, recently forecast that 121 plans might fail within 20 years. Plans are underfunded by a total of $48.9 billion, the firm estimated. Three plans alone account for 65 percent of all unfunded liabilities, led by the Teamsters' Central States fund, which is falling short by $22.9 billion.

Meanwhile, the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation, the federally sponsored insurance backstop for defunct plans, projects that its multiemployer insurance program will run out of money by the end of the 2025 fiscal year, absent reforms.

Congress approved an overhaul in 2014, the Multiemployer Pension Reform Act, but the legislation has faced strong resistance from retiree organizations, consumer groups and some labor unions.

The act allows troubled plans to seek government permission to make deep benefit cuts, if they can show that the reductions would prolong the life of the plan. Benefit cuts vary widely depending on what a plan proposes and the tenure of the worker -- but a worker with 25 years of service and a $2,000 monthly benefit could see that benefit cut to as low as $983, according to a cutback calculator created by the Pension Rights Center, an advocacy group. To date, nine plan restructurings have been approved.

This year, the special congressional committee appointed to create a replacement for the pension reform act missed an end-of-November deadline to issue its recommendation. But a draft proposal raises the guaranteed minimum benefits paid by the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation. It also would inject federal funds into the agency -- perhaps $3 billion annually -- to expand its partition program, which allows it to take on benefit payments to so-called orphans -- people who earned benefits from employers who have dropped out of plans, often because they have gone out of business.

""It would rely less on cutting benefits, and more on raising money from existing pension plans and taxpayers,"" says Joshua Gotbaum, a guest scholar at the Brookings Institution and a former director of the federal pension backstop.

The sticking points in the discussion have included the assumptions used to measure plan liabilities, and how much respective stakeholders, including the government, should contribute to maintain a viable multiemployer system, says Karen Friedman, executive vice president of the Pension Rights Center. ""We're hoping they can find a fair, comprehensive solution that can save these plans, the P.B.G.C. and protect workers and retirees.""

Protecting Investors From Conflicted Advice

The long-running battle to require brokers to look out for the best interests of clients will continue in 2019.

The S.E.C. is moving toward adoption of a ""regulation best interest"" standard following the end this year of an advice standard created by the Obama-era Labor Department. That regulation, which required advice on retirement accounts to meet fiduciary standards, was opposed by the financial services and insurance industries, which argued that it made advising smaller investors too costly.

The S.E.C. rule would require brokers to put their customers' financial interests ahead of their own, but it does not require them to act as fiduciaries. The rule also would require disclosures to clients of any potential conflicts, and it reaffirms existing higher standards for registered investment advisers.

The draft regulation has come under fire from consumer advocates who note that it does not clearly define the term ""best interest,"" and that the proposed disclosure forms are confusing for investors.

""There is a real need to simplify the disclosure forms so that they communicate effectively to investors the information that they actually need to make decisions,"" says Cristina Martin Firvida, vice president for financial security and consumer affairs at AARP.

Expanding Social Security

Proposals to overhaul Social Security by progressives are likely to get a hearing in the new Democratic-controlled House.

Most of the winning Democratic candidates who flipped 40 congressional seats in the midterm elections ran on expanding Social Security benefits, said Nancy Altman, president of Social Security Works, a progressive advocacy group. And the likely new chairman of the Ways and Means Social Security Subcommittee, Representative John B. Larson, Democrat of Connecticut, is the author of expansion legislation that has more than 170 co-sponsors in the House, including Mr. Neal, the incoming Ways and Means chairman.

""The Larson bill certainly will get a hearing, and there's a substantial chance it will move out of committee and even get a vote on the House floor,"" Ms. Altman predicted. ""That will really elevate the issue and put a spotlight on the Senate and the White House.""

Mr. Larson's bill includes a 2 percent across-the-board increase in benefits, a more generous annual cost-of-living adjustment and a higher minimum benefit for low-income workers. The bill would pay for the expansion by lifting the cap on wages subject to taxation and a gradual phase-in of a higher payroll tax rate.

Social Security faces a long-run financial imbalance -- the program is now spending more than it takes in annually in payroll taxes. The Social Security trustees project that the program will be unable to pay full benefits beginning in 2034; unless Congress takes action, benefits would be slashed by about 25 percent. The funding proposal in Mr. Larson's bill also would restore the program's long-range financial balance."

To the Editor:

Re ""U.S. Ends Mission in Syria as Trump Pulls 2,000 Troops"" (front page, Dec. 20):

Although the extrication of our soldiers from Syria is a laudable goal supported by most Americans, there is every reason to believe that the president's action to pull our troops out of that country now is ill advised. It is ominous that the pullout is being heralded by mischief-making nations like Russia.

President Trump seeks to justify this action as something that is warranted because of the vanquishing of ISIS in Syria. His declaration of victory over the terrorist organization may well prove to be every bit as credible as his ludicrous assertion that through one meeting with North Korea's dictator, Kim Jong-un, the threat of nuclear conflict had vanished.

Mr. Trump has told us that he receives his intelligence from shows like ""Fox and Friends"" and, in an insult to the top brass of the military, that he knows more than the generals. I believe we are likely to find out how absurd it is to place faith and authority in him to direct our foreign policy.

To the Editor:

Predictably, President Trump's opponents and perpetual hawks oppose the announced withdrawal of our forces from Syria. They maintain that continued deployment of American military strength is a prerequisite for world peace.

Since the end of World War II, the United States has repeatedly engaged in military intervention based on dubious premises, with disastrous results. The cost of Vietnam, Iraq and Afghanistan in blood and money should serve as a guide for the future.

Military deployment is justifiable only as a deterrent to a credible threat to our national interests. It's time to abandon our tenuous role as global cop.

President Trump has decided it is time to get out of Syria against the advice of his defense secretary and the Pentagon. He has now entered the ""Dr. Strangelove"" territory in which a rogue general, Jack D. Ripper, explains to a British captain, Lionel Mandrake, why he launched B-52s armed with nukes against the Soviet Union.

General Ripper explained Clemenceau's view of war to an astounded British officer: ""He said war was too important to be left to the generals. When he said that, 50 years ago, he might have been right. But today, war is too important to be left to politicians. They have neither the time, the training, nor the inclination for strategic thought.""

General Ripper could have been talking about our strategically clueless president, who scares the heck out of me.

""Withdrawal Recalls Obama and Iraq"" (news analysis, front page, Dec. 20) compares President Barack Obama's withdrawal from Iraq with President Trump's decision to withdraw American forces from Syria. The article does not mention that Mr. Obama's withdrawal was complying with a three-year timetable that was negotiated between the Bush administration and the Iraqi government.

To compare Mr. Trump's impulsive decision to unilaterally withdraw American personnel from Syria within 30 days with the Bush-negotiated, Iraqi-approved and Obama-executed multiyear project is absurd.

New York"
140,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2018/12/19/us/politics/ap-us-united-states-syria-glance.html,"WASHINGTON -- Here, at a glance, is a look at U.S. involvement in Syria:

HOW IT STARTED

In September 2014, then-President Barack Obama launched a U.S. air campaign against the Islamic State in Syria, one month after starting airstrikes in neighboring Iraq. The Islamic State had built substantial military firepower in Syria, which it used to sweep across western and northern Iraq earlier in 2014.

In late 2015 the first American ground troops entered Syria -- initially 50, growing to the current official total of about 2,000. They recruited, organized and advised thousands of Syrian Kurdish and Arab fighters, dubbed the Syrian Democratic Forces, and pushed IS out of most of its strongholds.

___

MILITARY OPERATIONS

To date, the U.S.-led coalition has launched airstrikes on at least 17,000 locations in Syria since the start of the operation. Last week, there were strikes on 208 locations, largely on Islamic State fighters and facilities in the Middle Euphrates River Valley, according to the U.S. military.

Thousands of IS fighters have been killed or captured, but U.S. military officials say there are still as many at 2,000 insurgents still in the MERV, and a number of others who have escaped to various locations around the country.

___

COMPLICATIONS

Russia joined the big-power entanglement in Syria in the fall of 2015. Moscow said it was there to defeat terrorists, but Washington objected, saying the Russian military was propping up Syrian President Bashar Assad and making it more difficult to eliminate IS. To avoid aerial confrontations and accidents, U.S. and Russian military officials set up a telephone ""deconfliction line,"" which remains in effect.

Turkey's concern about links between the U.S.-supported Syrian Kurdish militias and Kurdish insurgents inside Turkey added a further complication for Washington. The Turkish military intervened in northern Syria, prompting the Syrian Kurds to temporarily abandon the fight against IS.

Iran has also maintained a presence in the country, supporting Assad and supplying weapons, the U.S. has asserted.

___

THE U.S. PULLOUT

President Donald Trump said his administration had continued the Syria fight only because of the IS threat. On Wednesday the president tweeted, ""We have defeated ISIS in Syria,"" and later U.S. officials said he had ordered a full withdrawal of U.S. forces there.

The Pentagon said in a prepared statement that IS-held territory had been ""liberated,"" but added that the U.S. would continue ""working with our partners and allies to defeat ISIS wherever it operates."" Officials refused to say when all U.S. troops would be out of Syria.

___

REACTION TO THE DECISION: OPPPONENTS

The decision has been met with widespread condemnation and only a smattering of support.

Pentagon leaders were largely mum on Wednesday, adhering to the mandate that U.S. civilian leaders make policy and the military salutes and moves forward. But top defense officials have been blunt in recent assessments that the fight against the Islamic State is not over.

Brett McGurk, the administration's envoy for the fight against IS, said on Dec. 11: ""It would be reckless if we were just to say, well, the physical caliphate is defeated, so we can just leave now. I think anyone who's looked at a conflict like this would agree with that.""

Sen. Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican, called the pullout ""catastrophic,"" and Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., deemed it a ""disaster in the making.""

Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., said an ill-informed and hasty withdrawal may breathe new life into ISIS and other insurgent groups, and ""will also cede America's hard-fought gains in the region to Russia, Iran and Assad.""

___

REACTION TO THE DECISION: SUPPORTERS

Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., said he was ""very supportive"" of the decision. ""For the first time in my lifetime we have a president with the courage to declare victory and bring the troops home. We haven't had a president in 20 or 30 years who can figure out how to declare victory,"" he said.

Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., said Americans don't want troops in Syria in perpetuity. ""We brought them there to crush ISIS. We've crushed ISIS. We have troops in Iraq who can spring over there (to Syria) to do something"" if needed."
141,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/04/briefing/congress-stocks-china.html,"Good morning,

We start today with Democrats' efforts to end the partial government shutdown, and a look ahead at this morning's jobs report. And it's Friday, so there's a new news quiz.

Democrats vote to end the shutdown

Hours after Democrats took control of the House on Thursday, representatives approved two measures that would reopen government agencies that have been closed for nearly two weeks over a budget impasse. The votes were nearly all along party lines.

Both pieces of legislation are almost certain to die in the Senate. The majority leader, Mitch McConnell, has said he wouldn't bring to a vote measures that President Trump doesn't support, and the House bills don't include the $5 billion in border wall funding Mr. Trump is demanding. The new speaker, Representative Nancy Pelosi, calls such financing ""an immorality.""

In the Senate: Mr. McConnell is facing pressure from members of his party to resolve the stalemate. On Thursday, Senator Cory Gardner of Colorado became the first Republican in the chamber to publicly call for an end to the shutdown -- with or without wall funding.

Closer look: The current spending impasse seems different from ones during the Clinton and Obama eras, our chief Washington correspondent writes. There's little sense of urgency on either side about finding a resolution.

Voices: The shutdown has left 800,000 federal workers either furloughed or working without pay. ""They have to realize that this affects everyday people,"" said a corrections officer at a federal prison in Florida. ""It's like a political chess game that they're playing, and we seem to be pawns.""

New Congress is younger and more diverse

The 2019 freshman class in the House is the most racially diverse and most female ever. It includes the first Native American congresswomen, the first Muslim congresswomen and the first Palestinian-American. Meet all of the new lawmakers in the 116th Congress.

Watch: Nancy Pelosi, who in 2007 became the first woman elected speaker, reclaimed the gavel on Thursday. In her speech, she celebrated the diversity in the House.

The Daily: In today's episode, one of our congressional reporters discusses the scene on Thursday.

Companies hint that investors' worries are well placed

Revenue warnings this week from Apple and Delta Air Lines suggest that the U.S. economy and corporate profits are slowing more than expected, in part because of the trade dispute with China.

Many companies will be reporting fourth-quarter results in the coming weeks, and the chairman of the White House Council of Economic Advisers, Kevin Hassett, said on Thursday that there could be a torrent of bad news.

For you: If the recent market turmoil makes you want to flee -- or shift your 401(k) into cash -- that's understandable. It's also a bad idea, our senior economics correspondent writes.

Today: Analysts estimate that the U.S. economy added 180,000 jobs in December. Here's what to expect when the Labor Department releases its monthly employment report at 8:30 a.m. Eastern.

From Opinion: Apple's announcement about missing its revenue targets suggests the current wave of innovation is waning, our columnist writes in an Op-Ed.

Is this Marine veteran an American spy or a pawn?

Paul Whelan, the security chief of an international auto parts manufacturer, loved to travel around Russia and was in contact on social media with ordinary citizens there, including retired members of the military.

On Thursday, the Russian authorities charged Mr. Whelan, 48, with espionage. The U.S. government refused to publicly discuss Mr. Whelan's status in detail, but former C.I.A. officers said they didn't think he was a spy.

Why it matters: Mr. Whelan's arrest comes after a Russian woman, Maria Butina, pleaded guilty last month in Washington to conspiring to act as a foreign agent. Current and former officials said it was possible Mr. Whelan was seized to exchange him for Ms. Butina.

Vicente Zambada Niebla was groomed from an early age to take control of the Sinaloa drug cartel. But his lawyers said that he secretly worked for years as a spy for the Drug Enforcement Administration, providing information about his rivals in exchange for running his business freely.

On Thursday, he described in detail to a New York courtroom the workings of the drug-trafficking empire of his father's former partner, Joaquín Guzmán Loera, known as El Chapo.

Here's what else is happening

Travel advisory for China: The State Department warned U.S. citizens on Thursday that they could face arbitrary detention if they travel to China. The advisory comes after the recent arrest of a Chinese executive in Canada at the request of the U.S.

Subway reprieve: Plans for a 15-month shutdown of the L train tunnel between Manhattan and Brooklyn were abruptly halted on Thursday by Gov. Andrew Cuomo. The new project would keep full train service during weekdays and close just one of the tunnel's two tubes on nights and weekends.

And now for the Back Story on ...Tetris. All clear.

Some of us are still sorting through the year-end ""best of"" lists. Notably, many video game lists included a new release with roots in 1984: Tetris Effect.

It features a modern visual and sonic experience, including an acclaimed virtual-reality mode. But its core is the same gameplay that a Russian programmer, Alexey Pajitnov, created in his original title, Tetris.

In that version -- and in more than 200 subsequent official releases -- seven shapes (configurations of four squares, called tetriminos) stream one by one from the top of the screen. The player seeks to organize them to fill horizontal rows, which then clear from the field of play. The game ends when uncleared areas fill the playing grid. (Because of Soviet-era contracts, Mr. Pajitnov only began to get Tetris royalties in 1996.)

A report in The Times in 1988 said players found it ""surprisingly addictive.""

That has been borne out. Players report seeing the tetriminos away from the screen, including while dreaming.

The phenomenon's name? The Tetris Effect.

That's it for this briefing. Have a good weekend.

142,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/04/us/politics/native-american-education.html,"WASHINGTON -- This article is a collaboration between ProPublica and The New York Times.

A year and a half after receiving a detailed complaint from tribal leaders, the Education Department plans to investigate their accusations that the Wolf Point School District in Montana discriminates against Native American students.

In a Dec. 28 letter, sent hours after The New York Times and ProPublica published an investigation into racial inequities in the district, the department's Office for Civil Rights notified the lawyer representing the tribal executive board of the Fort Peck Indian Reservation in eastern Montana that it would look into the complaint. The board includes members of the Assiniboine and Sioux tribes. Native American and mixed-race students make up more than three-quarters of Wolf Point's enrollment.

According to the letter, the investigation will focus on whether Wolf Point schools discipline Native students more harshly than white students, shunt them into remedial programs without appropriate cause, and deny them special education evaluations and services.

The department said it would also examine whether the district failed to respond to a parent's accusations that a Native student was racially harassed. The student was not identified in the tribal complaint or in the letter.

""Tribal children have suffered unfairly for years in the Wolf Point School District,"" said Melina Healey, the lawyer representing the tribal executive board. She called for a ""swift and thorough investigation that leads to much-needed reforms.""

The Office for Civil Rights is already looking into a complaint by Louella Contreras that the Wolf Point district failed to provide her granddaughter Ruth Fourstar with special education services. The department's decision to look into the tribal leaders' broader accusations bucks the Education Department's policy under Secretary Betsy DeVos of pulling back from investigating complaints of systemic discrimination by schools and colleges, and concentrating on mistreatment of individuals.

ProPublica reported in June that under Ms. DeVos, the department had scuttled more than 1,200 civil rights investigations that began under the Obama administration and lasted at least six months.

Nationwide, more than 90 percent of Native students attend integrated public schools, near or on reservations, that have historically restricted tribal influence over curriculum, funding and staffing. Native American students have some of the worst academic outcomes in public schools: They score lower than nearly all other demographic groups on national tests, and less than three-fourths of Native students graduate from high school.

In June 2017, the tribal executive board filed a 46-page complaint that described dozens of instances where Wolf Point schools provided limited academic opportunities and social support to Native students. ProPublica and The Times found that Native students in Wolf Point are twice as likely to receive at least one suspension compared with their white peers, and white students are more than 10 times as likely to take at least one advanced placement course as Native students, according to an analysis of federal education data.

In interviews, students, staff and parents said Wolf Point's schools push Native children into a poorly funded, understaffed program for remedial and truant students. Native students said they were dropped from sports teams after giving birth, while a white student was not.

The Times-ProPublica investigation also found that some Native students have turned to self-harm and suicide. Three months before the tribal executive board's complaint, a Wolf Point High School junior killed himself after a public rebuke from the principal for poor attendance, two students said. He was the second student at the high school in seven years to take his own life after being chided by district administrators.

Jeana Lervick, a lawyer representing the school district, said on Wednesday that the district is closed for the holidays and is unable to comment on the federal investigation.

""Wolf Point Schools works constantly to address the challenges facing our students and, in particular, our Indigenous students,"" Ms. Lervick said in an earlier statement. ""Our district is aware of historical issues in our nation and as educators do everything in our power to address them.""

The district's superintendent and the high school principal did not respond to emailed questions.

Should civil rights investigators identify violations of federal law, the school district could lose federal funding. Typically, before investigators recommend sanctions, school districts voluntarily enter into an agreement with the Education Department to remedy any wrongdoing. Federal civil rights investigations can take up to several years to resolve.

""Instead of providing a safe learning environment, the Wolf Point School District adds to the long history of educational abuses of our tribal communities,"" said Roxanne Gourneau, a former member of the Fort Peck tribal executive board, who has worked to overhaul Wolf Point schools since her son killed himself after being disciplined at the high school. ""The school district has done more to fuel Native students' trauma than to support their education. Change is long overdue."""

A History of the United States Since 1974

By Kevin M. Kruse and Julian E. Zelizer

Illustrated. 428 pp. W.W. Norton & Company. $28.95.

Conventional wisdom holds that Americans are polarized, divided, tribalized -- choose your word -- over significant policy issues and that our two political parties abet and fuel this schism. Leaving aside the distinction between polarized political parties and a polarized people for the moment, the nation is surely in a time of political, intellectual and emotional realignment.

Kevin M. Kruse and Julian E. Zelizer's ""Fault Lines"" grafts a geologic metaphor onto three divisive threats to our democracy as suggested by Barack Obama in his January 2017 farewell address -- economic, racial and political -- while adding a fourth, gender and sexuality. The authors argue that these divisions have allowed the two parties, which are seen through the fractured lens of ""the media,"" to create a situation in which Americans have become more polarized than ever.

Their premise is that what they call ""fault lines"" have always existed but until recently were held in check by a ""robust federal government, a thriving middle-class economy and a powerful union movement."" They hammer home their ""fault line"" metaphor with Stakhanovite repetition. Almost every chapter is organized according to the rules familiar to any public speaker: ""In the first part I tell 'em what I am going to tell 'em; in the second part I tell 'em; and in the third part I tell 'em what I've told 'em.""

Kruse and Zelizer, who have based their book on a course they created at Princeton, begin with the story of the unraveling of the ""somewhat forced 'consensus' of the postwar era"" in the 1960s and '70s, quickly moving through capsule histories of the series of ""crisis"" events and issues that reordered the outlook of Americans -- Watergate, stagflation, racial equality, feminism, gay rights and more. Stepping in to exploit these unleashed fault lines, according to the authors, is ""an aggressive new conservative movement ... amplified by a fragmented partisan media.""

But are Americans really divided by fault lines? Interestingly, there is a great deal of research that shows it is the political parties that are polarized but not the American people. Political scientists describe this situation as ""party sorting."" That is, the Democratic and Republican Parties have devolved into two separate groups that offer ideological and policy conformity with almost no overlap. Remember liberal Republicans like Nelson Rockefeller of New York or conservative Democrats like Zell Miller of Georgia? They almost don't exist anymore (Joe Manchin of West Virginia excepted) because neither party in its current iteration would have them. The actual fault lines, it might be said, are between the parties, not between two groups of the public.

For the past 25 years, according to Gallup, over a third of Americans have identified as moderate, and the number of independents reached an all-time high in 2013. Even the famous 2014 Pew Survey on polarization noted that the majority of Americans ""do not have uniformly conservative or liberal views."" Where fault-line-like division is most pronounced is among the most politically engaged Americans. Examples of these folks abound in ""Fault Lines.""

So if the real story is that the political parties have sorted ideologically and are appealing to the most ideologically engaged voters, who happen to be the most outraged, what is to be done? Kruse and Zelizer argue for Americans to build bridges ""that can bring us closer together,"" although they are also refreshingly frank about the cant of postelection remarks on coming together -- noting the ritualistic aspect whose constant repetition is, in fact, an acknowledgment of division.

Kruse and Zelizer begin their book with Obama's farewell address. They might have ended it with two points the Obama speech made as well: ""Hold fast to the faith written into our founding documents"" and ""regardless of our party affiliation or particular interest, help restore the sense of common purpose that we so badly need right now."" Embracing both of those points might do the trick. Then again, it might not."
144,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/31/us/politics/2020-democratic-candidates.html,"Senator Elizabeth Warren's formation of an exploratory committee for president on Monday represents a sort of political ball drop, the beginning of a new year and new campaign that will feature an unusually large number of Democrats seeking the presidency.

Or will it?

As the 2020 Democratic primary gets underway, the defining characteristic of this first stage of the race is the sheer uncertainty about who is even running. More than 30 Democrats are mulling presidential bids, but hardly any of them qualifies as an instant front-runner or a gifted, tested campaigner, and some of the biggest names could pass in the end.

[Elizabeth Warren has entered the 2020 presidential race. Read about it here.]

Even beyond the field of specific candidates, this will be one of the most fluid nominating contests Democrats have had in recent decades. A leaderless party, they are in a moment of transition from center-left politics to a more ideologically pure brand of liberalism.

Democrats are grappling with what they stand for, what their voters expect, and what demographic groups will be most critical in winning an Electoral College majority in 2020. But most of all, they are unified by a once-unimaginable objective that only illustrates how unpredictable American politics has become: ensuring Donald J. Trump is just a one-term president.

Who's going to run?

It is hard to recall a recent presidential primary where, at the outset of the race, there was this much genuine mystery -- not only about who would eventually emerge as the nominee, but who planned to run at all.

Ms. Warren's announcement Monday was expected. And it will not be a surprise when Senators Cory Booker of New Jersey and Kamala Harris of California enter the race in the coming weeks.

But the number of would-be candidates who may ultimately stay out of the race is larger than the list of contenders who are certain to run.

There are the well-known, or at least much-buzzed-about, Democrats who are still deliberating: Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. is the most prominent of this group, and leads the field in initial polling in Iowa. But there is also great anticipation over Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, the runner-up for the Democratic nomination in 2016, and Representative Beto O'Rourke of Texas, whose losing Senate bid this year electrified many grass-roots Democrats.

It is unclear if any of these men will enter the race -- particularly Mr. Biden, who, associates say, is ambivalent about running after over three decades of presidential fits and starts.

[Make sense of the people, issues and ideas shaping American politics with our newsletter.]

There is also great uncertainty about lesser-known potential contenders who could be formidable -- and if the Trump phenomenon proves anything, it is that making any assumptions about candidates is folly.

Will Senators Sherrod Brown of Ohio and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota -- who both just won third terms in presidential battleground states -- go beyond their flirtation with running? And what of the roster of current and former Democratic governors, like Steve Bullock of Montana or Terry McAuliffe of Virginia?

Meeting the moment

Presidential politics recalls the adage that 80 percent of life is showing up.

Except in the case of primaries. Then, it's about knowing when to show up.

That question, more than anything, is what looms over Ms. Warren's candidacy: Would she be the president today if she had run in 2016, as some liberal activists and admirers urged her to? Mr. Sanders ended up filling the void on the populist left and ran a surprisingly strong campaign against Hillary Clinton.

Ms. Warren was hardly the first White House hopeful to risk waiting. Bill Clinton, for example, opted out of the 1988 campaign and still became president four years later.

But the more recent history of presidential calculations suggests that candidates are wiser to run when the moment presents itself. That is what Mr. Obama did in 2008 after just four years in the Senate, the same period Ms. Warren would have served by 2016. Some Democrats think 2020 is Mr. O'Rourke's moment: He has been in the House for just six years, but many liberals see his energy and freshness as inspiring.

[How early do presidential campaigns start? Earlier than you may think.]

One reason Ms. Warren announced on Monday and declared so early, her allies suggested, was to erase any uncertainty about her intentions among supporters whom she kept waiting -- and ultimately disappointed -- in 2016.

But now, instead of a head-to-head race against Mrs. Clinton, Ms. Warren is entering a wide-open campaign facing questions about her sensitivity on race and her political savvy after the release of a DNA test of her Native American heritage. Her decision to take the test angered some allies on the left and did nothing to stop Mr. Trump's mockery of her roots.

What do voters want?

Timing is also crucial in presidential races because the issues can change so quickly. Mr. Trump's incendiary rhetoric and policies around race and immigration have shifted the political conversation away from matters of economic inequality, which has been the life's work of Ms. Warren and which defined much of the 2016 Democratic primary.

Still, her party has plainly moved to the left on economics and social justice. So as much as anything, Ms. Warren's candidacy will test whether 2020 primary voters will demand that their candidates take unwavering positions on issues like universal health care and Wall Street regulations, much as they have historically expected them to do so on supporting abortion rights.

Mr. Sanders's 2016 candidacy demonstrated that there is hunger among Democrats to confront Wall Street excesses and income inequality. But what's less clear is how much of a premium the voters will put on purity on these issues -- and if they will overlook a softer line from a candidate who inspires them and who they think can defeat Mr. Trump.

A warning shot at big money

Ms. Warren is one of several potential candidates who have crusaded against the influence of wealthy donors and corporations, even to the point of calling out fellow Democrats for taking a more pliant approach to big-dollar fund-raising and business regulation. And she is unlikely to be any less confrontational with rivals in the primary who are heavily backed by billionaire donors, or who are billionaires themselves.

That poses a threat to possible Democratic candidates like Michael R. Bloomberg and Tom Steyer, who are aligned with liberals on important issues like climate change and immigration but embody the kind of capitalist wealth that many despise. She may also cause trouble for non-billionaires like Mr. Booker and Mr. McAuliffe, who have collected enormous sums of money over the years from banks, hedge funds and pharmaceutical corporations. Mr. Booker recently became the first candidate to have a super PAC formed in support of his anticipated campaign.

There is reason to expect Democratic primary voters and activists will be wary of candidates they see as too cozy with big money.

In the 2018 midterms, Democratic candidates who disavowed corporate money fared exceedingly well in primary elections, and the incoming House majority is expected to make ethics and campaign-finance legislation one of its first priorities. Revulsion from a money-soaked political system is one of a few concerns that links Democrats on the activist left, such as Representative-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, with less ideological party favorites like Mr. O'Rourke.

It is not difficult to imagine Ms. Warren emerging as a kind of good-government buzz saw on debate stages dotted with billionaires and super PAC beneficiaries. Whether or not voters thrill to her persona or policies, there may be no candidate better equipped than she is to help set the rules of engagement around political money and the 2020 field -- and to call out those who flout them.

Splitting the screen with Washington

Ms. Warren's step into the 2020 race was one of the biggest political stories of the day, but even a Democrat of her stature had to share the news cycle with an ongoing government shutdown and Mr. Trump's demands that Congress finance a border wall with Mexico. So it is likely to go for most of the 2020 campaign, as a president prone to political brinkmanship and angry outbursts simultaneously navigates divided government and his own battle for a second term.

Crises in government could routinely overshadow the Democratic primary campaign. Democrats' internal debates about ideology and their party's identity could be obscured by louder, more venomous clashes between the two parties. And challengers hoping to beat Mr. Trump on the campaign trail may have difficulty competing for attention when he is in the White House -- or on Twitter.

At times, there could also be moments of friction between the Democrats running for president and the Democrats helming the party in Congress. In the case of the shutdown, there is relatively little daylight, at least so far: Neither legislative leaders like Nancy Pelosi nor candidates like Ms. Warren want to build a border wall. But in other fights -- from cabinet nominations to possible impeachment proceedings -- there may be a wider gap between would-be presidents striving to win primary votes and legislative tacticians aiming to outmaneuver Republicans or cut deals with them.

Candidates like Ms. Warren, and other sitting senators like Ms. Harris and Mr. Booker, will each have to strike their own balance between joining the fights of the day in Washington -- often in reaction to Mr. Trump -- and introducing themselves to voters around the country, outlining their agendas and drawing contrasts with their rivals for the nomination."
145,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/17/us/politics/fed-interest-rates-wages.html,"WASHINGTON -- President Trump renewed his attacks on the Federal Reserve on Monday in a tweet expressing incredulity that the Fed continues to raise interest rates. While his outbursts have drawn widespread criticism for being impolitic, a growing number of experts think the president has a point.

As the Fed drives up borrowing costs, there is increasing concern that the central bank is risking a return to recession, and may be preventing workers from claiming a larger share of the American pie.

As Lawrence H. Summers, formerly President Barack Obama's chief economic adviser, put the matter in a recent interview with Fox Business Network, ""The ways in which the president spoke, I don't think any thoughtful economist would agree with."" Then he made clear that he mostly agreed: ""I do think that there are more risks of overtightening than there are of undertightening right now.""

The Fed is expected to raise its benchmark interest rate on Wednesday for the fifth consecutive quarter. The unemployment rate sits at the lowest level in half a century, wages are rising and Fed officials say they are raising rates to make sure price inflation remains under control.

The Fed's chairman, Jerome H. Powell, and other officials have emphasized that further rate increases would depend on the strength of the economy. In September, most Fed officials predicted it would raise rates at least three times in 2019. But the Fed's plans are increasingly uncertain because the economic outlook is increasingly uncertain. The Fed will publish a new set of policy projections on Wednesday.

Mr. Trump's trade war with China, along with concerns about global economic growth and a slowing Chinese economy, are fueling uncertainty and weighing on investors. The S&P 500 stock index fell more than 2 percent Monday, and is now down 4.8 percent for the year.

The president, who has repeatedly urged the Fed to stop raising rates, tweeted Monday that it was ""incredible"" for the Fed even to think about raising rates with ""the outside world blowing up around us.""

Mr. Trump, who has hitched his political success to a booming stock market, started chastising the Fed as the market began to decline this summer, describing the central bank in various tweets and public comments as ""crazy,"" ""loco,"" ""going wild"" and ""out of control.""

Some critics say the Fed is raising rates unnecessarily. While wages are rising more strongly, they argue that there is no evidence wage growth is causing price inflation.

Inflation is likely to fall short of the Fed's preferred 2 percent annual pace for the seventh straight year.

Rising wages can lead to inflation, if companies find the money by increasing prices. But companies also can find money by curtailing profits, giving workers a larger share of the pie without increasing inflation.

Jon Faust, now a senior adviser to Mr. Powell, warned in a 2015 paper that the central bank would need to be careful as it raised interest rates to make sure it was fighting inflation rather than protecting the profit margins of corporations and the dividends of shareholders.

""A central bank intending to lean against inflationary winds could inadvertently end up resisting secular forces toward income equality,"" wrote Mr. Faust, then an economist at Johns Hopkins University. The paper, written with Eric Leeper, was presented at the Fed's annual Jackson Hole symposium.

There are various ways to measure the share of economic output claimed by workers, but all show the same basic pattern: A sharp decline during the first decade of the present century, followed by a period of stagnation, followed by a mild recovery that began around 2015. Over the last year, however, as the Fed has raised rates, the level of the ""labor share"" has stagnated.

Julia Coronado, the president of MacroPolicy Perspectives, said she expected the Fed to take a break after raising rates Wednesday to wait for clearer evidence of inflation. ""I think that is their intention,"" she said. ""They want to pause on benign inflation and let things run strong.""

Mr. Leeper, the co-author of the 2015 paper, said in an interview that it was impossible to determine from the available data if the Fed's rate increases were weighing on wage growth. But he added that he was confident that the Fed was mindful of the difference between rising prices and falling profits -- not least because Mr. Faust now works at the Fed. ""I think you can be sure that they're carefully trying to decompose this in the way that we're talking about,"" Mr. Leeper said.

(Mr. Faust, as a Fed staff member, is subject to a ""blackout period"" before policy meetings.)

Mainstream economic models are built around the assumption that wages cannot rise faster than productivity growth without generating inflation. There is no allowance for changes in the division of economic output between workers and owners. The labor share is fixed.

Many economists continue to regard that as a reasonable approximation.

""Real income growth is dependent on productivity,"" said David W. Berson, the chief economist at Nationwide Mutual Insurance Company.

The tax cuts orchestrated by the Trump administration significantly boosted corporate profits, and corporations shared some of that money with workers. But investors were the primary beneficiaries.

""The tax cuts mean there could be a little bit there for businesses to give without having to raise prices,"" Mr. Berson said. ""But I think if productivity growth remains weak, then wage gains will be translated into price gains fully and quickly.""

Mr. Leeper said his own observation of public comments by Fed officials suggested that they did not take for granted a direct connection between wage increases and price increases.

""I think Fed people are very much accustomed to thinking outside the models, much more so than academics,"" he said.

There is some evidence to support his view in past public comments by top Fed officials.

Richard Clarida, the Fed's vice chairman, wrote about the issue in his previous life as an economist at Pimco, an investment management firm. He published a research note in 2014 charting the increases in labor share during past economic recoveries. Mr. Clarida noted that the increases were not accompanied by increases in inflation.

Mr. Clarida revisited the issue in April 2016, noting that labor share had begun to rebound without an increase in inflation. He described this as a normal pattern that should not raise concerns about inflation or corporate profits.

""Especially in a low-productivity-growth world, gains in labor's share will come, at least to some extent, out of profit growth,"" Mr. Clarida said.

Mr. Powell described the decline of labor share as ""very troubling"" during an appearance before the Senate Banking Committee in July.

He said most reasons for the decline were not under the Fed's control. But he added that the Fed had some power to help.

""The thing that we can do is to take seriously your congressional order that we seek maximum employment so in tight labor markets workers are more likely going to be paid well and paid their share,"" he said."
146,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/17/opinion/russia-2016-election-influence-trump.html,"This year, researchers at Ohio State University tried to measure the impact that fake news had on the 2016 election. They based their analysis on a postelection survey in which they'd asked voters 281 questions, three of which were intended to determine their exposure to online disinformation.

Respondents were asked to rate the accuracy of statements claiming that Hillary Clinton was suffering from a serious illness, that she'd approved weapons sales to the Islamic State as secretary of state, and that Donald Trump had been endorsed by Pope Francis. ""Belief in these fake news stories is very strongly linked to defection from the Democratic ticket by 2012 Obama voters,"" wrote the researchers, Richard Gunther, Paul A. Beck and Erik C. Nisbet. Even after controlling for variables like ideology, education, party identification and dislike of Clinton, they found that believing a fake news story made people who voted for President Barack Obama in 2012 significantly less likely to vote for Clinton in 2016.

The study's authors don't claim a clear causal link between propaganda and voting; it's possible that people who rejected Clinton were more open to misinformation about her. It's hard to believe, however, that at least some of them weren't affected by a social media ecosystem saturated with deliberate lies.

[Listen to ""The Argument"" podcast every Thursday morning, with Ross Douthat, Michelle Goldberg and David Leonhardt.]

Still, many people on both the left and the right have been skeptical of the notion that Russia's industrial-scale trolling campaign made a significant difference in Trump's election. In February, the special counsel Robert Mueller indicted 13 Russians connected to the Internet Research Agency, a Russian trolling operation based in St. Petersburg. Shortly afterward, National Review's Rich Lowry scoffed that the ""Russian contribution on social media was piddling and often laughable.""

That month, Adrian Chen, who reported on the Internet Research Agency for The New York Times Magazine, appeared to minimize its political impact in an interview on MSNBC. He called it ""essentially a social media marketing campaign with 90 people, a few million dollars behind it, run by people who have a bare grasp of the English language and not a full understanding of who they're targeting.""

At a conference in Germany in July, I met Denis Korotkov, a brave Russian journalist who has reported extensively on Yevgeny Prigozhin, the oligarch behind the troll factory, who was included in Mueller's February indictments. Speaking through an interpreter, he expressed incredulity at the idea that the misinformation being spread from St. Petersburg could have changed the direction of American history.

But it looks increasingly as though it did. On Monday, the Senate Intelligence Committee released two reports it commissioned about the nature and scale of Russia's social media disinformation campaign. One was produced by New Knowledge, a Texas cybersecurity company, along with researchers at Columbia University and Canfield Research; the other was written by researchers at Oxford University's Computational Propaganda Project along with Graphika, a company that analyzes social media. They were based on (incomplete) data turned over to Congress by several major social media platforms, and they suggest the campaign was more extensive and sophisticated than has been previously understood.

Russian propaganda, one of the reports found, had about 187 million engagements on Instagram, reaching at least 20 million users, and 76.5 million engagements on Facebook, reaching 126 million people. Approximately 1.4 million people, the report said, engaged with tweets associated with the Internet Research Agency. ""The organic Facebook posts reveal a nuanced and deep knowledge of American culture, media and influencers in each community the I.R.A. targeted,"" it said.

There is no way to quantify exactly what this barrage of disinformation and manipulation did to American politics. But it should be obvious that what happens online influences our perceptions of, and behavior in, the offline world. People have committed horrific acts of violence based on Facebook propaganda. The Islamic State has used Twitter to recruit alienated Westerners.

Looking at Israel's airstrikes on Gaza in 2012, Thomas Zeitzoff, an associate professor at American University, found that they'd significantly slow when there was a sharp uptick of online support for Hamas, an indication that the Israeli Defense Forces were monitoring their reputation on social media. So-called influencer marketing wouldn't be a billion-dollar industry if corporations didn't think social media shapes behavior.

In October 2016, Libby Chamberlain founded an invitation-only Facebook group called Pantsuit Nation as a safe space for supporters of Hillary Clinton. The fact that people felt like a such a space was necessary is testament to how intimidated a great many Clinton supporters were by the vicious climate online. ""As much as possible,"" Chamberlain told The Washington Post, her group ""removes the risk that they're going to be attacked for their views.""

Some of these attacks came from real people, but not all. In their book ""LikeWar: The Weaponization of Social Media"" -- which is where I learned about Zeitzoff's study -- P.W. Singer and Emerson T. Brooking described how, in the run-up to the election, ""anti-Clinton botnets actively sought out and 'colonized' pro-Clinton hashtags, flooding them with virulent political attacks."" These attacks helped make fervent Clinton supporters reluctant to go public online. That, in turn, created a widespread impression that Clinton lacked enthusiastic grass-roots support, which is belied by the fact that Pantsuit Nation quickly swelled to millions of members.

In an election decided by a rounding error -- fewer than 80,000 voters spread over three states -- Russian trolling easily could have made the difference. It's mortifying and preposterous that fake news ruined America. That doesn't mean it isn't true.

147,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/18/us/politics/senate-criminal-justice-bill.html,"WASHINGTON -- The Senate overwhelmingly approved on Tuesday the most substantial changes in a generation to the tough-on-crime prison and sentencing laws that ballooned the federal prison population and created a criminal justice system that many conservatives and liberals view as costly and unfair.

The First Step Act would expand job training and other programming aimed at reducing recidivism rates among federal prisoners. It also expands early-release programs and modifies sentencing laws, including some mandatory minimum sentences, to more equitably punish drug offenders.

But the legislation falls short of benchmarks set by a more expansive overhaul proposed in Congress during Barack Obama's presidency and of the kinds of changes sought by some liberal and conservative activists targeting mass incarceration.

House leaders have pledged to pass the measure this week, and President Trump, whose support resuscitated a yearslong overhaul effort last month, was expected to sign the bill.

Even as both sides acknowledged concessions, Tuesday's vote was an important first step for the unlikely coalition of liberals and conservatives -- including the American Civil Liberties Union, the American Conservative Union, Koch brothers and the liberal Center for American Progress -- who locked arms in recent years and pushed lawmakers to reconsider the way the federal government administers justice three decades after the war on crime peaked.

For Republicans preparing to relinquish total control of Washington next month, the bill's passage offered one final victory on their own terms and handed Mr. Trump a bipartisan policy achievement that he can tout as he seeks re-election. Liberals saw reason to celebrate, as well: In gaining the support of Mr. Trump and so many Senate Republicans, they believe they have shifted the terms of policy debates around criminal justice in a way that could set the stage for additional changes on the federal level and in the states.

""This bill in its entirety has been endorsed by the political spectrum of America,"" said Senator Richard J. Durbin, Democrat of Illinois, who has led the push for changes. ""I can't remember any bill that has this kind of support, left and right, liberal and conservative, Democrat and Republican.""

Senator John Cornyn of Texas, the chamber's No. 2 Republican, who as recently as last week was blocking a Senate vote, stood on the Senate floor on Tuesday to make the conservative argument for the changes, which he said would not only achieve fiscal savings but also ""human potential.""

""We're not just talking about money. We're talking about human potential,"" Mr. Cornyn said Tuesday. ""We're investing in the men and women who want to turn their lives around once they're released from prison, and we're investing in so doing in stronger and more viable communities.""

Proponents of the bill overcame an aggressive campaign by some conservatives who tried to resurrect the once-resonant charge that reducing sentences would make the United States less safe. Two Republicans, Senators Tom Cotton of Arkansas and John Kennedy of Louisiana, introduced amendments to significantly limit which types of offenders would be eligible for early-release programs and to water down other changes. All were narrowly voted down on the Senate floor on Tuesday.

Many of the changes adopted by the Senate and embraced by Mr. Trump are modeled after successful initiatives at the state level intended to reduce the costs and improve the outcomes of the criminal justice system. Congress's action would not directly effect state prisons, where the majority of the country's offenders are incarcerated, but proponents believe they could spur more states to change their laws.

Once signed into law, thousands of inmates will be eligible for immediate sentencing reductions and expanded early-release programs. Going forward, the effect will grow as thousands of new offenders receive reduced sentences and enter a changed prison system.

Broadly speaking, the First Step Act makes heavy investments in a package of incentives and new programs intended to improve prison conditions and better prepare low-risk prisoners for re-entry into their communities.

By participating in the programs, eligible prisoners can earn time credits to reduce their sentence or enter ""prerelease custody,"" such as home confinement. In recent weeks, conservative senators and law enforcement groups successfully pushed to limit some violent offenders from eligibility, including fentanyl traffickers.

The legislation would also prohibit the shackling of pregnant inmates and the use of solitary confinement for juveniles in almost all cases. The Bureau of Prisons would be required to place prisoners in facilities close to their homes, if possible.

In all, it includes four changes to federal sentencing laws. One would shorten mandatory minimum sentences for some nonviolent drug offenses, including lowering the mandatory ""three strikes"" penalty from life in prison to 25 years. Another would provide judges greater liberty to use so-called safety valves to go around mandatory minimums in some cases. The bill would also clarify that the so-called stacking mechanism making it a federal crime to possess a firearm while committing another crime, like a drug offense, should apply only to individuals who have previously been convicted.

Finally, the bill would allow offenders sentenced before a 2010 reduction in the sentencing disparity between crack and powder cocaine to petition for their cases to be re-evaluated. The provision could alter the sentences of several thousand drug offenders serving lengthy sentences for crack-cocaine offenses. That would help many African-American offenders who were disproportionately punished for crack dealing while white drug dealers got off easier for selling powder cocaine.

For the bill's supporters, Tuesday's vote was the culmination of a five-year campaign on Capitol Hill that only months ago appeared to be out of reach while Mr. Trump was in office.

Much of the same coalition that pushed the First Step Act had rallied around similar legislation, the Sentencing Reform and Corrections Act of 2015. With Mr. Obama's support, as well as that of Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, and Speaker Paul D. Ryan, Republican of Wisconsin, the more expansive bill had appeared destined for passage before Senator Mitch McConnell, Republican of Kentucky and majority leader, stepped in and refused to give it a vote in the run-up to the 2016 election.

Mr. McConnell seemed intent on denying proponents another shot this year, but they secured a powerful ally early on in Mr. Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner.

Over the course of the past year, Mr. Kushner worked with Mr. Grassley, Mr. Durbin and Senator Mike Lee, Republican of Utah, to draft a compromise that the president could back. With Mr. Trump's endorsement, the group brought a strong majority of Senate Republicans on board. By last week, under intense pressure from his own party and the White House, Mr. McConnell relented.

For Democrats and Republicans who favored greater changes, Mr. Trump's endorsement came at a cost: They had to scale back their proposed sentencing changes. The 2015 bill made all sentencing reductions retroactive to include those currently in prison, but the bill passed on Tuesday limits most of those changes to future offenders.

But by winning the support of a tough-talking, anticrime president who enjoys deep loyalty among Republican voters, the groups believe they have shifted the debate in a way that could set the stage for additional changes and elevate the criminal justice debate before the 2020 Democratic primaries."

New discoveries on Russia and the tech giants

The Senate Intelligence Committee released two huge reports on Monday that it had commissioned on Russian use of social media to disrupt the 2016 election and more. One is by New Knowledge, a cybersecurity company; the other by Oxford University researchers. Here are some highlights, both about the Russian campaign and about how tech companies have behaved toward the Senate:

African-Americans were targeted with relentless propaganda. We've heard plenty about Russian attempts to sway Facebook users who were on the political right, led by the Internet Research Agency in St. Petersburg. But the effort directed at black Americans was actually larger.

Facebook and Twitter were just the tip of the iceberg. Russian operatives on Instagram may have been as effective, or more effective, than on Facebook. They were also on Reddit, Google+, Vine, Gab, Meetup, Pinterest, Tumblr and even SoundCloud.

Tech companies did not fully cooperate with Senate investigations. Facebook withheld its users' responses to Russian-generated content; Twitter provided only scattered details about Russian-controlled accounts; and Google gave data in hard-to-analyze formats.

The disinformation campaign didn't end with the election. Facebook's ad volume from the Internet Research Agency peaked in April 2017; misleading Russian posts on Instagram in 2017 were double what they were in 2016. Renée DiResta, New Knowledge's director of research, writes that interference is ""a chronic, widespread and identifiable condition that we must now aggressively manage.""

Robert Mueller is now a popular theme. ""The Russian operatives unloaded on Mueller through fake accounts on Facebook, Twitter and beyond, falsely claiming that the former F.B.I. director was corrupt and that the allegations of Russian interference in the 2016 election were crackpot conspiracies,"" writes the WaPo.

Big Tech should expect more questions. ""The platforms may have misrepresented or evaded in some of their statements to Congress,"" the New Knowledge report says. ""It is unclear whether these answers were the result of faulty or lacking analysis, or a more deliberate evasion.""

The markets hit a low for 2018

The S&P 500 fell 2 percent on Monday, reaching its lowest point since October 2017 as concerns about growth and interest rates continued to rattle investors.

How bad is it? The sell-off, which began in early October, has now wiped out nearly 50 percent of the index's gains since President Trump was elected in November 2016. The S&P 500 is on pace for its worst annual performance since the financial crisis, and its worst December in 80 years.

Some perspective, from Matt Phillips of the NYT: ""This year's sell-off is nothing like the collapse of stocks a decade ago, when the S&P fell more than 38 percent. But in its own way, 2018 is emerging as a remarkable year for financial markets, with almost every type of investment and asset class -- stocks, bonds, commodities, even supersafe Treasurys -- posting negative or minuscule returns.""

And some consolation for wounded investors, from Bloomberg: ""Not even hindsight could have helped you make money this year.""

What's behind the plunge? Several indicators have hinted that the economy may be slowing, and investors are particularly worried that the Fed will raise interest rates tomorrow (see below). Global markets have followed Wall Street's lead, and futures tracking U.S. stocks certainly don't indicate a sudden recovery.

More on the markets: Until recently, health care shares were outperforming the wider market. Not now. Small-cap stocks fell into bear market territory. U.S. credit markets have dried up. Still, some investors see an opportunity.

CBS isn't giving Les Moonves $120 million

The company said yesterday that after reviewing information gathered by outside lawyers about allegations of sexual misconduct against Mr. Moonves, its former chief executive, he won't receive his severance package. But that's not the end of the story.

What CBS said: ""We have determined that there are grounds to terminate for cause, including his willful and material misfeasance, violation of company policies and breach of his employment contract, as well as his willful failure to cooperate fully with the company's investigation.""

What Mr. Moonves can do. ""He could still contest the CBS board's ruling and fight for his severance through arbitration,"" write Edmund Lee and Rachel Abrams of the NYT. ""He could argue the company violated the confidentiality terms of his exit agreement when the internal investigation became public.""

And CBS isn't done cleaning up the mess. ""It shouldn't have taken a media spotlight to remove a leader who had so grossly abused his power for years,"" writes Tara Lachapelle of Bloomberg Opinion. ""As CBS tries to repair its own culture and image, it has the power to influence society for the better.""

Goldman's 1MDB troubles are getting deeper

Goldman Sachs's efforts to build a reputation for scrupulous ethics are being undone by 1MDB scandal, write Matthew Goldstein and Alexandra Stevenson of the NYT.

Malaysia hit the bank with criminal charges yesterday. The government accused Goldman of defrauding investors by raising more than $6 billion for the 1MDB fund, which was supposed to benefit the country's residents but wound up enriching the company and others instead.

That could just be the start. ""The biggest threat to Goldman comes from the United States,"" Mr. Goldstein and Ms. Stevenson write. ""Goldman recently received subpoenas from New York regulators, held talks with federal prosecutors and is likely to incur billions of dollars in penalties. It is one of the most serious crises in the bank's 149-year history.""

Investors are watching. ""The bank's shares fell 2.7 percent on Monday, after news of the charges broke. Its shares are down by more than one-third since last year, reflecting both its troubles and the overall souring sentiment on Wall Street.""

Xi Jinping addresses two crowds

The Chinese president gave a well-rehearsed speech this morning to mark the 40th anniversary of some major economic reforms. It showed just how delicate a diplomatic position he's in.

For a domestic audience, he talked tough: ""No one is in a position to dictate to the Chinese people what should or should not be done. We must resolutely reform what should and can be changed, we must resolutely not reform what shouldn't and can't be changed.""

But while he's seeking a U.S. trade deal, not too tough: ""China's development does not pose a threat to any country. No matter how far China develops, it will never seek hegemony.""

And he wasn't committing himself on details. ""There will be a sense of disappointment, among both local and international investors, that Xi did not give clearer signals about the direction of future economic reform at a time when the Chinese government's commitment to market liberalization is seen to have waned,"" Tom Rafferty from the Economist Intelligence Unit told the Guardian.

Trump isn't the only one scared of rate rises

The Federal Reserve is likely to raise interest rates at the conclusion of a meeting of its policy-setting committee this week, despite resistance that is no longer confined to the White House.

The president's take: ""It is incredible,"" Mr. Trump wrote in a tweet yesterday, that ""the Fed is even considering yet another interest rate hike"" with ""the outside world blowing up around us.""

An economist's take: ""I do think that there are more risks of overtightening than there are of undertightening right now,"" Lawrence Summers, who served as President Barack Obama's chief economic adviser, told Fox Business Network yesterday.

The big fear: ""As the Fed drives up borrowing costs, there is increasing concern that the central bank is risking a return to recession, and may be preventing workers from claiming a larger share of the American pie,"" writes Binyamin Appelbaum of the NYT.

Meanwhile, the Fed is looking ahead. It's wrestling with how to say that future rate rises aren't guaranteed, the WSJ notes, without implying that they're done.

Theresa May bought herself time for Brexit

But the reprieve might not be that useful.

Mrs. May gave herself four weeks to save her Brexit deal. She rescheduled a parliamentary vote on her proposal, originally planned on Dec. 11, for the week of Jan. 14. That gives her time to seek help from E.U. leaders, in the hope of swaying lawmakers at home.

The E.U. may not play along. ""No further meetings with the U.K. are foreseen,"" Margaritis Schinas, a European Commission spokesman said, told reporters on Monday. ""On the E.U. side, we have started the process of ratification."" That's one reason preparations for a so-called no-deal exit are reportedly being increased.

Revolving door

Channing Dungey, who left ABC as head of entertainment, will join Netflix as a vice president of original content.

Whirlpool's C.E.O., Marc Bitzer, will also be its chairman.

The London Stock Exchange Group also named a new chairman: Don Robert of Experian.

Andreas Goss, the head of Thyssenkrupp's steel division, will be the C.E.O. of a new joint venture with Tata Steel.

Barclays named 85 new managing directors.

Ryan Zinke, the secretary of the Interior Department, is the second devoted cheerleader for President Trump's ill-conceived strategy of ""energy dominance"" to be ushered out the door. The first was Scott Pruitt, the administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency. Like Mr. Pruitt, Mr. Zinke leaves under a cloud of possible ethical violations. Also like Mr. Pruitt, Mr. Zinke promoted the rapid development of fossil fuels -- coal in Mr. Pruitt's case, oil and gas in Mr. Zinke's -- at a time when nearly every reputable scientist says that the world needs to produce and consume less, not more of these fuels, and swiftly replace them with carbon-free alternatives to avert the worst consequences of climate change.

Unfortunately for the environmental community, not to mention the health of the planet, there is likely to be little change in policy at Interior, just as there was no fundamental change at the E.P.A., where Andrew R. Wheeler, an industry lobbyist, replaced Mr. Pruitt. Mr. Zinke's second in command and possible successor is David Bernhardt, a former lobbyist and oil and gas man to the core.

And lest we forget, the policy is synonymous with Trump himself: His appointees in the environmental arena were chosen for their fealty to the America First energy strategy contained in a series of executive orders early in his presidency aimed at rolling back just about every useful thing President Obama had done to combat global warming and protect priceless public lands from commercial intrusion.

Despite serving less than two years, Mr. Zinke racked up an impressive number of ethics investigations. At last count, his leadership had spurred some 15 inquiries into a colorful array of purported misbehavior ranging from conflicts of interest to the misuse of taxpayer funds to violating the Hatch Act, which bars federal officials from using their position to influence elections.

Nine of the investigations have been closed -- some because Mr. Zinke was cleared, others because his department refused to cooperate. Among the probes to stall because of stonewalling was an inquiry into whether Mr. Zinke threatened a United States Senator, Alaska's Lisa Murkowski, a Republican, over her votes on health care.

Of the half dozen investigations still ongoing, one has been referred to the Department of Justice for further exploration, The Times has reported. It has not yet been made public which of Mr. Zinke's many missteps may constitute full-blown criminality, but a person familiar with the matter says it likely involves whether a potential land deal between Mr. Zinke and the energy giant Halliburton, which the department regulates, constituted a conflict of interest.

With regards to policy, Mr. Zinke has been a faithful servant of Mr. Trump's vision of energy and environmental policy, such as it is. At a very weird cabinet meeting in June of last year, at which each cabinet member went around the table lavishing praise on Mr. Trump, Mr. Zinke told the president it was ""an honor to be your steward of our public lands and the generator of energy dominance.""

Generator yes, steward no. His five-year plan for oil and gas exploration opened up vast swaths of America's outer continental shelf that had been off limits (while exempting coastal Florida as an apparent political favor to the state's Republican governor, Rick Scott, who was facing a tough re-election bid). He took special aim at Mr. Obama's last-minute plan to protect most of the Arctic's dangerous waters from further exploration. He supported Lisa Murkowski's tax amendment opening up the coastal plain of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to drilling, and on his own moved to promote exploration in the 22.8 million acres of Alaska's National Petroleum Reserve, including ecologically valuable areas that the Obama administration intended to be protected in perpetuity.

Not least, with Mr. Bernhardt as the architect, Mr. Zinke recently made it much easier for oil and gas companies to drill on millions of acres of Western lands that the Obama administration had set aside to promote the recovery of the sage grouse, a threatened bird.

Mr. Zinke had a Western swagger to him that some found appealing, but on matters of public relations he was not the sharpest knife in the drawer. When promoting various policies, he often referred to himself as a professional ""geologist,"" when in fact he had received only a long-ago undergraduate degree in geology before joining the military.

He also made an enemy late last month of the soon-to-be-chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee, Raúl M. Grijalva, an Arizona Democrat, accusing him on Twitter of being a drunk who used taxpayer money to cover up a personal scandal. Mr. Grijalva, who had earlier called on Mr. Zinke to resign, was restrained in his reaction Saturday. ""This is no kind of victory, but I am hopeful it is a genuine turning of the page,"" he wrote.

On his first day in office, Mr. Zinke rode a horse to work, in plain imitation of Teddy Roosevelt. As president, Mr. Roosevelt protected 230 million acres of American wilderness, including 18 national monuments. Ten months into his tenure as Interior Secretary, Mr. Zinke recommended the withdrawal of some two million acres from two national monuments in Utah established by Mr. Obama and Bill Clinton, the largest shrinkage of public land protection in history. He has not greatly improved on this record since.

150,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/15/opinion/sunday/trump-russia-nuclear-treaty-inf.html,"The editorial board represents the opinions of the board, its editor and the publisher. It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section.

Every American president from John F. Kennedy to Barack Obama has successfully negotiated an agreement with the Soviet Union, or the Russian federation, to reduce the threat from both countries' vast nuclear arsenals. More than a dozen treaties limiting nuclear testing, nuclear weapons, activities in outer space and missile defense have been part of this mix.

The need for such restraint is irrefutable: No weapons are more lethal and potentially more destabilizing to the world than those that have earned the moniker ""city killers.""

Although the pantheon of arms control agreements isn't perfect -- not surprising given the complexity of the weapons systems and the calculations involved in balancing risk -- they have enabled the United States and Russia for decades to manage their strategic competition without going to war.

Owing to these treaty commitments, the two powers, which still hold the vast majority of all the nuclear weapons in the world, have reduced their combined total of warheads from roughly 63,000 in 1986 to about 8,100 today. Most crucial, the agreements helped avoid nuclear conflict, even during the darkest days of the Cold War.

But that progress -- and the network of agreements that undergird it -- is now in jeopardy as President Donald Trump, and hard-line aides like John Bolton, the national security adviser for whom arms control has long been anathema, bristle at any restraints on what they call American sovereignty.

Earlier this month, the Trump administration announced plans to begin formally withdrawing from one agreement, the 1987 Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, if Russia doesn't correct a major violation -- testing and deploying a new treaty-banned missile -- within the next 60 days. The pact eliminated an entire class of weapons, some 2,692 ground-based missiles that can fly in the range of roughly 300 to 3,000 miles and their launchers.

Meanwhile, administration officials have suggested that the New Start Treaty, which has required both sides to reduce deployed nuclear warheads from a maximum of 2,200 in 2010 to 1,550 this year, may be allowed to expire in 2021, even though Russia, like the United States, is still observing it.

Mr. Trump is justified in his concern about Russia's noncompliance with the I.N.F. Treaty, as are NATO officials, who on Dec. 4, for the first time, joined the Trump administration in publicly condemning the violation.

Russian leaders have their own security concerns, since they are geographically close to several nations, including North Korea, China, India and Pakistan, that have growing intermediate-range missile forces, and because the United States has a formidable advantage in sea-based and air-launched missiles.

But unilaterally abrogating one of the most consequential arms agreements in history would be dangerous and cause new tensions with European allies who are already skeptical of Mr. Trump's commitments to the continent's security and don't want the United States to abandon the treaty.

By announcing plans to withdraw, as the president did with earlier agreements on climate change, Asian trade and Iran's nuclear program, he is again undercutting American global leadership and putting the United States in position to be blamed for the I.N.F. Treaty's collapse, rather than Russia, the actual culprit.

It would be even more harmful to let New Start, with its mandated caps on nuclear warhead deployments and valuable requirements for verification and data exchanges, unravel. Unlike the I.N.F. Treaty, New Start restrains core Russian strategic forces that could directly target the United States, not just its allies.

The Russian violation of the I.N.F. Treaty centers on an SSC-8 land-based cruise missile. American officials say it can carry nuclear and conventional warheads, is fired from a mobile launcher and has been tested at a distance of between 300 and 3,000 miles, the range prohibited by the treaty. The missiles, located in western and central Russia, are intended to intimidate Europe, especially former Soviet states aligned with the West.

But Russia so far probably has no more than 50 of them, a relatively small number. While threatening to Europe, the missile doesn't change the balance of power with the United States. And Washington has other weapons, not prohibited by the treaty, to counter it.

Which encourages speculation that the administration may be more interested in abandoning the I.N.F. Treaty so that it can deploy medium-range missiles to Asia. China is a growing threat that relies on similar missiles for 95 percent of its ground-based fleet. It also is not part of the treaty and is not restricted in its missile development. That same goes for Iran, India, Saudi Arabia, North Korea and the other six countries with fast-growing missile arsenals.

Treaties are meant to be adhered to, and if one side is cheating, then something has to be done. Until recently Russia denied it had violated the agreement at all, even though hawks in Moscow have been calling for withdrawal from it for more than a decade. Despite several attempts, the Obama administration failed to persuade Russia to return to compliance.

Given current American-Russian tensions, saving the treaty through negotiations may be a long shot. But the Trump administration has an obligation to try. Otherwise, Russia is expected to expand its medium-range missile production, menacing Europe and Asia even more.

""Abandoning the INF Treaty would be a step toward a new arms race, undermining strategic stability and increasing the threat of miscalculation or technical failure leading to an immensely destructive war,"" two of the main I.N.F. negotiators, George Shultz, the former secretary of state, and Mikhail Gorbachev, the former Soviet leader, wrote recently in The Washington Post.

""The answer to the problems that have come up is not to abandon the I.N.F. Treaty but to preserve and fix it,"" they said.

A diplomatic initiative would require a concerted NATO effort. One solution being discussed by American experts would involve Russia acceding to American inspections of the Russian cruise missiles and the Americans allowing Russian inspections of American Aegis missile defense systems based in Romania and planned for Poland. Moscow, fearing the system could be used to launch offensive intermediate-range missiles, sometimes brands it a treaty violation, but most independent experts do not.

The goal would be an agreement under which Russian inspectors periodically get to examine the Aegis system to verify that it is incapable of launching offensive cruise missiles; Russia would modify its SSC-8 cruise missile so it can't fly beyond 500 miles.

On Friday, the Russian foreign ministry said it would be willing to discuss mutual inspections with Washington, a hopeful sign.

Such an outcome would require political will and the kind of sustained multilateral diplomacy that the Trump team seems incapable of organizing. The one nuclear agreement Mr. Trump is pursuing is with North Korea, but his theatrical, incoherent approach has so far yielded only minimal, temporary gains.

Given all the developments in recent years -- wrenching political division at home; Russia's new aggression against Europe and America; threats from a rising China; missile proliferation by India, Pakistan, North Korea and Iran; other technological changes and cyber warfare -- it makes sense to rethink whether new approaches to arms control are needed or whether the old system remains sound.

One major question is at what point the United States and Russia ought to try to open talks with China and other countries armed with missiles and nuclear weapons. China and the others have resisted being drawn into such a process, at least until the United States and Russia shrink their arsenals even more.

But until some better formula is found for ensuring strategic balance and limiting the spread of the world's most lethal weapons -- until Mr. Trump at least has some plan for what comes next -- it's a dangerous mistake for him to jettison existing agreements like I.N.F. and New Start.

151,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/15/us/politics/obamacare-ruling-health-care.html,"WASHINGTON -- The decision by a federal judge in Texas to strike down all of the Affordable Care Act has thrust the volatile debate over health care onto center stage in a newly divided capital, imperiling the insurance coverage of millions of Americans while delivering a possible policy opening to Democrats.

After campaigning vigorously on a pledge to protect patients with pre-existing medical conditions -- a promise that helped return them to the House majority they had lost in 2010 -- Democrats vowed to move swiftly to defend the law and to safeguard its protections.

On the defensive, Republicans campaigning this fall promised that they too backed the health law's protections for people with pre-existing medical conditions. But the Texas ruling illustrated the fruits -- and possible perils -- of their long-running campaign, stepped up in the Trump era, to remake the judiciary through the confirmation of dozens of conservative judges, including two appointees to the Supreme Court.

The ruling, if it stands, would not only do away with coverage protections for people with pre-existing health conditions but would also strike down mandated coverage for what the law deems ""essential health benefits,"" including emergency services, maternity and newborn care, mental health and substance abuse treatment, prescription drugs and pediatric care.

But it is so sweeping that many legal analysts believe it is likely to be overturned. The Supreme Court, in a 5-to-4 decision, has already upheld the Affordable Care Act's legality. The political reaction to the Texas decision, though, is not likely to diminish anytime soon.

""This is a five-alarm fire,"" said Senator Christopher S. Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut. ""Republicans just blew up our health care system.""

Republicans were muted in their response, but Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the incoming House minority leader, appealed to Democrats to come to negotiate a successor to what he called ""an unconstitutional law.""

""President Trump has made clear he wants a solution, and I am committed to working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to make sure America's health care system works for all Americans,"" he said in a statement Saturday.

The Democrats' first step will be in the courts; aides to Representative Nancy Pelosi, the top House Democrat, said Saturday that House Democrats would move quickly to notify the Trump administration that they intended to intervene in the case. A vote on a resolution to do so is expected in the earliest days of the new Congress.

Democrats also intend to convene hearings to spotlight the sweeping impact of the Texas ruling -- and lay the groundwork for their case to reclaim the White House in 2020. If upheld on appeal, the decision could deprive an estimated 17 million Americans of their health insurance -- including millions who gained coverage through the law's expansion of Medicaid. Still others could see premiums skyrocket as price protections for pre-existing conditions lapse.

The immediate practical effect of the ruling was not clear. While the judge declared that the whole law was invalid, as Texas and 19 other states had asserted, he did not issue an injunction to stop federal officials from enforcing it, and the effects of the judgment could be delayed pending appeals.

But the timing of the decision seemed designed to maximize political reverberations. It came a day before open enrollment was to end for coverage under the health law for the coming year. Sign-ups were already expected to dip after successive blows to the law by Congress and the Trump administration. But the passage of statewide referendums last month and the election of Democratic governors could also mean coverage expansions in the coming year under the health law's Medicaid expansion.

In an email to millions of Americans on Saturday, the Trump administration tried to allay concerns caused by the court decision in the Texas case.

The case is ""still moving through the courts,"" said the message from the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. ""The marketplaces are still open for business, and we will continue with open enrollment. There will be no impact to enrollees' current coverage or their coverage in a 2019 plan.""

But Mr. Trump was in a celebratory mood, tweeting, ""Wow, but not surprisingly, Obamacare was just ruled UNCONSTITUTIONAL by a highly respected judge in Texas. Great news for America!""

In his ruling on Friday, Judge Reed O'Connor of the Federal District Court in Fort Worth struck down the law on the grounds that its mandate requiring people to buy health insurance is unconstitutional and the rest of the law cannot stand without it. The judge found that the ""myriad parts"" of the law are all interconnected. Without the mandate, he said, the rest of the law comes crashing down.

But the ruling is just the latest chapter in the tumultuous history of a law that has transformed life for millions of Americans since the measure was passed without any Republican votes and signed in March 2010 by President Barack Obama.

The decision puts Republicans in Congress into a political box. Most of them tried over and over to repeal the Affordable Care Act. And many of them survived the Democratic wave in midterm elections last month only by vowing to preserve the law's protections for people with pre-existing conditions -- protections that would be swept aside by Judge O'Connor.

""Republicans in office would mostly prefer to run away from this issue or hope it disappears before they have to deal with it legislatively,"" said Thomas P. Miller, a lawyer and health economist at the American Enterprise Institute and a critic of the law.

After struggling for eight years to come up with an alternative to the Affordable Care Act, some Republicans in Congress seemed to hope that the judge's decision would be a catalyst for cooperation, which has been virtually nonexistent to date.

""While the ruling will certainly be appealed and will not impact insurance premiums or plans for next year, we have a rare opportunity for truly bipartisan health care reform that protects those with pre-existing conditions,"" said Representative Greg Walden, Republican of Oregon and the departing chairman of the Energy and Commerce Committee.

But others were taking a wait-and-see attitude. Representative Tom Cole, Republican of Oklahoma, said in an interview Saturday that he and his colleagues would wait until they saw the outcome of the lawsuit before reacting, and dismissed the notion that the ruling would be a political boon for Democrats.

""They think they can whip people up over the health care issue; it worked well for them in the midterms,"" Mr. Cole said. ""But we are two years away from the election, and I think very seldom does something happen in this time frame that has lasting political impact.""

Friday's decision could also give a boost to liberal Democrats who won hotly contested races running as advocates of ""Medicare for all."" Even before the court decision on Friday, liberals were promising to make health care a central issue in the next presidential election.

""Democrats need to put a bright North Star in the sky for 2020 voters showing what Democrats would do with more power, and making clear that we're moving toward 'Medicare for all' as a big part of a 2020 electoral strategy,"" said Adam Green, a founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, an advocacy group. ""It seems pretty clear that the presidential nominee, whoever it is, will support Medicare for all.""

Recent polls have found that slightly more than half of Americans approve of the Affordable Care Act, with many more, across political persuasions, wanting to keep its provisions protecting people with pre-existing health conditions. But polls have also found that many Americans are unhappy with their health care and its costs, particularly drug prices, and both parties in Congress have taken note.

Under the Affordable Care Act, many people of modest means can obtain subsidies covering all of their premiums, so the insurance is essentially free. But for those whose income is too high to qualify for subsidies, the costs remain high -- a problem that the Trump administration and congressional Republicans have seized on.

Encouraging enrollment has never been a priority for Trump administration officials, and confusion caused by the court decision in Texas could further depress enrollment, which was already lagging behind last year's numbers.

From Nov. 1 to Dec. 8, about 4.1 million people had signed up for Affordable Care Act coverage through the federal marketplace. Since Nov. 1, new enrollment in the 39 states that use the federal website Healthcare.gov is down by 20 percent compared with the same period last year.

In all, 11.8 million people in all 50 states signed up for health insurance through the law's marketplaces for 2018. This year's enrollment period is now ending except for in Rhode Island, where it will end Dec. 23, and in California, Colorado, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New York and the District of Columbia, where it will end in January.

""During a year when most people don't know when the deadline is, if the only news you hear is that the A.C.A. was struck down, that is only going to hurt enrollment,"" Josh Peck, a co-founder of the group Get America Covered and the former chief marketing officer for Healthcare.gov during the Obama administration, said in an email.

The administration has slashed marketing efforts and enrollment assistance and encouraged people to buy skimpier, less expensive plans that do not meet the standards of the law. These actions, and the elimination of the law's tax penalty for not having coverage starting next year, are most likely among the reasons fewer people are signing up.

Even as enrollment in private plans under the Affordable Care Act will most likely be smaller next year, hundreds of thousands more low-income adults are expected to enroll in expanded Medicaid in five states that recently gave them the option through citizens' initiatives or legislative action. Those states are Idaho, Maine, Nebraska, Utah and Virginia. Last month's Kaiser tracking poll found that 59 percent of respondents living in the 14 states that have not yet expanded Medicaid want them to do so.

Other broadly popular provisions of the law are one that allows young people to stay on their parents' health insurance plan until they turn 26, and another that allows people to get certain types of preventive care, like vaccinations, mammograms and other types of screenings for diseases, at no charge."

Good evening. Here's the latest.

1. President Trump ordered a rapid withdrawal of all 2,000 U.S. ground troops from Syria, declaring the four-year American-led war against the Islamic State largely won, officials said. ""We have defeated ISIS in Syria, my only reason for being there during the Trump Presidency,"" the president said in a Twitter post.

He offered no details on his plans for the military mission in Syria, and there was no official announcement of the strategy from the White House.

Pentagon officials seeking to talk the president out of the decision argued that such a move would betray Kurdish allies who have fought alongside American troops in Syria -- and who could be vulnerable to an attack by Turkey. Above, in the Syrian town of Derik.

""At this time, we continue to work by, with and through our partners in the region,"" a Pentagon spokesman said in a short statement.

Mr. Trump believes that U.S. forces cannot alter the strategic balance in the Middle East and should not be there -- a view that Barack Obama fundamentally shared, our national security correspondent writes.

2. The Fed raised interest rates.

The U.S. Federal Reserve announced a widely expected quarter-point increase, and signaled that it planned to continue raising rates next year.

The Fed chairman emphasized that the national economy was relatively healthy, while saying the choppy global economy and the recent sell-off in stocks had gotten officials' attention.

The nuanced message added up to muddy guidance about the Fed's plans -- and markets didn't like it. Above, at the New York Stock Exchange.

3. Facebook shared more about you than you know.

A Times investigation found the social network gave major technology firms far more access to users' personal data than it had disclosed, effectively exempting some partners from its privacy rules.

Facebook let Spotify and Netflix read, write and delete users' private messages. It permitted Amazon to obtain users' names and contact information through their friends. In all, Facebook shared data with more than 150 companies, including The Times. Above, Mark Zuckerberg, Facebook's chief executive.

The data-sharing deals may have violated a 2011 agreement with the Federal Trade Commission that banned Facebook from sharing user data without explicit permission. Here are the five main takeaways from our investigation.

4. The Roman Catholic Church in Illinois vastly underreported the number of priests with sexual misconduct allegations against them and inadequately investigated reports of abuse, according to a scathing report from the state's attorney general.

Illinois dioceses have publicly identified 185 clergy members as having been ""credibly"" accused of child sexual abuse, the attorney general said. But her investigation found that the Catholic Church had withheld the names of more than 500 additional priests and clergy members who had been accused. Above, Cardinal Blase Cupich, the archbishop of Chicago.

The investigation found that allegations ""frequently have not been adequately investigated by the dioceses or not investigated at all.""

The report concluded that the Catholic dioceses in Illinois were incapable of investigating themselves and ""will not resolve the clergy sexual abuse crisis on their own.""

5. A stopgap spending bill that Congress is expected to pass this week would keep the government funded through Feb. 8.

It would also push a fight with President Trump, above, over billions of dollars for a border wall, to the New Year and a divided Congress.

The interim measure could pass the Senate as soon as tonight, before being taken up by the House on Thursday and sent to President Trump ahead of the midnight Friday deadline -- when funding is set to lapse for nine federal departments.

Democratic leaders in both houses said the party would support the compromise. Mr. Trump has publicly embraced shutting down the government over the wall, but White House officials signaled a softer position in the last couple days.

6. Climate change is ravaging the natural laboratory that inspired Charles Darwin.

As the world's oceans heat up, the Galápagos Islands are a crucible. And scientists are worried.

Not only do the islands sit at the intersection of three ocean currents, they are in the cross hairs of one of the world's most destructive weather patterns, El Niño, which causes rapid, extreme ocean heating across the Eastern Pacific tropics. Above, a marine iguana feeding on algae.

A Times correspondent and photographer traveled 600 miles off the coast of Ecuador to the islands, where warming waters are threatening native creatures with starvation and death.

7. Like rotting lemons and sulfur.

When Californians voted to legalize recreational marijuana, lawmakers didn't anticipate the uproar the aroma of millions of flowering cannabis plants would generate.

The plants are pungent, to put it mildly, and that's making neighbors furious.

In Sonoma County, residents are suing to ban cannabis operations. Farther north, the Mendocino County sheriff's deputy says the stench is the No. 1 complaint. And in Santa Barbara County, growers are installing odor-control systems designed for garbage dumps. Above, a grower in Santa Rosa, Calif.

""If someone is saying, 'Is it really that bad?' I'll go find a bunch of skunks and every evening I'll put them outside your window,"" one man said. ""It's just brutal.""

8. We have a reading list for tomorrow's feminists.

Children absorb stereotypes by the time they are ready for preschool. But when they read books that break gender assumptions, research has found, they reach for less stereotypical toys and broaden their future goals.

Our reporter covering gender and families suggests a dozen books for children to help.

One encourages boys to help around the house and promises: ""If you learn to work hard, you can do something cool -- fight fires, bake cakes, fly a spaceship, teach school.""

Another is the true story of woman who followed her dream of becoming a shark scientist, ignoring the people who told her to be a secretary or a housewife.

9. Penny Marshall, best known as Laverne from ABC's blue-collar duo ""Laverne & Shirley,"" died Monday at age 75.

In that role, our television critic writes, Marshall continually struck a balance between sarcasm and sweetness. She was terrific at the big physical moments the show demanded, and she let Laverne reveal the parts of herself she tried to guard.

Marshall was also the first woman to direct a feature film that grossed more than $100 million: the 1988 comedy ""Big,"" about a 12-year-old boy who magically turns into an adult, played by Tom Hanks, and then has to navigate the grown-up world. Above, on the set.

I hope you had a great, restful holiday.

Over my days off, I've enjoyed a little time back in Orange County, where I've been reading about your holiday traditions.

Mona Tehle wrote that her family always makes time for a couple hours of Lotería.

""I learned to play as a child from my Mexican grandmother and South Texas cousins, and my sons learned from my mother and their cousins,"" she said. ""Even though we are all adults now, we continue this tradition that I hope my kids will eventually pass on to their offspring.""

Tom Levy, for instance, leaves Oakland with his spouse and son, now 14, during Christmas week to go cross-country skiing in Bear Valley.

""Since I'm Jewish and we celebrate Hanukkah and downplay the Christmas stuff, we really don't mind not being at home during all that hoopla,"" he wrote.

Fred Hoffman told me that on Jan. 1, ""crowds of cold (but somewhat fit) bicyclists make the big climb to the summit of Mount Diablo,"" in the Bay Area.

But far and away, the bulk of the traditions I heard about involved food. A Christmas breakfast casserole -- with Marie Callender's cornbread mix and always Jimmy Dean sausage -- for Barbara Cohen's family. Oysters Rockefeller with champagne are an ""actually healthy and decadent"" way for Jan Newman to ring in the new year.

And, of course, lots of people wrote in to say that they eat black-eyed peas on New Year's Day.

It's a tradition that started in the South, with deep roots in African-American culture. Then, in true Californian fashion, it seems to have made it out West by tracing a variety of migration paths.

Jim Johnson said he first remembered eating black-eyed pea martinis in Texas. He's lived in California for 35 years. Denise Bachman said that her black-eyed pea tradition came with her family from New Orleans.

In any case, here's a recipe for stewed black-eyed peas from the chef Mashama Bailey of The Grey in Savannah, Ga.

154,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/18/us/politics/united-states-mexico-central-america-investment.html,"WASHINGTON -- The United States, joining an effort by Mexico, will commit to investing billions in Central America in hopes of ending the poverty, violence and drug-trafficking that are driving thousands of people in the region to undertake the difficult trek to the United States' southern border, the State Department announced on Tuesday.

Mexico's new president, Andrés Manuel López Obrador, introduced what he called a ""Marshall Plan"" last week to address the root causes of Central American migration: a $30 billion initiative to invest in the region and welcome migrants into Mexico with visas, health care and employment.

On Tuesday, the Trump administration signaled its support for the plan, saying it was committing $5.8 billion in private and public investments in Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador. Much of that amount, however, was previously committed or contingent on the identification of ""commercially viable projects.""

The promise comes amid tensions between the administration and Mexico over a caravan of migrants traveling from Central America, with President Trump pushing Mexico to allow those seeking asylum in the United States to remain in Mexico while they wait.

The United States ""welcomes the historic commitment by the government of Mexico to development in southern Mexico and to promote our shared goals with the countries of El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras,"" the State Department said in a statement. ""Furthermore, the United States also wishes to recognize Mexico's willingness to develop a framework to ensure migration occurs in a legal, orderly and safe manner.""

Although Mr. Obrador's goal of getting $30 billion in shared commitments to regional development remains far-off, Mexico welcomed the United States' announcement.

""This appears to us to be a very positive step,"" Marcelo Ebrard, Mexico's foreign minister and one of the chief architects of the regional development proposal, said shortly after the announcement by the State Department.

The Obama administration invested heavily in Central America, hoping that economic development, police training and a shared sense of commitment would stem a growing tide of migrants -- children in particular -- traveling through Mexico to get to the United States.

The programs are widely seen as successful, and American diplomats posted in the region consider them vital.

But Mr. Trump has, on occasion, threatened to end all such aid unless migration from the region ends entirely, something few diplomats see as possible.

The Trump administration has also repeatedly sought to cut foreign aid in general, only to see it restored by Congress, and there was little about Tuesday's announcement that suggested that dynamic would change. Mick Mulvaney, the White House budget director, is particularly skeptical of the value of foreign aid, and he is becoming only more powerful -- he was recently named acting White House chief of staff.

""Since President Trump took office, Congress has rejected his misguided effort to slash foreign assistance to Central America,"" Representative Eliot L. Engel, Democrat of New York, who is expected to lead the House Foreign Affairs Committee next year, said on Tuesday.

""So it should come as no surprise,"" he added, ""that Democrats in Congress are skeptical about the Trump administration's rhetorical commitment to new funding for Central America and southern Mexico to address the root causes of child migration.""

Although the United States has sought in recent weeks to reset its relationship with Mexico, the two sides remain at odds over a central priority of Mr. Trump's -- building a wall along their shared border. He has threatened to shut down the government this year if Congress does not give him $5 billion toward construction, something Mr. Trump promised repeatedly during the 2016 campaign that Mexico would pay for."
155,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/19/opinion/editorials/trump-syria-withdrawal.html,"The editorial board represents the opinions of the board, its editor and the publisher. It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section.

It was less than three months ago that John Bolton, the national security adviser, declared an expanded objective for American troops in Syria.

The goal is not just defeating the Islamic State, but also ensuring that Iranian forces leave the country, he told reporters in what seemed like an authoritative statement of official policy.

Only, as is so often the case with Donald Trump's chaotic presidency, it apparently wasn't.

On Wednesday, Mr. Trump summarily overruled Mr. Bolton and the rest of his national security team. He ordered the withdrawal of all 2,000 American ground troops from Syria within 30 days.

That abrupt and dangerous decision, detached from any broader strategic context or any public rationale, sowed new uncertainty about America's commitment to the Middle East, its willingness to be a global leader and Mr. Trump's role as commander in chief.

Soldiers have a duty to follow their leader and carry out lawful orders. But success depends on trusting that the leader knows what he's doing and where he's going.

Sending conflicting orders to soldiers on the battlefield, as Mr. Trump and his administration are doing, not only hampers morale and undermines allied forces like the Syrian Kurds, it could also risk getting American soldiers killed or wounded for objectives their commanders had already abandoned.

Even some of Mr. Trump's most ardent supporters were alarmed. ""It is a major blunder,"" a Republican senator, Marco Rubio of Florida, wrote on Twitter. ""If it isn't reversed it will haunt this administration & America for years to come.""

Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, who generally supports Mr. Trump, said he and others in the national security establishment were ""blindsided"" by the announcement. He called for congressional hearings on the decision.

This isn't the first time the president and his administration have sent mixed messages. During the 2016 campaign, Mr. Trump promised to withdraw troops from Syria and has been looking for a way do it ever since. In April, he gave the Pentagon more time to complete the mission, which since the Obama era has been strictly focused on finishing off the Islamic State. Then Mr. Bolton arrived on the job and declared that ""we're not going to leave as long as Iranian troops are outside Iranian borders, and that includes Iranian proxies and militias.""

As late as Monday, James Jeffrey, the State Department's Syria envoy, told the Atlantic Council that the United States would stay in Syria until ISIS was defeated, Iranian influence was curbed and there was a political solution to the Syrian civil war.

But on Wednesday, Mr. Trump undercut his advisers, and American interests, by reversing course and declaring in a tweet, ""We have defeated ISIS in Syria, my only reason for being there during the Trump Presidency.""

There was no attempt to use the leverage of an American withdrawal to achieve any specific political or military goal.

Mr. Trump's assertion that the Islamic State is defeated is absurd. The ability of the terrorists to strike has been significantly degraded and much of the territory they claimed for their so-called caliphate has been liberated. But the group still retains a pocket of land on the Syria-Iraq border and has roughly 20,000 to 30,000 fighters, according to military researchers. As Mr. Jeffrey said Monday, ""The job is not yet done.""

No one wants American troops deployed in a war zone longer than necessary. But there is no indication that Mr. Trump has thought through the consequences of a precipitous withdrawal, including allowing ISIS forces to regroup and create another crisis that would draw the United States back into the region.

An American withdrawal would also be a gift to Vladimir Putin, the Russian leader, who has been working hard to supplant American influence in the region, as well as to Iran, which has also expanded its regional footprint. It would certainly make it harder for the Trump administration to implement its policy of ratcheting up what it calls ""maximum pressure"" on Iran.

Among the biggest losers are likely to be the Kurdish troops that the United States has equipped and relied on to fight the Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. Turkey's president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, considers many of the Kurds to be terrorists bent on destroying his country. In recent days he has vowed to launch a new offensive against them in the Syrian border region. Mr. Trump discussed his withdrawal decision in a telephone call with Mr. Erdogan on Friday.

The American withdrawal is likely also to worry Israel, anxious about Iran's robust military presence in Syria, and Jordan, which bears a considerable burden from Syrian refugees who fled the fighting across the border.

Decisions of such consequence normally are thoroughly vetted by a president's national security advisers. But congressional lawmakers said there were no signs that any process was followed, and a senior White House official, refusing to discuss internal deliberations, said Wednesday, ""The issue here is the president made a decision.""

It's hard not to wonder whether Mr. Trump is once again announcing a dramatic step as a way of deflecting attention from bad news, in this case a torrent of legal judgments that are tightening the legal noose around him.

That would be the worst rationale for a commander in chief sworn to protect the nation and to honor the men and women who serve in uniform.

Good morning.

President Trump's first visit to American troops abroad, the consequences of his environmental policies and the vexing problem of an Irish border.

Here's the latest:

President Trump's surprise visit to Iraq

The president made his first visit to American troops stationed abroad in a combat zone. His trip, shrouded in secrecy, came less than a week after he announced plans to withdraw troops from Syria, which prompted his defense secretary Jim Mattis to resign, and from Afghanistan.

Mr. Trump told reporters at Joint Base al Asad that he had no plans to retreat from Iraq. Instead, he said, the U.S. may use Iraq as a base to carry out operations in Syria against the Islamic State.

Speaking of Trump and the military: The president received a medical exemption from service during the Vietnam War. But for 50 years, the details have been a mystery. Our reporters pieced together a possible explanation, involving a foot doctor whose landlord was Mr. Trump's father.

Other U.S. politics news: It's Day 6 of the government shutdown. Lawmakers will return to Capitol Hill to try to reopen the shuttered agencies, but Democrats and Mr. Trump are still at odds over his demand for a border wall. Here's a look at what's already in place along the southern border.

Undoing Obama's legacy on the environment

In California, farm workers are being sickened by a dangerous pesticide. In West Virginia, the largest inland waterway is being contaminated with selenium, a pollutant that can wipe out aquatic life.

These are just some of the effects of President Trump's large-scale rollback of environmental regulations over two years, which have been promoted as creating jobs, liberating businesses and helping the economy grow.

But as our reporters discovered, the policy changes are affecting the health and safety of people across the United States.

Go deeper: Mr. Trump has been working to undermine the environmental legacy of President Barack Obama. Nearly 80 Obama-era regulations have been blocked, delayed or targeted for repeal, according to our analysis. Here are some other takeaways from our investigation.

What Brexit could do to the Irish

In 1998, Ireland and Northern Ireland, which is part of Britain, signed the Good Friday Agreement that ended decades of violent conflict known as the Troubles.

Since then, people, livestock and goods have flowed freely between Ireland and Britain, both members of the E.U.

But now, Brexit threatens to bring back the old barrier.

Why it matters: A hard border could reignite hostilities and impede the vibrant trade that has fostered peace. ""It would be a real backward step,"" said one farmer in Ireland. ""Back to the Dark Ages.""

Europe's migrant crisis: 'It's an act of murder'

In November of last year, 20 people drowned while trying to get to Europe from Libya. Forty-seven others were captured by the Libyan Coast Guard and bought back to suffer abuse, including rape and torture.

A nearby ship that belonged to a German humanitarian organization, Sea-Watch, wasn't able to intervene and rescue them. A French vessel in the vicinity refrained from responding.

Our journalists produced a minute-by-minute reconstruction of the incident, working with two research groups and combining videos, radio recordings, vessel tracking data and witness testimony.

Why it matters: This case reflects a new policy in Europe -- particularly in Italy -- that has effectively outsourced migrant rescue operations to the Libyan Coast Guard, which often violates human rights.

Here's what else is happening

Ebola: In eastern Congo, where a woman recently died from Ebola, near-constant violence between government forces and militia groups have frustrated efforts to combat the second-largest outbreak of the virus, our correspondent found.

U.S.: The federal border agency has been ordered to bolster medical screenings for children after the Christmas Eve death of an 8-year-old boy from Guatemala, the second migrant child to die in custody in less than three weeks.

Stocks: The S&P 500, Dow and Nasdaq all climbed by around 5 percent, rebounding from a decline that had pushed the S&P to the brink of a bear market.

Russia: Selling property in Moscow requires an unusual piece of paperwork -- a certificate of sanity signed by a doctor.

Iran: Millions of middle-class Iranians have seen their lives shrink almost overnight, dragged down by renewed U.S. sanctions and their government's mismanagement of the economy.

India: New policies will effectively bar foreign online retailers, like Amazon and Walmart, from selling products supplied by their affiliated companies in the country, a surprise blow to e-commerce businesses.

Japan: The country announced it would resume commercial whaling in July, despite international condemnation.

Thailand: The military government approved a measure that would allow medicinal marijuana starting next year. Thailand would be the first Southeast Asian country to take that step.

Back Story

The Yellow Vests are not the first rebel group in French history to be named after the outfits of the resistance.

Fashion has played a significant role in the heritage, economic development and identity of France, and dress has often signaled and symbolized change.

In the late 18th century, during the French Revolution, a significant component of the uprising sported working-class pantalons -- basically trousers -- instead of the fancy knee breeches, or culottes, worn with heels and stockings by the male aristocracy. The insurgents have gone down in history as ""without breeches,"" or sans-culottes.

In 1968, France's student rebellions against capitalism and American imperialism (among other isms) redefined associations with berets, turtlenecks, boots and tartan.

In both cases, the visual messaging communicated allegiance as effectively as any slogan or protest poster -- and became exports as successful as Brie and Champagne.

157,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/19/us/politics/trump-national-security-tariffs.html,"President Trump has weaponized tariffs to upend the global rules of international trade -- but can his policies withstand the peanut butter test?

On Wednesday, a three-judge panel, deliberating in a federal courtroom in Lower Manhattan, considered the most far-reaching legal challenge to the president's aggressive use of national security to justify placing levies on steel and aluminum imports from Europe as well as Canada, Mexico, China and other nations.

The case, filed by an alliance of steel importers, revolves around an important constitutional question: whether a provision of United States trade law, known as Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act of 1962, gives the president too much power over taxes and tariffs -- powers that the founding fathers explicitly granted to Congress.

Mr. Trump has utilized Section 232 to impose tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum after a Commerce Department investigation determined the metals pose a threat to national security by degrading the American industrial base. Mr. Trump has also initiated investigations into whether imports of uranium, as well as autos, pose a national security threat and should somehow be limited.

Judge Claire R. Kelly of the United States Court of International Trade quickly cut to the heart of the matter, asking the Trump administration's legal team if it could think of a single product or service that the president did not have the authority to tariff in the name of national security.

""Could he, say, put a tariff on peanut butter?"" Judge Kelly asked, peering over her glasses.

Tara Hogan, the Department of Justice lawyer handling the case, declined to answer the question in yes-or-no fashion. Instead, she countered with a lengthy explanation of the process, which includes a Commerce Department investigation, required to determine if anything, even peanut butter, was a substance necessary to preserve national security.

""O.K. But I did not hear an answer on the peanut butter,"" said Alan B. Morrison, a George Washington University Law School professor who argued on behalf of the plaintiffs.

The constitutional challenge is considered something of a long shot in legal circles because the Supreme Court almost never overturns a congressional decision to delegate power to the executive branch.

""There are very few cases, but the precedents all suggest that Congress can delegate this authority to the president, and he has a wide discretion when it comes to issues of national security,"" said Mark Wu, a professor at Harvard Law School who studies international trade issues. ""The question here is whether the court is going to use this case to demarcate any limits on what the president can do when it comes to tariffs.""

Still, the issues raised in the case -- the widening use of national security concerns to justify trade barriers -- were deemed important enough to warrant the appointment of the three-judge panel, the first time the court has assigned more than a single judge to a trade case since 2005.

""It would be the first time since the early New Deal era that courts ruled that Congress went too far in delegating its lawmaking powers,"" Todd N. Tucker, a political scientist with progressive Roosevelt Institute, wrote this year on the Lawfare website. ""This is but the latest way that Trump's aberrant behavior is prompting reactions that undermine longstanding norms.""

The trade law's provision has been used previously -- before Mr. Trump took office, there had been 26 investigations into whether imports pose a risk to American national security. In six of those cases, the president imposed a trade action, such as quotas, according to the Congressional Research Service.

But, according to Ms. Hogan, no president had used Section 232 to impose tariffs before Mr. Trump placed tariffs of 25 percent and 10 percent on steel and aluminum imports this past spring.

In June, the American Institute of International Steel, an association of companies that trade with the affected countries, filed a lawsuit attacking the law itself, after a legal challenge to Mr. Trump's authority to use it was dismissed this year.

""We are challenging the law because no president before Trump ever used the law like this,"" Mr. Morrison said. ""The law has an opening, and he has taken advantage of it. There are no limits on what he can do.""

The judges in the case, all appointed by President Barack Obama, seemed to acknowledge the constraints placed on them by Supreme Court precedents, including the landmark 1976 case FEA v. Algonquin SNG Inc., which upheld the broad use of national security as a justification to impose quotas and licensing fees on imports.

But they also questioned specific provisions of the 1962 law granting the executive branch nearly unfettered authority to impose tariffs or fees on trading partners, especially the exemption of presidential decisions from judicial review.

And they quickly moved beyond hypothetical peanut butter scenarios to the national security justifications for the aluminum and steel tariffs.

Judge Gary S. Katzmann grilled Mr. Trump's lawyers repeatedly about a letter from Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, which supported the administration's efforts to limit imports but said the action should be aimed more squarely at China, rather than at allies like Canada. Mr. Mattis, in the memo, said imports of steel and aluminum accounted for a negligible percentage of materials used in the production of military hardware.

""I'm scratching my head about your rationale,"" he said.

It is not clear when the court will decide in the case. Both sides have suggested they will appeal directly to the Supreme Court if they lose."
158,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/21/sports/mlb-cuba.html,"When Major League Baseball announced on Wednesday that it had reached a historic agreement with the Cuban baseball federation to legalize the orderly signing of Cuban players, officials with the league knew the deal still required government approval.

But those same officials, barely three hours after the announcement, were stunned by the swift and vehement objections in a White House statement to a deal the league and the players' union had been working on for years.

M.L.B. thought it had been operating on safe legal grounds when it made the agreement with Cuba, but it started receiving mixed signals from Washington toward the end of the process, especially in the 24 hours before the league's announcement.

The United States government could still quash the deal, and some in the administration appear strongly opposed to it. But baseball officials remain optimistic, knowing they have a few arrows in their quiver, including a long list of American companies already doing business in Cuba.

According to two baseball officials familiar with the issue, no one in the United States government has told the league to halt work on the deal, and M.L.B. and the players' union are operating as if it will pass government scrutiny. The officials were not authorized to speak publicly about the agreement.

Under the plan, the Cuban baseball federation would release players to M.L.B. in return for a percentage of their contracts, an approach similar to the posting system used by Japanese and South Korean teams. The purpose of the agreement is to end the human trafficking of Cuban players to the United States and Canada.

But the United States maintains a trade embargo with Cuba, and it has been strengthened in certain ways under the Trump administration. At least three branches of government oversee interactions with Cuba: the State Department, the Treasury Department and the National Security Council.

The thrust of the new regulations is to prohibit entities from doing any business in Cuba that benefits its military and security services. Under Olympic rules, the Cuban baseball federation is required to be independent of the central government.

M.L.B. plans to file a brief with the United States Office of Foreign Assets Control, asserting that the league was already granted legal approval to negotiate a deal to pay transfer fees to the Cuban federation for its players.

M.L.B. obtained the license to do business with the Cuban baseball federation from the Office of Foreign Assets Control in September 2016, under the Obama administration. The league is relying on a national security presidential memorandum published on June 16, 2017, that outlined the Trump administration's new policy toward Cuba and new regulations governing American interests in the country. A fact sheet augmenting the memo said, ""The forthcoming regulations will be prospective and thus will not affect existing contracts and licenses.""

On Wednesday, a White House statement criticized baseball's agreement with Cuba, saying the administration would continue to restrict Cuba's ability to profit from American businesses.

The Office of Foreign Assets Control could revoke M.L.B.'s license to negotiate with the Cubans. If it does, it would signal a shift in policy that could affect many other companies doing business in Cuba.

Companies including American Airlines, JetBlue, Delta and Western Union, plus several United States telecommunications companies and cruise ship lines, operate in Cuba, and the amount of money those entities pour into the Cuban economy dwarfs what M.L.B. would most likely pay in transfer fees to the baseball federation. Most of the players remaining in Cuba are not thought to be stars or top prospects who would garner huge salaries.

But because M.L.B. has an especially high profile, its Cuban agreement may be subject to more government scrutiny.

M.L.B. may continue to lobby members of the administration and Congress. The league has a legislative action committee that includes Yankees President Randy Levine, who has known President Trump for years and was recently said to be a candidate to replace John F. Kelly as the White House chief of staff. M.L.B. Commissioner Rob Manfred could also seek to speak directly to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo.

If the agreement is scuttled, Cuban players who choose to defect probably would continue to be smuggled out. Several Cuban-born players in the major leagues have detailed harrowing tales of their escapes in dangerous sea voyages, and some say they continue to face extortion demands from smugglers even after arriving in the United States.

""To this date, I am still harassed,"" first baseman Jose Abreu, who has played for the Chicago White Sox since 2014, said in a statement on Wednesday.

While waiting for government approval, M.L.B. and the players' union still have work to do on the details of the pending agreement -- including the specifics of how players would be posted and how scouts would be allowed to evaluate players."
159,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/28/us/native-american-education.html,"This article was reported and written in a collaboration with ProPublica, the nonprofit investigative journalism organization.

WOLF POINT, Mont. -- The faint scars on Ruth Fourstar's arms testify to a difficult life on the Fort Peck Indian Reservation: the physical and emotional abuse at home, the bullying at school, the self-harm that sent her rotating through mental health facilities and plunged her to a remedial program from the honor roll.

A diploma from Wolf Point High School could be a ticket out of this isolated prairie town in eastern Montana. Instead, Ms. Fourstar, 17, sees her school as a dead end.

The tutoring she was promised to get her back on track did not materialize. An agreement with the high school principal to let her apply credits earned in summer courses toward graduation fell through, Ms. Fourstar said. The special education plan that the school district developed for her, supposedly to help her catch up, instead laid out how she should be disciplined.

Her family fears that she will inflict the pain of not graduating on herself.

""I'm just there,"" Ms. Fourstar said. ""I feel invisible.""

Her despondency is shared by other Native students at Wolf Point and across the United States. Often ignored in the national conversation about the public school achievement gap, these students post some of the worst academic outcomes of any demographic group, which has been exacerbated by decades of discrimination, according to federal reports.

The population is also among the most at risk: Underachievement and limited emotional support at school can contribute to a number of negative outcomes for Native youths -- even suicide. Among people 18 to 24, Native Americans have the highest rate of suicide in the nation: 23 per 100,000, compared with 15 per 100,000 among white youths.

Citing these factors, in 2014, the Obama administration declared Native youths and their education to be in a ""state of emergency.""

While the Interior Department's Bureau of Indian Education runs about 180 Native-only schools, more than 90 percent of Native students attend integrated public schools near or on reservations, like Wolf Point. A wealth of rarely tapped data documents their plight.

In public schools, white students are twice as likely as Native students to take at least one advanced placement course, and Native students are more than twice as likely to be suspended, according to an analysis of federal civil rights data conducted by ProPublica and The New York Times. Native students also score lower than nearly all other demographic groups on national tests, and only 72 percent of Native students graduate, the lowest of any demographic group.

A Second Chance for Prisoners, and Their WardenAs a school board member in Wolf Point, Mont., Ron Jackson couldn't help struggling Native American students as much as he hoped. Now some of them are his inmates.Dec. 28, 2018

In Wolf Point, the academic disparities between Native students and other groups are even wider, federal data shows. White students are more than 10 times as likely to take at least one advanced placement class as their Native peers.

Native students are twice as likely to receive at least one suspension, mirroring a national trend. Wolf Point's Native students also struggle academically: only 65 percent were proficient or better in reading, compared with 94 percent of their white peers, and only 8 percent were proficient or better in math, compared with about half of the white students, according to the most recent state assessment data from the 2013-2014 school year. Only half of Wolf Point's Native students graduate from high school, compared with about three-quarters of their white peers.

In June 2017, the Tribal Executive Board of Fort Peck filed a civil rights complaint with the Department of Education's Office for Civil Rights requesting a federal investigation into the tribe's contention that the Wolf Point school system discriminates against Native students.

""The discrimination is so ingrained that people think that's just the way things are,"" said Melina Healey, the lawyer representing the tribal board on the complaint.

According to the complaint and to interviews with dozens of students and families, Wolf Point schools provide fewer opportunities and fewer social and academic supports to Native students, who make up more than half of the student body, than to the white minority. The junior and senior high schools, which together have an enrollment of about 300, shunt struggling Native students into a poorly funded, understaffed program for remedial and truant students, often against their will.

On the school's basketball court, a coach has used derogatory slurs, such as ""prairie Indians"" and ""dirty Indians,"" in front of Native students, according to the tribal board's complaint. Native students were dropped from sports teams after giving birth, while white students were not, a violation of federal law. The complaint did not name the coaches, but the coach at the time denied the accusations.

In the most extreme cases, discouraged students have turned to suicide, the complaint states. Three months before the complaint was filed, a Wolf Point junior took his own life during school hours shortly after being berated by the principal for poor attendance, two students say. Nearly a fifth of Native high school students in Montana reported that they attempted suicide at least once in a year -- more than double the rate of white students, according to a Montana education agency survey from 2017.

""The district not only demonstrates indifference to but actually inflames Native students' vulnerability to self-harm,"" the tribes' civil rights complaint states.

Rob Osborne, who has been the superintendent of Wolf Point's school district for two and a half years, said he has read the board's complaint three times but is not familiar enough with its contents to comment. He sees no purpose in comparing how the district treats Native and white students.

""I'm not going to get into this Native American thing,"" he said. ""All I'm trying to do is make sure all our kids have a quality education. And is there some discontent up there? Yeah, probably.""

The Education Department has not opened an investigation into the complaint, a year and a half after it was filed. A senior official for the department said it was under evaluation.

Jeana Lervick, a lawyer representing Wolf Point schools, declined to respond to specific questions, which she said alluded to ""rumors"" and made ""many inaccurate assumptions.""

""Wolf Point Schools works constantly to address the challenges facing our students and, in particular, our Indigenous students,"" she said. ""Our district is aware of historical issues in our nation and as educators do everything in our power to address them.""

A long history of failure.

Since passage of the Indian Education Act in 1972, Congress has tried to give tribes more resources and responsibility for educating their children. But most schools that serve Native youths remain under the authority of states and municipalities, which have historically rejected tribal input and insisted on control over curriculum, funding and staffing.

The Obama administration instituted initiatives on Native education, such as grants to strengthen partnerships between tribes, states and school districts. The new federal education law, the Every Student Succeeds Act, or ESSA, requires states to consult with tribes about education plans.

After President Barack Obama visited with students in June 2014 on the Standing Rock Indian Reservation in the Dakotas, a report from his administration called for remedies to a ""long history"" of ""deeply troubling and destructive federal policies.""

The report stated that ""the specific struggles that Native youth face often go unmentioned in our nation's discussions about America's children, and that has to change.""

Then the White House led a listening tour to gather testimony from Native families and educators. In Los Angeles, a Native school official said limited funds led to cutbacks in Native language and cultural programs at her school. In Anchorage, a Native student said a school staff member addressed her as ""squaw,"" an offensive term. In Oklahoma City, federal officials heard about how a ""Redskins"" high school mascot led students to create posters alluding to skinning opponents and sending them ""home on a 'trail of tears.'""

""I think the sensitivity to different cultures, sometimes it ends with Native people,"" said Ron Lessard, who has been the acting executive director of the White House Initiative on American Indian and Alaska Native Education since 2017.

Last year, the Education Department concluded a nearly four-year investigation into a complaint filed by the Wiyot Tribe, alleging discrimination in the Loleta Union Elementary School District in rural Northern California. The investigation found that the school's principal called Native students a ""pack of wolves"" and grabbed and hit them, and it found that Native students were denied special education services and received harsher discipline than whites. The district agreed to change its policies.

This year, a federal judge ruled that a lawsuit could proceed against the government on behalf of Native American students at Havasupai Elementary School, near Grand Canyon National Park. The complaint said the school, run by the Bureau of Indian Education, was persistently understaffed, lacked a functioning library and adequate textbooks, and provided inadequate special education services. Because of ""excessive exclusionary discipline,"" some students barely attend classes.

But Betsy DeVos, the education secretary, scaled back the Obama administration's emphasis on investigating claims of systemic civil rights violations, and the future of complaints based on wide disparities like those seen in Wolf Point remains uncertain.

Liz Hill, a spokeswoman for the Education Department, said that Ms. DeVos was ""keenly aware"" of the challenges facing Native students and has been aggressive in holding federal schools accountable for improving their education. In March, the department withheld funds from the Bureau of Indian Education because the agency had not complied with ESSA, according to a letter sent by the department.

""The Obama administration produced several reports and blueprints on Indian education reform, but very little changed under their watch,"" Ms. Hill said.

In 1886, Washington designated Fort Peck, a remote area now composed of two million acres of Montana's northeastern plains, to the Assiniboine and Sioux tribes. It also agreed to educate the tribes' youth.

Initially, that meant forcing Fort Peck's parents to send their children to boarding schools on and off the reservation. Native children had their hair chopped off, their traditional garments replaced with uniforms and their names westernized. Students were disciplined for speaking their languages and practicing their rituals.

""The federal government created a policy to culturally annihilate us,"" said Diana Cournoyer, the interim executive director of the National Indian Education Association, an advocacy organization.

In the early 20th century, white homesteaders pressured the federal government to open up unused lands of Fort Peck to non-Native settlement. Many white farmers put down roots around the town of Wolf Point.

The settlers' children and some mixed-race children attended Wolf Point's public schools. By the 1920s, Native students joined them and gradually became the majority of Wolf Point's enrollment. Yet white residents continued to hold nearly all of the seats on the school board, responsible for all major educational policy and staffing decisions.

Dana Buckles, a member of the Tribal Executive Board since 2012, attended school in Wolf Point, where he was pegged as an ""instigator"" in the 1960s for questioning why the Native students were seated in the back of the classrooms.

Even when his children went through the Wolf Point schools decades later, Mr. Buckles said, ""they were getting rid of Indian kids because they didn't want to deal with them.""

In August 2013, seven Native residents sued the Wolf Point School District, saying that political boundaries were carved to give the minority white voters outsize power. Seven months later, a consent decree was signed to remedy the district's unjust voting lines. Today, three of the six board members are Native residents or of Native descent.

Still, only 18.5 percent of school staff members are Native, according to a 2014 report, although more than three-fourths of Wolf Point's students are Native American or mixed. The high school principal and the superintendent are white.

""Broken promises -- that's all you get from the school.""

Last August, in a steamy yellow school bus turned food truck, Albert Schafer prepared burgers, hot dogs and fry bread for hungry customers at Wolf Point's Wadopana celebration, one of the oldest traditional powwows in Montana. The four-day festival draws hundreds of Native families bedecked in traditional dancing costumes to a pavilion where they sing and drum into the night.

Mr. Schafer, 32, dropped out of Wolf Point High School, feeling warehoused in a classroom for students with special needs. ""It seemed like I was wasting their time, and they didn't want to teach me what I needed,"" he said, adding that his daughter Claudia Schafer helps him read and write.

Ms. Schafer also struggled at Wolf Point High School. Last year, she transferred to a school about 20 miles away in Poplar, Mont., where nearly all of the students are Native.

Like the Schafers, multiple generations of Native families have floundered in Wolf Point's schools.

Ms. Fourstar's grandmother, Louella Contreras, dropped out of a Wolf Point school in ninth grade. She went on to earn her high school equivalency diploma and a bachelor's degree in business management from the University of Mary in Bismarck, N.D. For about 15 years, she has worked for the Fort Peck Housing Authority.

Ms. Contreras's second job has been advocating support services for her two grandchildren. She became their guardian after taking them from an abusive household eight years ago.

In eighth and ninth grade, Ms. Fourstar was hospitalized four times for post-traumatic stress. She was also cutting herself. Her grades plummeted to F's and D's, after being high enough to earn her a spot on the honor roll. At the end of eighth grade, as she recovered in a treatment center in Albuquerque, Ms. Contreras begged school officials for accommodations to help her granddaughter when she returned. Ms. Fourstar never got the help she was promised, her family said, and still struggles in classes.

""Broken promises -- that's all you get from the school,"" Ms. Fourstar said.

One year after Ms. Contreras requested it, the school drafted a formal education plan that was supposed to help Ms. Fourstar academically. Instead, it set out disciplinary procedures for slow learning. Its solution: Ms. Fourstar would have ""approximately five minutes to make a choice"" on tasks and questions or face an in-school suspension.

""Ruth has come a long way,"" Ms. Contreras said, ""and it's not because of the school.""

When reached by phone, the principal of Wolf Point High School, Kim Hanks, referred questions to the superintendent. Ms. Lervick, the lawyer representing the school, declined to comment on the principal's actions.

One of the few places where Ms. Fourstar has flourished at the high school is the Opportunity Learning Center, an ""alternative"" program with more than 50 students -- about 95 percent of them Native. They spend a couple of periods to most of the school day there.

Cookie Ragland, the program's director and only full-time staff member, is white and grew up just west of the reservation. She has devoted her career to students who ""don't fit into mainstream, traditional educational classrooms"" and was drawn to Wolf Point in 2003 because it had the only alternative program in northeastern Montana.

She soon found that the program ""was designed to punish those students that didn't comply with the rules of traditional education,"" she said.

""They should be given other choices before they get to me,"" Ms. Ragland added.

She said the town used Wolf Point's official dogcatcher and his van to take students with behavioral problems home, a practice that has since ended.

For her classroom, Ms. Ragland procured a refrigerator, which she stocked with sandwich supplies, and a washer and dryer for students who did not have homes. She allowed Native students to earn a biology credit for going fishing and bringing back their catch to dissect. She spurned worksheets and encouraged students to do research papers on topics that interested them.

In recent years, though, the school administration has given Ms. Ragland ""little financial or other support,"" according to the tribal board's complaint. It has ordered her to stop developing Native-centered curriculums and taking students on field trips. At one point, it required learning center students to enter the school through a back door.

Because she considers the school ""toxic,"" she said, she encourages some Native students to take a nontraditional path to graduation, such as a training program called Job Corps or the Montana Youth Challenge Academy.

Ms. Ragland's approach has been criticized by parents who say that steering students toward outside programs can set them back even further, and by some Native students who say Ms. Ragland appears to have lower expectations for them.

""I'm not saying I'm a miracle worker,"" she said. ""I've lost students, and there are students that aren't happy with me. I try to be consistent and fair, but I'm not perfect.""

Native hopelessness and a tragic solution: teen suicide.

Despair can be deadly.

Jayden Joe, a once gregarious honor roll student who devoured math workbooks and dreamed of becoming a teacher, began to withdraw from friends after his father died from liver cancer in August 2010. Mr. Joe had prayed every night for his father to receive a transplant; when it did not happen, he blamed himself. His grades at Wolf Point High School plummeted, and he was steered into Ms. Ragland's remedial program.

""My son was pushed to the side,"" said his mother, Michelle Barsness.

Like many Native parents on the reservation did with their own children, Ms. Barsness spoke with her son about suicide.

""That's the chicken-shit way out, Mom,"" she said Mr. Joe told her.

By the winter of his junior year, he seemed to be doing better. He had a steady job as a chef at the local diner, the Old Town Grill. He had recently earned a $2 an hour raise, and had saved $700 toward a used Chevrolet Monte Carlo. He planned to go to a culinary program in Arizona after graduation. But he struggled to stay on track at school.

When Angeline Cheek, an advocate for Native students in Wolf Point's schools, saw his name on a tribal court list of truants in March 2017, she told the school's guidance counselor that Mr. Joe needed immediate help. According to Ms. Cheek, the counselor said, ""I'll follow up on it if I have time. I have a lot of things I have to do.""

As the high school's only guidance counselor, she was responsible for about 200 students. The counselor, who retired this past year, would not respond to questions by phone or email. The district declined to answer questions about her work.

Twenty-four hours later, in a heated hallway exchange, the high school principal, Ms. Hanks, reprimanded Mr. Joe for missing class and warned him that his graduating was in jeopardy.

Mr. Joe ""was asking if he could do anything,"" said a classmate, Ayanna Archdale. ""He looked upset.""

A broad-shouldered 17-year-old with a mop of thick, dark brown hair, Mr. Joe walked home at lunchtime and took his mother's truck to Borge Park, a teenage hangout a mile away from his school. He parked next to a baseball diamond, put the muzzle of a .22 rifle borrowed from his grandfather to his head, and pulled the trigger. Three of Mr. Joe's friends found his body lying face down in the parking lot.

Ms. Barsness learned at a suicide awareness training session that teenagers typically kill themselves within a half-hour of deciding to do it.

""So half an hour before my son did it, where was he? He was at school,"" she said.

Ms. Hanks later expressed concern that her scolding may have contributed to Mr. Joe's death. After getting the news, she called Nadine Adams, the mother of one of Mr. Joe's best friends.

""I hope it's not because of what I told him,"" Ms. Hanks said, according to Ms. Adams. She urged Ms. Adams to keep an eye on her own daughter and her daughter's boyfriend, Ms. Adams said. Ms. Hanks did not respond to repeated email requests for comment about her conversations with Mr. Joe and Ms. Adams.

Over the years, tribal members have criticized Wolf Point schools for not doing more to prevent suicide. In 2010, Dalton Gourneau, a senior at Wolf Point High School, shot himself hours after he was suspended from athletic activities and his appeal to administrators was rejected.

His mother, Roxanne Gourneau, a former judge, sued the school district, contending that the school did not appropriately handle the hours leading up to his death. The Montana Supreme Court ruled in 2013 that the school district could not be held responsible for an ""unforeseeable"" suicide. The district supported the court's finding that connecting discipline at the school to her son's death was ""speculation.""

But Ms. Gourneau tried to help other teenagers. As a member of the tribal executive board, she helped create the position of liaison for Native students and secure $3.68 million in 2016 to expand mental health screening and to train community members to identify youths at risk for suicide.

Suicide remains a scourge. During Ms. Ragland's 15 years in the Wolf Point schools, the district has averaged about one suicide a year, she said. In the past few years, she said, she has filled out the paperwork for several state grants to help her address Native students' trauma. But the high school principal and district superintendent did not have the time or the interest to sign off, and her proposals were shelved, Ms. Ragland said.

Dale DeCoteau, a suicide prevention coordinator for the reservation's health department, said Wolf Point High School ""can have some big barriers and cause hopelessness.""

A Native advocate is shown the door.

Filling the job that Ms. Gourneau helped establish, Ms. Cheek, a Lakota educator and community organizer, was hired in 2016 as a Native student advocate for a half-dozen schools on the west end of the Fort Peck reservation.

She tried to make school more tolerable. She gave students awards, like T-shirts and gift bags, to motivate them to stay in school and excel. She introduced them to Native cultural events, like local dance and drumming groups. She invited representatives from the American Civil Liberties Union to Wolf Point to educate families about their rights, and she helped create a Native parent advocacy group.

""Students would cry because they felt mistreated,"" Ms. Cheek said.

The administration did not welcome her initiatives. She was told that she also had to give rewards to white students. (She did not.) She was given a public bench in the hallway to speak with students about sensitive issues like abuse and pregnancy. When she referred Native students to high school counselors, she said, she was frequently brushed off.

""I started to feel like the students,"" she said.

Distraught after hearing about Mr. Joe's death, Ms. Cheek asked the high school counselor if she had followed up on her urgent request to check in on him. She had not, Ms. Cheek said. About a week later, the superintendent, Mr. Osborne, banned Ms. Cheek from the district's schools.

In a complaint to the tribe's education director, Mr. Osborne wrote that Ms. Cheek had a ""negative attitude towards our school district, staff, putting parents and school district against each other and critical of how the district handled the tragic loss of one of our students without knowing all the facts.""

The education director fired her, accusing Ms. Cheek of disrespect toward Wolf Point administrators.

Much as white authorities suppressed Native culture for generations, the schools hinder Native students from succeeding and forming the next generation of tribal leadership, Ms. Cheek said.

""History is repeating itself,"" she said.

Mr. Osborne referred questions to Ms. Lervick, who declined to say whether Ms. Cheek's ouster was related to Mr. Joe's suicide.

Over her grandmother's objections, Ms. Fourstar wants to complete her high school education at a Native boarding school in Oregon. She sees the faraway school as the only way out of Wolf Point and the issues plaguing her community.

She wants to study psychology to help Native children overcome similar challenges.

""I feel like I have to get away from here to see what I can do,"" Ms. Fourstar said.

To Ms. Contreras, boarding schools are a symbol of the government's long campaign to eradicate Native culture. She wants her granddaughter to achieve what she did not: a diploma from Wolf Point High School.

For that to happen, she realized, the school must pay more attention to Native students. Unwilling to wait for a federal response to the tribes' complaint, Ms. Contreras filed a separate complaint with the Education Department on her granddaughter's behalf in October 2017, prompting the department to open an investigation into the school's treatment of Ms. Fourstar.

""I do not want my granddaughter to be another suicide statistic,"" she wrote."
160,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/03/us/politics/jim-webb-defense-secretary.html,"WASHINGTON -- The Trump administration is considering Jim Webb, a former Democratic senator and Reagan-era secretary of the Navy, to be the next defense secretary, according to three officials, potentially bypassing more hawkish Republicans whose names have been floated to replace Jim Mattis.

Mr. Webb, an outspoken opponent of the Iraq war, is being considered as President Trump seeks to carry out campaign promises to withdraw American troops from Syria and Afghanistan.

Those two decisions prompted Mr. Mattis to resign late last month, putting the deputy defense secretary, Patrick M. Shanahan, a former Boeing executive, in the top role in an acting capacity.

Representatives for Vice President Mike Pence and Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff, have reached out to Mr. Webb, one of the three officials said. Separately, a senior Defense Department official confirmed that Mr. Webb's name had been circulating at the White House. Those two and the third official all spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe the internal discussions.

Mr. Webb did not respond to a request for comment.

The views of Mr. Webb, a former one-term Democratic senator from Virginia and candidate during the 2016 Democratic presidential primaries, align closely with Mr. Trump's drive to pull American troops from the Middle East and confront China more aggressively.

During a Democratic primary debate in 2015, Mr. Webb railed against Beijing's actions in the South China Sea and cyberattacks on Americans.

""If you want a place where we need to be in terms of our national strategy, a focus, the greatest strategic threat that we have right now is resolving our relationship with China,"" Mr. Webb said.

Much like Mr. Trump, Mr. Webb was also critical of President Barack Obama's efforts in 2015 to strike a deal to curtail Iran's nuclear program. ""The end result of this could well be our acquiescence in allowing Iran to develop a nuclear weapon,"" Mr. Webb said.

Mr. Webb, now 72, graduated from the Naval Academy in 1968 and served in Vietnam as a Marine rifle platoon and company commander. He was wounded twice and awarded the Navy Cross, a prestigious award that ranks just below the Medal of Honor, along with other valor awards.

In a 1979 opinion article in Washingtonian magazine titled ""Women Can't Fight,"" Mr. Webb wrote that allowing women into the military -- specifically in combat positions -- would harm national defense. The article would haunt him throughout his political career, despite his changing views on the subject.

The Pentagon opened all combat jobs to women during the Obama administration. But Mr. Trump has not vigorously supported the policy, and even Mr. Mattis said the ""jury is out"" on whether women should be put into combat roles.

""This is a policy that I inherited, and so far the cadre is so small, we have no data on it,"" Mr. Mattis said in remarks to officer candidates at the Virginia Military Institute in September.

Ronald Reagan appointed Mr. Webb first as an assistant secretary of defense and, in 1987, as secretary of the Navy, where he pushed for modernizing the fleet and opening more jobs for women in the service. Between his stints in government, Mr. Webb continued his writing career, which includes the critically acclaimed Vietnam War novel ""Fields of Fire."" He switched parties and in 2006 ran for the Senate as a Democrat; there, he helped pass the post-9/11 G.I. Bill and oversaw Asia-Pacific issues on the Foreign Relations Committee.

Other names that have surfaced as potential replacements for Mr. Mattis have included a former Republican senator, Jim Talent of Missouri, and two current ones, Tom Cotton of Arkansas and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina. David H. Petraeus, the retired Army general and former C.I.A. director, was considered for the post earlier in the Trump administration but recently told the BBC that he ""cannot envision returning to government at this time.""

Last week, Mr. Trump said Mr. Shanahan might remain as acting secretary ""for a long time.""

On Wednesday, his second day as Pentagon chief, Mr. Shanahan voiced a tougher stand against China, telling the military's civilian leaders to focus more on the country, according to a Defense Department official."
161,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/19/us/alabama-senate-roy-jones-russia.html,"As Russia's online election machinations came to light last year, a group of Democratic tech experts decided to try out similarly deceptive tactics in the fiercely contested Alabama Senate race, according to people familiar with the effort and a report on its results.

The secret project, carried out on Facebook and Twitter, was likely too small to have a significant effect on the race, in which the Democratic candidate it was designed to help, Doug Jones, edged out the Republican, Roy S. Moore. But it was a sign that American political operatives of both parties have paid close attention to the Russian methods, which some fear may come to taint elections in the United States.

One participant in the Alabama project, Jonathon Morgan, is the chief executive of New Knowledge, a small cyber security firm that wrote a scathing account of Russia's social media operations in the 2016 election that was released this week by the Senate Intelligence Committee.

An internal report on the Alabama effort, obtained by The New York Times, says explicitly that it ""experimented with many of the tactics now understood to have influenced the 2016 elections.""

The project's operators created a Facebook page on which they posed as conservative Alabamians, using it to try to divide Republicans and even to endorse a write-in candidate to draw votes from Mr. Moore. It involved a scheme to link the Moore campaign to thousands of Russian accounts that suddenly began following the Republican candidate on Twitter, a development that drew national media attention.

""We orchestrated an elaborate 'false flag' operation that planted the idea that the Moore campaign was amplified on social media by a Russian botnet,"" the report says.

Mr. Morgan said in an interview that the Russian botnet ruse ""does not ring a bell,"" adding that others had worked on the effort and had written the report. He said he saw the project as ""a small experiment"" designed to explore how certain online tactics worked, not to affect the election.

Mr. Morgan said he could not account for the claims in the report that the project sought to ""enrage and energize Democrats"" and ""depress turnout"" among Republicans, partly by emphasizing accusations that Mr. Moore had pursued teenage girls when he was a prosecutor in his 30s.

""The research project was intended to help us understand how these kind of campaigns operated,"" said Mr. Morgan. ""We thought it was useful to work in the context of a real election but design it to have almost no impact.""

The project had a budget of just $100,000, in a race that cost approximately $51 million, including the primaries, according to Federal Election Commission records.

But however modest, the influence effort in Alabama may be a sign of things to come. Campaign veterans in both parties fear the Russian example may set off a race to the bottom, in which candidates choose social media manipulation because they fear their opponents will.

""Some will do whatever it takes to win,"" said Dan Bayens, a Kentucky-based Republican consultant. ""You've got Russia, which showed folks how to do it, you've got consultants willing to engage in this type of behavior and political leaders who apparently find it futile to stop it.""

There is no evidence that Mr. Jones sanctioned or was even aware of the social media project. Joe Trippi, a seasoned Democratic operative who served as a top advisor to the Jones campaign, said he had noticed the Russian bot swarm suddenly following Mr. Moore on Twitter. But he said it was impossible that a $100,000 operation had an impact on the race.

Mr. Trippi said he was nonetheless disturbed by the stealth operation. ""I think the big danger is somebody in this cycle uses the dark arts of bots and social networks and it works,"" he said. ""Then we're in real trouble.""

Despite its small size, the Alabama project brought together some prominent names in the world of political technology. The funding came from Reid Hoffman, the billionaire co-founder of LinkedIn, who has sought to help Democrats catch up with Republicans in their use of online technology.

The money passed through American Engagement Technologies, run by Mikey Dickerson, the founding director of the United States Digital Service, which was created during the Obama administration to try to upgrade the federal government's use of technology. Sara K. Hudson, a former Justice Department fellow now with Investing in Us, a tech finance company partly funded by Mr. Hoffman, worked on the project, along with Mr. Morgan.

A close collaborator of Mr. Hoffman, Dmitri Mehlhorn, the founder of Investing in Us, said in a statement that ""our purpose in investing in politics and civic engagement is to strengthen American democracy"" and that while they do not ""micromanage"" the projects they fund, they are not aware of having financed projects that have used deception. Mr. Dickerson declined to comment and Ms. Hudson did not respond to queries.

The Alabama project got started as Democrats were coming to grips with the Russians' weaponizing of social media to undermine the presidential campaign of Hillary Clinton and promote Donald J. Trump.

Mr. Morgan reached out at the time to Renée DiResta, who would later join New Knowledge and was lead author of the report on Russian social media operations released this week.

""I know there were people who believed the Democrats needed to fight fire with fire,"" Ms. DiResta said, adding that she disagreed. ""It was absolutely chatter going around the party.""

But she said Mr. Morgan simply asked her for suggestions of online tactics worth testing. ""My understanding was that they were going to investigate to what extent they could grow audiences for Facebook pages using sensational news,"" she said.

Mr. Morgan confirmed that the project created a generic page to draw conservative Alabamians -- he said he couldn't remember its name -- and that Mac Watson, one of multiple write-in candidates, contacted the page. ""But we didn't do anything on his behalf,"" he said.

The report, however, says the Facebook page agreed to ""boost"" Mr. Watson's campaign and stayed in regular touch with him, and was ""treated as an advisor and the go-to media contact for the write-in candidate.'' The report claims the page got him interviews with The Montgomery Advertiser and The Washington Post.

Mr. Watson, who runs a patio supply company in Auburn, Ala., confirmed that he got some assistance from a Facebook page whose operators seemed determined to stay in the shadows.

Of dozens of conservative Alabamian-oriented pages on Facebook that he wrote to, only one replied. ""You are in a particularly interesting position and from what we have read of your politics, we would be inclined to endorse you,"" the unnamed operator of the page wrote. After Mr. Watson answered a single question about abortion rights as a sort of test, the page offered an endorsement, though no money.

""They never spent one red dime as far as I know on anything I did -- they just kind of told their 400 followers, 'Hey, vote for this guy,'"" Mr. Watson said.

Mr. Watson never spoke with the page's author or authors by phone, and they declined a request for meeting. But he did notice something unusual: his Twitter followers suddenly ballooned from about 100 to about 10,000. The Facebook page's operators asked Mr. Watson whether he trusted anyone to set up a super PAC that could receive funding and offered advice on how to sharpen his appeal to disenchanted Republican voters.

Shortly before the election, the page sent him a message, wishing him luck.

The report does not say whether the project purchased the Russian bot Twitter accounts that suddenly began to follow Mr. Moore. But it takes credit for ""radicalizing Democrats with a Russian bot scandal"" and points to stories on the phenomenon in the mainstream media. ""Roy Moore flooded with fake Russian Twitter followers,"" reported The New York Post.

Inside the Moore campaign, officials began to worry about online interference.

""We did have suspicions that something odd was going on,"" said Rich Hobson, Mr. Moore's campaign manager. Mr. Hobson said that although he did not recall any hard evidence of interference, the campaign complained to Facebook about potential chicanery.

""Any and all of these things could make a difference,"" Mr. Hobson said. ""It's definitely frustrating, and we still kick ourselves that Judge Moore didn't win.""

When Election Day came, Mr. Jones became the first Alabama Democrat elected to the Senate in a quarter of a century, defeating Mr. Moore by 21,924 votes in a race that drew more than 22,800 write-in votes. More than 1.3 million ballots were cast over all.

Many of the write-in votes went to then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions, Condoleezza Rice -- an Alabama native and former secretary of state -- certain popular football coaches and Jesus Christ. Mr. Watson drew just a few hundred votes.

Mr. Watson noticed one other oddity. The day after the vote, the Facebook page that had taken such an interest in him had vanished.

""It was a group that, like, honest to God, next day was gone,"" said Mr. Watson.

""It was weird,"" he said. ""The whole thing was weird."""

Good evening. Here's the latest.

1. Democrats took control of the House of Representatives and elected Nancy Pelosi as speaker, returning divided government to Washington.

The power shift came amid a partial government shutdown, with President Trump's insistence on a wall on the Mexican border running headlong into newly energized Democratic opposition. House Democrats are voting on two new bills to reopen the federal government this evening, but their prospects in the Senate seemed dim.

Hours before her election, Ms. Pelosi, center, suggested in an interview that a sitting president could be indicted and left open the option of impeachment, kicking off what could shape up to be a memorable term.

The incoming class of freshman lawmakers is best described in superlatives -- it is the most racially diverse group ever elected to the House, and it includes a historic number of women.

2. An American citizen has been charged with spying in Russia, his lawyer said.

Paul Whelan, 48, above, is the head of security for a Michigan auto parts maker and a Marine Corps veteran. A Russian news agency reported that he was accused of trying to recruit a Russian citizen to obtain classified information.

Mr. Whelan's family said he was in Russia to attend the wedding of a friend. His lawyer said his client was upbeat despite being held in solitary confinement.

There has been widespread speculation that Russia seized Mr. Whelan to exchange him for Maria Butina, a Russian citizen who pleaded guilty to conspiring to act as a foreign agent and influence N.R.A. officials and prominent Republicans.

3. A spending slowdown in China has investors concerned, leading U.S. markets to close down about 2.5 percent.

News that Apple was cutting its revenue forecast for the first time in 16 years because of poor iPhone sales in China sparked fears. And reams of other data suggest Chinese consumers are tightening their belts over worries about the trade war, personal debt and their country's own economy. Above, in Beijing.

Shrinking Chinese demand would have a big impact on a world looking for engines of growth, on companies that counted on China's continuing expansion and on global investors who have long viewed the country as a steady source of profits.

So what should you do about the falling stock market? Take a nap, writes our senior economics correspondent.

4. In Turkey, ""the brain drain is real.""

After a failed coup attempt in 2016, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan set out on a sweeping crackdown, consolidating his power and steering the country toward authoritarianism.

Since then, hundreds of thousands of Turks -- including entrepreneurs and wealthy individuals -- have left the country. They have emigrated because of fear of political persecution, distrust of the judiciary, mismanagement of the economy and a deteriorating business climate. Above, in Istanbul.

The exodus has resulted in an alarming loss of talent and capital in Turkey, at a time when its economy is teetering -- a development that some experts believe looks like a more permanent reordering of society, threatening to set the country back decades.

5. Saudi Arabia's public prosecutor requested the death penalty for five suspects in the killing of the Saudi dissident Jamal Khashoggi.

The announcement came after the first court session in the case. It provided no new information about the murder, the investigation or why the prosecutor sought the death penalty against only five of the 11 suspects charged in Mr. Khashoggi's death.

The killing inside the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul has badly tarnished the international reputation of the kingdom and of its crown prince and day-to-day ruler, Mohammed bin Salman. Above, at a vigil in Istanbul.

The Trump administration has stood by the prince, an important ally in the Middle East. But U.S. intelligence agencies and members of Congress believe he ordered the killing.

7. Two Australian artists have paid for and installed a bronze menagerie of kitschy statues -- anthropomorphic dogs and rabbits, topsy-turvy rhinos -- across New York City.

In August, their ""Statues for Equality,"" 10 likenesses of women including Angelina Jolie and Michelle Obama, will line the property facing Radio City Music Hall. Above, ""The Table of Love"" at 237 Park Ave.

They've quickly become the most prolific creators of public art in New York City history -- to the dismay of leading art historians. Awarding city space to wealthy artists who can afford to bankroll their own work saves taxpayer dollars at the expense of diversity, experts told us.

The couple ""would not be considered serious artists with a capital 'A' and yet they have eight commissions?"" one said. ""That's a severe imbalance.""

8. New York City's subway service got a reprieve.

In an unexpected announcement, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said technology imported from Europe would be used to fix a tunnel without having to close it entirely.

The new plan would avert an expected 15-month shutdown of a major subway tunnel between Manhattan and Brooklyn on the L line, above.

The closure would have affected 250,000 riders daily, making it one of the biggest transportation disruptions in New York City's recent history.

Thompson, a former Brooklyn legislator and judge who was in the vanguard of the black Democrats who staked their claim to elective office beginning in the mid-1960s, died on Dec. 24 at his home in Brooklyn Heights. He was 94.

The cause was complications of colon cancer, his son, William C. Thompson Jr., the former New York City comptroller, said.

In 1964, Mr. Thompson became the first black state senator elected from Brooklyn, a borough where, as recently as 1960, the fanciest restaurant, Gage & Tollner, did not seat black people.

He was on the City Council from 1969 to 1973; elected to the State Supreme Court in 1974; and named assistant administrative judge of the Supreme Court in Brooklyn and Staten Island in 1978. In 1980, he was the first black associate justice appointed to the Appellate Division of the Second Judicial Department in Brooklyn.

He retired from the bench in 2001 and returned to his law practice.

Mr. Thompson was a founder, with Robert F. Kennedy, of the Bedford-Stuyvesant Restoration Corporation, of which he was also director, and New York City regional director of the N.A.A.C.P.

In 1965, he was one of about 30 black politicians who served notice on New York Democratic leaders that they expected a greater voice in the party organization. Why, one of the black politicians asked, do they have to wait for a particular district to have a majority black population before the party fields a black candidate?

In 1970, when black residents accounted for about one-fourth of Brooklyn's population, Mr. Thompson became a leader of his party in the borough when he was elected chairman of the Kings County Democratic Committee.

Known as Willie, Mr. Thompson was a gregarious glad-hander who, while he could be uncommonly blunt, ingratiated himself by expressing his unbridled opinions in several languages. (He spoke Yiddish, and he mastered Neapolitan dialect while serving in the Army with the 92nd Infantry Division in Italy during World War II.)

He also spoke regularly to his son, who relied on his father's political advice.

""We talk all the time,"" the elder Mr. Thompson told The New York Times in 2009, when William Jr. was the Democratic nominee for mayor of New York. ""Sometimes three times a day. Oh, sure. Why waste the knowledge?""

William Colridge Thompson was born on Oct. 26, 1924, in Manhattan. His father, William W. Thompson, sold furniture and was a city marshal. His mother, Louise (Greene) Thompson, was a domestic and cook.

After attending Franklin K. Lane High School on the Brooklyn-Queens border, Mr. Thompson received a degree in politcal science from Brooklyn College in 1948 and went on to graduate from Brooklyn Law School.

His marriage to Elaine Allen ended in divorce. In addition to their son, who is known as Bill, he is survived by their daughter, Gail Thompson, and three grandchildren.

Mr. Thompson was married twice more, to Sybil Hart Kooper an Appellate Division justice in New York, and Barbara Jamet, both of whom have died. Bill Thompson, a former president of the city Board of Education, was defeated by Mayor Michael R. Bloomberg in the 2009 mayoral contest and is now chairman of the board of trustees of the City University of New York.

As a state legislator, the elder Mr. Thompson played an outsize role for a freshman. In 1965, he successfully co-sponsored a bill that voided a 19th-century provision barring the dissemination of birth control devices or information.

Four decades later, he nudged the Legislature as an outsider, recommending, as a member of a court-appointed panel, that New York City and State spend billions of dollars more on the city's public schools.

In 1968, after a federal court ordered the Legislature to redraw Brooklyn's congressional districts, ruling that they discriminated against black voters, he ran with the informal support of party leaders in the new 12th District.

He lost the Democratic nomination by fewer than 800 votes, out of about 13,000 cast, to Shirley Chisholm, who went on to be elected the nation's first black congresswoman.

When Ms. Chisholm ran for the Democratic presidential nomination in 1972 (she was the first woman to do so), Mr. Thompson was the only one of the four Democratic district leaders in her congressional district whose national convention delegates were pledged to support her candidacy.

Ms. Chisholm won barely 5 percent of the delegates at the convention that year. Even after the election of Barack Obama to the White House in 2008, Mr. Thompson suggested that a majority of Americans still could not rise above a prevailing ""quiet racism"" to vote for a black candidate.

""Obama didn't surprise me,"" Mr. Thompson told The Times in 2009. ""The American people did."""

Trade, Immigration, and the Revolt Against Globalization

By John B. Judis

157 pp. Columbia Global Reports. Paper, $15.99.

Since the twin convulsions of 2016, Trump and Brexit, a cottage industry has evolved dedicated to explaining these phenomena, especially to liberals shocked and appalled by them both. John B. Judis was an early entrant into the field, publishing ""The Populist Explosion"" to wide acclaim just before Donald Trump was elected president. Like many of his fellow explainers, Judis writes as a liberal who has wised up, one who has seen what so many of his progressive confreres have missed and who sighs with exasperation at how desperately out of touch they have become.

His project in ""The Nationalist Revival"" is to explain the resurgence of nationalism, in both the United States and Europe. Once again, his timing is sharp: The fall midterm campaign saw Trump tell a Houston rally, ""You know what I am? I'm a nationalist. OK? I'm a nationalist."" In that same speech, the president pitted himself against ""corrupt, power-hungry globalists,"" deploying a term understood by anti-Semites as a code word for Jews. A week later, a self-described nationalist gunned down 11 Jews at prayer in Pittsburgh. So an inquiry into nationalism seems both necessary and urgent.

Methodically and with data widely drawn, Judis points the finger at a globalization that has seen once well-rewarded jobs shipped overseas; at immigration and the cultural and economic resentment it stirs; and at terrorism and the fear of the other it provokes. He also reminds us that ethnic nationalism is hardly new in the United States -- that the melting pot self-conception of the American nation is relatively recent and that for more than a century the American people conceived their country in strictly white, northern European and Protestant terms. Wisely, he argues that nationalism does not have an innate political color, that it can shade right or left depending on the ideological pigment with which it is combined.

With that context established, his focus is on the here and now and on explaining the current nationalist surge. Such an endeavor always carries a risk: that in seeking to explain a phenomenon, you stray into justifying it. Judis crosses that line more than once. Straining hard to see the world from the point of view of a voter for Trump or, say, the Hungarian strongman Viktor Orban, he too often channels that view unchallenged, accepting too many of its assumptions.

He draws, for example, on the typology set out by the British writer David Goodhart, who divides voters into two categories: Anywheres and Somewheres. The latter tend to live in once-homogeneous towns rather than diverse cities, valuing tradition and rootedness, while the former are footloose, prizing the novel over the long-established and constructing their identity from their individual professional or educational achievements rather than from the collective affiliations into which they were born. In this view, it is the Somewheres, often left behind economically and alienated by the rush to diversity, who have driven the nationalist revival, backing Trump, Brexit and a host of xenophobic politicians across Europe, while Anywheres remain stubbornly clueless about the pain and cultural dislocation their fellow citizens have endured.

But Judis, like Goodhart, too easily caricatures Anywheres as unmoored citizens of the world (both writers eschew the phrase ""rootless cosmopolitans,"" with its unhappy history, but that's the idea). Anywheres are disconnected from and deaf to the natural feelings of national kinship that animate their less well-heeled, less educated countrymen and women. Judis constructs a straw man when he takes on ""the cosmopolitan liberals who believe in a borderless world,"" for how many liberal arguments, outside a John Lennon lyric, seriously demand a world without countries?

Similarly, in fleshing out the supposed outlook of these cosmopolitans, a category that he estimates makes up ""perhaps, 15 to 20 percent of the electorate,"" he cites a poll taken of the founders of internet start-ups in Silicon Valley, as if that tiny, rarefied group reflects the views of one-fifth of the American population. Sure, these tech millionaires and billionaires love immigration and value ""global trade"" over ""American workers,"" but they are outliers.

More troubling is Judis's embrace of some of the presumptions that underlie the hawkish nationalism he aims to analyze. A small tell is his adoption of aquatic language when discussing immigration: Twice we read of a ""flood"" of refugees. Elsewhere a ""trickle"" of migrants becomes ""a raging stream."" It's only a small act of dehumanization, but it is such a common trope of anti-immigrant rhetoric that one would have expected Judis to be on guard against it.

It is striking too that Judis accepts the link that xenophobic nationalists make between immigration and terrorism. True, he is careful to write that this is the perception of anxious voters drawn toward nationalism, but he could surely have devoted a sentence or two to the question of whether that perception has a solid basis in fact. ""Some of the terrorist incidents involved refugees,"" he writes. That's true of a handful of cases in Europe, though the vast majority of incidents did not involve refugees. Meanwhile, the number of acts of terror that have been committed by refugees in the United States since 1980 hovers between one and zero, depending on whether you count only fatal acts (zero) or nonfatal ones (one).

Judis handles other (white) nationalist prejudices the same way. ""Many Americans blamed the rise of welfare spending ... on new Hispanic immigrants and newly empowered blacks using relaxed welfare laws to free ride,"" he writes, again without challenge. Later we learn of the ""resentment that many in the Euro-American core felt toward African-Americans and Latino immigrants, whom they believed to be benefiting from government programs without paying taxes to support them."" Sure, the verbs here are ""blamed"" and ""believed,"" but it would not have impaired Judis's exercise in understanding to note that black and Latino Americans are of course taxpayers too.

There's a reason this matters. The fact that many of these hostile perceptions of migrants and minorities are often only loosely grounded in reality is surely central to understanding the current nationalist surge. It tells us that this is as much about fear as it is about reality. Judis himself provides the evidence, noting that the number of illegal immigrants entering the United States peaked in 2007 and has declined ever since. Yet Trump was able to use the issue of supposedly rampant illegal immigration as rocket fuel for his campaign. Fear is the heart of the matter.

In a well-informed survey of the nationalist ascendancy in Europe, Judis again scolds liberals for being oblivious to nationalism's enduring power. He upbraids the European Union for insufficient sensitivity to the national yearnings of Poland and Hungary -- never quite saying whether the E.U.'s error has been in condemning those countries' drift toward illiberal democracy or in admitting them into the E.U. club in the first place -- and admonishes the Clinton and Obama administrations for a similar tin ear toward Russia. But here too he slips from explanation to justification, adopting what sounds a lot like Putin's narrative. In his telling Russia did not invade or annex Crimea, for example, but merely ""reclaimed"" it.

Still, Judis would surely wave aside these objections as typical liberal fastidiousness, untuned to the more elemental, raw longings of national identity that liberals need to accommodate fast. On that point, he makes a robust case: Liberals have indeed underestimated for too long the need for a collective sense of belonging, failing to see that any social democratic project involving redistribution or welfare spending requires a basic level of fellow-feeling among citizens. That too is nationalism, and this book is a timely, if flawed, reminder of its importance."

Economists size up 2019

It's time for economists to make their predictions for the year ahead. Among the main questions: What are the biggest threats to the U.S. economy, and will the country fall into a recession?

Trade tensions are the top concern. About 47.3 percent of the economists surveyed by the WSJ said the continuing conflict between the U.S. and China was the biggest economic risk of 2019. About one in five cited disruptions in the financial markets as their biggest worry, and 12.7 percent were most worried about a slowdown in business investment.

Don't sweat rising interest rates. Only 7.3 percent of the economists polled by the WSJ said Fed rate increases were the biggest threat to the economy. Economists told the WSJ and Reuters that they only expect two increases next year.

Expect a recession soon(ish). Over half of the economists polled by the WSJ expect a recession to start in 2020, and slightly more than one in four expect it in 2021. Just one in ten expect a recession next year. Economists surveyed by Reuters put the chances of a recession in the next two years at 40 percent; Pimco has put the odds of one next year at 30 percent. Make of all that what you will.

Bonus: If you think this is all too much talk and not enough action, you are not alone. ""I propose a new standard,"" writes Daniel Moss of Bloomberg Opinion. ""Anyone noting a slowdown in major economies or predicting a recession is expected to also suggest how officials should respond.""

Can Nissan and Renault fill their power vacuum?

With Carlos Ghosn in a Tokyo jail facing criminal charges of underreporting his income, the automakers have a major problem. Mr. Ghosn masterminded and led the alliance that allowed the two companies to prosper. But, as Jack Ewing, Motoko Rich and Liz Alderman of the NYT write:

* ""Mr. Ghosn had not cultivated a clear successor, and that leaves the alliance's survival in doubt: Neither Nissan nor Renault has a plan for preserving the arrangement that has been a juggernaut.""

* ""Mr. Ghosn's power and unusually long tenure may have prevented the alliance from evolving as Nissan became by far the bigger and more profitable partner, yet Renault exercised more control.""

* ""The Renault board said on Thursday that an internal inquiry into Mr. Ghosn's compensation had uncovered no irregularities, and that he would remain chief executive."" (Reuters says that could change.)

* ""Nissan's board will meet on Monday to appoint a replacement for Mr. Ghosn."" (Reuters isn't expecting them to succeed.)

* ""With Mr. Ghosn in jail, the most complicated problem for the alliance is that it simply has no leader.""

Inside Elon Musk's manufacturing hell

Tesla has long struggled with production issues on its new Model 3 electric car, and Elon Musk, the carmaker's C.E.O., is known to have worked hard to overcome them. But a new investigation by Wired paints a deeply unflattering picture of his methods. Here's a particularly illuminating passage:

He walked along the assembly line, red-faced and urgent, interrogating workers he encountered, telling them that at Tesla excellence was a passing grade, and they were failing; that they weren't smart enough to be working on these problems; that they were endangering the company, according to someone who observed him.

Employees knew about such rampages. Sometimes Musk would terminate people; other times he would simply intimidate them. One manager had a name for these outbursts -- Elon's rage firings -- and had forbidden subordinates from walking too close to Musk's desk at the Gigafactory out of concern that a chance encounter, an unexpected question answered incorrectly, might endanger a career.

A $9.5 million sign of CBS's big #MeToo problem

When sexual comments by the star of the prime-time CBS drama ""Bull,"" Michael Weatherly, made the actress Eliza Dushku uncomfortable, she confronted him. Shortly after, she was written out of the show. Believing it to be an act of retaliation, Ms. Dushku went through mediation with CBS and won a $9.5 million settlement.

Her story, which emerged amid an investigation by outside lawyers for CBS into sexual misconduct allegations against Les Moonves, the company's former C.E.O., is laid out in a draft report reviewed by The New York Times. The document contains some damning conclusions:

* ""The lawyers said the company's handling of Ms. Dushku's complaints was not only misguided, but emblematic of larger problems at CBS.""

* ""When faced with instances of wrongdoing, the company had a tendency to protect itself, at the expense of victims, the investigators wrote.""

And an investment bank's #MeToo stand

In a letter to staff members, Richard Handler, the C.E.O. of the investment bank Jeffries, explained that he was vexed by ""the thoughtless, paranoid and fundamentally wrong reaction that many people in our industry are expressing about the #MeToo movement.""

* ""If you don't know how to conduct yourself as a responsible, courteous and balanced human being, the fault lies exclusively with you and not with an allegedly flawed system designed to ensnare the innocent,"" he wrote.

* His conclusion: ""We cannot control the markets, but we can control how we act and behave.""

How Big Oil covertly pushed to gut car emissions rules

When President Trump announced a rolling back of car emission regulations this year, automakers said it was too much even for them. But the U.S. oil industry had secretly pressed for such extreme measures all along, writes Hiroko Tabuchi of the NYT:

* ""The industry had reason to urge the rollback of higher fuel efficiency standards proposed by former President Barack Obama. A quarter of the world's oil is used to power cars, and less-thirsty vehicles mean lower gasoline sales.""

* ""In Congress, on Facebook and in statehouses nationwide, Marathon Petroleum, the country's largest refiner, worked with powerful oil-industry groups and a conservative policy network financed by the billionaire industrialist Charles G. Koch to run a stealth campaign to roll back car emissions standards.""

* ""The campaign's main argument for significantly easing fuel efficiency standards -- that the United States is so awash in oil it no longer needs to worry about energy conservation -- clashed with decades of federal energy and environmental policy.""

Why investors are so eager to ""sell the rally""

Stocks on Wall Street are poised to end the week higher than they started it, with trade tensions between China and the U.S. apparently easing.

But one developing trend has some people concerned: Yesterday, for a fifth straight day, investors sold an early rally, leaving stocks with only modest gains. The FT explains what's happening:

Year after year of support from global central banks and their multi-trillion dollar asset purchase programmes had indoctrinated the BTD [buy the dip] moneymaking strategy: buy on any sign of a pullback, policymakers have you covered.

But with the Federal Reserve well into a policy tightening cycle and concerns about the U.S.-China trade war weighing on the global growth outlook, investors appear a lot less keen to place their belief -- at least for now -- that stocks always go up.

More on markets: Investors often treat tech stocks like members of a close-knit family that always travel together. That's wrong. Headlines about trade have kept investors on tenterhooks in recent weeks, flustering stock markets in much of the world -- except, oddly, in China.

Europe ends its huge money-printing program

The European Central Bank said on Thursday that it would stop adding to its stockpile of government and corporate bonds at the end of December, winding down a scheme that has held down interest rates and encouraged lending for nearly four years, reports Jack Ewing of the NYT.

It's an expected end. ""The bank signaled in June that the bond-buying program, which pumped 2.5 trillion newly created euros, or $2.8 trillion, into the eurozone economy, would probably end in December,"" Mr. Ewing writes.

But the central bank still has worries. ""The latest data and survey results have been weaker than expected,"" said Mario Draghi, the bank's president. ""This may suggest some slower growth momentum ahead.""

Don't expect an economic shock. ""An enormous stockpile of government bonds will remain in the central bank's possession for years,"" Mr. Ewing writes. ""The central bank emphasized on Thursday that it was in no hurry to reduce its holdings, and reiterated that it would not begin to raise interest rates before the end of next summer.""

167,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/27/opinion/carbon-tax-climate-change.html,"PARIS -- The angry graffiti have been blasted off the Arc de Triomphe with water jets, leaving unnaturally white patches scarring the base of France's national monument. The husks of incinerated cars have been cleared from the streets, the glass from shattered store windows swept up. The government has taken steps to appease the demonstrators, which may be working.

With a bit of calm upon us, now would be a good time for those of us concerned about climate change to engage in some introspection.

The violent demonstrations that flared this fall in France were a culmination of decades of rising anger among the working class, it is true, but they were triggered by plans to impose a tax hike on gasoline and diesel fuel at the pump in the name of fighting climate change. Only three years ago, French monuments were bathed in green floodlights to celebrate a global deal negotiated in a Paris suburb to limit emissions; now we are scraping ugly slogans off those monuments.

Days before the French fury boiled over in November, voters in one of most liberal American states, Washington, once again rejected a plan to tax emissions of carbon dioxide in the name of fighting climate change.

These tax proposals all spring from basic economic theory. If people and companies are abusing a public good -- in this case, by dumping greenhouse gases into the atmosphere -- the answer, economists tell us, is to put a price on that activity that reflects the harm and encourages the development of more benign alternatives. Because most of the gases that cause climate change contain carbon in some form, the shorthand term for this policy is a ""carbon price.""

Yet the climate movement has, I fear, turned this potentially useful tool into a fetish. Discuss any aspect of the emissions problem these days and you will quickly hear somebody say, ""A price is the answer,"" or equivalent words. You hear that from the lips of politicians, from newspaper editorial boards, from utility executives and even from the heads of oil companies.

Yet the put-a-price-on-it mantra is proving, in practice, to be a political failure. The Democrats could not get such a policy through Congress even when they had big majorities in the first two years of the Obama administration. Efforts to sell Republicans on the idea that this is the most market-friendly approach to the emissions problem have failed miserably, and will continue to fail.

Proponents of carbon pricing like to point out that variants of the idea have spread all over the world, including to all the countries of the European Union and several American states and Canadian provinces. This is true, but when you look at how these systems have worked in practice, the picture grows murky. Invariably, huge political capital was spent to push through a carbon price too low to spur the rapid reductions in emissions that we need.

Cases that are held up as demonstrating the purported success of carbon pricing, like a tax in British Columbia, mostly prove that if you slap on a modest carbon price, you will get a modest economic response. That people may get used to paying the low tax does not seem to make it much easier, in these jurisdictions, to raise the price to a level where it will really bite.

The basic political problem is that the climate movement still does not have the strength of numbers to overcome entrenched opposition and put in the kind of stiff-and-rising taxes we would need to do the job. The oil companies may claim they want carbon pricing, but a subset of them spent more than $30 million in Washington State to kill the tax proposal there, twice as much money as the proponents were able to raise in support of their intelligent, carefully designed plan.

Damn the oil companies if you will, but they persuaded 56 percent of the voters to take their side, carrying every county in the state but two. What that vote, and the French protests, tell us is that any proposal to raise energy prices is going to run into a buzz saw of opposition, including from working-class people who already feel like they are being mistreated.

The political difficulties are not the only issue with carbon pricing, though. Even in theory, the idea is expected to work in some economic sectors but not in others, yet the fetishists hold it up as the magic answer to all problems.

For example, it is not at all clear that raising prices at the pump is the best way to reduce emissions from driving. European drivers already pay $6 to $7 a gallon for fuel, most of that in taxes, yet governments there have found that they still need efficiency regulations for cars. Moreover, if you want people to leave their cars at home, you have to give them alternative ways to get to work, and a hike in fuel taxes by itself does nothing to accomplish that. Much of the American public does not have access to public transit of any kind, and even in transit-dependent cities like New York and Washington, the subways have been allowed to fall apart.

The single most important climate policy in the world might be the efficiency regulations that the American government imposes on cars and trucks, which are under attack by the Trump administration. Climate advocates are fighting to defend them in court, but we also need concerned citizens to crawl all over Congress, pushing legislators to stop the rollback. What are many of us doing instead? Trying to persuade Congress to pass a carbon tax, when the political conditions to achieve that simply do not exist.

Here is more evidence that a carbon price is no magic bullet: One of the biggest climate problems is poorly constructed buildings that waste energy. A carbon price will not solve that problem, for the elementary reason that the people who put up the buildings, and have an economic motive to skimp on insulation and windows, are not the people who wind up paying the energy bills. The solution is building codes with strict energy requirements, vigorously enforced. Yet across huge swaths of the United States we still have weak building codes and lousy enforcement.

Building codes, you're thinking? Yes, I know they seem boring. I am writing a book with an energy expert, Hal Harvey, who has convinced me that they could hardly be more important. A bad building wastes energy for decades. Yet are climate activists swarming Topeka City Hall, the Colorado statehouse or your local county commission to demand tougher building codes? I wish.

To be clear, I am not arguing that a carbon price is unimportant. I would repeal none of the ones that have already passed, and I am in favor of passing new carbon prices everywhere that the politics seem aligned to make it possible. The activists in Washington State who pushed that proposal made a noble effort, and in a better world they would have won -- not least because their plan was designed with the interests of the working class in mind.

What I am saying is that we cannot argue for climate policy in a vacuum, ignoring the dangerous political moment we are in, when the anger of working people is being misappropriated by demagogues like Donald Trump and Marine Le Pen in France. We would be wise not to ratchet up that anger, as President Emmanuel Macron of France belatedly acknowledged when he yanked the proposed hike in fuel taxes.

Any carbon tax that is put on the table needs to be designed with that in mind. Maybe the opening promise should be that every penny of the money will go to relieve the burden on the working class, perhaps by cutting payroll taxes and putting more cash into its pockets the day the carbon tax goes into effect. Some countries might be able to push that through, even if the United States cannot.

In the final analysis, the economic theory is right, of course: We do need a price on carbon. Some of our most important goals, such as cutting emissions from heavy industries like steel mills and cement plants, are likely to be impossible to achieve without it.

But just because a stiff carbon price is, in theory, the biggest tool in the toolbox, I am not sure that means we have to whip it out first. Many other tools are available. A policy known as a clean-electricity standard, which would require that a certain share of electricity generation come from low-carbon sources, could get us a long way in the United States. Republicans have shown some interest in it in the past. Stricter building regulations are also needed the world over.

Maybe we need to use those techniques to convince people that emissions really can be cut without wrecking the economy or further impoverishing the working class. Then, having proved that, we would pull the big tool out last.

168,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/26/us/trump-environment-regulation-rollbacks.html,"For nearly two years, President Trump has pursued an aggressive, far-reaching effort, lobbied for and cheered on by industry, to free American business from what he and many of his supporters view as excessive environmental regulation.

The consequences are starting to play out in noticeable ways in communities across the United States.

An investigation by The New York Times showed how Mr. Trump's deregulatory policies are starting to have substantial impact on those who experience them close up -- and often are economically dependent on the industries the president is trying to help.

Here are five takeaways:

Trump has quickly undercut Obama's legacy

President Barack Obama made protecting the environment a big part of his legacy. His administration, over eight years, carefully developed rules designed to clean up the environment, deter climate change and protect against dangerous chemicals. Many were completed in the final stretch of his presidency, often in ways that bypassed Congress.

But industry consistently balked at those regulations, calling them an overreach, duplicative and unnecessary, unleashing a backlash that has informed Mr. Trump's approach.

So, with equal decisiveness, Mr. Trump has sought to undo his predecessor's agenda by blocking, delaying and killing measures. The Trump administration cited its rollbacks as a victory and the fulfillment of a campaign promise.

The rapid change in policy direction shows how both presidents used their expansive executive powers -- but for very different outcomes.

Environmental impacts span the country

The early impacts of the Trump rollbacks are beginning to emerge across the country, from California to North Dakota, Texas and West Virginia.

The Times visited the communities facing these changes, and found that local residents and business leaders are often divided. Some believe that the Obama administration went too far in imposing new environmental demands, while others worry that the changes the Trump administration is making will hurt their families, in particular their children.

The geographic diversity of the places grappling with the trade-offs highlights how pervasive the connections are between natural resources, health and economic opportunity.

In the vast farmlands of central California, day care centers have to take account of pesticide-spraying schedules. The local government's revenues on the Fort Berthold Indian Reservation in North Dakota have grown to $330 million from $20 million over the last 15 years because of vast fossil fuel reserves that can now be pumped from the ground using fracking. National forests 400 miles away can be clouded with haze produced by a coal-fired power plant near Houston.

The rollbacks touch air, water, chemicals and climate

No parts of the federal government during the Trump era have been more aggressive in rolling back rules than the Environmental Protection Agency and the Interior Department, which between them regulate much of the intersection between the environment and the economy. Together their rule changes have touched nearly every aspect of environmental protection, including air pollution caused by power plants and the oil and gas industry, water pollution caused by coal mines, and toxic chemicals and pesticides used by farmers nationwide.

In short, what is at stake is the quality of the air we breathe and the food we eat, the cleanliness of the rivers that flow past us, and the pace at which the climate is changing. Two years after Mr. Trump took office, the policy shifts are not nearly complete; dozens of other rules have been targeted for rollback.

After decades of legislation and regulation, the environment in the United States continues to get cleaner. What has changed under Mr. Trump in most cases is the pace of improvement, which has been slowed in a number of key areas compared to what it would have been if the Obama rules had been preserved.

The decline of coal has not been stopped

If there is a single industry that has been at the center of the fight -- both during the Obama expansion of rules and the Trump rollbacks -- it is coal. Mr. Obama targeted the industry as a way to combat climate change. Mr. Trump has defended and promoted it as part of his populist political and economic strategy.

Mr. Trump's approach has been to slow demands for further steps to curb air and water pollution caused by coal-burning power plants.

The tug-of-war involves coal mines as well, which were ordered by Mr. Obama to take steps to help clean thousands of miles of rivers and streams, only be told by Mr. Trump that these measures were no longer necessary.

What has not changed is the decline of coal -- both coal mines and coal-burning power plants. Even as Mr. Trump has used his executive powers to help the industry, coal production in the United States continues to decline. As the Energy Department announced this month, the country's coal consumption for 2018 is ""expected to be the lowest in 39 years."" The decline is mostly a result of power plants shifting away from burning coal.

Progress is slowing -- but there's still progress

At the core of the fight between environmentalists and the Trump administration is a debate over a simple question: How much improvement is enough? By some measures -- such as overall emissions of sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxide, two major air pollutants that cause smoke and haze and a variety of health ailments -- environmental quality in the United States has continued to improve in the Trump era.

That is in large part because of the rapid closure of more coal-burning power plants. But the pace of those declines would almost certainly have been greater had Obama-era policies continued. So what is happening in the United States is a slowing of the pace of progress -- not a return to the era, before the E.P.A. was created in 1970, where a river in Ohio caught fire.

Another factor is that environmental change happens slowly. So the real impact of the Trump-era policies may not be fully apparent until years after Mr. Trump leaves office."
169,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/26/us/politics/trump-iraq-troops-visit.html,"WASHINGTON -- President Trump visited American military forces in Iraq on Wednesday, a surprise trip and the first visit to troops stationed abroad in a combat zone by a commander in chief who has made withdrawing the United States from foreign wars a signature issue.

The trip, shrouded in secrecy, came in the midst of a government shutdown and less than a week after Mr. Trump disrupted America's military status quo and infuriated even some of his staunchest political allies by announcing plans to withdraw troops from Syria and about half of those stationed in Afghanistan. That decision on Syria, made over the objections of American military generals and civilian advisers, led to the resignation of Mr. Trump's defense secretary, Jim Mattis, and fueled tensions within the national security establishment.

The place Mr. Trump chose to visit is the one theater of war where he has not promised a rapid drawdown of forces -- and it is where he claims his greatest military victory, the defeat of the Islamic State in Mosul, the Iraqi city where the group's leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi declared the beginning of its self-proclaimed caliphate. The assault on Mosul by Iraqi forces, backed by Americans, began under President Barack Obama but culminated in the summer of 2017 under Mr. Trump.

Mr. Trump, who was accompanied by his wife, Melania Trump, was expected to make two stops on his post-Christmas trip, delivering a holiday message to the more than 5,000 American forces stationed in the country.

""President Trump and the First Lady traveled to Iraq late on Christmas night to visit with our troops and Senior Military leadership to thank them for their service, their success, and their sacrifice and to wish them a Merry Christmas,"" Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House spokeswoman, said in a tweet.

Visiting troops abroad is a cherished tradition for presidents. President George W. Bush served Thanksgiving turkey to the soldiers in Baghdad in 2003, in the early days of the Iraq War. Mr. Obama flew to Baghdad in April 2009, four months after his inauguration, winning cheers when he told the troops it was time for the Iraqis to take responsibility for their own country. He visited Afghanistan four times while in office.

But nearly two years into his presidency, Mr. Trump had yet to visit any troops abroad, drawing criticism from various corners.

After he canceled a rainy-day visit to an American cemetery outside of Paris last month during a World War I battlefield commemoration, he told Chris Wallace, the Fox News anchor, that he had not visited troops abroad because of ""an unbelievably busy schedule.""

Mr. Trump ran for the presidency on a platform of bringing the troops home from Afghanistan and Syria, part of a broader strategy of ending nearly two decades of American military interventions -- from Iraq and Libya to Syria and Afghanistan -- that he criticized as costly, ineffective and at odds with his ""America First"" foreign policy.

But the United States still has 14,000 troops in Afghanistan and about 2,000 in Syria. While the number of casualties in these conflicts is a fraction of what it was during the two previous administrations, the fact that American troops are still on the ground -- in the case of Afghanistan, 17 years after they were first deployed -- attests to the difficulty of extracting the country from these entanglements.

Mr. Trump's trip came at a sensitive moment, as the president's clash with Mr. Mattis over the troop withdrawals opened a rift between the commander in chief and the military.

Over the weekend, Brett McGurk, the special presidential envoy to the coalition fighting the Islamic State, accelerated his resignation, telling colleagues that he could not in good conscience carry out Mr. Trump's newly declared policy of withdrawing American troops from Syria. Mr. McGurk, a seasoned diplomat who was considered central to the fight against the terrorist group, had originally planned to retire in February.

Mr. Trump's announcements on Syria and Afghanistan have left a trail of confusion, with White House officials unable to explain the timetable for the withdrawals or their strategy to prevent a return of radical extremism in either country.

Adding to the sense of uncertainty is the partial shutdown of the government, which does not affect active-duty military but had led Mr. Trump to cancel his holiday visit to his Florida estate, Mar-a-Lago, and remain sequestered in the White House.

On Christmas, Mr. Trump and Melania Trump, the first lady, made calls from the West Wing to troops stationed abroad, though he was criticized in the media for being the first president since 2002 not to visit troops or wounded warriors on the holiday.

Mr. Trump says he has ""done more for the military"" than many of his recent predecessors but had not made visiting active duty military personnel a priority.

""I will do that at some point, but I don't think it's overly necessary,"" Mr. Trump said in an interview with The Associated Press in October, when asked about visiting troops stationed abroad. ""I've been very busy with everything that's taking place here.""

""I'm doing a lot of things,"" he added. ""But it's something I'd do and do gladly.""

Wednesday's trip also took Mr. Trump out of the White House, where he had been venting his grievances over the partial government shutdown triggered by the stalemate over his demand for funding to build a wall along the southern border.

Mr. Trump, who had been scheduled to leave for a 16-day vacation in Palm Beach last Friday, instead has complained on Twitter in recent days that he is ""all alone (poor me) in the White House waiting for the Democrats to come back and make a deal on desperately needed Border Security."""
170,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/19/us/politics/trump-syria-withdrawal-obama.html,"WASHINGTON -- President Trump has always taken a contrarian's view of American military power: He wants to command the biggest, toughest forces on earth, and he wants to keep them at home.

The lessons that many in the Pentagon and the intelligence agencies learned in the post-9/11 era -- that deployed forces are key to stopping terrorists before they reach American shores and vital to maintaining the alliances that keep the world safe -- never resonated with Mr. Trump. He is far more engaged with the idea of using the military to secure the Mexican border than to counter Russia, Iran, North Korea and China.

And now, by ordering the small American force of 2,000 troops to leave Syria, Mr. Trump is about to turn his theory into practice. He is doing so to the quiet horror of many of his senior aides, who have long argued that to pull out of Syria (or Afghanistan, another conflict in which Mr. Trump has said America has no legitimate long-term role) is to ignore the lessons of the past two decades.

But even Mr. Trump's biggest critics, the Democrats, will have a hard time going after him on this decision.

Mr. Trump's view that American forces cannot alter the strategic balance in the Middle East, and should not be there, was fundamentally shared by his immediate predecessor, Barack Obama. It was Mr. Obama who, at almost the exact same moment in his presidency, announced the removal of America's last troops in Iraq -- fulfilling a campaign promise.

Mr. Obama's strategy -- rely on local partners on the ground, use American air power when necessary to defend American interests and celebrate a return of American troops for the holidays -- sounds a lot like discussions inside Mr. Trump's White House over the past several days. Which is exactly what grates on some of the more hawkish Republicans in Congress.

""If Obama had done this, all of us would be furious,"" Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, said on Wednesday. ""If Obama had done this, we'd be going nuts right now: 'How weak, how dangerous.'""

Both the 44th and 45th presidents looked at troop commitments that have now lasted nearly 17 years -- nearly 170,000 American troops in Iraq at the peak in 2007, and more than 100,000 in Afghanistan 2011 -- and concluded that their long-term effect was marginal, at best. Keeping 2,000 in Syria was not going to make a difference.

""On this issue -- maybe on this issue alone -- there is more continuity between Trump and Obama than would make either administration comfortable,"" said Richard N. Haass, the president of the Council on Foreign Relations and a senior official in the Bush administration in the lead-up to the 2003 invasion of Iraq.

But Mr. Haass worries that if Mr. Trump completely pulls troops from Syria, ""we may be giving up whatever limited leverage we had for nothing.""

""It's not clear that we have established any understandings about conditions on the American withdrawal,"" Mr. Haas said. ""Have we set any red lines with the Turks about how they will handle the Kurds? Any understandings with the Russians about the shape of future government?""

If there were any conditions, any effort by Mr. Trump to shape the outcome in one of the great humanitarian disasters of the modern age, White House officials said nothing about them on Wednesday -- even to some of America's closest allies, who were phoning around Washington trying to understand what was happening.

Instead, Mr. Trump tweeted, ""We have defeated ISIS in Syria, my only reason for being there during the Trump Presidency.""

It was his only public statement -- though one true to his 2016 presidential campaign, when he made it clear in interviews with The New York Times and others that he was not interested in using American troops to protect Syrians caught in the crossfire, to oust President Bashar al-Assad, or even to counter the Russians or the Iranians.

For a brief moment early in his presidency, it looked like Mr. Trump's view of America's role in Syria might be evolving and broadening. That false turn came in April 2017, after Mr. Assad's forces used chemical weapons in an attack that killed more than 80 civilians in an Idlib Province neighborhood that opposed Mr. Assad's brutal rule.

Mr. Trump, operating from his Mar-a-Lago estate in Florida, with President Xi Jinping of China waiting at his dinner table, ordered an airstrike against a Syrian base where the attack had originated.

""It is in this vital national security interest of the United States to prevent and deter the spread and use of deadly chemical weapons,"" Mr. Trump said that evening.

His national security aides -- almost all of whom are now gone from the White House -- emphasized the difference with Mr. Obama, who had famously decided against a similar strike against Mr. Assad for crossing a ""red line"" of using chemical weapons. Mr. Trump called that weakness, and made the red line a campaign line.

The willingness to go after Mr. Assad's bases, Mr. Trump's team suggested, was evidence there was a new sheriff in town. Having Mr. Xi there to witness the use of raw power, they suggested, was just an added benefit.

But there was little follow-up; while the United States and its allies hit another chemical weapons depot earlier this year, American military power was never used effectively to back up a diplomatic strategy to bring an end to the civil war or engineer the removal, one way or another, of Mr. Assad.

One of Mr. Trump's former senior aides said that even after the bombing of the base, the president repeatedly returned in Oval Office meetings to the theme of full withdrawal of American troops and had little interest in hearing arguments that doing so could signal weakness to Russia or Iran.

In fact, as recently as Monday, as Mr. Trump was contemplating getting out, the State Department insisted that America was not going anywhere -- and Mr. Assad would be making a big mistake if he thought the United States was going to leave.

""I think if that's his strategy, he is going to have to wait a very long time,"" James F. Jeffrey, the United States special representative for Syria, said in an address at the Atlantic Council in Washington.

As it turns out, Mr. Assad will have to wait only about a month for the American withdrawal to be complete.

In his speech this week, Mr. Jeffrey made an impassioned case that the civil war in Syria was not just about the half-million people dead, nor the 11 million others who have been driven from their homes.

It has ""become a great-power conflict,"" he said, with Americans, Russians, Iranians, Turks and Israelis all involved. Any American policy, he said, ""cannot focus only on the internal conflict."" He added later than ""Iran has to get out of there,"" meaning Iranian ground troops.

Mr. Jeffrey's ultimate boss, however, seems largely uninterested in the geopolitics of remaining in Syria, or using whatever leverage the United States has left to shape events there. American troops, in Mr. Trump's view, should return to American shores, where they can bristle with new weapons -- but only engage those who would enter the United States and seek to harm its citizens.

It is a very 20th-century view of global power. And it largely overlooks how terrorist groups are making bombs outside Damascus that can be slipped aboard aircraft, or how the newly revived Syrian Electronic Army, Mr. Assad's team for hacking the United States from afar, can wreak havoc without ever stepping into American territory.

But as Mr. Jeffrey himself said, the Trump administration's national security strategy, published early this year, stated outright that countering terrorism was no longer the primary goal of American policy -- and that dealing with a renewed era of great-power competition was, once again, the motivating rationale.

Some of Mr. Trump's former aides have said the president never actually read through his strategy, although he was briefed on it. With his brief, little-explained announcement on Wednesday, he leaves his allies wondering whether it is truly his strategy at all."
171,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/26/world/asia/afghanistan-presidential-election-delay.html,"KABUL, Afghanistan -- Afghanistan's presidential election, scheduled for April, is likely to be delayed, Afghan officials said on Wednesday, underscoring the country's fragility as war with the Taliban rages and the United States presses for peace talks.

The officials suggested a lack of technical preparations justified a delay of at least three months, to avoid repeating the furious disputes and accusations of industrial-scale fraud that followed the previous presidential election, in 2014. But the move comes as the Trump administration is losing patience with the long war in Afghanistan, where about 14,000 American troops remain.

Last week Pentagon officials said President Trump had ordered preparations to withdraw 7,000 soldiers from Afghanistan in coming months -- a decision that surprised Afghan officials. It also went against the advice of Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and may have contributed to his resignation.

Although American generals have since played down the suggestion of an imminent withdrawal, Mr. Trump has made no secret of his exasperation with troops' protracted entanglement in Afghanistan. His White House also has been pressing for the Taliban to sit down for direct talks with the Afghan government.

If the presidential elections are delayed, that could give Zalmay Khalilzad, the top American envoy who has met with the Taliban several times in recent months, a bigger window to seek a deal.

Mr. Khalilzad has pushed strongly for a peace agreement before elections.

Although Afghan election officials, speaking to local media, suggested a delay was likely, they would not confirm it publicly. A senior official said the decision was made to delay the presidential vote by three months, and that it would be announced on Thursday.

The coalition government of President Ashraf Ghani, brokered by the Obama administration after a stalemate following the 2014 election, has struggled in the face of a resurgent Taliban and vocal political opposition.

More recently, Mr. Ghani's government has also expressed frustrations at the marginal role it has played in the Trump administration's drive toward talks with the Taliban. Rumors have circulated that the United States is in favor of a transitional or caretaker administration that the Taliban could agree to as part of a deal to end the war.

Much of the criticism directed at Mr. Ghani and his coalition partner and former electoral rival, Abdullah Abdullah, stems from how their government has handled overhauling Afghanistan's election machinery to avoid a repeat of 2014. The coalition partners fought bitterly over election appointments, delaying a parliamentary vote by three years.

When the parliamentary elections finally happened, in October of this year, they were marred by widespread irregularities and claims of fraud. More than two months later, even the initial results have yet to be completed.

While opposition parties had long demanded that the presidential election go ahead in April, many of them cautiously welcomed news of the delay on Wednesday, hoping that the authorities could use the extra time to put in place better anti-fraud measures.

""The election postponement has two reasons -- one is the ongoing peace negotiation, as we heard the U.S. government wants to reach an agreement with the Taliban,"" said Asadullah Sadati, a member of the opposition Wahdat party. ""On the other hand, the election commission is not ready to hold the election at its exact time. The parliamentary election was a mess. It was not fair and transparent. We think the postponement brings more time for the election commission to prepare.""

Karim Amin, a member of the Hizb-e-Islami party, said they would welcome a delay that allowed more time for peace talks before they were overtaken by a contest for power.

""Before the elections, the result of the talks should be clear,"" Mr. Amin said. ""Peace is much more important than everything else."""
172,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/04/opinion/sunday/metoo-new-yorker-conde-nast.html,"""No way. I'm not signing that,"" a New Yorker writer said when she saw the terms.

When you see publishers and authors chatting chummily at book parties, you're likely to think that they're on the same side -- the side of great literature and the free flow of ideas.

In reality, their interests are at odds. Publishers are marketers. They don't like scandals that might threaten their bottom line -- or the bottom lines of the multinational media conglomerates of which most form a small part. Authors are people, often flawed. Sometimes they behave badly. How, for instance, should publishers deal with the #MeToo era, when accusations of sexual impropriety can lead to books being pulled from shelves and syllabuses, as happened last year with the novelists Junot Díaz and Sherman Alexie?

One answer is the increasingly widespread ""morality clause."" Over the past few years, Simon & Schuster, HarperCollins and Penguin Random House have added such clauses to their standard book contracts. I've heard that Hachette Book Group is debating putting one in its trade book contracts, though the publisher wouldn't confirm it. These clauses release a company from the obligation to publish a book if, in the words of Penguin Random House, ""past or future conduct of the author inconsistent with the author's reputation at the time this agreement is executed comes to light and results in sustained, widespread public condemnation of the author that materially diminishes the sales potential of the work.""

That's reasonable, I guess. Penguin, to its credit, doesn't ask authors to return their advances. But other publishers do, and some are even more hard-nosed.

This past year, regular contributors to Condé Nast magazines started spotting a new paragraph in their yearly contracts. It's a doozy. If, in the company's ""sole judgment,"" the clause states, the writer ""becomes the subject of public disrepute, contempt, complaints or scandals,"" Condé Nast can terminate the agreement. In other words, a writer need not have done anything wrong; she need only become scandalous. In the age of the Twitter mob, that could mean simply writing or saying something that offends some group of strident tweeters.

Agents hate morality clauses because terms like ""public condemnation"" are vague and open to abuse, especially if a publisher is looking for an excuse to back out of its contractual obligations. When I asked writers about morality clauses, on the other hand, most of them had no idea what I was talking about. You'd be surprised at how many don't read the small print.

One writer who did was the fantasy and science-fiction novelist Ursula K. Le Guin, who died last year. When she discovered the morality clause in her HarperCollins contract in 2011, she posted on her blog a satirical letter from a fictional writer confessing sins to Rupert Murdoch, who owns the company: ""It was nothing really materially damaging, only just the money and I.D. I stole from the old man with the walker and some things I said about some schoolgirls with big tits."" Please, the letter went on, don't ""make me pay back the money because I can't because I already had to give most of it to some stupid lawyer who said I had defaulted on a loan and was behind on my child support, which is just a lie. That stupid brat was never mine.""

Jeannie Suk Gersen, a Harvard Law School professor who writes regularly for The New Yorker, a Condé Nast magazine, read the small print, too, and thought: ""No way. I'm not signing that."" Ms. Gersen, an expert in the laws regulating sexuality, often takes stands that may offend the magazine's liberal readers, as when she defended Education Secretary Betsy DeVos's rollback of Obama-era rules on campus sexual-assault accusations. When I called Ms. Gersen in November, she said, ""No person who is engaged in creative expressive activity should be signing one of these.""

It's not that a company should have to keep on staff a murderer or rapist, she added. But when the trigger for termination could be a Twitter storm or a letter-writing campaign, she said, ""I think it would have a very significant chilling effect.""

Masha Gessen, another New Yorker writer, also said she wouldn't sign her new contract, at least not as it was originally worded. Ms. Gessen, a Russian-American journalist who won the 2017 National Book Award for ""The Future Is History,"" about the return of totalitarianism in post-Communist Russia, has spent her career challenging prevailing nostrums.

Last year, as prominent men fell like bowling pins after being accused of sexual misconduct, Ms. Gessen published columns on the New Yorker website describing the #MeToo movement as an out-of-control ""moral panic"" bent on policing sexual behavior by mob justice. Needless to say, many readers did not agree.

""I'm extremely uncomfortable with it,"" Ms. Gessen said about the contract, ""because I have in the past been vilified on social media."" Having once been fired from a job as the director of Radio Liberty in Russia after what she called a disinformation campaign, she added, ""I know what it's like to lose institutional support when you most need it.""

Both Ms. Gersen's and Ms. Gessen's agents got Condé Nast to tone down the language that offended them, and the writers have now signed. Ms. Gessen's agent made Condé Nast acknowledge ""that I have expressed controversial views,"" Ms. Gessen said, and the morality clause now states that it can't be invoked as ""the result of my professional work."" By ""professional work,"" she added, she meant public events or posts on social media in addition to her writing.

Ms. Gessen said she felt she could stand up to Condé Nast because she has clout. She worries that younger or less famous writers won't be as empowered.

I share that concern. Over the past four years, I've published articles criticizing the concept of safe spaces and deploring the lack of due process in campus rape hearings. I've been called transphobic for an essay I wrote in 2016 about the tension between transgender rights and the right to privacy, and I'm still being called that. If I'd had a book contract with a morality clause when I wrote those, I might have thought twice before indulging my fondness for picking fights.

It's impossible to say how many novelists and journalists have fallen afoul of morality clauses, or, indeed, if any of them have. No one I talked to could or would name a case.

In 2017, Simon & Schuster canceled a book by the professional provocateur Milo Yiannopoulos after he gave an interview in which he appeared to condone pedophilia. His contract reportedly did not include a morality clause, and he sued, though he later dropped the suit. If a morality clause did lead to a book's cancellation, we probably wouldn't know it, according to Devereux Chatillon, a partner in the media and intellectual property law firm Chatillon Weiss who has represented both The New Yorker and writers. ""It wouldn't be public unless somebody sued over it,"" she said. And even then, the lawsuit probably wouldn't come to light.

Morality clauses may be relatively new to mainstream publishing, but they have a long history. The entertainment industry started drafting them in 1921, when the silent-movie star Fatty Arbuckle, who had just signed a then-astonishing $1 million contract with Paramount Pictures, was accused of the rape and manslaughter of a girl at a party. Mr. Arbuckle was acquitted after two mistrials, but by then the public had soured on him, and the studios wanted out.

Today the clauses are widespread in sports, television and advertising. Religious publishers have used them for at least 15 years, which seems fair enough. You can't condemn a Christian publisher that cancels publication of a book called ""The Ridiculously Good Marriage"" after the author is accused of having sexually assaulted an underage girl when he was a youth pastor. (He apologized for a ""sexual incident."") Children's publishers have been including the clauses for a decade or more, and they, too, have a case. It would be challenging to sell a children's book written by a pedophile.

Maybe you don't find morality clauses alarming under any circumstances. ""If what you're selling me is your reputation, if that's what I'm paying you for, then I should not have to pay you"" if your reputation tanks, said Rick Kurnit, a partner in Frankfurt Kurnit Klein & Selz, a firm specializing in art and entertainment law.

Maybe you're asking: Why should anyone get away with being a racist or sexist jerk? What gives Mr. Alexie, accused of hitting on women who saw him as a mentor, and Mr. Díaz, accused of forcibly kissing someone, the right to have their books published? Or even: Why should opinion writers be allowed to gratuitously insult duly elected officials? If a loudmouth suffers from a backlash, this reasoning goes, he probably deserves it.

The problem with letting publishers back out of contracts with noncelebrity, nonreligious, non-children's book authors on the grounds of immorality is that immorality is a slippery concept. Publishers have little incentive to clarify what they mean by it, and the public is fickle in what it takes umbrage at.

In 1947, the concern was Communism, and morality clauses gave studios a way to blacklist the Hollywood 10, a group of directors and screenwriters who denounced the House Un-American Activities Committee as illegitimate and refused to say whether they'd ever been Communists. All 10 went to jail, and all but one, who decided to cooperate with the committee, became unemployable until the 1960s, though some continued to write under pseudonyms.

Not long ago, publishers were hailed as countercultural heroes for backing works that offended public sensibilities. Barney Rosset, the publisher of Grove Press, introduced Americans to Samuel Beckett, Jack Kerouac, Malcolm X, Marguerite Duras and Kathy Acker, among scores of other writers considered avant-garde at the time.

Mr. Rosset fought doggedly to overturn laws that were preventing him from publishing D.H. Lawrence's ""Lady Chatterley's Lover"" and Henry Miller's ""Tropic of Cancer,"" both of which contained scenes of graphic sex. The ""Tropic of Cancer"" case made it to the Supreme Court, which ruled that the book was not obscene. The feminist critic Kate Millet attacked Henry Miller's novels as misogynistic -- she was quite right about that -- but that didn't stop the PEN American Center from awarding Mr. Rosset a citation for ""the free transmission of the printed word across the barriers of poverty, ignorance, censorship and repression.""

Times change; norms change with them. Morality clauses hand the power to censor to publishers, not the government, so they don't violate the constitutional right to free speech. But that power is still dangerous.

After our conversation, Ms. Gersen sent me an email pointing out a possible unintended consequence of the Condé Nast clause. Who are the groups subjected to the most public vitriol for their published work, she asked? Who is most viciously trolled? Women and members of minorities. ""That is one of the realities of publishing while a woman or minority in this age,"" she wrote. ""The clause is perversely posing more career risk to women and minorities than to white males.""

If all it takes to lose a magazine gig or book deal is to fall into ""public disrepute,"" it won't be only villains whose voices are lost.

It's Friday.

Weather: Something for everyone: buckets of warmish rain today with a high of 56, sunny on Saturday, cold on Sunday, raw and rainy on New Year's Eve.

Alternate-side parking: in effect till New Year's Day.

For a few minutes last night, it seemed as if the world was ending.

Around 9:12 p.m., the sky over New York City turned several shades of bright fluorescent blue. There was smoke and a loud hum. People freaked out on social media, wondering if aliens had invaded. La Guardia Airport went dark.

The culprit turned out to be an explosion at a Con Edison plant in Queens. Miraculously, there were no injuries, except perhaps to the feelings of those who truly wanted to meet some aliens.

[Read the full story on the explosion.]

Times reporters will be following the story all day, so check back for updates.

For now, here's what we know:

* The cause: Mayor Bill de Blasio said the light was caused by an ""electrical surge"" at a Con Ed substation in Astoria, at the northern tip of Queens.

A Con Edison spokesman, Bob McGee, said early this morning: ""What people were seeing was an electric arc flash. The electrical arc of that magnitude is similar to a thunder and lightning event."" The sound people heard was ""the arc striking the ground.""

The Police Department described it, bluntly, as a ""transformer explosion."" The reason for the explosion remained unclear this morning.

* The impact: Power was shut down at La Guardia Airport, near the plant, for about 45 minutes and flights were grounded. A few dozen homes briefly lost power.

The No. 7 subway line was partly, and briefly, shut down.

* How the city responded: With some fear and lots of humor on social media.

Besides those inevitable jokes about an alien invasion, there were also comparisons to the movie ""Ghostbusters,"" and someone guessed this was part of the third season of ""Stranger Things.""

Metropolitan Diary: Train reading

Dear Diary:

I lament not seeing what people read on the subway anymore.

I believe people do still read (although the weaker among us slip into gaming and video images). I just notice it less because I cannot see what's on their devices. Somehow it feels too nosy to look at a device. A book or a newspaper seemed less private.

I miss seeing the racing sheet, the Polish-language press, the Chinese shopping circular.

I miss looking at the scripts read by actors, even though to this day I still see their lips move as they rehearse their lines.

174,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/18/opinion/2020-primary-polls-wrong.html,"Promise me something: Over the coming weeks, whenever you hear a pundit or read a poll on the subject of who the 2020 Democratic nominee might be, you'll flash back four years. You'll remember predictions about the Republican nominee at this same point before the 2016 election.

Republicans then were in a situation similar to the one that Democrats are in now. More than a dozen candidates were poised to run. And in December 2014, CNN/ORC published the results of a survey that sought to determine which of them had the most support and the best chance.

The answer was not Donald Trump.

""Jeb Bush is the clear Republican presidential front-runner, surging to the front of the potential G.O.P. pack,"" read the story on CNN's website.

Surging. Jeb!

He had the support of 23 percent of respondents. That put him fully 10 points ahead of his nearest competitor, who was ... Chris Christie. Next came Ben Carson, followed by Rand Paul and Mike Huckabee.

Need I remind anyone how that fearsome five fared?

We political junkies got far ahead of ourselves then, and we're getting ahead of ourselves now. Almost 23 months before the 2020 election, we're handicapping contenders, edging toward prophecies and setting ourselves up to look every bit as foolish as we deserve to. We don't learn. That would get in the way of a guessing game that we relish too much.

Polls are being done at an accelerating pace. CNN released one late last week. It surveyed Democratic voters nationwide, among whom Joe Biden ranked first; Bernie Sanders, second; and Beto O'Rourke, third. So they're the Bush, Christie and Carson analogues. If 2014 is any guide, they should spare themselves a lot of travel and a world of heartache and pack it in now.

Of course, 2014 isn't a guide, but it's a caveat. A reality check. Assessments of candidates at this early stage have limited bearing on how well they'll be doing more than a year down the road, when the Iowa caucuses kick off the primary season. Too little has happened so far. Too much will happen in fairly short order.

At this juncture back then, Trump's candidacy wasn't even anticipated. Pollsters didn't present his name to Republican voters as an option. That remained true in February 2015, when someone new did challenge Bush for front-runner status and then briefly wrest it from him: Scott Walker. If you forgot about his supposedly big promise, no wonder. His campaign wouldn't last until the end of that year.

Trump finally came onto the radar and earned inclusion in polls around May 2015 -- five months further into the process than where we are now. But he didn't take the lead even then. In a Quinnipiac poll of Republican voters released on May 28, 2015, he placed eighth, just behind Ted Cruz. Cruz would be the only one, in the end, to give him any competition for the nomination.

While the 2016 presidential race was messy, it wasn't a complete anomaly. The 2008 race, for example, looked very different this far ahead of Election Day than it did in the homestretch. A CNN/ORC poll in December 2006 showed that among Democrats, Hillary Clinton had more than double the support that Barack Obama did.

She remained 14 points ahead of him three months later, in a USA Today/Gallup poll that established an even more commanding front-runner on the Republican side: Rudy Giuliani. Republicans preferred him to John McCain by a margin of 44 percent to 20 percent. McCain, obviously, went on to become the nominee. Giuliani exited the contest in January 2008.

The volatility partly reflects how little attention most voters pay to the nomination contests until much later on. But it's also a function of how much about the candidates remains unknown or has yet to emerge.

Sure, most of them have been vetted somewhat during prior runs for office. But whatever scrutiny they received, and whatever pressure they felt, pale next to the withering spotlight of a presidential bid. Previously overlooked discrepancies between their images and their reality will emerge; so will secrets. They'll teeter, some of them. Others will implode. Just ask such short-lived hopefuls as Giuliani, Howard Dean and John Edwards.

Already I'm hearing debates about O'Rourke's true politics that weren't a big factor in his recently concluded Senate race; if he runs for president, he'll have to explain a tension between his relatively moderate reputation in Congress and a more progressive tilt on the campaign trail.

Already Elizabeth Warren is suffering from an intensity of second-guessing that wasn't there before she released her DNA test about two months ago. Maybe it's a blip. Maybe not.

We think we know a lot about these candidates, and we do: their basic biographies, their professional accomplishments, their fluency so far at the microphone and in interviews.

But we don't have the most consequential information of all, at least in terms of their presidential ambitions. With the exception perhaps of Warren, who has given recent speeches on foreign policy and racial justice, we haven't heard the specific, boiled-down cases for themselves -- and their prescriptions for the country's future -- that they'll present to American voters. We don't know how persuasively they'll communicate that. And we haven't been able to judge how well it complements what voters are hungriest for now.

Trump is instructive. The phenomenon of his candidacy had everything to do with what he said when he came down that escalator in Trump Tower on June 16, 2015. He delivered a racially charged, anti-immigrant message with surprising resonance, and he did so -- not just then but in the months afterward -- with an unapologetic bluntness that many listeners interpreted as strength. That wasn't easily foreseeable and, for the most part, it wasn't foreseen.

Biden's, Sanders's and O'Rourke's strong showing in current polls isn't wholly irrelevant. It will help them with fund-raising. It will direct more media attention their way. It demonstrates that they've crossed the all-important threshold of widespread name recognition.

I was joking when I suggested that it spelled doom. But they shouldn't be too encouraged by it. And the rest of us shouldn't use it to write off other candidates.

175,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/24/us/politics/texas-judge-obamacare.html,"WASHINGTON -- When lawyers for Texas and 19 other states were deciding where to file a lawsuit seeking to wipe out President Barack Obama's health care law, they had many choices. But they settled on a federal courthouse in Fort Worth, Tex.

Forum shopping in litigation is common, and liberal lawyers challenging Trump administration initiatives like to file their cases in places like San Francisco or Brooklyn. But the lawyers in the health care case did more than choose a venue where the mix of judges was likely to include ones apt to favor their arguments. They effectively chose their own judge.

That is because there is only one active judge in the Fort Worth Division of the Federal District Court for the Northern District of Texas. He is Judge Reed O'Connor, and he has quite a track record.

He ruled for Texas in 2015 when it challenged an Obama administration measure extending family leave benefits to married same-sex couples. That decision came two years after the Supreme Court extended federal benefits to such couples and just months before the court established a constitutional right to same-sex marriage nationwide.

He also ruled for Texas in 2016, blocking the Obama administration from enforcing guidelines expanding restroom access for transgender students.

And this month he accepted Texas's arguments that the entire 2010 health care law was rendered unlawful by a 2017 congressional action adjusting one of its provisions.

Since 2015, The Texas Tribune found, Judge O'Connor has heard almost half of the state's suits against the federal government filed in federal court in Texas.

A new article in The Columbia Human Rights Law Review by Alex Botoman called for an end to such judge shopping.

""As long as court procedures allow politically motivated litigants to pick their judges, the judiciary risks enabling, rather than combating, the growing view that judges are mere political actors,"" he wrote. ""That is a risk that a country committed to an independent judiciary can ill afford to take.""

Mr. Botoman, a recent graduate of Columbia Law School who is now serving as a law clerk to a federal judge, drew a distinction between forum shopping and judge shopping. Congress created 94 federal judicial districts. Were cases filed in those districts randomly assigned, litigants would have no assurance of being heard by a particular judge.

There are, for instance, 12 authorized judgeships in Judge O'Connor's district, the Northern District of Texas.

The problem arises because districts are typically subdivided into geographical divisions. By itself, that is a harmless convenience, allowing litigants to avoid traveling hundreds of miles to courthouses in remote parts of sprawling districts.

But some courts also assign particular judges to particular divisions. Some also let litigants file their cases in any division of the district. That combination allows plaintiffs to choose their own judges.

The problem is common, Mr. Botoman found. In at least 81 divisions in 30 district courts, he wrote, one or two judges hear all of the division's cases. In districts that let plaintiffs sue wherever they like, he wrote, ""having divisions with only a few assigned judges makes it easy for plaintiffs to judge shop.""

A few courts make exceptions in politically charged cases, requiring them to be assigned at random across all of the district's judges. That approach could serve as a model, Mr. Botoman wrote.

""While judge shopping is always concerning, in cases between two private parties, any hardships that can be attributed to a judge-shopped outcome are typically borne only by the parties to the case,"" Mr. Botoman wrote. ""But challenges to laws and regulations are different.""

""Because the effects of these cases are felt well beyond the original parties,"" he wrote, ""it is especially important to ensure that judge assignments are made with the highest degree of impartiality.""

Such a change would not be hard to achieve, Jonas Anderson, a law professor at American University, wrote in a 2016 article urging action to prevent judge shopping in patent cases in the Eastern District of Texas. No congressional action was needed, he wrote, as courts have great discretion in deciding how to allocate cases within their districts.

""The court itself can make this assignment procedure change with a simple memo from the chief judge,"" Professor Anderson wrote.

There was a small sign of change along those lines in Judge O'Connor's district not long ago.

Texas filed the family leave and transgender cases, along with several other challenges to federal programs, in the Northern District's Wichita Falls Division. At the time, Judge O'Connor was the only judge in the division.

In 2016, Chief Judge Barbara M. G. Lynn, an appointee of President Bill Clinton, took a modest step to constrain Judge O'Connor's power, announcing that she would handle 15 percent of the civil cases filed in the Wichita Falls Division, to be assigned randomly.

After that, Texas filed two cases against the federal government, including the one challenging the health care law, in the Fort Worth Division, where Judge O'Connor is the only active judge, along with two semiretired ones. He heard both cases."
176,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/25/us/politics/rhinos-poachers-south-africa-czub.html,"HOEDSPRUIT, South Africa -- High-powered hunting rifles are the tools of the trade for poachers in South Africa and Mozambique. Steady and deadly accurate, the rifles are capable of dropping a rhinoceros with one shot from long distances, and are a major reason the rhinos in those African countries, highly valued for their horns, are dwindling toward extinction.

Three years ago, Sandy McDonald began finding the rifles, left behind by poachers, scattered near the dead rhinos he found in the game reserve he owns in Mozambique, just across the border from South Africa.

Mr. McDonald immediately recognized the weapons. They were .375-caliber Safari Classics, made by CZUB or just CZ, a firearms manufacturer based in the Czech Republic. Upon closer inspection, Mr. McDonald noticed something else on the rifles. Carved into the metal were the words ""CZ-USA, Kansas City, KS,"" suggesting that the weapons were from the American subsidiary of the arms company.

""Coming from a firearms background I recognized that these were rifles that are quite common in the U.S.,"" Mr. McDonald said. ""It left me wondering how they got out of the U.S. and into the hands of Mozambican poaching syndicates.""

His question is at the heart of multiple investigations by a congressional committee and an array of federal agencies into whether an American gun manufacturer has become entangled in the shadowy and illegal world of arms smuggling and wildlife poaching that both President Trump and former President Barack Obama have committed to combating. Neither CZ nor its American subsidiary has been accused of a crime by federal authorities.

In a 2013 executive order, Mr. Obama called wildlife trafficking a national security issue because of its devastation of African wildlife and its destabilizing effect on local communities. Another order signed by Mr. Trump last year directed law enforcement agencies to increase their efforts to dismantle transnational smuggling organizations, including wildlife traffickers.

The American government has also stationed law enforcement officers from the United States Fish and Wildlife Service in several African countries, including Botswana, to help local officials fight poachers. Over all, the American government spends about $150 million a year in efforts to fight wildlife trafficking and poaching.

Now agents from the Commerce Department and the Department of Homeland Security are investigating whether CZ or its subsidiary violated American laws by exporting rifles to Mozambique and whether the company continued to sell weapons even after being warned as early as 2015 that the rifles were used by poachers to kill protected wildlife in South Africa.

This fall, the House Foreign Affairs Committee began its own investigation into the use of possible illegally exported rifles in poaching crimes, requesting from federal agencies ""any and all information related to CZUB and its subsidiary CZ-USA and the selling of rifles to transnational criminal organizations,"" according to a staff member on the committee, who spoke on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk publicly about the investigation.

A United States law enforcement official said as many as 100 Safari Classics found on African game reserves appear to have been manufactured by CZ-USA, which is based in Kansas City, Kan.

But CZ officials said the guns that were found at poaching scenes were manufactured in the Czech Republic, not the United States. The company denied that any of the rifles came from its subsidiary in the United States -- or that it had done anything wrong. And company officials said the weapons were legally sold to suppliers in Mozambique.

""Although the firearms were marked 'CZ-USA,' the U.S. entity CZ-USA had nothing to do with the rifles,"" Petr Kallus, a company executive, wrote in a response to questions from The New York Times. ""Rather, the marking 'CZ-USA' was applied to the rifles by CZUB as an international brand name only.""

Mr. Kallus also said the company ceased delivery of firearms after being told that the firearms shipped to Mozambique had been used in wildlife crimes. (An American law enforcement official confirmed that the company stopped selling weapons but said it was only after the company was warned that it could be added to one of several government lists of bad corporate actors.)

Wherever they are made, the weapons have had a disastrous effect -- the latest factor in the precipitous decline in the worldwide rhino population from 500,000 in the early 20th century to fewer than 30,000 today, with the vast majority in South Africa.

A 2015 report by Small Arms Survey, a Switzerland-based research group, showed that the free flow of high-powered rifles and other weapons in Africa has significantly increased the scale of poaching. In turn, that has bolstered the illicit arms trade.

Protrack, a private anti-poaching company, began finding the CZ rifles near rhino carcasses as early as 2011. ""We didn't see this level of poaching until these high-powered rifles were introduced into the system,"" said Vincent Barkas, Protrack's owner.

Police records and incident reports from similar anti-poaching watchdogs indicate that 90 percent of all weapons found at wildlife crime scenes in South Africa and Mozambique since then were CZ rifles.

As the number of rifles found at wildlife crime scenes soared, alarmed conservation and anti-poaching groups reached out to Kathi Lynn Austin, a former United Nations arms-trafficking expert who had worked on the investigation of Viktor Bout, the notorious Russian arms dealer. Ms. Austin is executive director of the Conflict Awareness Project, an organization that investigates international arms trafficking.

Over the next two years, and armed with incident reports, interviews, rifle serial numbers, shipping receipts and other records, Ms. Austin pieced together the trail of the rifles sold from CZ as they made their way into the hands of poachers. Her findings were the basis of the government investigations now underway.

""Millions of dollars were being poured into anti-poaching efforts, including arming rangers and private companies with more and more weapons, which had just created an arms race,"" Ms. Austin said in a recent interview. ""But not one was tracing the source of the guns found on the poachers or at the scene of the crime.""

In 2016, Ms. Austin, attended a gun show in Las Vegas after learning that CZ-USA officials would be there. Ms. Austin said she observed CZ and CZ-USA company representatives meeting with several Mozambican companies. She had earlier traced several weapons CZ sold to those companies that were later found at poaching crime scenes in South Africa.

Ms. Austin said she later met with a whistle-blower from one of the companies who shared with her emails between the company and CZ sales offices. It is unclear if the weapons were sold from the parent company or its American subsidiary. Ms. Austin also shared emails with The Times showing that she had warned CZ-USA that weapons with the company's markings were showing up at wildlife crime scenes in South Africa.

""CZ and its American subsidiary, at a minimum, knew that the weapons it was selling were being used for poaching,"" Ms. Austin said in an interview. ""They knew and continued to look the other way as dozens, perhaps hundreds, of their weapons continued to show up in the hands of poachers.""

Emails obtained by Ms. Austin and federal investigators show that the Czech company was made aware that Safari Classics with the Kansas branding were used to poach rhinos at least as early as May 2015. Ms. Austin said she personally met with company officials and told them that their weapons were being used in wildlife crimes.

If the weapons were manufactured in the United States, American export laws would have required CZ-USA to have a license to sell them outside the United States and to provide detailed accounting of their buyers. Federal investigators are looking into whether the weapons were actually made in the United States and not in the Czech Republic, as the parent company says.

But while company officials insist that all Safari Classics that are for export are made in the Czech Republic, CZ-USA's own sales catalogs advertise rifles that are built to order by Triple River Gunsmithing, a small family-owned company in Warsaw, Mo.

Meagan Satrang, a gunsmith and the daughter of the store owner, Harlan Satrang, confirmed in an interview that the company has built Safari Classic models since 2004.

Only recently, she said, did she learn that two models of the Safari Classic -- the .416-caliber and the .375-caliber -- are built by CZ manufacturers abroad, she said.

""But they shouldn't have the U.S. markings on them,"" Ms. Satrang said.

In emailed answers to questions posed by The Times, CZ executives gave a different explanation for how the Safari Classics are made. The company said all of the weapons were manufactured in the Czech Republic, and the American markings were added to the Safari Classics there.

CZ executives said a limited number of the Safari Classics are made specifically for the American market and stamped with the Kansas branding. But since CZ-USA was not able to place orders for all the rifles that the parent company makes for the American market, Mr. Kallus said, some of the weapons were instead sold to customers elsewhere in the world, including in Mozambique.

Mr. Kallus insisted that even though the weapons were intended for sale in the United States, they were never shipped into the country. He added that once the weapons are sold, the company has no legal responsibility, and said that CZ was cooperating with law enforcement officials.

CZ said some of the rifles sold in the United States could have been brought to Mozambique and South Africa by hunters. Ms. Austin agreed that hunters could have left some of their Safari Classics behind; American hunters can take their weapons to another country if they file documentation to temporarily export a personally owned firearm for hunting.

But Ms. Austin said given that the vast majority of the hundreds of CZ-USA rifles that have been recovered at poaching sites were traced to gun sales in Mozambique, it is unlikely they were all left by hunters.

""All of these weapons didn't come from hunters,"" Ms. Austin said. ""The records just don't show that."""
177,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/30/us/politics/lindsey-graham-syria-trump.html,"Senator Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, a vocal Republican critic of President Trump's plan for a 30-day troop withdrawal of American troops from Syria, suggested on Sunday that the pullout had been slowed and that he felt ""a lot better"" about it after a lunch with the president.

""I think we're in a pause situation where we are re-evaluating what's the best way to achieve the president's objective of having people pay more and do more,"" Mr. Graham said.

He did not elaborate on what that meant. But he may have been referring to assurances that Mr. Trump is said to have given some military officials that they can have more time than 30 days to ensure a proper drawdown of troops.

Mr. Trump's surprise announcement on Twitter this month that he planned to withdraw the 2,000 American troops in Syria over the advice of military officials drew strong objections from many of his usual allies, like Mr. Graham, and helped prompt Defense Secretary Jim Mattis to resign.

Mr. Graham told reporters outside the West Wing entrance Sunday afternoon that he and the president had had a frank discussion over lunch.

""We talked about Syria and he told me some things that I didn't know that make me feel a lot better about where we're headed in Syria,"" Mr. Graham said. ""He promised to destroy ISIS. He's going to keep that promise. We're not there yet, but as I said today, we're inside the 10-yard line and the president understands the need to finish the job.""

Mr. Graham told reporters that Mr. Trump was ""worried about Iranian influence and the potential dangers to Israel from having a superhighway from Beirut to Tehran in terms of delivering weapons into Lebanon, and he'll be talking to Turkey about making sure we don't have a war between the Turks and our allies the Kurds.""

In an appearance on CNN's ""State of the Union"" before the lunch, Mr. Graham issued a starker warning about the threat to the Kurds, who are allied with the United States but whom Turkey regards as insurgents.

""If we leave now, the Kurds are going to get slaughtered,"" Mr. Graham said, adding: ""The president is reconsidering how we do this. He's frustrated, I get that.""

White House officials declined to comment on Mr. Graham's remarks. Lt. Col. Carla Gleason, a Pentagon spokeswoman, had said in an email Saturday that the Defense Department would not discuss ""operational details,"" but was ""focused on a deliberate and controlled withdrawal of forces, taking all measures possible to ensure our troops' safety while they finish off the remnants of ISIS.""

Last week, officials announced that John R. Bolton, the national security adviser, would travel to Turkey and Israel soon to meet with officials there. The discussion about how the pullout from Syria is conducted is expected to continue during those visits.

Departing from Syria had been a campaign pledge of Mr. Trump's, and he had grudgingly agreed to remain for several more months in 2018 when he initially wanted the military to withdraw. He told reporters on the South Lawn of the White House that it was time for the troops to return.

""We've been fighting for a long time in Syria,"" Mr. Trump said. ""I've been president for almost two years, and we've really stepped it up. And we've won against ISIS.""

But the abrupt nature of Mr. Trump's order was the last straw in his frayed relationship with Mr. Mattis, who resigned after being unable to persuade the president to remain.

In an extraordinary rebuke of Mr. Trump's worldview, Mr. Mattis, a retired four-star general, wrote a resignation letter in which he took issue with the president's approach to international alliances and his apparent softness toward adversaries such as Russia.

In an interview on ABC News' ""This Week"" on Sunday, another retired four-star general, Stanley McChrystal, called the Mattis letter ""valuable"" as he spoke out against Mr. Trump.

""I think maybe it causes the American people to take pause and say, wait a minute, if we have someone who is as selfless and as committed as Jim Mattis resigns his position, walking away from all the responsibility he feels for every service member in our forces, and he does so in a public way like that, we ought to stop and say, O.K., why did he do it?"" said Mr. McChrystal, who led United States forces in Afghanistan but was forced out by President Barack Obama after unflattering comments about officials in his administration.

""We ought to ask what kind of commander in chief he had that Jim Mattis that, you know, the good Marine, felt he had to walk away,"" he added.

Mr. McChrystal described Mr. Trump as dishonest and immoral amid questioning from the host, Martha Raddatz, and said he hopes Americans would stop overlooking the president's failings because they liked certain policies he had enacted.

""I don't think he tells the truth,"" Mr. McChrystal said.

""What I would ask every American to do is, again, stand in front of that mirror and say, what are we about?"" he went on. ""Am I really willing to throw away or ignore some of the things that people do that are -- are pretty unacceptable, normally, just because they accomplish certain other things that we might like?""

Mr. McChrystal described Mr. Trump in starkly negative terms.

""If we want to be governed by someone we wouldn't do a business deal with because their -- their background is so shady, if we're willing to do that, then that's in conflict with who I think we are,"" he said. ""And so I think it's necessary at those times to take a stand."""
178,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/06/us/politics/joe-biden-2020-president.html,"WASHINGTON -- Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. is in the final stages of deciding whether to run for president and has told allies he is skeptical the other Democrats eyeing the White House can defeat President Trump, an assessment that foreshadows a clash between the veteran Washington insider and the more liberal and fresh-faced contenders for the party's 2020 nomination.

Many Democratic voters, and nearly all major Democratic donors, are keenly interested in Mr. Biden's plans because of their consuming focus on finding a candidate who can beat a president they believe represents a threat to American democracy. But there is also a rising demand in the party for a more progressive standard-bearer who reflects the increasingly diverse Democratic coalition.

Mr. Biden would instantly be the early front-runner if he ran, but he would have to bridge divides in a primary that would test whether Democrats are willing to embrace a moderate white man in his 70s if they view him as the best bet to oust Mr. Trump.

""He has the best chance of beating Trump, hands down,"" said Senator Tom Carper of Delaware, Mr. Biden's longtime friend and former colleague. ""On a scale of one to 10, that's probably about a 12 for us.""

Yet Mr. Biden's skepticism about the field could alienate female and minority voters who are excited that several women and African-Americans are expected to run. Nominating a white man may also roil some Democrats who are already torn about whether a woman could win in 2020 after Hillary Clinton's loss. And Mr. Biden's preoccupation with winning back blue-collar Midwestern whites could place him at odds with Democrats who see greater potential for growth in the highly educated suburbs and across the booming Sun Belt and upper South.

More broadly, debate around Mr. Biden's possible candidacy illustrates the dueling visions in the party and particularly the divisions between its pragmatic and liberal wing. Some Democrats are skeptical that a relatively moderate candidate like Mr. Biden, who has baggage like supporting the 1990s crime bill that is loathed on the left, would prevail in the primary with a message of unity and national healing rather than the fiery and uncompromising brand of populism that Democratic primary voters elevated in the midterm elections.

""In 2020, Biden-style centrism will become a toxic and losing brand of politics in Democratic primaries,"" said Waleed Shahid, a left-wing activist.

[Make sense of the people, issues and ideas shaping American politics with our newsletter.]

The 76-year-old former vice president, who leads the field in initial national and Iowa polls, has not yet told his allies that he has decided to run. And they emphasize that Mr. Biden's decision will not be final until he says it for himself, noting that family considerations are central. Mr. Biden sought the presidency twice before but he has also considered it at least as many times before bowing out.

But Mr. Biden has indicated that he is leaning toward running and will most likely make a decision within the next two weeks, according to Democrats within and beyond his inner circle who have spoken to him recently.

The former vice president told a senior Democratic official last week that he is both likely to run and that his aides have told him he must move quickly in this primary, according to two Democrats briefed on the conversation.

Mr. Biden is under significant pressure from his party's major donors to make up his mind -- no later than the end of January -- or risk watching them migrate to other candidates. Mr. Biden and his advisers are highly sensitive to the criticism that in 2015, he dragged out his decision before ultimately opting out of the Democratic primary, exasperating his supporters and undermining the Democratic front-runner, Mrs. Clinton, in the process.

He spent some of his Christmas vacation in the Virgin Islands calling and texting his would-be supporters and is using this week to hold private meetings in Washington with Democratic officials.

In one of his calls over the holidays, Mr. Biden repeated a variation of a line he has used publicly: ""If you can persuade me there is somebody better who can win, I'm happy not to do it,"" he said, according to the Democrat he spoke to, who shared the conversation on condition of anonymity to discuss a private talk.

But then Mr. Biden said something he has not stated so bluntly in public: ""But I don't see the candidate who can clearly do what has to be done to win.""

In another possible sign that he is preparing to ramp up, an emissary from Mr. Biden recently reached out to James Smith, the Democratic Party nominee for governor in South Carolina last year, about scheduling a call with the former vice president. Mr. Smith, a state legislator and friend of Mr. Biden, said the former vice president could count on an enthusiastic reception in South Carolina if he were to run.

""In the circles that I move, I think there's almost unanimity of support for him,"" Mr. Smith said.

But Mr. Smith acknowledged that in Mr. Biden's absence, others were making moves in South Carolina. Mr. Smith said that after his defeat in November, he had heard from several contenders, including Senators Cory Booker of New Jersey, Kamala Harris of California and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts -- none of whom, he said, could count on scooping up Mr. Biden's network.

The entry of Mr. Biden would immediately upend the still-nascent primary: Ms. Warren joined the race last week and three dozen other Democrats are considering it. Mr. Biden could crowd out other establishment-aligned contenders like former Mayor Mitch Landrieu of New Orleans and former Gov. Terry McAuliffe of Virginia, given that Mr. Biden's donor base and supporters may overlap with some of their own. And Mr. Biden's allies are themselves mindful of another Democrat whose blue-collar credentials could pose a challenge to their own coalition: Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio.

Most of all, a Biden candidacy would also frame the primary around the question of whether Democrats prefer a familiar face and steady continuum of former President Barack Obama's center-left politics, or a generational change and turn to a more liberal, confrontational approach to Mr. Trump and the right.

Mr. Biden's supporters argue that Mr. Trump's incendiary conduct and norm-breaking presidency have so imperiled the country that only somebody with the stature and experience of a two-term vice president can bring back stability. And, they contend, Mr. Trump has diminished the importance of ideological differences within the Democratic Party.

""Variations in policy positions don't really matter because, to paraphrase the president, we are in a national emergency -- but the national emergency is him,"" said Lou Frillman, who was a major fund-raising bundler for Mr. Obama's campaigns and is close to Mr. Biden. ""The vice president has all the qualities necessary to win, and I think he has all the qualities the country is going to so desperately need to bring us back from the edge.""

Most of all, Mr. Biden's allies contend, he would be the Democrat most likely to reclaim the battleground state voters who abandoned the party in 2016.

""If you look at Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, the labor folks who voted for Trump, they love him,"" former Gov. Jack Markell of Delaware said of Mr. Biden. ""He has a connection with these people.""

Mr. Biden's enthusiasts are also quick to note that he is not just popular with white working-class voters, but is also well-liked among African-Americans and millennials.

Mr. Biden has led in national and early-state polling, drawing about a third of the vote, enough to make him a solid but not overwhelming front-runner at a moment when such surveys are heavily dependent on name identification. He is viewed favorably by the vast majority of Democrats, but some surveys indicate Democrats want fresh faces and new leadership.

Mr. Biden would portray himself as a progressive, embracing priorities like free public college tuition and expanding health care, advisers say. But he would also make the case that his 36 years in the Senate and eight years as vice president make him the best qualified to repair the damage they believe Mr. Trump has done at home and abroad.

""This is a guy who actually gets along with Mitch McConnell and a number of other Republicans,"" said Mr. Carper, invoking the Senate majority leader with whom Mr. Biden worked closely to negotiate a handful of agreements in the Obama years.

Yet the preferences of the party's donor class and an ability to work in a bipartisan fashion are hardly alluring to the party's increasingly liberal grass-roots activists and voters. And the candidacy of a Washington Democrat who fondly recalls his relationships with conservatives, and even used his speech bowing out of the 2016 race to make the case that Republicans are the opposition but not the enemy, may be ill-suited for the Trump era.

""We are at a time when we have a combative racist and often unhinged person in the White House, and that's not going to be answered with somebody who says: Let's come together and let's heal and let's all be gentle souls,"" said Representative Pramila Jayapal of Washington, who supported Senator Bernie Sanders for president in 2016.

Part of Mr. Biden's challenge would be what he represents as a septuagenarian who came of age in a consensus-oriented Senate dominated by white men, some of them segregationists, a political milieu as distant to millennial Democrats as the Civil War.

Should he run, Mr. Biden would quite likely face multiple major black candidates and no fewer than three prominent women. After the Democratic base elevated diversity to a first priority in the midterm elections, Mr. Biden would have little to offer voters determined to change the face of the presidency.

He would be counting, instead, on Democrats embracing a candidate from an ideologically and culturally traditional caste as an expedient for defeating Mr. Trump.

Perhaps just as daunting, Mr. Biden would have to answer for a political record stretching back nearly half a century. He has never faced the level of criticism from his fellow Democrats that he would earn as a leading candidate for president.

Mr. Biden has steadfastly supported important liberal priorities over the years, including gun control and labor rights, but he was also a loyal ally of the credit card industry as a senator from Delaware and backed a crime bill in the 1990s that is now seen by liberals as having forged a generation of mass incarceration.

In 1991, as chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Mr. Biden presided over the confirmation hearings of Justice Clarence Thomas, including the interrogation of Anita Hill by a panel of all-white and all-male senators. And in 2002, he voted to authorize the invasion of Iraq.

But he has said before that he is not alarmed about the indignity of ending his storied career by losing a primary.

Invoking the 2015 death of his eldest son, Beau, Mr. Biden wrote in his book ""Promise Me, Dad"" that he understood ""the difference between an electoral loss and real loss."""
179,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/21/us/politics/factcheck-trump-reagan-china-russia-border-isis.html,"What Trump Said

The facts

False.

Ronald Reagan made no attempts to build a border wall, according to biographers of the 40th president and journalists who covered the Reagan administration.

During a 1980 Republican primary debate, Reagan discussed illegal immigration and the United States' relationship with Mexico.

""Rather than making them, or talking about putting up a fence,"" he said, ""why don't we work out some recognition of our mutual problems and make it possible for them to come here legally, with a work permit, and then while they are working and earning here, they pay taxes here.""

Bob Spitz, the author of ""Reagan: An American Journey,"" said he was unaware of any other examples of Reagan discussing a border wall during his presidency. Mr. Spitz also pointed to the former president's farewell address, in which he envisioned the United States as a ""shining city upon a hill"" and ""if there had to be city walls, the walls had doors and the doors were open to anyone with the will and the heart to get here.""

""That was Ronald Reagan's America -- welcoming and inclusive,"" Mr. Spitz said. ""He knew that immigrants contributed to the fabric of American society and keeping them out was never a focus of his policy.""

Asked whether Reagan tried to build a border wall, H.W. Brands, a historian and the author of ""Reagan: The Life,"" simply replied, ""No, he did not.""

""The most famous line of his presidency was about tearing down walls -- 'Mr. Gorbachev, tear down this wall' -- not building them,"" Mr. Brands said.

And Kelly D. Barton, an archivist at the Ronald Reagan Library in Simi Valley, Calif., said he has ""not been able to find any indication of Reagan being directly involved in attempts to get a border fence/wall built.""

""The issue did not come up in any of his public speeches and statements as President, or any other source that I was able to check,"" Mr. Barton said Friday in an email to The New York Times.

What Trump Said

The facts

This is misleading.

Whether or not President Trump has been ""tougher"" on China and Russia than any other president is subjective. But it's worth pointing out that observers of American relations with both countries point to a disconnect between aggressive policies enacted by the Trump administration and not-so-tough language from Mr. Trump himself.

In his resignation letter on Thursday, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis emphasized that his views on ""treating allies with respect and also being clear-eyed about both malign actors and strategic competitors"" -- China and Russia, for example -- were not shared by Mr. Trump.

Cheng Li, a China expert at the Brookings Institution, said Mr. Trump was right in the sense that he has treated China as a strategic rival or enemy -- an unprecedented stance among the eight presidents who served after Richard M. Nixon opened diplomatic relations with Beijing.

But Mr. Li called Mr. Trump the ""least effective"" president in addressing the concerns he and his administration have raised about China, especially given the confusing signals the president sends.

During his November 2017 visit to Beijing, Mr. Trump touted his ""very good chemistry"" with President Xi Jinping of China and declined to blame China for the trade imbalance. Then, in January, the Trump administration imposed tariffs on solar panels and washing machines, aimed at China and South Korea before other rounds.

The meeting last month between Mr. Trump and Mr. Xi in Argentina was characterized as ""highly successful"" by the White House. The same night they met, the United States secured the arrest of a Chinese telecommunications company's chief financial officer.

Those actions, as well as other tariffs on Chinese imports, confrontations with Chinese ships in the South China Sea and a law requiring the State Department to punish Chinese officials who limit travel to Tibet would all qualify as ""tough."" At the same time, Mr. Li said, Mr. Trump has stopped short of rallying the world against China, as he promised to do during his 2016 presidential campaign.

On Russia, the Trump administration has indeed imposed sanctions, ordered a missile attack on Syria despite Moscow's opposition and approved arms sales to Ukraine -- actions that could be called ""tough.""

Yet Mr. Trump himself has repeatedly denied or played down Russia's interference in the 2016 election, contradicting his own intelligence agencies.

""My personal view is that his assertion would be laughable if it were not so dangerous,"" said Harley Balzer, a professor emeritus at Georgetown University and a Russia expert.

Withdrawing American troops from Syria, where Mr. Balzer said Russia has accused a humanitarian relief group of being terrorists, ""hardly sends a 'tough' message.""

This view seems to be shared by President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, who called Mr. Trump's decision to withdraw American forces from Syria ""correct.""

What Trump Said

The facts

This contradicts an earlier statement.

Ten days ago, Mr. Trump took full ownership of a potential government shutdown at a meeting with Representative Nancy Pelosi and Senator Chuck Schumer, the congressional Democratic leaders.

""I am proud to shut down the government for border security, Chuck, because the people of this country don't want criminals and people that have lots of problems and drugs pouring into our country,"" Mr. Trump said. ""So I will take the mantle. I will be the one to shut it down. I'm not going to blame you for it. The last time you shut it down, it didn't work. I will take the mantle of shutting down.""

What Trump Said

The facts

This is exaggerated.

The Islamic State, also known as ISIS, was established in 2004 under a different name, according to the National Counterterrorism Center. It rebounded in 2011 after civil war erupted in Syria and the American military withdrew from Iraq, and it began to control vast amounts of territory in both countries.

The American-led coalition against the extremist group did not begin until 2014. President Barack Obama was the only other American commander in chief to oversee military intervention against the Islamic State.

Under Mr. Trump's watch, almost all of the territory that was previously held by the Islamic State has been recaptured. But, as The Times explained in a previous fact-check, Mr. Trump has largely stuck with, and taken advantage of, a strategy that Mr. Obama began.

180,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/28/obituaries/richard-overton-dead.html,"Richard Overton, the nation's oldest World War II veteran, died on Thursday at a rehabilitation facility near his home in Austin, Tex. He was 112.

His death was confirmed by Shirley Overton, whose husband was Mr. Overton's cousin and his longtime caretaker. She said he had been hospitalized with pneumonia but was released on Christmas Eve.

Mr. Overton was in his 30s when he volunteered for the Army and was at Pearl Harbor just after the Japanese attack in 1941. He served in the all-black 1887th Engineer Aviation Battalion in the Pacific Theater.

Mr. Overton told The Austin American-Statesman in 2013 that combat helped his segregated unit gain acceptance.

""When we got out in the war, we were all together,"" he said. ""There wasn't no discrimination there. We were hugging each other -- darn near kissing each other."" Lives depended on it, he said.

After the war Mr. Overton returned to Austin, where he worked in a furniture store and as a courier at the state Capitol before retiring in his 80s.

Mr. Overton once said that one secret to his long life was smoking cigars and drinking whiskey, which he was often found doing on the porch of his home in Austin. In recent years his birthday drew national attention, and strangers would stop by his house to meet him.

In 2013 he met President Barack Obama at the White House, and Mr. Obama honored him at a Veterans Day ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery.

""He was there at Pearl Harbor, when the battleships were still smoldering,"" Mr. Obama said of Mr. Overton. ""He was there at Okinawa. He was there at Iwo Jima, where he said, 'I only got out of there by the grace of God.' ""

""When the war ended, Richard headed home to Texas to a nation bitterly divided by race,"" he continued. ""And his service on the battlefield was not always matched by the respect that he deserved at home. But this veteran held his head high. He carried on and lived his life with honor and dignity.""

Mr. Overton was born on May 11, 1906, near Austin. His grandfather was a slave in Tennessee who moved to Texas after emancipation, and Mr. Overton grew up amid the indignities and inequality of the segregated South.

Mr. Overton was married twice but had no children. Information about survivors was not immediately available.

He remained active until recently. This year he took a private tour of the National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington.

The Austin City Council recognized Mr. Overton's contributions to the state and country by proclaiming a day in his honor and ceremonially renaming the street he lived on after him.

In a statement on Thursday, Gov. Greg Abbott of Texas called him ""an American icon and Texas legend,"" adding, ""Richard Overton made us proud to be Texans and proud to be Americans."""
181,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/28/arts/obama-favorites-2018.html,"Former President Barack Obama on Friday shared some of the books, movies and music he found most inspiring or thought-provoking in 2018, including works that he ""just plain loved,"" compiling them into a year-end list posted on Facebook.

It was a wide-ranging list that included songs by artists as varied as Cardi B, Janelle Monáe and Nancy Wilson, who died this month. Unsurprisingly, ""Becoming,"" by Michelle Obama, topped his list of books, which featured multiple works by women and by authors of color.

Mr. Obama started sharing his reading lists and playlists during his presidency, and has continued that tradition into retirement. The selections are a carefully curated mix of works that have found critical acclaim or mainstream popularity, punctuated by nods to lesser-known artists.

Mr. Obama, an avid reader with a deep appreciation of pop culture, not only celebrated art during his presidency but also brought it into the White House.

There was the luncheon with the novelists Zadie Smith, Barbara Kingsolver, Junot Díaz, Dave Eggers and Colson Whitehead. Visits from numerous rappers and R&B singers including Common, John Legend and Queen Latifah. And the multicultural ""Jazz at the White House"" event in 2016.

In 2009, before Lin-Manuel Miranda was a household name, Mr. Obama invited him to a White House poetry jam, where he performed an early version of the opening song from ""Hamilton."" Mr. Miranda was invited back in 2016, along with his cast, to perform parts of the Broadway blockbuster for high school students.

A love of books has always been one of Mr. Obama's defining features. Nearly every night in the White House, he would read for an hour or so, The New York Times's former chief book critic, Michiko Kakutani, reported.

""Not since Lincoln has there been a president as fundamentally shaped -- in his life, convictions and outlook on the world -- by reading and writing as Barack Obama,"" Ms. Kakutani wrote.

Mr. Obama's Facebook post provided ""a chance to highlight talented authors, artists, and storytellers -- some who are household names and others who you may not have heard of before,"" he wrote.

Several of his favorite books, including ""There There,"" ""Asymmetry,"" and ""Frederick Douglass: Prophet of Freedom,"" appeared on The Times's list of the 10 best books of 2018.

182,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/28/style/daddy-dads-of-2018.html,"There's a scene in the second season of ""Riverdale"" (stay with me, folks) that could serve as an imperfect metaphor for 2018. The telltale signs of a town in collapse are crammed into 42 bracing minutes: rioting, gun violence, families torn apart, political secrets and sabotage. It all culminates in a face-off between good and evil, with the life of Riverdale High's golden boy at stake. Archie Andrews frequently delivers his neighbors from perilous scenarios disproportionate to their suburban surroundings, and this time it seems that only he can save himself. Until ... three ""hot Riverdale dads"" arrive on the scene, at once defusing the bloodthirsty tension and captivating the licentious imagination of onlookers. Amid total chaos, the thirst remains real.

And not just thirst for hot guys in general. After the ""dad bod"" debacle of 2015 and the so-called ""dad style"" that has been adopted by all genders in recent years, it seems we've reached peak ""daddy.""

A recent ""Saturday Night Live"" skit signaled that the word, used affectionately by children, and lustfully by gay men and straight women, had achieved a specific significance in the cultural mainstream: ""Any guy can be a father, but it takes a hot, middle-aged guy with a big job to be a daddy,"" Kate McKinnon and Matt Damon said in unison, as the hosts of a competition called the Westminster Daddy Show.

You might have noticed an uptick in aging heartthrobs of the '90s and early 2000s appearing in programs marketed to young viewers -- and receiving outsize attention for their (mostly supporting) roles. Consider Luke Perry in the aforementioned teen drama ""Riverdale,"" John Corbett in the Netflix rom-com ""To All the Boys I've Loved Before,"" John Cho in ""Searching,"" Sterling K. Brown in ""Black Panther"" and ""This Is Us,"" and Jude Law as Albus Dumbledore (or shall I say ""Dumbledaddy""?) in the latest ""Fantastic Beasts"" film.

In practice, age is not always a defining characteristic. A daddy might be any man with graying hair (see: the salt-and-peppery fitness entrepreneur Peter Kraus, 33, whom many American women hoped would lead the last season of ""The Bachelor""), or a beefy action-movie hero (Dwayne ""the Rock"" Johnson, for example, who also happens to be a father), or ... the mascot of a boxed cereal brand. (Tony, we're so sorry.)

While on the internet ""dad"" is most often used to express devotion to a cultural father figure, in the same way that ""mom"" emerged as a term of reverence for feminist patron saints, ""daddy"" has tended somewhat problematically toward the sexual. Barack Obama is ""dad."" Bill Murray is ""dad."" Idris Elba, People magazine's Sexiest Man Alive, is ""daddy."" Jeff Goldblum is ""daddy,"" and also sometimes ""zaddy."" You get the point.

Making the jump from ""dad"" to ""daddy"" can be as simple as a few minor lifestyle adjustments. On Netflix's popular ""Queer Eye"" reboot, the Fab Five turned its schlubby ""heroes"" into daddies -- or, at least, more dateable versions of themselves -- by grooming their beards and showing them how to make simple meals. (The show's first run was so successful that the streaming company released a second season less than six months after its premiere.)

That narrative, of male self-interrogation and self-improvement, aligns with a broader paternal revisionism that has permeated visual media in recent years. If you've watched an ad with a dad in it recently, you know that the couch-potato who can't cook or clean or wear pants that don't have an elastic waistband is a trope of the past. In the age of ""dadvertising,"" father-actors are, instead, competent, present, presentable, even mythic parents, and equal if not more hardworking partners. Those depictions are aligned with the optimistic, egalitarian standards the newest generation of fathers has set for themselves.

Accordingly, dads and daddies have become motifs of the ever-growing retail category that is merch. The cotton baseball cap, often used to express fandom, has been christened the ""dad hat,"" just as tapered light-wash denim is considered the quintessential ""dad jean."" There are $360 ""dad"" sweatshirts, dad hats inscribed with the word ""daddy,"" a video game whose objective is for dads to date each other ... you name it.

Rachel Antonoff, a fashion designer in New York, recalled a T-shirt from her fall 2017 collection inscribed with ""daddy"" in a Barbie-like script. Like most of her line's graphic tees, it was initially conceived as a piece of social commentary. ""I wanted to do a shirt that said 'No more daddy-daughter dance,'"" Ms. Antonoff said, to critique what she found to be ""an insanely heteronormative concept."" But her colleagues encouraged her to soften the message and create something more lighthearted. They landed on a design that was meant to be neither reverential nor incisive, but rather seen as ""funny, and a bit.""

It struck a chord with her customers, who are primarily women. But, she said, ""there were other people who were like, 'I'm a dad,' or 'my friend just had a baby.'""

Which is to say: It's 2018, and being a daddy is for everyone."
183,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/05/opinion/sunday/cubas-next-transformation.html,"Mr. Anderson is a journalist who has written extensively about Cuba.

On the 60th anniversary of the Cuban revolution, which the ruling Communist Party celebrated on Tuesday, the island nation is stable, having overcome such existential threats as the Bay of Pigs invasion in 1961, the Cuban missile crisis in 1962 and a half-century of diplomatic isolation and withering economic sanctions imposed by the United States.

Cuba has also weathered the collapse of the Soviet Union, its main Cold War benefactor, and a slew of traumatic internal ructions including the Mariel boatlift in 1980 and the Cuban raft exodus in 1994. Last but not least, Cuba has managed its first major political transitions, following the death in 2016 of its defining leader, Fidel Castro; the presidential retirement, last year, of his younger brother, Raúl Castro; and Raúl's succession in office by Miguel Díaz-Canel Bermúdez, a 58-year-old Communist Party loyalist.

For the first time since 1959, in other words, Cuba is ruled by someone other than a Castro, and it has handled the transition without the drama or bloodshed that many other revolutionary states have experienced after the death of their patriarchs.

The Cuban Communist system shows no sign of collapse. But the internal struggle over whether to have more democracy or continued dictatorship is well underway in Cuba, although it is not couched in those terms.

How that struggle is resolved will determine the nation's future. Although most of the debate is conducted in a rhetoric that is almost liturgical in its strictures, there is a growing space for differing points of view. It is increasingly clear that Cuban society is no longer -- if it ever was -- a homogeneous bloc of revolutionary workers willing to simply applaud or fall silent at the decisions of their leaders.

In a possible sign of change, Cubans will vote next month on a new Constitution to replace the country's Cold War-era charter. Several hundred changes were made to the draft to incorporate the views of Cubans who were consulted on proposed reforms. Not all of the changes are progressive: In response to apparent widespread public demand, a clause was dropped that would have explicitly allowed same-sex marriage; another alteration reinstated language that describes Cuba's ultimate political goal as ""advancing toward communism.""

There was also public pushback against a draft law prohibiting the accumulation of private property. In response, the government agreed to a compromise in which state regulators will decide what property can be owned case by case. Another recent decree that has generated resistance seeks to impose a system of prior official approval for cultural performances and of censorship of art determined to have ""immoral or vulgar"" content or which ""misuses patriotic symbols."" The government has agreed to step back aspects of the law.

This wrangling underscores the evolving struggle over the nature of the Cuban state. Some of the concerns raised about the draft Constitution clearly reflect the will of older Cubans, many of whom are socially conservative, have spent most of their lives living under Communism and constitute a growing percentage of the population. Other concerns point to the emerging self-confidence and clout of younger Cubans, increasing numbers of whom are involved in the country's new economy, known as cuentapropismo -- or self-employed work, which was authorized and significantly expanded during Raúl Castro's presidency.

Nowadays, cuentapropismo accounts for the work of nearly 600,000 people (about 13 percent of Cuba's work force) and arguably constitutes the most vibrant, innovative and lucrative part of the nation's economy. The tendency of the government, though, has been to try to slow down its growth. Recently, private taxi drivers went on an informal strike, an almost unheard-of action, after the government announced nettlesome new regulations for such drivers as well as plans for more public transportation.

A main concern of the government is how to sustain an economy that had a dismal 1.4 percent growth rate last year and how to maintain its free education and health systems as well as its food security and housing and job programs while balancing the budget.

But though most of the news coming out of Cuba nowadays is about economics, it is peppered with items that have an out-of-time quality. In December, for instance, there were headlines about how Cubans were going to get 3G on their mobile phones, an event prosaic in most Western countries but huge for Cubans, who were not allowed even to own cellphones until 2008, when Raúl Castro decreed that they could.

Another notable bit of news at year's end was that Cuba reached a new high in tourist visitors: 4.75 million. That figure is nearly double that of just four years ago, when President Barack Obama and Raúl Castro announced their diplomatic breakthrough, which restored relations between the United States and Cuba after a half-century's rupture.

In contrast to the Obama administration, the Trump administration has adopted a posture of hostility toward Cuba, imposing sanctions intended to deny financial investment in or assistance to Cuban businesses and institutions, including some tourist hotels and resorts, in which the Cuban military or intelligence services have a stake.

Relations between Washington and Havana have also deteriorated as a result of mysterious ""sonic attacks"" that have affected several dozen American and Canadian diplomats on the island since late 2016, bringing about a virtual shutdown of the United States diplomatic presence in Cuba. The State Department has moved its consular services for Cubans to its embassy in Guyana, 2,000 miles away. In the fall, the national security adviser, John Bolton, castigated Cuba, Nicaragua and Venezuela as a ""troika of tyranny"" and vowed to enact polices that would help bring down their governments.

While Cuba's official relationship with the United States remains precarious, the contacts between ordinary Cubans and Americans have generally deepened and improved. That Cubans are now able to own their own businesses and to travel -- something that required official permission just a decade ago -- means that they are less isolated and freer than they used to be.

All of this bodes well for the future of Cuba, although its rulers still need to be convinced that freedom of speech, assembly, art, literature and media is not to be feared. They will also need to continue to be shrewd in their dealings with the United States to avoid a repetition of the sort of containment polices that isolated them during the Cold War, and which are being used again today to isolate Nicolás Maduro's regime in Venezuela.

At a time when the United States can no longer lay claim to being the democratic bastion it once was, Cuba has an opportunity to compete, albeit on a much smaller scale. In much of the world, and for all its faults, Cuba is respected for its pluck in standing up to the American behemoth over the last half-century. Cuba is also beloved and admired for its international medical assistance program, for its prowess in music and dance, in art and in athletics. But such achievements are not enough to keep the island going.

To exist in a way that is not only about survival, Cuba needs to find a new role for itself. It can begin by seeking to avoid taking sides in a newly polarized world order.

Most immediately, that means rethinking its relationship with Venezuela and Nicaragua. Both are countries with which Cuba has longstanding ties and much shared history, but which have become increasingly repressive and are no longer friends to be proud of. Cuba need not betray its friends in order to do the right thing: It could deploy its considerable political and diplomatic resources to take a leadership role in ensuring that the political transitions necessary in Venezuela and Nicaragua be peaceful ones.

Cuba's rulers also need to continue to open up. Just as it did 60 years ago with a revolution that, for better or worse, helped reshape the modern world, Cuba can once again choose its own path, and once again be a leader among nations. It can choose to be more democratic. Now that would be truly revolutionary.

184,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/05/sunday-review/julian-castro-2020-president.html,"Last month, when Julián Castro filed the requisite paperwork to run for president, he had to add an accent over the a in Julián by hand. The Federal Election Commission apparently hadn't planned for a candidate with a Spanish name.

It's one of the many ways his candidacy as the only (so far) Latino in the Democratic 2020 field will make the country contemplate its future. Mr. Castro knows that he is the longest of long shots, but he is nothing if not a product of his hometown, San Antonio -- an often underestimated, predominantly Hispanic, American microcosm.

In recent years, some commentators on the right have expressed fear about what a ""majority minority"" country would look like. The answer is that it would most likely look a lot like San Antonio, where 64 percent of the city's 1.4 million residents are Hispanic and unemployment is below the national average.

After serving as mayor of San Antonio from 2009 to 2014, Mr. Castro, 44, became the secretary of housing and urban development under Barack Obama. But his strongest selling point as an antidote to President Trump and his immigrant bashing might be his runty, but wildly successful, experiment of a hometown.

""At this time when the nation feels so polarized, I saw exactly the opposite in my community,"" Mr. Castro told me. ""A place where people of different backgrounds generally got along very well together.""

San Antonio, 150 miles north of the Mexican border and 80 miles south of Austin, is a petri dish of the country's future. It's a place where wage growth has surpassed the national average, housing is 13 percent cheaper than the national average and those who earn the median household income of $56,774 can get a single-family home, access to a good public education and tickets to the occasional Spurs game.

The low cost of living and the healthy economy, bolstered by jobs in tech and cybersecurity, have made San Antonio the fastest-growing city in the country for the past several years, and given it the nation's second-fastest-growing population of millennials, according to the Brookings Institution. The number of residents is expected to double in the next 20 years, with 66 people added daily, according to census data.

Julián and his twin brother, Joaquin, who is a Democratic congressman representing the 20th District of Texas, graduated from San Antonio's public schools several years before I did. Tales of the overachieving twins were local folklore. Their images are painted on the walls of the Pico de Gallo Tex-Mex restaurant and in a mural at Mi Tierra Cafe y Panaderia, along with that of the slain Tejano singer Selena.

We share the same scrappy underdog attitude that comes with being from San Antonio, a working-class city flanked by military bases and overshadowed by Austin, its ritzier and (in my unpopular opinion) insufferable neighbor. The seventh-largest city in the country by population, San Antonio sprawls across 465 square miles of craggy terrain of mesquite trees and cactuses, giving it an unpretentious, small-town feel.

New Yorkers mostly know it as being the home of the Alamo. Sometimes they'll say to me, ""Oh, isn't there a river there?"" To which, I usually joke that, yes, as a matter of fact, it is the Venice of Texas. (It is nothing like Venice.) Even when the Spurs racked up national N.B.A. championships, the coastal sports media dismissed them as boring. (Luckily, another local hero, Coach Gregg Popovich, is around to belittle said national media.)

""We're not Houston or Dallas, we don't boast,"" said Leticia Van de Putte, a San Antonio native and former state senator who ran for lieutenant governor of Texas in 2014. ""We never give ourselves the 'atta boys' or 'atta girls,' it's not in our nature.""

If you spend enough time in San Antonio, it's hard not to run into one of the Castro brothers. (""Half the time they think I'm my brother,"" Julián Castro said). When we were both back home, Mr. Castro and I usually caught up over tacos, so, just before Christmas, when he was in New York, I met him at La Esquina, a taqueria in Midtown.

""Not as good as Texas, but not bad,"" Mr. Castro said, a cautious politician's verdict on the $4.99 barbacoa tacos that we both knew would have been fluffier and cost 99 cents in San Antonio.

We spent the first few minutes catching up on local gossip -- a mutual friend; The San Antonio Express-News holding a grudge because he didn't give it an exclusive about his plans to run. (""They put my story in the Metro section!"")

When asked by reporters why he was running, given that he hardly registers in the national polls, Mr. Castro talked about his hometown. ""I said, 'Go to my neighborhood that I grew up in -- nobody was the front-runner there,'"" he recalled. Mr. Castro will base his campaign in San Antonio, starting with a kickoff rally next Saturday.

Until recently, San Antonio was reliably red, but like much of the Southwest, it has been transformed into a battleground by its young and Latino population, bad news for Republicans fearing an increasingly purple Texas. In the midterms, every major statewide candidate, including Senator Ted Cruz and his Democratic opponent, Beto O'Rourke, poured resources into winning San Antonio.

""Julián's rising to the national stage is really symbolic of San Antonio's trajectory"" -- and, by extension, the country's, said Jenna Saucedo-Herrera, president and chief executive of the San Antonio Economic Development Foundation.

Part of Mr. Castro's candidacy will be educating voters about what it means to be an acculturated Mexican-American, identifying not with Mexico or ""los gringos,"" but as a uniquely American, comfortably hyphenated blend of the two.

After writing in the accent on his F.E.C. paperwork, Mr. Castro talked briefly with local reporters in the little yellow living room of his house on San Antonio's Northwest Side. The political press jumped on the painting of the Virgin of Guadalupe that hung behind Mr. Castro -- a sign he would be appealing to Latino voters! -- but Mr. Castro just calls that his living room.

It infuriates Mr. Castro that Republicans knock him for not speaking fluent Spanish. ""There's a stinging irony in that these people were saying you weren't good enough before because you didn't speak English well enough, and today, somehow you're not good enough because you don't speak Spanish well enough?"" he said.

In 1922, Mr. Castro's maternal grandmother emigrated from Coahuila, Mexico, to Eagle Pass, Tex., and worked as a maid. Like many children of immigrants, his mother, Rosie Castro, a civil rights activist and single mom, raised her own children to speak English.

For all its growth, San Antonio remains starkly divided by income. Mr. Castro's wife, Erica Lira Castro, works in the Harlingen Consolidated Independent School District on the city's South Side, where one in five people live below the poverty line and where she grew up.

Mr. Castro went from Jefferson High School, with a 95 percent Hispanic student body, to degrees from Stanford and Harvard Law. But we both are sometimes snubbed back home for not having attended Alamo Heights High School, the public school on the city's wealthier side of town. It's become this running joke.

In December, I asked Mr. Castro if he thought the joke would stick, now that he is preparing to run for president, and ready to make the case that San Antonio should be this country's future. He has accomplished so much already, we both laughed, without Alamo Heights.

""Oh, well,"" he said. ""Imagine what I could've been.""

185,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/05/opinion/sunday/nancy-pelosi-house-speaker.html,"On Thursday, Nancy Pelosi became the first person in 64 years to return to the position of speaker of the House of Representatives, completing the most startling comeback in American politics since Richard Nixon became president.

Her return says a great deal about Ms. Pelosi and about our politics, but above all it is a triumph of nerve and ability. Republicans have tried for years to make Ms. Pelosi's very name a curse. President Trump and members of his party have called her, among many other things, the promoter of a ""socialist agenda"" and the ""unhinged face"" of her party, while others have labeled her as both the ""San Francisco Democrat"" that she is, and a ""machine"" politician from Baltimore, where her father and an older brother both served as mayor.

The strategy seemed to be working. Through most of last year's midterm campaigns, many Democrats also warily avoided endorsing her, speaking instead of the need to embrace ""a new generation of leadership"" and replace a ""toxic brand."" But when the vote for speaker was over last week, there was Ms. Pelosi with gavel in hand again, having lost only 15 votes from her caucus.

How did this happen?

Qualifying for Congress today has come to seem more and more like the college admission process, where you pile up incredible achievements that will rarely benefit you on campus. The speakership, by contrast, is a place for pluggers. It's an odd post, rare in democratic politics, where one can serve simultaneously in opposition and the majority, leading your own party in the House while dealing with a president from the other side.

There have been political stars in the office. Henry Clay put in the second longest time there. James G. Blaine, ""the plumed knight"" of post-Civil War Republicans, held the post for nearly six years. Neither of them made it to the position they coveted, in the White House -- though the one former speaker who did become chief executive, James K. Polk, was the most successful one-term president in our history.

Say what you will about his agenda -- and a lot of people, then and now, had a lot to say -- Polk was a model of efficiency and won the Mexican War, nearly doubled the size of the United States, lowered tariffs and instituted an independent Treasury system before refusing to run for re-election and quietly dying three months after leaving office. A very speaker-like performance, when you think of it.

Ms. Pelosi, the only woman to be speaker, is also the first person to repeat in the office since Sam Rayburn, who served a record 17 years as speaker over three different stretches in the office, the last of which only ended with his death, in 1961. ""Mr. Sam,"" a moderate Texas Democrat, twice exchanged the speaker's gavel with his Republican counterpart, Joe Martin, a moderate Massachusetts conservative. This was back in a more parliamentary era, when no one considered the vagaries of voters in a national election to be a reason to kick out a perfectly able congressional leader.

Rayburn helped steer the country through World War II and much of the Cold War, served faithfully under Presidents Franklin Roosevelt, Harry Truman and Dwight Eisenhower; became a mentor to Lyndon Johnson; and insisted L.B.J. join the national ticket under John Kennedy. Rayburn also built up one of his successors, the diminutive Carl Albert from Oklahoma, who, after gaining the speakership, twice found himself first in the line of succession to the presidency during the Watergate scandals.

On each occasion, Albert did all he could to put others in place before him, believing, as he said on becoming speaker, ""I hope we will get together, and work for the country, and not work for the two political parties.""

Such a sentiment, not to mention the idea of stepping away from power for the good of the country, seems so alien to our politics today that it might have come from a different age. In light of such service, talk of toxic brands and a new generation of leaders seems misplaced.

Rayburn, Albert and Tip O'Neill -- who negotiated a key bill with President Ronald Reagan to preserve funding for Social Security -- formed the ideal of the modern speakership. They shaped policy, worked with presidents from either party, molded their successors and tried to move the wheel forward. They sought compromise but also tried to bring about what progress had to be made. Above all, they respected the institution they led, the most thoroughly democratic part of our national government.

It was a model that worked very well -- or at least it did until Newt Gingrich wrecked it, as he wrecked so much that he put his hand to. Mr. Gingrich's rebellion was aimed at cozy, low-level corruption and complacency, which certainly existed in the old speaker system. But his brand of self-aggrandizing hyperpartisanship proved exactly wrong as a corrective. Unable to conquer or to compromise, he ended up fleeing the Capitol engulfed in investigations and hounded by allegations about his own personal conduct.

Ms. Pelosi represents a restoration of that ideal, and she brings formidable talents and a legendary work ethic (back) to the job. In what was described as an ""unbelievable marathon"" to secure Obamacare, she personally took on the task of winning over 60 wavering Democrats. To win back the speakership this time, she swayed another 60 or so members of her caucus.

""For Pelosi, the strategy in every campaign she runs is 'owning the ground,'"" writes her friend Steve Israel, a former congressman, which is ""not just a matter of a campaign field operation,"" but ""extends to message as well.""

Ms. Pelosi doesn't hesitate to associate her own ambitions with the quest for women's equality -- ""You know why I do it? I do it because I want women to see you do not get pushed around,"" she told CNN's Dana Bash -- and some, including Representative Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut, have attributed Ms. Pelosi's ability to whip a caucus to the mothering skills that come from having five children and eight grandchildren: ""She has eyes in the back of her head.""

At the same time, she regularly displays what have traditionally -- wrongly -- been considered male attributes in politics. She keeps her head when all about her are losing theirs and is adept at the deadpan gibe, usually delivered right between the ribs. When President Barack Obama and his chief of staff Rahm Emanuel seemed about to abandon the Affordable Care Act in despair, she mocked their proposed alternative as ""incrementalism"" and ""Kiddie Care,"" and told them: ""We'll never have a better majority in your presidency in numbers than we've got right now. We can make this work."" She proceeded to get it done, vote by vote, maneuver after maneuver.

Republicans have already received a full barrage of what Ms. Pelosi can do. She quietly but directly called Mr. Trump out on his lying and ""fearmongering"" about immigration, labeled the government's closing the ""Trump shutdown"" and mocked his planned border wall as a ""beaded curtain"" and ""a manhood thing for him.""

The day after Mr. Trump subjected us to a cabinet meeting that seemed like a lost outtake from Charlie Chaplin's ""Great Dictator,"" Ms. Pelosi turned the opening of the new Congress into a jubilant festival, one that celebrated the youth and diversity of her party, complete with a table full of Bibles and a male representative rocking a baby. She took her oath of office surrounded by children -- and followed it up by pushing through a series of bills that both parties had previously voted for, challenging Republicans to reopen the government and giving a speech that quoted Reagan.

In her second stint as speaker, Ms. Pelosi goes into the job with a majority that is 21 seats smaller than what she enjoyed previously, and without a Democratic White House or a Senate majority to aid her. She has limited herself to four years in the job -- part of the price of regaining it -- and her remarkable energy notwithstanding, she will be nearing her mid-80s when she finishes it. She must navigate a much nastier Washington culture that is likely to turn even uglier as congressional investigations into the president begin, and the Mueller report is delivered.

On the other side is Ms. Pelosi's restive new Democratic majority, which demands a say in setting the agenda. This is not Mr. Sam's House of Representatives. The brightest new Democratic star, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, joined a protest in Ms. Pelosi's office before she even took her seat. When Carl Albert showed up for his first day at the House, he was given a pile of papers to deliver to an office by an older congressman who mistook him for a page. (Albert did as he was told.)

Ms. Pelosi would never so disrespect a member, and it may well be that both her new majority and her old-school skills will serve her well. As Ronald Brownstein pointed out in The Atlantic, changing demographics have left her with far fewer conservative Democrats from blue-collar or rural districts -- Democrats who hobbled Mr. Pelosi and such previous Democratic speakers as Tom Foley and Tip O'Neill. Her current majority may squabble over economics, but it is unlikely to fight over social issues like immigration, gay rights or abortion.

The ""San Francisco Democrat"" and product of the ""Baltimore machine"" may be just the person to lead this new coalition. Asked on her first day back as speaker why she would not compromise on the border wall, Ms. Pelosi told the press, seemingly off the cuff: ""A wall, in my view is an immorality,"" before adding, ""It's the least effective way to protect the border and the most costly.""

There was the old Democratic liberalism at its best, idealistic and pragmatic at the same time: The wall is wrong because it's wrong, plus it won't work. It's worth noting that Ms. Ocasio-Cortez cast her first vote in Congress to return Nancy Pelosi to the speakership. Mr. Sam would be proud.

186,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/25/world/middleeast/yemen-us-saudi-civilian-war.html,"CAIRO -- When a Saudi F-15 warplane takes off from King Khalid air base in southern Saudi Arabia for a bombing run over Yemen, it is not just the plane and the bombs that are American.

American mechanics service the jet and carry out repairs on the ground. American technicians upgrade the targeting software and other classified technology, which Saudis are not allowed to touch. The pilot has likely been trained by the United States Air Force.

And at a flight operations room in the capital, Riyadh, Saudi commanders sit near American military officials who provide intelligence and tactical advice, mainly aimed at stopping the Saudis from killing Yemeni civilians.

American fingerprints are all over the air war in Yemen, where errant strikes by the Saudi-led coalition have killed more than 4,600 civilians, according to a monitoring group. In Washington, that toll has stoked impassioned debate about the pitfalls of America's alliance with Saudi Arabia under Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who relies on American support to keep his warplanes in the air.

Saudi Arabia entered the war in 2015, allying with the United Arab Emirates and a smattering of Yemeni factions with the goal of ousting the Iran-allied Houthi rebels from northern Yemen. Three years on, they have made little progress. At least 60,000 Yemenis have died in the war, and the country stands on the brink of a calamitous famine.

For American officials, the stalled war has become a strategic and moral quagmire. It has upended the assumptions behind the decades-old policy of selling powerful weapons to a wealthy ally that, until recently, rarely used them. It has raised questions about complicity in possible war crimes. And the civilian toll has posed a troubling dilemma: how to support Saudi allies while keeping the war's excesses at arm's length.

In interviews, 10 current and former United States officials portrayed a troubled and fractious American response to regular reports of civilians killed in coalition airstrikes.

The Pentagon and State Department have denied knowing whether American bombs were used in the war's most notorious airstrikes, which have struck weddings, mosques and funerals. However, a former senior State Department official said that the United States had access to records of every airstrike over Yemen since the early days of the war, including the warplane and munitions used.

At the same time, American efforts to advise the Saudis on how to protect civilians often came to naught. The Saudis whitewashed an American-sponsored initiative to investigate errant airstrikes and often ignored a voluminous no-strike list.

""In the end, we concluded that they were just not willing to listen,"" said Tom Malinowski, a former assistant secretary of state and an incoming member of Congress from New Jersey. ""They were given specific coordinates of targets that should not be struck and they continued to strike them. That struck me as a willful disregard of advice they were getting.""

Yet American military support for the airstrikes continued.

While American officials often protested civilian deaths in public, two presidents ultimately stood by the Saudis. President Obama gave the war his qualified approval to assuage Saudi anger over his Iran nuclear deal. President Trump embraced Prince Mohammed and bragged of multibillion-dollar arms deals with the Saudis.

As bombs fell on Yemen, the United States continued to train the Royal Saudi Air Force. In 2017, the United States military announced a $750 million program focused on how to carry out airstrikes, including avoiding civilian casualties. The same year, Congress authorized the sale of more than $510 million in precision-guided munitions to Saudi Arabia, which had been suspended by the Obama administration in protest of civilian casualties.

Nearly 100 American military personnel are advising or assisting the coalition war effort, although fewer than 35 are based in Saudi Arabia.

American support for the war met stiff headwinds this fall, when congressional fury over the murder of the Saudi dissident Jamal Khashoggi combined with worries over civilian deaths in Yemen.

In response, the Trump administration ended American air-to-air refueling of coalition warplanes over Yemen in November but has otherwise continued to support the war. This month, the Senate voted to end American military assistance to the war altogether, a sharp rebuke to the Trump administration, but the bill died when the House refused to consider it.

The civilian toll is still rising. According to the Armed Conflict Location and Event Data Project, November was the most violent month in Yemen since the group began tracking casualties in January 2016. There were 3,058 war-related fatalities in November, it said, including 80 civilians killed in airstrikes.

'Expensive Paperweights'

For decades, the United States sold tens of billions of dollars in arms to Saudi Arabia on an unspoken premise: that they would rarely be used.

The Saudis amassed the world's third-largest fleet of F-15 jets, after the United States and Israel, but their pilots almost never saw action. They shot down two Iranian jets over the Persian Gulf in 1984, two Iraqi warplanes during the 1991 gulf war and they conducted a handful of bombing raids along the border with Yemen in 2009.

The United States had similar expectations for its arms sales to other Persian Gulf countries.

""There was a belief that these countries wouldn't end up using this equipment, and we were just selling them expensive paperweights,"" said Andrew Miller, a former State Department official now with the Project on Middle East Democracy.

Then came Prince Mohammed bin Salman.

When the prince, then the Saudi defense minister, sent fighter jets to Yemen in March 2015, Pentagon officials were flustered to receive just 48 hours notice of the first strikes against Houthi rebels, two former senior American officials said. American officials were persuaded by Saudi assurances the campaign would be over in weeks.

But as the weeks turned to years, and the prospect of victory receded, the Americans found themselves backing a military campaign that was exacting a steep civilian toll, largely as a result of Saudi and Emirati airstrikes.

American military officials posted to the coalition war room in Riyadh noticed that inexperienced Saudi pilots flew at high altitudes to avoid enemy fire, military officials said. The tactic reduced their risk but transferred it to civilians, who were exposed to less accurate bombings.

Coalition planners misidentified targets and their pilots struck them at the wrong time -- destroying a vehicle as it passed through a crowded bazaar, for instance, instead of waiting until it reached an open road. The coalition routinely ignored a no-strike list -- drawn up by the United States Central Command and the United Nations -- of hospitals, schools and other places where civilians gathered.

At times, coalition officers subverted their own chain of command. In one instance, a devastating strike that killed 155 people in a funeral hall was ordered by a junior officer who countermanded an order from a more senior officer, a State Department official said.

The Americans offered help. The State Department financed an investigative body to review errant airstrikes and propose corrective action. Pentagon lawyers trained Saudi officers in the laws of war. Military officers suggested putting gun cameras on Saudi and Emiratis warplanes to see how strikes were being conducted. The coalition balked.

In June 2017, American officials extracted new promises of safeguards, including stricter rules of engagement and an expansion of the no-strike list to about 33,000 targets -- provisions that allowed the secretary of state, then Rex Tillerson, to win support in Congress for the sale of more than $510 million in precision-guided munitions to the kingdom.

But those measures seemed to make little difference. Just over a year later, in August 2018, a coalition airstrike killed at least 40 boys on a packed school bus in northern Yemen.

Still, American leaders insisted they need to keep helping the Saudi coalition.

America's role in the war was ""absolutely essential"" to safeguard civilians, the general in charge of Central Command, Gen. Joseph L. Votel, told a charged Senate hearing in March.

""I think this does give us the best opportunity to address these concerns,"" he said.

What the U.S. Knows

In March, Prince Mohammed paid a visit to Washington, where he was feted by President Trump. As the two leaders sat in the White House, Mr. Trump held aloft a chart with price-tagged photos of warplanes and other weapons.

Pointing to the chart, Mr. Trump said, ""$3 billion."" He added, ""$533 million. $525 million. That's peanuts for you.""

The prince chuckled.

But in Congress, the mood was souring. In the March hearing, senators accused the Pentagon of being complicit in the coalition's errant bombing, and pressed its leaders on how directly the United States was linked to atrocities.

General Votel said the military knew little about that. The United States did not track whether the coalition jets that it refueled carried out the airstrikes that killed civilians, he said, and did not know when they used American-made bombs. At a briefing in Cairo in August, a senior United States official echoed that assessment.

""I would assume the Saudis have an inventory system that traces that information,"" said the official, who spoke anonymously to discuss diplomatically sensitive relations. ""But that's not information that is available to the U.S.""

But Larry Lewis, a State Department adviser on civilian harm who worked with the Saudi-led coalition from 2015 to 2017, said that information was readily available from an early stage.

At the coalition headquarters in Riyadh, he said, American liaison officers had access to a database that detailed every airstrike: warplane, target, munitions used and a brief description of the attack. American officials frequently emailed him copies of a spreadsheet for his own work, he said.

The data could easily be used to pinpoint the role of American warplanes and bombs in any single strike, he said. ""If they question was ""Hey, was that a U.S. munition they used?"" You would know that it was,"" he said.

Capt. Bill Urban, a spokesman for Central Command, did not deny the existence of the database, but said that American officers only used coalition data to carry out their core mission: advising on civilian casualties, sharing intelligence on Houthi threats and coordinating the midair refueling that ended in November.

""I will not speculate on how the United States could have used or compiled the information the Saudi-led coalition shared for some other function,"" he said in a statement. ""That is not the mission these advisers were invited to Riyadh to perform. That is not the way partnerships work.""

Other officials have said that collating information about use of American munitions in Yemen would be onerous and, ultimately, pointless. ""What difference would it make?"" the senior United States official in Cairo said.

But legal experts say such information could be significant. Inside the State Department, there have been longstanding worries about potential legal liability for the American role in the war. In August, the United Nations' human rights body determined that some coalition airstrikes were likely war crimes.

Under American law, customers of American weapons must follow the laws of armed conflict or future sales may be blocked, said Ryan Goodman, a former Defense Department attorney who teaches law at New York University.

Mr. Lewis, who left the State Department in 2017, said that in his experience, individual Saudi officers were often concerned or distressed by airstrikes that killed civilians but there was little institutional effort to reform the system.

The Joint Incidents Assessment Team, the body set up to investigate errant strikes, worked diligently at first, he said. But when its findings were made public, the Saudi Ministry of Foreign Affairs had removed any references that were critical of coalition actions.

Asked if that was the case, the Saudi ambassador to Yemen, Mohamed Al Jaber, said, ""The JIAT is an independent team,"" and he referred any questions to them.

Applying Leverage

Obfuscation and impunity continue to characterize the coalition's airstrike campaign. The coalition rarely identifies which country carries out an airstrike, although the vast majority are Saudi and Emirati, officials say. In July, King Salman of Saudi Arabia issued an order lifting ""all military and disciplinary penalties"" for Saudi troops fighting in Yemen, an apparent amnesty for possible war crimes.

Over the summer, as Emirati warplanes pounded the Red Sea port of Hudaydah, General Votel and the defense secretary at the time, Jim Mattis, held at least 10 phone calls or video conferences with Saudi and Emirati leaders, urging them to show restraint, a senior American military official and a senior Western official said.

At least one of the conferences involved Mohammed bin Zayed, the crown prince of Abu Dhabi and the effective leader of the United Arab Emirates.

""The Saudis are decent partners,"" Gen. C.Q. Brown Jr., a former top commander of American air forces in the Middle East, said in an interview. ""And sometimes our partners don't always do things we would expect.""

Short of halting all weapons sales, critics say the United States could pressure the Saudis by curtailing its assistance to the air war. Hundreds of American aviation mechanics and other specialists, working under Defense Department contracts, keep the Saudi F-15 fleet in the air. In 2017, Boeing signed a $480 million contract for service repairs to the fleet.

But after the departure of Mr. Mattis, who resigned last week, the Defense Department will be helmed by Patrick M. Shanahan, an arms industry insider. Mr. Shanahan, the acting defense secretary as of Jan 1., spent more than three decades at Boeing, the F-15 manufacturer which has earned further billions from lucrative service contracts in Saudi Arabia.

Pentagon officials said that in his current job as deputy defense secretary, Mr. Shanahan had recused himself from decisions involving Boeing.

Daniel L. Byman, a professor at Georgetown University's School of Foreign Service, said that a more robust policy toward Saudi airstrikes would not just be good for Yemeni civilians -- it would also help the Saudis.

""This war has been a strategic disaster for the Saudis,"" he said. The airstrikes have shown no sign of defeating the Houthis, and the Houthis' foreign ally, Iran, has gained from Saudi Arabia's clumsy prosecution of the war.

""The United States needs to use its power to promote peace and stability in Yemen,"" Mr. Byman said. ""And it needs to protect its allies from themselves."""
187,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/07/us/politics/bolton-trump-syria.html,"WASHINGTON -- John R. Bolton found himself last weekend in a familiar but dangerous spot for any White House aide: cleaning up after his boss, President Trump, announced the withdrawal of 2,000 troops from Syria -- a decision that rattled allies and threw America's Middle East policy into turmoil.

But Mr. Bolton is at least partly responsible for the conditions that led to Mr. Trump's sudden move.

As the president's national security adviser, Mr. Bolton has largely eliminated the internal policy debates that could have fleshed out the troop decision with timetables, conditions and a counterterrorism strategy for after the troops leave. Under Mr. Bolton's management, senior administration officials said, the National Security Council staff had ""zero"" role in brokering a debate over America's future in Syria.

Mr. Bolton, officials said, was surprised by the timing of Mr. Trump's announcement, which contradicted his own pledge in September to keep American troops in Syria. Faced with the president's abrupt declaration, which drew howls of protest from Congress and concerned phone calls from allies like Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, Mr. Bolton felt compelled to talk his boss into slowing down the process, these officials said.

Then Mr. Bolton had to cobble together a withdrawal strategy that would normally have taken shape over weeks or months and laid the groundwork for Mr. Trump's decision -- not hastily followed it.

After Mr. Bolton presented the details in Israel on Sunday, Mr. Trump pushed back on reports that he and his adviser were out of sync. ""We will be leaving at a proper pace while at the same time continuing to fight ISIS and doing all else that is prudent and necessary!"" he said in a tweet on Monday, firing at a report in The New York Times rather than at Mr. Bolton.

If Mr. Trump did not repudiate his adviser, the daylight between their words captured the tricky path that Mr. Bolton, 70, a former official in the George W. Bush administration who long occupied the hawkish fringe of the Republican Party, has walked since entering the White House last April.

Mr. Bolton himself famously battled with the bureaucracy in Mr. Bush's State Department. But the discordant messages laid bare a national security process that, officials say, has shrunk to little more than the instincts of an impulsive president.

There is not much Mr. Bolton can do to temper his boss. Mr. Trump's erratic style and habit of undermining his advisers has already driven out the secretaries of state and defense, as well as Mr. Bolton's predecessor, H. R. McMaster. Mr. McMaster held many more meetings than Mr. Bolton and was still routinely blindsided by Mr. Trump's tweets.

""Bolton is trying to salvage the situation, but he's unable to do so, because everyone in the region will question whether he is speaking for himself or for the president,"" said Martin S. Indyk, a former American ambassador to Israel now at the Council on Foreign Relations.

Mr. Bolton, officials said, has put his energy into keeping the ear of the president. His strategy has worked on some issues, like withdrawing from the Iran nuclear deal, but less so on others, like maintaining a presence in Syria to counter Iranian influence -- something Mr. Bolton vowed to do only weeks before the president decided to pull out.

Mr. Bolton was not the only official to urge Mr. Trump to slow down on Syria. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo made the same argument, as did Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, and American military commanders who met with Mr. Trump during his holiday visit to the troops in Iraq. Mr. Netanyahu called Mr. Trump to pass along the view that it is in Israel's interest for the United States to maintain a presence in the region, according to an Israeli official.

Mr. Trump's aides ""have created on the back end the process that you would normally have on the front end,"" said Derek H. Chollet, a Pentagon official under President Barack Obama.

""In normal times,"" Mr. Chollet said, ""you would have a discussion on a proposed decision that would lead to the decision, and you would discuss how to implement one. But now, the process is such that once you get policy guidance from the president in the form of a tweet, you reverse-engineer a process.""

Another example of this was North Korea, where Mr. Trump decided to halt military exercises and informed the Pentagon afterward. Defense Department officials quietly continued the exercises but just did not refer to them as exercises.

White House officials said Mr. Bolton came into his job determined to streamline the National Security Council, which they said had become bloated during the Obama administration, with functions that often overlapped those of the agencies. They insist his approach was welcomed: During his first breakfast with Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, one official said, Mr. Mattis asked Mr. Bolton to hold fewer meetings.

But there is a long distance between standard-issue jokes about too many meetings and eliminating them completely. Pentagon officials said Mr. Bolton did away with much of the process put in place by Mr. McMaster, a retired three-star Army general, who placed great emphasis on meetings, where everyone got a say.

Mr. Bolton's preference, one official said, is to have one-on-one conversations with cabinet members or other senior officials directly, rather than in a group or on a conference call. He maintains more control of the process that way, this person said.

Patrick M. Shanahan, the acting defense secretary, has taken advantage of this channel, according to another Pentagon official. He has not hesitated to call Mr. Bolton directly, something that Mr. Mattis apparently did not do as much. He tended to relay questions through his recently departed chief of staff, Kevin Sweeney.

The National Security Council engaged in ""reverse engineering"" under Mr. McMaster as well. But officials said the trend had gotten worse under Mr. Bolton, in part because he did not trust the national-security bureaucracy and saw no reason to include it in policymaking.

Mr. Bolton is also handicapped by not having a deputy, who traditionally coordinates policy debates. He has yet to replace Mira Ricardel, an official who was forced out of the White House after she clashed with the first lady, Melania Trump.

Unlike in the past, when the National Security Council was the president's clearing ground for security policy, one official said that the N.S.C. under Mr. Bolton was best described as another voice at a table crowded with advisers vying for influence with Mr. Trump.

By all accounts, Mr. Bolton has a better relationship with the president than Mr. McMaster did. He also gets along with Jared Kushner, Mr. Trump's son-in-law and senior adviser, and with Mr. Pompeo, though officials said the secretary acted as a ""buzz saw"" toward some of his harder-edged ideas about Iran.

Mr. Bolton stumbled early in his tenure when he almost derailed a summit meeting between Mr. Trump and the North Korean leader, Kim Jong-un, by suggesting that Libya would be a good model for nuclear disarmament talks with North Korea (the Libyan leader, Muammar el-Qaddafi, was ousted and killed a decade after he agreed to give up his weapons).

With Mr. Pompeo taking the lead on North Korea, Mr. Bolton has carved out a sideline on issues relating to American sovereignty -- an issue he has championed for decades as a fixture in conservative foreign policy circles. He spoke recently about the need to overhaul the nation's foreign assistance programs and threatened judges on the International Criminal Court with sanctions if they investigated American troops in Afghanistan.

That policy had not even fully cleared the review process when Mr. Bolton announced it at the Federalist Society, an N.S.C. official said. But he felt so confident that his views were in sync with Mr. Trump's that he went ahead and called the court ""ineffective, unaccountable, and indeed, outright dangerous.""

Mr. Bolton sometimes gestures to a photo in his office that shows President George H.W. Bush huddling in the Oval Office with a small circle of national security aides, as an example of the ideal way to manage foreign policy.

Despite being a contemporary of Mr. Trump's, however, Mr. Bolton is not a member of his inner circle. He does not have the same relationship with Mr. Trump that he had with Mr. Bush. Sometimes, with aides, the president refers to him as ""Mike Bolton."""
188,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/07/us/politics/trump-medicare-drug-prices.html,"WASHINGTON -- A federal court has rejected President Trump's first major effort to cut payments for prescription drugs, saying the administration went far beyond its legal authority.

The Trump administration made a ""drastic departure from the statutorily mandated rates"" when it reduced payments to hospitals for drugs given to Medicare beneficiaries in outpatient clinics, Judge Rudolph Contreras of the Federal District Court here said in the decision, issued late last month.

Alex M. Azar II, the secretary of health and human services, ""may not end-run Congress's clear mandate,"" the judge said.

The court is still considering how to compensate hospitals for the money lost, estimated at $1.6 billion for last year. The cuts are still in effect, but the court has asked the government and hospitals to propose a remedy.

At issue is a federal program that allows hospitals serving large numbers of low-income people to get discounts from drug manufacturers on certain prescription drugs, including many used to treat cancer and H.I.V./AIDS.

Medicare pays for the drugs when Medicare beneficiaries receive them as outpatients at more than 1,000 hospitals that participate in the program. The Trump administration concluded that Medicare was paying hospitals much more than they spent to acquire the drugs.

So federal officials cut the reimbursement rate last year -- to 77.5 percent of a drug's average sales price, from 106 percent.

Hospital executives told the judge that as a result of the reductions, they would have to cut back or eliminate some services.

Under the Medicare law, Judge Contreras said, federal officials have the power to ""adjust"" reimbursement rates. But, he said, they abused that power and ""fundamentally altered the statutory scheme established by Congress for determining"" reimbursement rates.

Mr. Azar ""may either collect the data necessary to set payment rates based on acquisition costs, or he may raise his disagreement with Congress,"" but he may not circumvent the mandate of Congress, said Judge Contreras, who was appointed by President Barack Obama. The government had acknowledged that it did not know the precise amount of the difference between what hospitals were paying for the drugs and what Medicare was reimbursing them.

The program, created under Section 340B of the Public Health Service Act, is commonly known as the 340B program.

Caitlin Oakley, a spokeswoman for Mr. Azar, said Monday: ""We are disappointed with the court's ruling and are evaluating next steps. As the court correctly recognized, its judgment has the potential to wreak havoc on the system.""

Ms. Oakley said the decision could increase costs for Medicare patients, who are generally responsible for 20 percent of the Medicare-approved amount for outpatient drugs covered by the program. Most people on Medicare have supplementary insurance, like a Medigap policy or retiree health benefits, to help pay their share of the bill.

The lawsuit challenging the Medicare cuts was filed by the American Hospital Association; by two trade groups representing teaching and public hospitals; and by three providers: Henry Ford Health System, based in Detroit; Park Ridge Hospital, in Hendersonville, N.C.; and Eastern Maine Healthcare Systems, now known as Northern Light Health.

Dr. Robert A. Chapman, a medical oncologist at Henry Ford Health System, described the administration's action as an example of ""reverse Robin Hood."" Under the policy, he said, the government took money from hospitals serving large numbers of low-income people and redistributed most of it to hospitals that did not qualify for the program.

When Medicare cuts its payments to hospitals, Dr. Chapman said, it tends to offset the discounts that hospitals receive from drug manufacturers.

Melinda R. Hatton, a senior vice president and the general counsel of the American Hospital Association, said the court was ""holding the administration's feet to the fire to comply with the law."" Hospitals use savings from the program to pay for myriad services in low-income communities, she said.

In a speech in May in the Rose Garden, Mr. Trump announced what he called ""the most sweeping action in history to lower the price of prescription drugs for the American people."" He persuaded some pharmaceutical executives to roll back or postpone price increases over the summer.

And at a campaign rally in October in Wisconsin, Mr. Trump said: ""You will see, very soon, drug prices will go plunging downward. You wait, you watch.""

But drug makers have increased prices on hundreds of products this month, provoking an angry reaction from the president.

In a Twitter post over the weekend, Mr. Trump said: ""Drug makers and companies are not living up to their commitments on pricing. Not being fair to the consumer, or to our Country!""

Many of those commitments were carefully hedged and temporary. Pfizer, for example, said in July that it was rolling back price increases to give Mr. Trump time to work on his ""blueprint to lower drug prices.""

Pfizer said then that its prices would remain at the lower level until the president's blueprint took effect or until the end of 2018, ""whichever is sooner.""

Members of Congress from both parties, including Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senator Charles E. Grassley, Republican of Iowa, said they were hoping to work with Mr. Trump to rein in drug prices. But so far, Trump appointees have generally expressed more interest in unilateral administrative actions than in legislative solutions."
189,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/30/business/economy/us-economy-gdp-q2.html,"The economic recovery may be durable, but it is anything but dynamic.

Weighed down by anemic business spending, overstocked factories and warehouses, and a surprisingly weak housing sector, the American economy barely improved this spring after its usual winter doldrums.

Consumer spending advanced at a robust pace, helping to sustain a modest growth rate of 1.2 percent, but the gain was overshadowed by the poor showing in other sectors of the economy. The April-June quarter was the third consecutive period in which the economy advanced at less than a 2 percent annual rate, the weakest stretch in four years.

The new economic data underscores the continuing frustration about the current growth cycle, which has now gone on for seven years -- longer than most economic upswings -- but which has repeatedly failed to break out into a higher orbit.

And with the political conventions now over, and the brawl between Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump for the White House in full swing, Friday's data at least partly undercuts the Democrats' argument that the nation's economic health is improving.

""This definitely feeds into an existing Republican narrative that the economy is growing too slowly and dials it up a notch,"" said Jared Bernstein, a liberal economist who served in the Obama administration.

The economic debate may intensify ahead of the election in November, particularly because the recovery's gains have been less robust in battleground states like Ohio and Pennsylvania. States firmly in the Democratic or Republican column -- California and Texas, for example -- are generally doing much better.

On Friday, Republican leaders were quick to cite the new data on the nation's gross domestic product to reinforce their argument that President Obama's policies have failed to turn things around.

""After eight years of higher taxes, endless regulations and skyrocketing health care costs, the chickens are apparently coming home to roost,"" said Senator Tom Cotton, Republican of Arkansas.

But there are other signs that the economy is on the mend, even for ordinary Americans who had, until recently, barely benefited from the rebound. The unemployment rate, which reached 10 percent after the recession, has fallen back to around 5 percent, while hiring and pay gains have been healthier lately. Those factors may ultimately contribute more to perceptions of vitality than abstract statistics on the nation's economic output.

""What really matters to people is jobs and income, and that's most recently been a positive story,"" added Mr. Bernstein, who is now a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.

Based on more complete information about recent years, the government revised last year's growth rate up slightly to 2.6 percent -- the best so far since the severe downturn ended in mid-2009. But that is still below the gains the American economy recorded in the mid-2000s, let alone in the booming late 1990s.

Over all, the economy's 1.2 percent advance in the second quarter, the Commerce Department reported Friday, was just slightly better than the 0.8 percent pace recorded in the first quarter.

Besides the decrease in inventory accumulation and business investment, weaker government outlays also held back growth, reinforcing a trend that has hobbled the recovery in recent years.

The abrupt falloff in homebuilding caught analysts off guard, but it came after a series of double-digit gains in late 2014 and 2015. And with mortgage rates very low and home prices still rising in many parts of the country, the residential real estate sector is expected to contribute to growth again in the coming quarters.

Household spending was the economy's bright spot, rising at an annualized rate of 4.2 percent.

""The consumer is doing all the heavy lifting,"" said Nariman Behravesh, chief economist at IHS Markit. ""Aside from technology and software, business spending was bad and housing was also surprisingly weak, which is payback for gains in recent quarters.""

On the positive side, the overstock at stores and warehouses is starting to dissipate. That could help growth in the second half of the year, Mr. Behravesh said.

After a long period in which trade has weighed on the economy, the balance between exports and imports may finally be improving. The net trade picture actually lifted growth by nearly a quarter of a percentage point last quarter, the first significant improvement from trade since mid-2014.

In addition, Mr. Behravesh said, wages are finally beginning to inch higher for many workers after years of stagnation. Gas prices also remain low.

While grappling with weaker demand from customers in Asia and Europe, many factories and mills in the nation's midsection have been hit by the drop in energy prices as new drilling for oil and natural gas has collapsed.

Regional disparities have contributed to differing perceptions of the economy. Workers in the West are finding themselves priced out of neighborhoods in booming San Francisco and Seattle, while families in less prosperous parts of the country say they feel as if the recession never really ended.

Domestically focused service industries like software, health care and financial services are doing well, lifting incomes among white-collar workers. A strong real estate market in many parts of the country and the run-up on Wall Street are also encouraging more affluent consumers to open their wallets.

This week, the Federal Reserve noted improving economic conditions in the United States after a two-day meeting of policy makers, even as the central bank held off on increasing in interest rates.

A top Fed official downplayed the latest report.

John Williams, president of the San Francisco Fed, said the second-quarter gross domestic product reading was weak largely because of inventories and government spending, noting that underlying data that discount for swings in stock building ""look good.""

Speaking to reporters after a speech in Cambridge, Mass., Mr. Williams, an influential centrist at the central bank, noted the two key employment and inflation reports before the next meeting in mid-September. ""It makes sense, assuming the data continue to support that, to raise rates again this year,"" he said.

Michael Gapen, chief United States economist at Barclays, said the disappointing gross domestic product report makes a move by the Fed in September a bit less likely, but it could still be on track if the government issues strong jobs reports for July and August. July's data will be released by the Labor Department next Friday.

""The domestic side of the economy looks O.K. Not stellar, not fantastic, but enough to keep us on a modest growth path,"" Mr. Gapen said. ""And if it's all about personal consumption, then the labor market is your best forward-looking indicator."""
190,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/31/opinion/win-lose-but-no-compromise.html,"Anyone who says it doesn't matter whether Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton wins this election needs their head examined. The damage that Trump could do to our nation with his blend of intellectual laziness, towering policy ignorance and reckless impulsiveness is in a league of its own. Hillary has some real personal ethics issues she needs to confront, but she's got the chops to be president.

What interests me most right now, though, is a different question. It's not, ""Who are they -- our politicians?"" It's, ""Who are we -- the voters?""

To be specific: Are we all just Shiites and Sunnis now?

More and more of our politics resembles the core sectarian conflict in the Middle East between these two branches of Islam, and that is not good. Because whether you're talking about Shiites and Sunnis -- or Iranians and Saudis, Israelis and Palestinians, Turks and Kurds -- a simple binary rule dominates their politics: ""I am strong, why should I compromise? I am weak, how can I compromise?""

With rare exceptions, the politics of the Middle East is just a seesaw game between those two modes of zero-sum, rule-or-die thinking. Rarely, these days, does either party stop to seek or forge common ground. It's just: I am strong, so I don't have to meet you in the middle, or I am weak, so I can't meet you in the middle. You can see how well it's worked for them.

Politico last week reported that while some G.O.P. officials may vote for Hillary, they are already sketching plans ""to stymie a President Hillary Clinton agenda."" Liberals are already warning Clinton not to bring Republicans into her cabinet or explore meeting them halfway. Have a nice day.

That kind of sectarian/tribal thinking, now reinforced by left-right social media enforcers, gerrymandering and giant campaign funders, gives you the sorry spectacle of House Speaker Paul Ryan saying, without embarrassment, that Trump's pronouncements are a ""textbook"" example of racism, but he's supporting Trump anyway.

And it gives you the sorry spectacle of Clinton surrogates turning themselves into pretzels to defend her, even though it's obvious that she embraced a pattern of major donors to the Clinton Foundation being given preferential access to her as secretary of state.

Shiites stick with Shiites. Sunnis stick with Sunnis. It's rule or die, baby. Nothing else matters.

That is not always true in other walks of life. We just got that lesson at the Olympics. American runner Abbey D'Agostino clipped New Zealand's Nikki Hamblin from behind in the women's 5000-meter qualifying heat, sending both tumbling to the ground well short of the finish.

The Associated Press reported: ""D'Agostino got up, but Hamblin was just lying there. She appeared to be crying. Instead of running in pursuit of the others, D'Agostino crouched down and put her hand on the New Zealander's shoulder, then under her arms to help her up, and softly urged her not to quit."" They embraced at the finish.

Contrast that with the Egyptian Olympic judoka who, under pressure from his society, refused to shake hands with his Israeli opponent. And how's Egypt doing these days? Drifting aimlessly.

Yes, I know, politics ain't bean bag. It's about winning. But it's also about winning with a mandate to govern. And right now, everything suggests that the next four years will be just like the last eight: a gridlocked, toxic, Sunni-Shiite, Democrat-Republican civil war, with little search for common ground. That's how you ruin, not run, a great country.

How will we improve Obamacare? How will we invest in infrastructure? How will we recreate the compromise on immigration that a few brave Republican and Democratic legislators tried in 2013? How will we get corporate tax reform, a carbon tax and some fiscal policy that we so desperately need to propel the economy and control the deficit?

There is no doubt that Republicans during the Obama presidency pioneered and perfected this scorched-earth politics and have now paid a price for it. They let themselves be led around by a group of no-compromise talk-radio gasbags, think-tank ideologues in the pay of one industry or another, Fox News know-nothings and an alt-right fringe, who, together, so poisoned the G.O.P. garden that an invasive species, Donald Trump, just took it over.

That is all the more reason for Clinton to reach out, at the right time, and see if any of them have learned their lesson. There is no way she'll get anything big done otherwise. We have to break this fever.

It will be a tragedy if center-right Republicans conclude that their only problem is Donald Trump, and that once he's gone the G.O.P. will be theirs again. Their party is over. They either have to become conservative Democrats or redefine a responsible center-right G.O.P. -- with a different base. But it will be equally sad if Clinton wastes the opportunity of a potentially substantial victory, achieved with some Republican votes, to rebuild the political center in this country.

As Americans, we were once summoned by our politics to be participants in a race to the moon. Lately we've been summoned by our politics to be spectators in a race to the bottom. We can do better, and we must."
191,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/20/opinion/trump-and-the-sultan.html,"Turkey is a long way from Cleveland, where the Republicans are holding their presidential convention. But I'd urge you to study the recent failed military coup against Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan. America is not Turkey -- but in terms of personality and political strategy, Erdogan and Donald Trump were separated at birth.

And the drama playing out in Turkey today is the story of just how off track a once successful country can get when a leader who demonizes all his rivals and dabbles in crazy conspiracy theories comes to believe that he alone is The Man -- the only one who can make his country great again -- and ensconces himself in power.

Let's start with Erdogan, who was prime minister from 2003 to 2014, but then maneuvered himself into the previously symbolic role of president and got all key powers shifted to that position. I confess that when I first heard the news of the July 15 coup attempt, my first instinct was to consult that great foreign policy expert Miss Manners, The Washington Post's etiquette columnist, because I was asking myself, ""What is the right response when bad things happen to bad people?""

""Dear Miss Manners: I instinctively oppose military coups against democratically elected governments, like the one in Turkey. But am I a bad person if part of me felt that Turkey's president had it coming?""

Anyone who has been following Turkey closely knows that Erdogan has been mounting a silent, drip-by-drip coup of his own against Turkish democracy for years -- jailing reporters, hounding rivals with giant tax bills, reviving an internal war against Turkish Kurds to stoke nationalist passions to propel his efforts to grab more powers -- and by generally making himself into a modern-day sultan for life.

I'm glad the coup failed, especially the way it did -- with many secular Turks who actually opposed Erdogan's autocratic rule, and had been abused by it, nevertheless coming out against the plotters on the principle that Turkish democracy must be upheld. That was a truly impressive act of collective wisdom and a display of democratic sensibilities.

The maturity of the Turkish people resulted in Erdogan's getting what golfers call a mulligan, or a do-over, to demonstrate that he is committed to the universal precepts of democracy. Will he? Or will Erdogan go right back to his preferred means of staying in power: dividing Turks into his supporters and enemies of the state, weaving conspiracy theories and using the failed coup as a license for a witch hunt, not only for plotters but for anyone who has dared to cross his path?

The early signs are bad. A day after the failed coup, Erdogan dismissed 2,745 judges and prosecutors. How did he know exactly who to fire in one day? Did he already have an enemies list? To date, he has now reportedly purged 1,500 university deans, revoked the licenses of 21,000 teachers and either purged or detained nearly 35,000 members of the military, security forces and judiciary as part of his ""cleansing"" of coup supporters.

Here's the real tragedy: Erdogan was an outstanding leader his first five years and truly lifted the country's economy and middle class. But since then it's all gone to his head, and he has gotten away with increasingly bad behavior by creating an us-versus-them divide between his loyal, more religious followers, and the more secular communities in Turkey.

Because his followers see their dignity wrapped up in his remaining in power, he can say and do anything and never pay a political price. His base will always rally to his us-versus-them dog whistles. But Turkey in the long run suffers.

Sound familiar?

Trump relies on the same tactics: He fabricates facts and figures on an industrial scale. He regularly puts out conspiracy theories -- his latest is that President Obama's ""body language"" suggests that ""there's something going on"" with the president -- hinting that Obama is not comfortable condemning the killing of cops by African-American gunmen and has sympathy for radical Islamists.

Trump also relies on the us-versus-them bond with his followers to avoid punishment for any of his misbehavior. He, too, is obsessed with his own prowess, and he uses Twitter to get around traditional media gatekeepers -- and fact-checkers -- to inject anything he wants into the nation's media bloodstream. (Erdogan just uses his own friendly media.) And most of the people Trump has surrounded himself with are either family or second-raters looking for a star turn, including his vice-presidential choice and the person who wrote his wife's convention speech and clearly plagiarized part of it from Michelle Obama. The whole thing reeks of flimflam.

If Trump is elected, I don't think there will be a military coup, but I guarantee you that Jeb Bush's prediction will be proved true, that he'll be ""a chaos president"" just as he's been a ""chaos candidate."" Americans will regularly be in the streets, because they are not going to follow -- on any big issue -- a man who lies as he breathes, who has not done an ounce of homework to prepare for the job and who generates support by conspiracy theories and making people afraid of the future and one another.

If you like what's going on in Turkey today, you'll love Trump's America."
192,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/06/15/opinion/lessons-of-hiroshima-and-orlando.html,"I want to talk today about the horrific human tragedy of Orlando. But first I want to talk about Hiroshima -- or, more precisely, the profound speech that President Obama gave there on May 27 that got lost in all the campaign noise here.

Hiroshima, Obama suggested, represents a world in which for the first time ever a country possessed the power to kill all of us -- and if it had to be any country, I am glad it was America. But today, he said, we're entering a world where small groups -- maybe even soon a single super-empowered person -- will be able to kill all of us; therefore we'd better start thinking about the moral implications of where technology is taking us.

""Science allows us to communicate across the seas and fly above the clouds, to cure disease and understand the cosmos, but those same discoveries can be turned into ever more efficient killing machines,"" the president noted. ""The wars of the modern age teach us this truth. Hiroshima teaches this truth. Technological progress without an equivalent progress in human institutions can doom us. The scientific revolution that led to the splitting of an atom requires a moral revolution as well.""

What the president was describing is the central strategic issue of our time: the growing mismatch between the combined rapid evolution of our technological prowess and the powers this gives to a single individual or group to destroy at scale (you can make your own gun now with a 3-D-printer), and the pace of our moral and social evolution to govern and use these powers responsibly.

And that brings me to the Orlando massacre -- to what happens when, on a smaller scale, we refuse to reimagine the social and legal changes we need to manage a world where one loser can now kill so many innocent people. The notion that such a person -- any person -- should be able to buy a military-style assault rifle is insane. That the Republican Party cannot see the wisdom of common-sense guns laws is just begging for bigger massacres.

At the same time, year after year, we keep seeing young Muslim men drawing inspiration and permission from Islam to kill large numbers of civilians in the West and, even more so, killing other Muslims in Muslim lands.

I've lived too long in the Muslim world, and experienced the decency of Muslim communities, to believe that this is the essence of Islam. But I have seen too much of this suicidal violence for too long to believe that it has nothing to do with the puritanical, anti-gay, anti-transgender, anti-female, anti-religious-pluralism versions of Islam that are too often promoted by sources in the Arab world, Pakistan and Afghanistan.

The websites, social networks and mosques that promote these intolerant ideas can ""light up"" lost souls anywhere in the world. Until that stops, we're just waiting around for the next Paris, Brussels, San Bernardino or Orlando.

And the only thing that can stop them is from the inside: a meaningful mass movement by Muslim governments, clergymen and citizens to delegitimize this behavior. It takes a village and only stops when the village clearly says, ""No more!"" And that has not happened at the scale and consistency it needs to happen.

Finally, in an age when individuals can become super-empowered, we need to ensure our government has all the surveillance powers it needs -- under appropriate judicial review -- to monitor and arrest violent extremists of all stripes. The bad guys now have too many tools to elude detection.

Obama closed his speech at Hiroshima with words that could easily have been said of Orlando: ""Those who died, they are like us. ... They do not want more war. They would rather that the wonders of science be focused on improving life and not eliminating it. When the choices made by nations, when the choices made by leaders, reflect this simple wisdom, then the lesson of Hiroshima is done.""

We need to make choices appropriate for our age when technology can so amplify the power of one. We need common-sense gun laws, common-sense gender equality and religious pluralism and common-sense privacy laws.

But that takes common-sense leaders, not ones who think the complexities of this age can be bombed away, walled away, willed away or insulted away. Stop for a moment and reflect on what this week would have been like had Donald Trump been president -- the carpet-bombing he'd have ordered in the Middle East, the fear and isolation his Muslim ban would have engendered in every Muslim-American, the joy that ISIS would have taken from being at war with all of America, the license this would have given to crazies in our own society to firebomb a mosque. And the backlash that would engender among Muslims around the world, the most radical of whom would be firebombing our embassies. When America goes nuts, the world goes nuts.

I don't agree with Obama on all aspects of this issue, but the guy is thinking deeply and acting responsibly. Trump is shooting from the hip, spraying insults 360 degrees, telling lies, stoking fears and making threats that many in our military and the F.B.I. would refuse to implement. If you Republican senators and congressmen support Trump for president, he will own you -- and you will own everything he does."
193,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/04/fashion/michelle-obama-brandon-maxwell.html,"Continuing her efforts to fast-track the careers of young American designers on the global stage, Michelle Obama wore a gown by Brandon Maxwell, perhaps the newest and most up-and-coming of the names she has worn so far, to the White House state dinner for Singapore on Tuesday night.

It was the first time the first lady had worn Mr. Maxwell, who is such an up-and-coming designer that he has not yet achieved full brand status.

What he is, however, is Lady Gaga's stylist, and the man who made the widely praised jumpsuit she wore to the Oscars.

(Interestingly, Mrs. Obama's gown -- strapless, white crepe, with Art Deco folds at the neck and sides -- was not unlike the rock star's red carpet look, which was also white and strapless with folds, though its voluminous Old Hollywood skirt turned out to be -- surprise -- pants!)

Mr. Maxwell, 31, was also a 2016 finalist for the LVMH Prize for young fashion designers, the most coveted, and largest, of the new designer bursaries, as well as the winner of the Swarovski award for women's wear at the Council of Fashion Designers of America awards in June, where he gave perhaps the most moving speech of the night.

""I was very gay, in a very small town, and all I had were the women in my life who let me dress them up and put clothes on them,"" he said.

""It gave me meaning,"" he added, admitting that he was so new to the scene (he held his first show in September) that he wasn't even a member of the C.F.D.A. -- though he became one that month.

Mr. Maxwell learned that the first lady had worn his dress to the state dinner when he was in Austria with Swarovski as part of the C.F.D.A. award. He posted a photo on Instagram with the comment, ""A very proud moment for me and my team.""

It was also, it must be said, a very effective moment for reaching a new audience and increasing his name recognition.

Mrs. Obama's choice of Mr. Maxwell on Tuesday follows her decision to wear a dress by another young designer who is relatively new to her public wardrobe: Christian Siriano, whose blue frock made a palpable splash at the Democratic National Convention as supporting actor to her powerful speech.

It also continues the surprising cross-party theme of white dressing, after Melania Trump's and Hillary Clinton's at the conventions. It could be happenstance, but you know what they say: Once is a fluke, twice is a coincidence and three times is a trend. Especially three times in three weeks.

We have trend, people. At least until Labor Day."
194,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/29/fashion/tim-kaine-democratic-national-convention.html,"Can we talk, for a minute, about the men?

Not so much President Obama, who in his appearance at the Democratic National Convention on Wednesday was as polished and powerful as ever, extolling the American myth and passing the torch of leadership to Hillary Clinton. Mr. Obama recast himself in the role of elder statesman, complete with silver tie, to match the hair that has silvered in office.

Not so much Michael R. Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York, now an Independent as demonstrated by his neither red nor blue but purple tie, who pointedly declared his allegiance to Mrs. Clinton and called her opponent, Donald J. Trump, a ""dangerous demagogue.""

Not even former President Bill Clinton, who has a complicated road ahead of him building an image of a first man (first spouse?) and who chose, on Tuesday night, the current default Washington option that once upon a time was Mr. Obama's trademark look: dark suit, white shirt, blue tie.

But Tim Kaine. Over the last few nights of the Democratic convention, which was chockablock with national figures, his image was not like the others. It stood out for a reason.

Whenever I write about how women in the political arena dress, I inevitably get accusations of sexism and a number of responses along the lines of: ""Who cares how they dress, you should be writing about what they say!"" It's true that I write about women more than men. But that is because women have more choice in the matter, because they have more choice in general: For them, clothing can become a weapon and a tool in a way it cannot for men, whose options are meaningfully more limited.

That's an asset for a female politician (and happily, the current crop of female leaders are starting to use it), though we tend to tar it as a negative and though all those decisions can also be a pain.

Men really have only the tie and their off-duty wear to telegraph individuality. And, as has been clear over the last few nights in Philadelphia, a kind of general aura that is hard to pin down but creates an impression. That's where Mr. Kaine has come in.

Of all the male power speakers at the convention thus far, he was the least tailored. In fact, he looked kind of schlubby. In his gray suit, which pulled and bunched when he waved his arms, his dull blue shirt, and his tie with the wide red, dark gray and blue stripes that somehow matched his shirt and blended the two together, he looked like the anti-image-consultant guy. And I bet that is all to the good. After all, it is partly the point.

Mr. Kaine may have a lot of experience in government (he does), and foreign policy and military cred (he does), all of which were most material in his selection as vice-presidential candidate, but he is also unshowy; he's the normal guy, in contrast to a woman in extraordinary circumstances. The one who doesn't wear designer duds. The one everyone who doesn't relate to Mrs. Clinton can relate to.

At least, in those clothes he was.

Just consider some of the Twitter reaction:

And the answer to the question in that last tweet: Yes.

Mr. Kaine's role is not unlike the one that Speaker Paul D. Ryan in his too-big suits played for Mitt Romney in 2012, when Mr. Ryan was the guy's guy, the one that brought Mr. Romney down to earth, the -- as Noreen Malone wrote in the New Republic -- ""Midwestern boy next door suddenly thrust into this crazy political world.""

Mr. Kaine is the visual yin to Mrs. Clinton's yang. When you are pitching yourself as the big-tent candidate, you need to make the case every way you can. On Wednesday, the vice-presidential nominee was a meaningful part of that narrative before he even spoke a word."
195,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/27/fashion/michelle-obama-christian-siriano-democratic-national-convention.html,"The first night of the Democratic National Convention on Monday was, rightly, not about the clothes: It was about trying to unify the party, rise above the opponent and so on, as many of my colleagues have described. Which is not to say it lacked a fashion statement or two.

The loudest may have come early in the evening, courtesy of a video starring the economist Austan Goolsbee and the actor Ken Jeong in which Mr. Goolsbee reveals to Mr. Jeong that most of the Donald Trump-branded clothing line is not Made in the U.S.A., but rather in Bangladesh, China, Mexico and other countries (facts that seem to undermine Mr. Trump's assertion of America First but also seem to have had no impact on his supporters). But the most pointed came, not surprisingly, from Michelle Obama.

Not that you would have known it at first. Like her speech, in which she castigated Mr. Trump without ever saying his name, her dress spoke volumes while appearing, at first glance, to be entirely subdued.

Cobalt blue silk crepe, with cap sleeves, a flared skirt and a neat waist, it was by the designer Christian Siriano, and it pretty much matched the backdrop, playing down Mrs. Obama's appearance and playing to the patriotic theme, especially when contrasted with the bright red jacket that Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts wore during her speech.

But the simplicity and the color were just the beginning. See, Mr. Siriano is a former reality TV star -- the only designer to really have emerged from the television show ""Project Runway"" (he won the fourth season competition) and carved out a place on the New York Fashion Week scene.

But unlike another reality TV star, Mr. Siriano has built his career on being inclusive: on catering to women regardless of size or age.

Most recently, he was, for example, the designer who stepped forward (via Instagram) when Leslie Jones, the late-40-something six-foot-tall star of the movie remake ""Ghostbusters,"" complained that no designer wanted to dress her, making a custom off-the-shoulder red gown for her premiere that became something of an internet moment. He also has a collaboration with the plus-size store Lane Bryant, for which he held a runway show at the United Nations this year, and has dressed other celebrities, including Kate Hudson and Zendaya.

""I just don't think anyone should be excluded from having a beautiful dress,"" he said to me when we were talking about the Jones brouhaha, and why he had volunteered to play fairy godfather.

Lest you think Mrs. Obama's wardrobe choice was just happenstance, however, know that the convention appearance was only the second time she has worn Mr. Siriano; the first time was this month, at the funeral for the police officers killed in Dallas.

Throughout her time in the White House, the first lady has made something of a secondary cause out of supporting new, independent American designers, and choosing her clothes not only because she likes them but because their back story has a certain resonance that goes beyond the aesthetic. Monday night was no different. Fashion is not known for its embrace of togetherness (more for its exclusion). But Mr. Siriano is.

Think that's just a coincidence?"
196,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/29/t-magazine/cow-poop-design-museum-castelbosco-farm.html,"THE DAIRY FARMER Gianantonio Locatelli climbed up the steel ladder and peered over the brim of a large corrugated vat, about the size of a very deep above-ground swimming pool. ""It's full!"" he exclaimed, with warbling joy. ""It's beautiful!""

The vat was full of liquid cow dung. I handed my phone to Locatelli's friend, the architect Luca Cipelletti, and climbed the ladder to the top, disembarking on a viewing dock. Beneath my feet the manure bubbled and gurgled, forming foamy peaks and crests. It was a topographical map, a primordial stew. A rich and beautiful shade of brown.

The day was sunny, with a gentle wind. T-shirt weather. From the top of the poop vat we had a view of the entire Castelbosco farm, one of eight farms run by Locatelli in the province of Piacenza, about an hour south of Milan. We could see the barns, home to some 1,500 dairy cows that produce milk for Grana Padano cheese. Their roofs and eaves were painted in cheerful geometric patterns by the British artist David Tremlett: yellows, fuchsias. We could also see the 13th-century medieval castle where Locatelli lives from May to November with his wife, Laura, a cheesemaker. We had breakfasted there a little while ago.

Another vat, this one disused, was directly behind us. At first it appeared to be some kind of ""green roof"" building. But the verdure that covered it had sprouted spontaneously, nourished by the remnants of fecal waste. It reminded me of the wild grasses of Manhattan's High Line.

We took in the processing facilities and digesters, also painted by Tremlett, where cow dung is transformed into electricity. Since 2007, Castelbosco farm has been entirely powered by energy produced on the premises, from the cows' excrement; Locatelli sells the electricity he does not use. Last year, he and Cipelletti, along with the artist Gaspare Luigi Marcone and the art collector Massimo Valsecchi, opened the Shit Museum in 10 rooms on the castle's first floor. It's a charmingly unmodern space that showcases paintings, objects, video art about poop, a display about the dung beetle (also the museum's logo) and a giant coprolite. (Visits are by appointment only, and include a guided tour of the property.)

In addition, the museum produces and sells home goods -- including vases, flowerpots, coffee mugs and plates -- that are made out of a compound of baked manure and clay that they call merdacotta -- ""baked shit."" For a site-specific show, composed of the museum's goods and some of its installations, the group won the top prize for exhibition design at this year's prestigious Milan Design Week.

But I am still standing on top of a vat of liquid waste, and you are wondering about the smell. Of course you are. The thing is, unless you have the well-trained nose of a sommelier or a professional taster, it's hard to describe smells. They are not over there, something to be coolly appraised and summed up; they are overwhelming, literally consuming. Describing a smell is like describing a feeling or a mood or an atmosphere. Smells are reminders of the body's defenselessness and porousness; they come from the inside. But here's what I can say. The smell, from the platform on top of the poop vat, was pleasant -- earthy, farmlike, wholesome. It was far, far preferable to the smell that clung to the barns like a bad memory.

Castelbosco farm is no mom-and-pop operation. Locatelli is an intensive farmer. His cows do not range free over open fields. When they are not being milked, they jostle haunch to haunch in file. Poking their blocky, sweet heads between bars, they scarf ever-diminishing piles of hay. They defecate. Properly speaking, they do all of these activities at once. And these are big animals. Waste floods out of them like water from an open pipe. It drops out of them like grenades. They stand in their own filth. The pregnant ones lie down in it. It stains their haunches.

If the wind is favorable, the odor around the barns is tolerable -- a little sweet, a little sharp. But when the wind blows against you, the odor is rank and nauseating. Fun fact: Every day the cows on Locatelli's farms produce 50,000 kilograms of milk and 150,000 kilos of dung.

It's ammonia that makes manure smell bad, a by-product of its natural decomposition. When manure is collected and stored in an oxygen-free environment, it produces several other gases, including methane -- a greenhouse gas that traps heat many times more effectively than carbon dioxide. Globally, agriculture is the number one source of methane emissions. According to a recent E.P.A. report, in 2014, 8 percent of U.S. methane emissions due to human activity were produced by manure management. And 23 percent were produced by enteric fermentation -- the digestive process in which cows also produce methane, which they mostly release through burping. (A typical dairy cow can emit 145 kilograms of methane per year.)

The liquid manure in the vat was tolerable to the senses because it had already been processed -- the methane and other noxious elements had been removed. What we were standing on was a slurry, a leftover from producing biogas that would be used as liquid fertilizer. The process of extracting methane also leaves behind a dry material that becomes fertilizer, as well as the base for the ­merdacotta.

SUBSTANCE OVER FORM is the mantra of the museum. At dinner the night before, Cipelletti had little to say in favor of contemporary design or architecture. Those disciplines are like fashion, he complained: They pursue form for its own sake, and the result is boring -- decorative and arbitrary. The dining room had been frescoed by Tremlett with white curved lines and bright circles, like gumballs. We were served by a cook named Pablito, with a fantastic, huge head. Pablito rolled each course out on a cart: mushroom risotto, pheasant and potatoes, chocolate mousse. Locatelli agreed that architecture is in a bad way. ""Architects have no heart,"" he said, by which he meant no concepts. ""When a concept is strong,"" Cipelletti said, ""the form is simple.""

The principle of the merdacotta products is anti-design -- substance over form, shit over shape. The molds are simple, clean and classic, with no embellishments. The eye's attention is drawn to the surface, which is uniquely patterned. The clay and dung are mixed with straw that burns off during baking, leaving behind tiny holes and a pink, nubby texture. Most of the items are branded with the museum's logo. They sell hexagonal and rectangular tiles that would be beautiful in a home, huge unadorned Judd-like cubes that can be used as benches or coffee tables, flower pots in the most traditional shapes and a large cylinder called ""Homage to Piero Manzoni,"" a reference to the tin cans that the artist Manzoni sold of his own feces in 1961.

They also make a toilet, a reproduction of a 1920s design. It isn't yet functional. I asked Cipelletti what he thought of Maurizio Cattelan's solid gold toilet, which will be installed at the Guggenheim for patrons to use. ""We're against it!"" he said, laughing uproariously. Then he tried a more diplomatic tack. ""Which toilet do you think is more contemporary?"" he asked. He answered himself. Cattelan's toilet is decadent, a totem for the culture we have; the museum's toilet is sustainable, a totem for the culture we need.

Cipelletti spoke repeatedly of his desire to ""get back to basics,"" or ""back to zero."" He meant that given the growing awareness of climate change and the reckonings attendant on the Anthropocene -- the idea that human beings have entered an era where we are irrevocably changing the Earth's ecology -- a small clay pisspot is a cutting-edge technology. ""Art,"" Locatelli said in an outburst of passion, ""shows us what is possible.""

Locatelli is a collector. He is especially passionate about conceptual art; he lived in Greenwich Village in the 1970s, where he first encountered Warhol and Pop Art. He loves punk music and Devo; his conversation is peppered with references to John Cage and Gordon Matta-Clark.

Cipelletti specializes in museum design. ""A museum should be a place of change,"" he said. It should change its visitors, and it should always be changing. Museums, he insisted, are not collections of objects; they are ways of thinking. Here, the museum displays photographs and films and drawings. But though art inspired them, it is secondary to the message. ""Art supports the idea,"" Locatelli said. Regardless of the space or exhibition he's working on, Cipelletti's aesthetic emphasizes ""showing the layers"" -- making history visible in a contemporary way. This philosophy takes an eccentric turn in one of the bathrooms of Locatelli's castle, where the walls are partially made of exposed dried cow dung. It's good insulation, not at all cold to the touch. The brown is set off by a cool aquamarine paint and fixtures.

AS LONG AS THERE have been people living in proximity to cows, there have been people making use of their waste -- fabricating bricks or dwellings; tennis courts; coffee filters; paper. As for turning fecal matter into electricity, it's done here in the United States, too: As of May, there were approximately 240 digesters operating on American farms. That number is increasing. Obama wants to cut methane emissions in the oil and gas sector by 40 to 45 percent by 2025. The focus on methane emissions has led to a corresponding push for sustainable manure management programs.

Merdacotta's appeal has more to do with a principle of zero waste than with creating a building material that is superior to existing building materials. As Andrew Dent, a Ph.D. in materials science who works for Material ConneXion, said to me, ""He's doing what we all would like to do, which is to use the whole of the cow -- its waste as well as its milk and its hide and flesh. But is it going to be an industrialized process which takes over existing industrialized terracotta? Probably not.""

It might not take over, but I can imagine a day when Home Depot sells flowerpots made out of merdacotta, or a similar material. It has a rough, artisanal-looking appeal lacking in mass-produced terracotta. It's also lighter. Recently, when Cipelletti and Locatelli applied too late to get a booth at the Orticola Flower Show in Milan, they simply tied their own merdacotta flower pots to their heads and walked around the market. The short-term benefits of merdacotta are twofold. It makes use of Locatelli's cow dung, which is otherwise expensive and wasteful to dispose of, and it provokes people.

Microorganisms, excrement: These are materials that are usually invisible, either because we literally can't see them, as in the case of bacteria, or because we choose not to. It's not that we don't imagine feces as a renewable resource -- it's that we don't imagine it, period. Our ancestors didn't have this choice. They emptied their chamberpots in basements. They used human waste as a weapon -- spread it on arrows, filled bombs with it and flung it over enemy walls. This thing where humanity flushes without looking down and never thinks about it again is relatively new, and it cannot last.

You can't ignore shit. It will have its revenge. When Cipelletti and Locatelli began renovating the physical space of the museum, they realized that the castle was sinking, because the basement was filled with hundreds of years of feces. In the final room of the exhibition space, they've cut a hole in the floor through which you can see down into this centuries-old cloaca. Dung is compacted into dusty boulders, mounds the size of calves. Creating their museum of poop caused them to discover the centuries of waste Locatelli had been living on all along. Shit saved the castle."
197,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/01/us/politics/obama-asia-trip.html,"President Obama leaves on Wednesday for his final trip in office to the other side of the world, heading to China and Laos after a brief stop on a spit of land in the middle of the Pacific Ocean.

As president, Mr. Obama has promised to reframe American foreign policy toward Asia as part of a ""pivot"" intended to focus more on the emerging trading partners in that region. The president's weeklong trip is his last big effort to make that policy a reality.

But on the way, the president will spend two days highlighting his commitment to combating climate change. On Wednesday, Air Force One will travel to Hawaii, with a stop at Lake Tahoe, Nev., where Mr. Obama will speak at a climate change summit meeting organized by Senator Harry Reid of Nevada, the Democratic leader.

On Thursday, the president will fly to Midway Atoll, a tiny island in the Pacific and the site of a critical victory by United States naval forces over the Japanese during World War II. It is now a national wildlife refuge. On the island, Mr. Obama will announce a vast expansion of the Papahanaumokuakea Marine National Monument to highlight the importance of protecting lands and waters from the perils of climate change.

Then it is on to China, where the president is expected to discuss trade and climate change, along with contentious issues like cyberintrusions and tensions in the South China Sea.

In Laos, Mr. Obama will open ties with another reclusive communist state and will seek conciliation years after the United States dropped numerous bombs -- many of which remain buried and unexploded -- on the country during the Vietnam War."
198,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/27/business/entrepreneur-immigration.html,"Foreign entrepreneurs building new companies in the United States could soon gain a new immigration option that would grant them temporary entry for up to five years, under a rule proposed on Friday by the Department of Homeland Security.

The proposal, which does not require congressional approval, would allow immigration officials to admit entrepreneurs case by case. To qualify, an applicant must have an ""active and central role,"" and a significant ownership stake, in an American company founded in the last three years.

The move is one of many piecemeal efforts by the Obama administration to expand America's immigration policies without action from Congress. Entrepreneurs in any industry would be eligible to apply, but the new rule would be especially significant for the technology field. Creating an immigration route for start-up founders has been one of Silicon Valley's political priorities.

""This is a big step in the right direction,"" said Patrick Collison, an Irish immigrant and the chief executive of Stripe, a payment processing company based in San Francisco. ""I think it will have major impact on U.S. entrepreneurship, and potentially on the broader economy.""

More than half of American tech start-ups valued at $1 billion or more had at least one immigrant founder, according to a recent study by the National Foundation for American Policy, a research group that focuses on immigration issues.

Mr. Collison and his brother John started Stripe five years ago while attending colleges in Massachusetts. Dealing with the brothers' visa issues was one of the biggest challenges Stripe had to overcome in its early days, Mr. Collison said. The company now has more than 500 employees, and Mr. Collison is part of a group of Silicon Valley executives and investors pressing for immigration reform.

President Obama made it a signature policy issue, speaking frequently about the need for a path that would allow skilled entrepreneurs to build new companies and create jobs, but efforts to create a ""start-up visa"" for foreign entrepreneurs have repeatedly died in Congress.

In 2014, Mr. Obama changed tactics, using an executive action to order federal officials to draft a plan for granting some entrepreneurs temporary immigration status.

The proposal put forth on Friday circumvents visas by relying on a federal law that lets the secretary of homeland security temporarily admit people whose entry into the United States would create ""significant public benefit."" Around 3,000 entrepreneurs a year may qualify, according to an estimate from the Department of Homeland Security.

Sophie Alcorn, an immigration lawyer in Mountain View, Calif., said the new rule, if adopted, could significantly ease the challenges faced by fledgling entrepreneurs, especially those who came to the United States to attend college and began working on a new venture.

""I get calls every day from desperate start-up founders who are brilliant and accomplished, but they get into this chicken-and-egg problem,"" she said. ""Investors won't give them money unless they can be confident that people can get into the country, or remain here.""

Immigration has become a major flash point in this year's presidential race, with the Republican nominee, Donald J. Trump, calling for stricter limits on entry and his Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, proposing automatic green cards for foreign students who earn advanced degrees in technical fields from American universities.

Deepak Kamra, a venture capitalist, testified before Congress three years ago in favor of a visa for entrepreneurs. The idea had broad bipartisan backing, he said, but kept falling apart over the issue's politics.

""Establishment Republicans and Democrats all support this, but they all then back up and say, 'It should be part of comprehensive immigration reform,' which is code for, 'It's not going anywhere,'"" Mr. Kamra said.

The main immigration pathway for foreign workers with specialized skills, the H-1B visa program, has been plagued by controversy and abuses, and labor groups generally oppose efforts to expand it. But past proposals to create pathways for entrepreneurs have drawn fairly little criticism, in part because the suggested programs are typically small and targeted.

The Department of Homeland Security's 155-page proposal will be open for public comment for 45 days. After that, the department can move forward with a final rule, which could take effect as soon as next year."
199,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/21/business/as-the-for-profit-world-moves-into-an-elder-care-program-some-worry.html,"DENVER -- Inside a senior center here, nestled along a bustling commercial strip, Vivian Malveaux scans her bingo card for a winning number. Her 81-year-old eyes are warm, lively and occasionally set adrift by the dementia plundering her mind.

Dozens of elderly men and women -- some in wheelchairs, others whose hands tremble involuntarily -- gather excitedly around the game tables. After bingo, there is more entertainment and activities: Yahtzee, tile-painting, beading.

But this is no linoleum-floored community center reeking of bleach. Instead, it's one of eight vanguard centers owned by InnovAge, a company based in Denver with ambitious plans. With the support of private equity money, InnovAge aims to aggressively expand a little-known Medicare program that will pay to keep older and disabled Americans out of nursing homes.

Until recently, only nonprofits were allowed to run programs like these. But a year ago, the government flipped the switch, opening the program to for-profit companies as well, ending one of the last remaining holdouts to commercialism in health care. The hope is that the profit motive will expand the services faster.

Hanging over all the promise, though, is the question of whether for-profit companies are well-suited to this line of work, long the province of nonprofit do-gooders. Critics point out that the business of caring for poor and frail people is marred with abuse. Already, new ideas for lowering the cost of the program have started circulating. In Silicon Valley, for example, some eager entrepreneurs are pushing plans that call for a higher reliance on video calls instead of in-face doctor visits.

The business appeal is simple: A baby boom-propelled surge in government health care spending is coming. Medicare enrollment is expected to grow by 30 million people in the next two decades, and many of those people are potential future clients. Adding to the allure are hefty profit margins for programs like these -- as high as 15 percent, compared with an average of 2 percent among nursing homes -- and geographic monopolies that are all but guaranteed by state Medicaid agencies to ensure the solvency of providers.

The goal of the program, known as PACE, or the Program of All-Inclusive Care for the Elderly, is to help frail, older Americans live longer and more happily in their own homes, by providing comprehensive medical care and intensive social support. It also promises to save Medicare and Medicaid millions of dollars by keeping those people out of nursing homes.

For decades, though, the program has failed to catch on, with only 40,000 people enrolled as of January of this year.

""PACE is still a secret in the minds of the public,"" Andy Slavitt, Medicare's acting administrator, said at the National PACE Association meeting in April. The challenge, he said, was to make PACE ""a clear part of the solution.""

Several private equity firms, venture capitalists and Silicon Valley entrepreneurs have jumped into the niche. F-Prime Capital Partners, a former Fidelity Biosciences group, provided seed funding for a PACE-related start-up, as have well-regarded angel investors like Amir Dan Rubin, the former Stanford Health Care president, and Michael Zubkoff, a Dartmouth health care economist.

And no company has moved with more tenacity than InnovAge. Last year, the company overcame protests from watchdog groups to convert from a nonprofit organization to a for-profit business in Colorado. And in May, InnovAge received $196 million in backing -- the largest investment in a PACE business since the rule change was made -- from Welsh, Carson, Anderson & Stowe, a private equity firm with $10 billion in assets under management.

""For years we were pariahs, and no one wanted anything to do with us,"" said Julie Reiskin, executive director of the Colorado Cross-Disability Coalition, a nonprofit group that advocates for people with disabilities, many of whom are eligible for PACE.

""Now that there's money involved,"" Ms. Reiskin said, ""everyone is all interested.""

Even the program's supporters acknowledge that the movement needs fresh momentum. But they worry that commercial operators will tarnish their image in the same way many for-profits eroded trust in hospice care and nursing homes.

Three decades ago, after Congress authorized Medicare to pay for hospice care, commercial operators displaced the religious and community groups that had championed the movement. As recently as 2014, government inspectors found that for-profit hospice companies cherry-picked patients and stinted on care.

In addition, elderly patients with dementia and chronic ailments have frequently been targets of abuse and neglect at nursing homes, something advocates for the elderly say is correlated with the increased commercialization of that industry.

""I'm not wild about every knucklehead running around trying to do PACE,"" said Thomas Scully, former Medicare administrator under President George W. Bush. ""I would rather keep it below the radar.""

Not Quite Able

Early last year, Ms. Malveaux was drowning. She lived alone in a tidy red-brick home in a leafy Denver neighborhood that she paid for by working shifts at a Samsonite luggage factory, now closed.

Laundry piled up. Bills went unpaid. Doors were left unlocked. Pans sometimes burned on the stove as her memory failed.

""I had lost my mind,"" she recalled, sitting on her couch in a pink velour robe. ""I couldn't keep up my house.""

For Americans who find themselves in this situation, the next stop is often a traditional nursing home. Ms. Malveaux's son took her instead to visit an InnovAge day center.

The $9 million building south of downtown Denver is designed to calm people with dementia. It has subdued lighting and winding hallways that encircle the first floor like a running track and discourage ""exit-seeking behaviors,"" where patients search for ways out of a building.

For the frightened Ms. Malveaux, it seemed like paradise: a flower garden, a beauty salon and day trips to casinos and candy factories. And, most importantly, it had a team of doctors, nurses, psychiatrists, dentists, physical therapists, nutritionists, home health aides and social workers whose purpose was to help her live safely in her beloved brick home.

After joining the center last June 2015, Ms. Malveaux began seeing a psychiatrist and went on medication for depression. A social worker coached her grandson, Jermaine Malveaux, on how to care for someone with dementia. Three days a week, an InnovAge van picks up Ms. Malveaux at home and takes her to the center to share lunch with other older adults and try her luck at bingo and ceramics.

""I make friends easily,"" she said with a smile. ""And the guys flirt with me.""

The InnovAge center, like other PACE facilities, is inspired by Britain's much-lauded Day Hospitals, outpatient health care facilities that arose in the 1950s that became a hub of daily life for many older people. In the United States, the earliest incarnation of PACE was started in San Francisco in 1971 by a group of Asian and Italian immigrant families seeking alternatives to the American nursing home.

Federal health officials allowed the group, called On Lok -- Cantonese for ""peaceful, happy abode"" -- to test what was then a novel and prophetic approach to health care financing. Instead of physicians billing Medicare each time they treated a patient, the government would pay a fixed amount to the center for each member. On Lok would assume the financial risk, similar to an insurance company. In 1990, Medicare officially sanctioned the model.

In exchange for a capped monthly payment from Medicare and Medicaid, PACE staff members arrange and pay for all of a patient's doctors' visits, medications, rehabilitation and hospitalizations. At the same time, they are supposed to pay attention to the patient's daily needs -- meals, bathing, housekeeping and transportation to day centers, where older people can ward off isolation and cognitive decline by socializing. (Studies have found that the intensive caretaking reduces costly hospital stays.)

Comparing the cost effectiveness of PACE against nursing homes is difficult, partly because state Medicaid agencies pay a variety of rates. But all the states are required to keep their rates below what they would pay for nursing home care. In Colorado, for example, that amounts to 7 percent less per patient.

On average, Medicare and Medicaid pay PACE providers $76,728 a person a year, about $5,500 less than the average cost of a nursing home. And the money going to PACE covers all of the person's health and social needs, unlike nursing home care, which doesn't include hospitalizations and other expensive medical care.

The flat government payment pushes the organizations to invest in maintaining a patient's health and safety to avoid big hospital bills. Dentistry -- excluded from traditional Medicare coverage -- is a crucial focus: Programs invest heavily to fix broken teeth and dentures to avoid costly infections or poor nutrition that can cause cascading health problems.

Providers are also generous with rehabilitation, setting few limits on training sessions that strengthen injured muscles and sturdy patients against falls.

""If you're neglecting these patients, the odds they'll call an ambulance and go to the hospital and spend a week there because they're really sick is pretty high, and that all comes out of the payment,"" said Bob Kocher, a former senior health care adviser to President Obama.

Profits are in no way guaranteed, though. The centers still face major financial risk -- it just takes a few patients with serious medical conditions to upend the books.

Dan Gray, a PACE financing consultant at Continuum Development Services, said too many trips to the emergency room or an expensive hospital stay can flip fortunes. One organization he advises had $300,000 in hospital medical claims in a month that he refers to as ""Black August.""

""I had a nervous twitch,"" he said.

High-Tech vs. High-Touch

In January, at the health care industry's leading matchmaking event, the J.P. Morgan Healthcare Conference in San Francisco, word quickly spread that PACE programs could save states and the federal government up to 20 percent a patient. And suddenly, the program became one of the hottest topics of discussion.

""Every other conversation was, 'What do you think we should do with PACE?'"" said Bill Pomeranz, a managing director at Cain Brothers, who helped finance the nation's first PACE program in the 1970s.

The message appeared to travel down Highway 101 as well, to the heart of the technology industry. At least eight start-ups have circulated PACE-related pitches to Silicon Valley venture capital firms, hoping to tap into new capital and create technology-enabled versions of the program.

The interest of the tech industry is so far only nascent. But the possibility that Silicon Valley, notoriously aggressive and extremely deep-pocketed, could play a significant role in PACE underscores the changes that may lie ahead.

Building a center requires medical offices, rehabilitation equipment, food service and fleets of handicapped-accessible vans. On average, it takes up to $12 million just to get it off the ground. That is a lot of money for most nonprofits but relatively little in the technology world. Opening new centers may become less of a hurdle.

The tech industry and nonprofit world are driven by different impulses. The early centers were closely tied to local cultures, making them difficult to replicate. An aversion to aggressive marketing among the center's leaders didn't help, either. Tech likes to move as fast as possible.

""PACE reminds me of religious orthodoxy,"" said Mr. Pomeranz, who said he had affection for the program. The movement's leaders come from the world of public health and have a ""social work mentality,"" he added.

The pitches circulating among investors envision technology-enabled programs that would rely, in part, on video visits and sensors. Some studies have found that telemedicine can help patients better control certain chronic conditions and reduce health care spending. But those technologies are largely untested in geriatric care.

""The entrepreneurs coming into this space all believe there are much lower-cost ways to check on patients every day than driving them all to one building,"" said Mr. Kocher, who is now a partner at the venture capital firm Venrock, which invests in health care companies.

These sorts of pitches, while promising, have not been universally welcomed. They have even been used as evidence that opening PACE up to for-profit companies might lead to unwanted consequences.

Veteran PACE providers, for example, are skeptical of virtual medicine's benefits to seniors, especially those with dementia.

""Socialization goes a long way to improve the health of the participants we serve,"" said Kelly Hopkins, president of Trinity Health PACE, a nonprofit health system that operates PACE centers in eight states. ""It's naïve to think you can do it virtually.""

Supporters of the change say the necessary safeguards are in place. The for-profit centers were approved, to little fanfare, after the Department of Health and Human Services submitted the results of a pilot study to Congress in June 2015. The demonstration project, in Pennsylvania, showed no difference in quality of care and costs between nonprofit PACE providers and a for-profit allowed to operate there.

The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services has vowed to closely track the performance of all PACE operators by measuring emergency room use, falls and vaccination rates, among other metrics. The National PACE Association, a policy and lobbying group, is also considering peer-reviewed accreditation to help safeguard the program. Oversight is now largely left to state Medicaid agencies.

Maureen Hewitt, InnovAge's chief executive, said, ""At the end of the day, we're held to the same quality and care standards.""

Dr. Si France, a founder of WelbeHealth, an early-stage company based in Menlo Park, Calif., says start-ups can use technology to improve clinical communication, help caregivers make treatment decisions and monitor patients at home or in a hospital. But he insists even a high-tech PACE program cannot veer from its origins.

""It's not a way to get rich or generate outsize returns,"" said Dr. France, the former chief executive of GoHealth, a chain of urgent care centers acquired by TPG Capital, a private equity firm. ""We think this is an arena for missionaries, not mercenaries.""

Will Money Change Things?

Families enrolled in InnovAge's PACE program in Denver appeared to be unaware of its conversion into a for-profit enterprise. The company did not announce the change directly to its participants, but notified a patient advisory group.

Kathy Baron, 68, who lives in subsidized senior housing, was left disabled by breast cancer and debilitating nerve pain. Her daughter, Leah van Zelm, struggled to take care of her. So Ms. Baron, fearful she would be deemed unfit to stay in her apartment, signed up for InnovAge's program.

""I would rather be dead than go into a nursing home,"" Ms. Baron said.

She says InnovAge has been generous with services, echoing interviews with other patients. Each week, an InnovAge housekeeper changes the sheets on her bed, launders her clothes and cleans her apartment, a service provided to those unable to tidy their own homes. The few times her requests for special equipment or services were denied, Ms. Baron appealed and won.

But she worries new investors will skimp on what outsiders might view as unwarranted services. The company's commercials, promising ""Life on Your Terms"" and voiced by the actress Susan Sarandon, have reinforced those concerns.

It's a concern echoed by Ms. Malveaux's family. ""Anytime you involve money,"" said Jermaine Malveaux, Ms. Malveaux's grandson, ""there's always the concern for greed, especially with the elderly.""

At least in the near future, the number of companies getting into PACE programs will be limited. Most states cap enrollment in PACE centers. And each state -- as Colorado did, opening the window for InnovAge -- likely needs to amend its law to allow the for-profit companies. So far, it appears only California has done so.

Yet there is a growing realization among longtime PACE providers that new competition looms.

In a newsletter to the generally placid PACE community, one adviser warned that providers who failed to become bigger would face new entrants who ""will find a way to meet the needs of persons in your community.""

Those needs will only grow as the adult children of baby boomers face difficult decisions about how to care for their parents.

In the meantime, for people like Ms. Van Zelm, the anxiety that once pervaded her daily life has diminished.

""When she's stable,"" Ms. Van Zelm said of her mother, ""my daily life stress is reduced."""
200,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/24/opinion/hillary-health-shocker.html,"Although she has gone to extraordinary lengths to distract and deceive American voters, the truth is finally coming out: Hillary Clinton has an 11th toe.

I don't have the medical records. She refuses to release them. But just try to come up with some other explanation for why she's so infrequently photographed in sandals or flip-flops; why she seldom appears barefoot in public; why, during debates, she keeps her legs, especially the lower halves, tucked carefully behind the lectern.

She's covering something up, and it's that freakish, disqualifying digit.

Have you watched her walk? Look closely. She wobbles a bit, or maybe it's more of a teeter, combined with a lurch, and the likeliest cause is podiatric asymmetry. I consulted foot specialists. At least they referred to themselves that way online, and when I assured them that an interview with me could be their springboard to Sean Hannity, they opened up.

""Does Hillary Clinton have a superfluous toe?"" I asked one of them.

""I can't definitively rule that out,"" he said.

""Hillary Clinton: Hobbled and hiding it?"" I asked the other, who agreed that ""until she permits a thorough examination of her feet -- and I mean both of them -- how can we be sure?""

I'm not holding my breath. Clinton doesn't volunteer information; she waits for the subpoena. A letter from her longtime physician that she provided last year was all of two pages long, and that's not nearly enough medical detail about a 68-year-old raring to take on one of the most grueling jobs on the planet, let alone a 68-year-old facing a swirl of questions -- a swirl, mind you! -- about her gait.

Admittedly, Donald Trump, 70, gave us considerably less, even though he'd be the oldest first-term president ever. In a paltry cluster of sentences, his supposed doctor pronounced his health ""astonishingly excellent,"" a diagnostic term heretofore absent from the medical literature, and that same sycophant -- I mean doctor -- demonstrated impressive retroactive omniscience, saying that he could ""state unequivocally"" that no American president had been in shape as splendiferous as Trump's.

This testimonial was less science than sonnet: gushing, besotted.

I'm pretty sure it was written in iambic pentameter. Phrases were plagiarized from Michelle Obama's 2008 physical.

But you merely need to watch Trump lope from his comfy chauffeured car to his plush private jet to know that everything below his waist is working magnificently, including his toes, of which there are an even number. They're amazing toes. You won't believe these toes. Vladimir Putin once offered several Russian oil fields in exchange for them. Paul Manafort drew up the contract, including his 40 percent commission for the swap.

But back to Clinton. In her physician's report, did you see anything about her feet? No. Rudy Giuliani pointed this out. He was on Fox News, raving about what an obvious invalid she is and leaving out the part about his decision not to run against her for a Senate seat in 2000 because he was battling prostate cancer while she was sturdy as an ox. An ox with an extra toe, that is, although her critics didn't catch it at the time.

Maybe they weren't Googling aggressively enough. We're only now realizing the full potential of the internet, which connects visionary dissidents once dismissed as isolated crackpots and gives them a big, ready billboard for their hallucinations -- oops, revelations. They can tweet the unvarnished, unshod truth, and who needs cumbersome Freedom of Information Act requests or tedious investigative journalism when you have hashtags? #ShowTheToe.

The lamestream media pussyfoots around all of this, protecting Clinton by persecuting Trump for his unshared tax returns. It's a classic diversionary tactic. But while a man's bank account is personal, a woman's body is public. It's in the Constitution, maybe one of the amendments, or should be.

Besides, there are ramifications to whatever's going on inside Clinton's clogs. An extra toe means an extra toenail, and can a country in straits as dire as ours suffer a commander in chief whose pedicure takes minutes longer than the average American's?

If it's on her left foot, which is what some carefully edited video suggests, it means she's pulled constantly to the left. We can't have that.

Not everyone in the Clinton Conspiracy Industry agrees that this is a matter to be pressed as forcefully as others. They say it jumbles together issues of vastly discrepant seriousness: her emails, the Clinton Foundation, Benghazi, Birkenstocks. They say it turns each assertion of scandal into more white noise.

But that's flawed thinking -- and a defeatist attitude to boot. When you're hunting game as slippery as Clinton, you use every weapon you have, never knowing which will trip her up and take her down. Mark my words. This toe could be her Achilles' heel."
201,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/14/world/middleeast/pompeo-iran-middle-east-coalition.html,"RIYADH, Saudi Arabia -- In a barnstorming tour that took him to eight countries in one week, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo burned with one central message: ""The need to counter the greatest threat of all in the Middle East, the Iranian regime and its campaigns of terrorism and destruction,"" as he put it in Cairo on Thursday.

Jetting from capital to capital, meeting with kings, princes and presidents, his goal was to get Arab countries to work together to roll back Iranian influence in the region and take on the militias Iran is backing.

But as the trip drew to a close on Monday, it was unclear whether he had made any notable progress on that front. The obstacles toward building such a coalition are formidable.

In practice, it will be difficult for the Arab nations to work closely together on anti-Iran policies because of the complexity of relationships in the region, officials and analysts from those countries say. The Iranian-backed militias Mr. Pompeo wants to rein in vary widely and would resist a one-size-fits all solution: Hezbollah is a major force in the government of Lebanon, the groups in Syria work mostly apart from one another in the war zone, and those in Iraq have great influence in the oil-rich south.

American officials have had difficulty coordinating their own anti-Iran policy beyond economic sanctions, which Mr. Trump imposed in November after withdrawing from a nuclear arms agreement that the Obama administration and other governments had reached with Iran.

Against the wishes of all his top national security officials, Mr. Trump decided last month to withdraw about 2,000 American troops from eastern Syria, which would cede any leverage the Americans had to limit the presence of Iranian forces and Iranian-backed militias there -- precisely the goal that Mr. Pompeo was asking Arab partners to take up across the region.

And Mr. Pompeo offered no explanation of how he expected other countries to do the job.

When asked Monday what the United States wanted Arab nations to do to get rid of the militias, Mr. Pompeo did not give specific answers.

He said Iran aimed to dominate ""five capitals,"" a reference to the government seats of Iraq, Lebanon, Syria, Yemen and Iran itself.

""And our effort is to make sure that the Iranian people get control of their capital, and that it becomes a nation that is normal and isn't conducting terror campaigns that are unrivaled anyplace else in the world,"" he said.

In general, Mr. Pompeo's message was well received among Sunni Arab leaders. They tend to consider Iran, a Shiite Persian nation, to be a threat.

""We all have problems with Iran's expansionist policies in the region,"" Jordan's foreign minister, Ayman Safadi, said in a news conference with Mr. Pompeo in Amman last week. ""All Arab countries, and I think the United States too, would want healthy relations based on the principle of nonintervention in the internal affairs of the other, and respecting the sovereignty of other countries.""

In Cairo, Mr. Pompeo said that Egypt, Oman, Kuwait and Jordan had been ""instrumental in thwarting Iran's efforts to evade sanctions."" And he said that Bahrain was working to combat Iran's ""illicit maritime activities"" in the region.

Mr. Pompeo has not yet proposed that Arab nations outside the war zones send troops to fight the militias, though he has left open the possibility of the United States helping piece together an Arab military coalition to move into northeastern Syria as the United States withdraws.

In any case, troop deployments could prove to be as ineffective as they have been in Yemen. Since 2015, Saudi Arabia, one of the world's largest spenders on military hardware, has failed to oust Houthi rebels who are aligned with Iran from the capital of Yemen, the Arab world's poorest state. The fighting has resulted in the world's worst humanitarian crisis.

The creation of a unified Arab coalition against Iran would require resolving many political, economic and military issues among Arab countries.

""If you are talking about coordination in certain areas, that is already taking place, but if you want to create a military alliance, an Arab NATO, I think it's a nonstarter,"" said Marwan Muasher, the vice president for studies at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace and a former foreign minister of Jordan. ""The ingredients are not there.""

He cited a number of factors: disputes between states like Saudi Arabia and Qatar, the inability to integrate Arab armies, the lack of any kind of united command structure and the fact that not all of the United States' Arab allies view Iran at the same level of threat.

""I also don't see a small country like Jordan, with limited resources, participating in a military alliance,"" Mr. Muasher said. ""Iran is not seen in a good light among many of the countries of the region, but that is different from participating in a military alliance against it. I don't think this is an idea that will gain a lot of traction in countries other than Saudi Arabia.""

Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates are leading the anti-Iran charge in the region. Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman of Saudi Arabia has compared Iran's supreme leader to Hitler and even threatened to incite violence inside of Iran. This has made him the go-to partner for the Iran hard-liners in the Trump administration. Prince Mohammed has also led a quiet détente between his kingdom and Israel, which, like Saudi Arabia, views Iran as an archenemy.

Many countries in the region do see Iran as a foe, but some, like Egypt and Jordan, do not feel directly threatened by it and would be hesitant to risk confronting it. Smaller Gulf states, like Kuwait, Bahrain and Oman, maintain diplomatic and trade ties with Iran and would be unlikely to join in hostilities against it.

Iraq, however, is dominated by Shiite Arabs and shares a long border and deep cultural, religious and political ties with Iran.

Trump administration officials have insisted to Iraqi leaders that they begin severing economic ties to Iran, and have urged Saudi Arabia and other Arab nations to help improve Iraq's economy.

""There are lots of economic things we might do to assist Iraq getting back on its feet, which will permit them to be more independent, have more control, be more sovereign,"" Mr. Pompeo said Monday.

But while the Iraqi government has taken steps to loosen itself from Iran's tight embrace, it has shown no inclination to oppose it.

""Iraq is not a part of the American sanctions system and Iraq is not a part of the system of attacking any state,"" Prime Minister Adel Abdul Mahdi said in November.

Mowaffak al-Rubaie, a former Iraqi national security adviser, said that Mr. Pompeo had ""tunnel vision"" when it came to the Middle East.

""There are a lot of other problems than Iran, but they are obsessed with Iran,"" he said. ""If two fish fight in the Tigris River, it is because of Iran.""

He said Iraq, which waged a long war against Iran in the 1980s and has fought several wars since, had no interest in joining another one.

""I don't want to be a victim of America versus Iran or Saudi Arabia versus Iran,"" he said. ""I don't get anything out of that.""

Nabil Fahmy, a former Egyptian foreign minister, said that he and many in the Arab world agreed that regional countries should play a greater role in ensuring broad stability. But it will take time for individual Arab countries to develop their own military capabilities as well as some sort of mechanism to allow different states to work together.

""You build your military and political capacity gradually and you do that with your friends providing support in the meantime,"" he said. ""In the absence of that, who will have instant capabilities or bear the paramount, singular responsibility of putting troops in harm's way and boots on the ground?""

Michael Knights, a senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy, said that up to now, the United States had taken a calibrated and piecemeal approach to opposing the Iranian militias, and it should continue with that method.

Iran's support of militias, he said, was ""a tricky model of expansion to counter."""
202,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/14/us/politics/ivanka-trump-world-bank-president.html,"WASHINGTON -- Ivanka Trump, the president's eldest daughter and senior adviser, will play a role in helping to select the next head of the World Bank, the White House said Monday.

Ms. Trump, who had been rumored to be a contender for the position herself, will not be a candidate, a Trump administration official said. But she will assist the Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, and the acting White House chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, in choosing a successor to Jim Yong Kim, the current president of the World Bank who announced last week he would be stepping down.

Mr. Mnuchin called Ms. Trump last week and asked her if she would be involved, an administration official said.

Jessica Ditto, a White House spokeswoman, said Ms. Trump was asked because ""she's worked closely with the World Bank's leadership for the past two years.""

Administration officials are expected to begin the interview process for the job, which has always gone to an American, on Tuesday. The White House did not provide any names of contenders, but the official noted that one person whose name has been floated -- Nikki R. Haley, the former United Nations ambassador -- was not a candidate.

Ms. Trump, Mr. Mnuchin and Mr. Mulvaney will make recommendations to President Trump, who will nominate a candidate for the position. Member countries of the World Bank will then vote on the nominee.

Traditionally, the American president's pick is accepted and Europe chooses the leader of the International Monetary Fund because both institutions were founded during World War II. Mr. Kim, for instance, a former Dartmouth College president and a global health expert, was selected for the post by President Barack Obama in 2012.

Ms. Trump is seen inside the White House as having unique sway over her father, especially when it comes to personnel decisions. In a speech on Monday in front of a farm convention in New Orleans, Mr. Trump even conceded that it was Ms. Trump's constant nagging that pushed him to support a child care tax credit in the tax bill passed last year. ""Dad, Dad, we have to get it passed,"" Mr. Trump said, mimicking his daughter's successful pressure campaign.

In explaining Ms. Trump's qualifications for participating in the selection process, the administration official cited both Ms. Trump's close relationship with Mr. Mnuchin as well as her work with Mr. Kim.

Last year, for instance, she helped start the Women Entrepreneurs Finance Initiative, a fund administered by the World Bank and branded ""We-Fi,"" at the Group of 20 conference in Hamburg, Germany. The goal of the fund, which Ms. Trump is credited with envisioning, is to generate $1.6 billion in capital for female entrepreneurs in developing countries.

Ms. Trump's involvement with the World Bank has drawn criticism in the past. Senator Benjamin L. Cardin, Democrat of Maryland, sent a letter last year to Mr. Mnuchin raising questions about her role with the fund, given that her eponymous women's apparel and accessories brand could stand to benefit from its work. Since then, however, Ms. Trump has shut down her clothing line.

But Richard W. Painter, who served as chief ethics lawyer under President George W. Bush, still questioned Ms. Trump's involvement, noting that she holds trademarks around the world, even if she has shut down her brand. He said he had similar doubts about her husband, Jared Kushner, also a senior White House adviser.

""I do not believe that Ivanka and Jared have sufficiently divested their assets that they can participate personally and substantially in economic policy -- particularly international economic matters -- without risk of violating financial conflict of interest laws,"" he said."
203,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/19/magazine/naturalized-citizenship-immigration-trump.html,"On the morning of June 2, 2017, Odette Dureland woke to a loud knock on the door of the one-story bungalow that she shares with her husband and her children. She was recovering from minor surgery, so her 26-year-old daughter, Rebecca, rose to open the door. Outside, there was a group of federal agents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

Rebecca was confused: Everyone in her family was a citizen. She told the officers there must be a mistake. They told Rebecca there wasn't; they had a warrant for the arrest of her mother. One officer ordered Odette to dress and then led her out of the house and into a government vehicle.

At that time, Odette, Gilbert and Rebecca had been American citizens for five years. They had lived in the United States for more than two decades, since political violence in their native Haiti forced them to flee in the mid-1990s. Gilbert had joined protests following the first overthrow of the Haitian president Jean-Bertrand Aristide, which made him a target of the new ruling party -- he was beaten and jailed, his right eyeball destroyed. Odette remembers her husband coming home, his face battered. Gilbert fled to the United States. Odette and Rebecca eventually followed, boarding a rickety boat and landing on a Florida beach.

After several years in the United States, Gilbert was granted political asylum, and he filed petitions for Odette and Rebecca. In 2002, the couple applied for green cards. They began working as janitors and had three more children, eventually moving into the bungalow in East Lake, Fla., where they still live. Their youngest child is now in high school, while another is studying elementary education at a nearby college and another is in Air Force training; Rebecca, who has a young baby of her own, works at a nearby call center. ""We can say we are proud of this,"" Gilbert told me.

In 2012, Odette, Gilbert and Rebecca finally applied to become United States citizens, and later that year they took their oaths of allegiance. ""It felt big, like we were really American, even though I've been here for all my life,"" Rebecca says. Odette, too, felt a sense of deep relief after becoming a citizen. ""We came from a country where there was chaos,"" she says. ""When we had the opportunity to become citizens, we thought this was the best thing to do, that it would provide safety."" She had not anticipated how freeing it would feel to engage fully as a citizen, in the country that had become her home. She voted in her first United States election and traveled back to Haiti for the first time in nearly two decades, without worrying that her life in America was at risk.

But then, the knock on the door. The officers were agents from Homeland Security Investigations, a sprawling investigative unit within Immigration and Customs Enforcement. A week earlier, they told Odette, she had been indicted in federal court in Tampa. The Justice Department claimed that in 1997, before her husband filed his asylum claim, Odette applied under a different identity; her fingerprints and photograph were part of the application for Enite Alindor, a last name close to her mother's maiden name. After that application was filed, no one ever again appeared to pursue it. An immigration judge ordered ""Alindor"" deported in absentia.

""They presented me with a name, and they said that this name is my name, and that it matched my fingerprints and that it had been in existence for 21 years,"" Odette says. ""They showed me a paper. They said that I was supposed to be deported, but that they had never found me.""

Dureland was charged criminally by the United States attorney for the Middle District of Florida. Dureland's attorney, a federal public defender named Irina Hughes, eventually presented evidence to the judge that a document preparer Dureland had hired to help before she was granted asylum was convicted criminally several years later for defrauding clients, using their names and identities to file fake tax returns. Hughes suggested that the ""Alindor"" asylum application might have been connected to one of the man's schemes, but the judge would not allow this evidence to be heard by the jury. Hughes also pointed to testimony by government officials who told Congress in the 1990s that immigration records from the time were often handled by private entities, including untrained storefront processors -- so it would have been unsurprising to find a fraudulent application with someone else's prints. There was no way, Hughes argued, that the government could credibly come back decades later and use those haphazard records to prove anything.

The prosecution of naturalized United States citizens like Odette Dureland is a sign, immigrant advocates fear, of a new and gathering storm for immigration policy in the Trump era. For decades, the debate over immigration in the United States has centered on who should be allowed to enter the country and who should be allowed to stay; citizens like Dureland have largely been exempted from that debate. But amid the Trump administration's growing stridency on immigration, that may be changing. ""We have always focused on those who have done something terrible,"" a former Justice Department attorney told me. ""If that's now changing, if we're going after people who did nothing of note, or whose wrong caused no harm, it means they're going after citizenship.""

Dureland's case was filed as part of an Immigration and Customs Enforcement program called Operation Second Look, which grew out of a U.S.C.I.S. program started under the Obama administration called Operation Janus. Both operations seek to identify cases in which people might have been naturalized despite apparent deportation orders or concerns about past fraud or criminal charges. The investigation into Dureland was coordinated with a unit in the Justice Department's civil division called the Office of Immigration Litigation. That office, which devotes most of its resources to defending the federal government on immigration matters in court, is the nerve center for denaturalization actions in the department. From 2004 to 2016, denaturalization cases filed by that office and by United States attorneys have averaged 46 each year. In each of the last two years, prosecutors filed nearly twice that many cases.

That number was already rising toward the end of the Obama administration, but the rhetoric from the Trump administration suggests that the rise under his watch is more than random noise. In July 2017, around the time that Dureland was arrested, the Justice Department began signaling -- quietly at first, through a bulletin from the Office of Immigration Litigation -- that ""civil denaturalization will play a prominent role in securing the integrity of our immigration system."" As the department ""renews its commitment to immigration enforcement,"" the bulletin went on, ""the president has directed all executive departments and agencies 'to employ all lawful means to enforce the immigration laws of the United States.' ""

Last January, the Justice Department announced what it said was the first conviction for denaturalization fraud to come out of Operation Janus, which along with Second Look is looking into 315,000 immigration cases in which concerns had been raised but fingerprints were not uploaded to the government's digital system. Some of those people, the government worried, may have gone on to become citizens using fake identities. By the end of the Obama administration, the Department of Homeland Security planned to refer 120 cases to the Justice Department to face potential federal charges. Now, in announcing the first denaturalization, the Trump administration said in a news release that the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services planned an expansion: The agency sought to refer 1,600 people to the Justice Department to face charges. A month later, U.S.C.I.S., which processes green-card and citizenship applications, changed its statement of purpose, removing a commitment to fulfill ""America's promise as a nation of immigrants"" and promising instead to focus on ""securing the homeland."" Attorney General Jeff Sessions then issued a strategic plan for the Justice Department as a whole, listing denaturalizations among a short tally of ""strategic objectives"" for the next five years.

This summer, it became clear that the Trump administration was ramping up denaturalization efforts. U.S.C.I.S. said it was forming a new office in California, to become fully functional sometime next year, that would replace and consolidate existing Operation Janus work. The agency is actively hiring lawyers to staff the unit. The number of cases that U.S.C.I.S. has flagged as likely targets for denaturalization has risen to 2,500. The agency has referred 167 cases to the Justice Department for civil charges, nine of which have already led to denaturalizations. (ICE would not say how many criminal cases it had referred to United States attorney's offices.) The Department of Homeland Security also asked Congress earlier this year to approve funding to hire 300 new agents for other immigration-fraud investigations, including Operation Second Look. And now ICE says it is sharply expanding the number of files under review. Its deportation division, Enforcement and Removal Operations, is looking into 700,000 additional files to find evidence of fraudulent naturalization, despite U.S.C.I.S.'s saying it considers them very low priority. That brings the total number of files under scrutiny to more than one million.

Trump's U.S.C.I.S. director, L. Francis Cissna, appeared in August on a panel at the Center for Immigration Studies, a right-wing policy group that advocates the restriction of legal immigration. There, he described the agency's denaturalization investigations as ""totally rational and appropriate,"" and warned against concerns that U.S.C.I.S. was attacking citizenship. ""This is about people who lied about having been deported, and then faked that identity, and then came in under Identity No. 2 and became a citizen somehow.""

Since January 2017, United States attorney's offices have filed 107 criminal naturalization fraud cases. Among these cases are a number against people like Odette Dureland, naturalized citizens who purportedly committed fraud but who deny those claims. Many involve people whose histories raise no national-security concerns -- an apparent departure from the Obama administration's priorities. But the number is on par with prosecutions during the Obama era. Where there has been a marked rise in denaturalizations under Trump is in the civil process. Lawyers in the Office of Immigration Litigation filed more than 65 civil denaturalization cases between January 2017 and November 2018, according to data from the Justice Department, twice the total number of civil cases that the office filed in the last two years of the Obama administration. Some of these people would most likely have been denaturalized under any administration, including people who were convicted of serious crimes or were discovered to have participated in war crimes. But the Trump administration's prosecutions have served another purpose: In news releases and declarations by senior officials, the denaturalization cases have been used as cudgels -- tools for attacking the legal immigration process as riddled with fraud, as pathways for criminals and terrorists to enter the United States.

""For decades, the American people have begged and pleaded with their government for a lawful system of immigration that serves the national interest -- a system that has as its foremost priorities their safety, their jobs and their well-being,"" Sessions said in one news release about denaturalization cases against a Somali family in Minnesota whom the State Department had investigated for making false claims in paperwork about their family ties. ""The current immigration system is easily abused by fraudsters and nefarious actors."" He continued, ""If the fraud is not detected and swift enforcement actions are not taken, chain migration only multiplies the consequences of this abuse.""

In another release, the acting head of the Justice Department's civil division said that ""the filing of these cases sends a clear message to immigration fraudsters -- if you break our immigration laws, we will prosecute you and denaturalize you."" This summer, Trump lied on Twitter that the ""Obama Administration granted citizenship, during the terrible Iran Deal negotiation, to 2,500 Iranians -- including to government officials. How big (and bad) is that?""

The administration has cast naturalized citizens as suspects for fraud, and the legal immigration process itself in need of urgent course-correction to prevent that abuse. ""They are trying to manufacture crises to institute draconian policies,"" says Ur Jaddou, who was the chief lawyer at U.S.C.I.S. for almost three years under Obama. ""They did it with families at the border. The worry is they'll do that with this story of naturalization fraud."" Denaturalization court cases require significant dedication of time and labor from federal prosecutors. It's not clear whether the Justice Department has shifted resources to facilitate significantly larger numbers of prosecutions. But Mae Ngai, a Columbia University historian who writes on citizenship and immigration, says that the announcement of a denaturalization surge has already sent a message. She compares the rhetoric about denaturalization to the conservative campaign against voter fraud. Intent on imposing voter restrictions on communities of color, Republican officials, including Trump, have often held up scarce examples of fraudulent voting as evidence that such measures as voter identification laws are necessary -- even as they've been unable to marshal evidence that voter fraud is widespread. ""It's trying to make a crisis out of an issue that is not by any measure a crisis,"" Ngai says, ""an attempt to call the larger systems into question.""

Revoking citizenship has been part of the American citizenship system since the earliest efforts to centralize it. Beginning in 1906, officials in the federal government began to denaturalize immigrants who had obtained citizenship through fraud, often then allowing them to reapply. But as Patrick Weil, a historian and legal scholar at Yale, details in his 2013 book, ""The Sovereign Citizen: Denaturalization and the Origins of the American Republic,"" what began as an administrative cleanup soon became overtly political. Within a few years, denaturalization was being deployed against political subversives, most famously Emma Goldman, the anarchist and Lithuanian immigrant who for years had confounded efforts by federal officials to deport her. Prosecutors discovered that her husband, through whom she had obtained citizenship, was himself naturalized through fraud. In 1909, the government stripped Goldman of her citizenship, and she was eventually expelled. For the next 50 years, the federal government revoked the citizenship of thousands of naturalized and United States-born citizens. Many were targeted for their associations with communists. Others lost their citizenship because they had moved abroad after naturalization or had voted in foreign elections or served in foreign armies. Women were summarily stripped of citizenship for marrying foreign men.

Weil found that between 1906, when naturalization law was standardized and centralized, and the 1970s, 145,000 United States citizens, native born and naturalized, were stripped of their citizenship by the courts. Many others lost their citizenship without any judicial process at all. But a series of court decisions in the 1950s and 1960s curtailed that process. In the most significant of these, in 1967, the Supreme Court in Afroyim v. Rusk ruled in favor of a Polish Jewish immigrant named Beys Afroyim who had become a United States citizen. Afroyim had voted in an Israeli election, which at the time was an offense that could lead to denaturalization. The court ruled against the government: ""Citizenship is no light trifle to be jeopardized any moment Congress decides to do so,"" Justice Hugo Black wrote. Citizenship, acquired either by birth or by naturalization, was now held as a nearly unassailable right, no longer hinging upon adherence to norms imposed by the state.

In the 50 years since then, courts have further tightened the requirements for denaturalization. Mass stripping of citizenship is no longer possible. The government can now denaturalize citizens only if the state can prove they should never have obtained citizenship in the first place, i.e., if it was acquired through some material fraud or misrepresentation. And yet politics has continued to drive rounds of denaturalization prosecutions. After the Republican Party won control of the House in 1994, the new congressional majority began to denounce the Clinton administration, claiming that the Democrats had opened the gates to citizenship for criminals as a way to expand the ranks of Democratic voters. The Justice Department responded by devising a streamlined denaturalization process that would allow Immigration and Naturalization Services, or I.N.S., to administratively strip citizenship from recently naturalized people who had been convicted of crimes -- sidestepping the courts. The agency compiled a list of 369 cases of people with serious past convictions, planning to strip them of their citizenship. Those plans were upended by a lawsuit decided in 2000, when the court ruled that federal officials were required to take denaturalization cases to court. As a smaller number of those cases rolled through the federal courts, the early years of the George W. Bush administration were marked by a spike in civil denaturalization actions, which reached a peak of 50 in 2001.

During the Bush and Obama administrations, a number of citizens were stripped of their citizenship after being implicated in a sprawling immigration-fraud scheme -- they paid bribes to a D.H.S. official to process their immigration applications. A handful of others were denaturalized for being war criminals.

The seeds of the current denaturalization campaign were sown as early as 2008, when a Customs and Border Protection officer discovered 206 cases of people from ""special-interest countries"" like Afghanistan and Iraq, and countries that border them, who appeared to have once been ordered deported, but had gone on to obtain green cards or become citizens. The Department of Homeland Security began looking into those cases, only to discover thousands of other old immigration files that had never been uploaded to digital immigration databases. In September 2016, near the end of the Obama administration, the inspector general for the Department of Homeland Security reported a total of 315,000 previously undigitized sets of fingerprints associated with immigrants whose files raised possible concerns. Just over half of those prints had been uploaded since the problem was discovered in 2008. More than 850 people from special-interest countries, or countries that bordered them, who were apparently ordered out of the country and whose fingerprints were not in the digital system had still gone on to become citizens. Just a few appear to have raised serious concerns, and they were referred to the Justice Department or to Joint Terrorism task forces for further review. Another 953 cases had also been flagged for possible review. The inspector general recommended the government to finish uploading the remaining files, a process that the report said had stalled for lack of funding. It also recommended that ICE determine how to proceed with the remaining files.

Former Obama officials told me that they believed that few of the flagged cases would rise to the level of major priorities for federal agencies. ""We wanted to know who had become a citizen and to see if there was anyone who raised real concerns"" about security, says Ur Jaddou, the former U.S.C.I.S. official. For example, she noted that the inspector general had flagged a handful of cases that involved people who had obtained security clearances or government jobs after naturalizing. By March 2015, with the case-file reviews well underway, Obama's D.H.S. had referred several dozen cases to the offices of the United States attorneys, which in turn decided to prosecute only two. By the time the inspector general's office released its report in September 2016, the Department of Homeland Security had referred a total of 120 cases to the Justice Department to consider for prosecution.

Several former Obama officials told me that the spike in court cases by the Trump administration may be explained by Operation Janus, adding that the numbers for 2017 and 2018 might look similar under a Democratic administration. U.S.C.I.S. also characterizes the growing number of cases under review as the natural expansion of the Janus process. It is an open question how much the number of people charged will grow under the Trump Administration, as the Justice Department prioritizes denaturalization efforts and the scope of the files under review expand.

In my conversations with immigration advocates in recent months, nobody has been more awake to the threat of denaturalization cases than Abdulhakem Alsadah, who spends his days dashing between meetings with members of the Yemeni community near Detroit and working with people already in the court system who need counseling. Alsadah, a social worker, is president of the National Association of Yemeni-Americans, a community organization that operates out of a second-floor office next to a small Yemeni restaurant in Dearborn. Starting in 2013, he began to hear from Yemeni-Americans who had traveled to Yemen that the United States government had confiscated their passports at the embassy in Sana, the country's capital. Alsadah called these passport confiscations ""unofficial denaturalizations."" United States citizens were stuck in Yemen for months; in some cases their passports were never returned, and they were only able to return to their families in Michigan on provisional passports. Other Yemeni-Americans found themselves grounded in the United States, unable to travel. ""They are just stranded,"" Alsadah says. ""They are United States citizens. But they were not treated that way.""

State Department officials in Sana, and then later in the United States, he explains, were telling these suddenly paperless Yemeni-Americans that their passports would not be returned or renewed until they could prove that they were indeed who they said they were. The problem for Yemenis is that documentation to prove identity often doesn't exist in the country, which didn't have a civil department that recorded births and deaths until the mid-1980s. The United States has for years treated this lack of strong documentation as a harbinger of fraud. The U.S.C.I.S. manual issued during the Obama administration notes that because ""civil documents concerning marriage, birth, death, etc., are often issued in Yemen based solely on information furnished by an interested party, often the petitioner or beneficiary of the petition, they are usually not considered conclusive to establish claimed relationships."" (The Trump administration used a lack of strong documentation to justify its travel ban on individuals from five Muslim-majority countries, arguing that the Yemeni government and other banned countries couldn't provide the United States with the information it needs to verify the identity of a potential immigrant.)

In October of this year, the State Department's inspector general released a report that found these Obama-era passport seizures had not followed any discernible process and were not backed by clear rationale. Nonetheless, those passport seizures appear now to have created yet another pool of people -- like those from Janus and Second Look -- who can be targeted with denaturalization. For years, Alsadah was worried about exactly this possibility, and under the Trump administration it has begun.

Alsadah has met several families in Detroit whose passports were revoked under the Obama administration and who have now been threatened with denaturalization, including Abdo Wasel, whom I met this summer through his lawyer. In June 2017, Wasel, who is 53 and lives with his family on a quiet street in Hamtramck, Mich., received a letter from the Justice Department that read, ""The government has evidence that you illegally procured your naturalization."" Based on this evidence, which the letter did not specify, he had not been eligible to become a United States citizen.

Wasel was confused. He left Yemen in 1990, when he was 25, following his father. Wasel settled in Hamtramck, a town near Detroit with a growing Yemeni community, and found work in warehouses and factories. For several years, he traveled back to Yemen whenever he could; he married there, and some of his children were born there. But after he became a United States citizen in 1995, he started bringing his children to Hamtramck, one after another. He and his wife now live in a five-bedroom home, on a street lined with vinyl-sided two-story homes. Wasel's oldest son lives with his own wife and their children in a house on Wasel's block.

Wasel says his troubles began in 2015, after he applied to renew his United States passport to travel to Yemen. The county was becoming increasingly unstable, and he wanted to visit relatives and possibly help them come to the United States. Months passed, and he hadn't received it. He returned to the passport office several times, where he was told the government was looking into his case. During one stop at the office, Wasel says, State Department officers told him they needed him provide a saliva sample so that they could perform a DNA test to verify his identity.

He did not know at the time that the refusal to renew his passport -- and later the United States passports of two of his children -- was part of a broader practice by the Obama administration. For him, the loss meant he could not make any plans to visit the place he was born. Wasel was also unaware that in February 2016, State Department agents showed up at the California home of his father and asked the older man to submit to a DNA test. The results showed that the men were not biologically related.

His father finally told Wasel the truth: He was orphaned as a baby, and he and his wife raised him as their own. Wasel was stunned. He says the story was entirely new to him, and he could only speculate about how the government came to suspect a back story that he had never even imagined. No official has ever explained to him how the investigation came about.

Wasel's is one of at least two denaturalization cases brought by the Trump Department of Justice against Yemeni-Americans whose passports were seized or revoked during the Obama years. Naz Ahmad, a staff lawyer with the Clear project at the City University of New York, which has advocated for Yemeni-Americans with passport issues, was concerned when I told her about Wasel's case. ""We suspect there may have been hundreds of seized passports. How many of those families will now be threatened with denaturalization?""

Of the civil denaturalization cases that have so far been filed by the Office of Immigration Litigation under the Trump Administration, roughly 10 percent have been against people from three countries -- Yemen, Somalia and Iran -- that are included in Trump's ban of Muslim nations. But people from these countries make up just over 1 percent of foreign-born people in the United States. ""They are cherry-picking, picking and choosing, focusing on these communities,"" Alsadah said. If Wasel's citizenship is stripped, the government can cancel the citizenship of his children born in Yemen.

Because Wasel's case is a civil action, there's no threat of prison time. But there's also no access to a public defender and no statute of limitations -- prosecutors can file charges against people like Wasel whose citizenship was obtained decades ago. And the standards for denaturalization are more lax; prosecutors have no burden to prove intent. In a pretrial brief filed in July, prosecutors clarified that the government acknowledges Wasel may well not have known that his father is not biological kin. They say that doesn't matter. ""It is entirely irrelevant when Defendant learned that"" the man ""is not his father and whether he subjectively intended to provide incorrect information,"" the government wrote.

In another recent case, this one drawn from Janus files, the United States attorney for the Middle District of Florida -- the same office that brought the charges against Dureland -- failed to persuade a jury to convict a Bangladeshi-born United States citizen for criminal citizenship fraud. The claims against the man, Shorab Hossain, hinged significantly on a single letter of his first name. In an asylum application filed in 1995, soon after he arrived in the United States, Hossain signed his name as Sohrab. The government denied that petition and he was ordered deported, but Hossain claimed in court that he never received the order. Believing his application had gone nowhere, he later applied again to remain in the United States and signed this time as Shorab, switching the O and H -- two plausible spellings of a name that Hossain, until his arrival in the United States, had written only in Bengali. The jury, apparently unconvinced that he had intentionally sought to alter his identity, acquitted him in April (the jury hung on a separate related charge), and he returned home to his wife and stepdaughter, and to work at the gas station and convenience store he owns. But one month later, the prosecutor told the judge that the Department of Homeland Security was considering a civil case against Hossain -- this time, with no burden to prove intent.

One of the few Trump-era denaturalization cases that has received substantial press attention, that of Norma Borgoño, a 64-year-old secretary and grandmother who was naturalized in 2007, is also facing civil counts, with the same lower burden of proof. The case stems from an ICE investigation that is unrelated to Janus. Four years after becoming a citizen, she pleaded guilty to assisting her boss defraud a bank and cooperated in the investigation. In May 2018 she found herself facing denaturalization, following a probe by Homeland Security Investigations. The Office of Immigration Litigation claimed that Borgoño should have alerted U.S.C.I.S. to her role in the ongoing crime when she applied for citizenship -- even though it's plausible she may not have been aware, at that point, that she was participating in a crime.

""At this point you'd be disrupting an American family,"" Leon Rodriguez, who served as the head of U.S.C.I.S. during the later part of the Obama administration, told me of cases like Borgoño's and Dureland's. ""What do we gain as a society from that? Sessions will talk about sound principles of asylum, but, truly, what do we gain from doing this?""

Throughout Odette Dureland's trial, her lawyer maintained her innocence. But she also argued that even if the jury believed Dureland had applied for asylum under a different name, it shouldn't matter. Odette had become a citizen through her husband's application, moving from asylee to green-card holder to citizen based on fully adjudicated claims. If Dureland became a citizen through a process that would be unproblematic were it not for this supposed ""Alindor"" application, why should that now affect her right to remain in the United States?

The jury was unconvinced. The government had shown evidence that Dureland has relatives named Alindor, and that various details on the Alindor application looked similar to those on the one she later filed. The jury found Dureland guilty of criminal naturalization fraud. ""The integrity of our nation's legal immigration system is paramount,"" the acting director of U.S.C.I.S. in Tampa said in a press statement after the conviction. ""This conviction sends a clear message that attempting to fraudulently obtain United States citizenship will not be tolerated. Our nation's citizens deserve nothing less."" The judge sentenced Dureland to five months in prison. The conviction automatically led to Dureland's losing her citizenship.

After serving her sentence, Immigration and Customs Enforcement moved her to a detention center in August, with plans to deport her. She spent a month there before Gilbert managed to scrape together $10,000 for bond. The couple has hired an immigration attorney, who says he will try to convince an immigration judge that she should be allowed, effectively, to start the immigration process again, to obtain a new green card as the wife of a citizen or the mother of a citizen in the military. But lawyers familiar with denaturalization cases say that because she has been convicted of a crime, it's unlikely she'll prevail. Without a judge's approval, ICE will almost certainly deport her.

In September, I sat with Dureland and her family at their home. A bowl of star fruit, picked from the tree outside, sat on the table. Dureland held her head up with her hands, her elbows resting on the table. Her eyes were heavy. Less than two days before, she was released from federal immigration detention.""I didn't know if I would come home again,"" Dureland told me, standing beside her 15-year-old son, Gethro. She placed her hand on the top of her son's head, which he rested on her shoulder. She liked to pretend, before she was locked up, that she and her youngest child were the same height, but he had grown in the six months that she was away; there was no more pretending. She laughed. But despite her easygoing demeanor with her son, Dureland was weary from her time in detention, and she told me she needed to nap. When I returned a few hours later, the house was filled with the smell of spices and cooked onions. It had been six months since Dureland had made a meal. ""I missed my kitchen,"" she said.

She sat back down at the table. ""Detention was a scary place,"" Dureland told me. ""When I got there, everybody was being deported. And I was thinking, I have nobody in Haiti. If I were deported to Haiti, I would be by myself.""

Before she became a citizen, Dureland always knew that if something happened, if she were convicted of some crime, say, she could be deported. She lived a careful life. When she took the oath in 2012, that feeling -- that it could be taken away -- finally disappeared. ""I became an American,"" Dureland said. ""I am an American."" But even as she said it, she knew it was no longer true."
204,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/14/us/politics/court-trump-birth-control.html,"WASHINGTON -- A federal court issued a nationwide injunction on Monday that prevents the Trump administration from interfering with women's access to free birth control guaranteed under the Affordable Care Act.

The decision, by Judge Wendy Beetlestone of the Federal District Court in Philadelphia, extends a losing streak for President Trump, who has repeatedly been set back in his efforts to allow employers to deny insurance coverage of contraceptives to which the employers object on religious or moral grounds.

The rules were scheduled to take effect on Monday. The states of Pennsylvania and New Jersey challenged the rules before Judge Beetlestone, saying they would have to shoulder much of the burden of providing contraceptives to women who lost coverage under the Trump administration's rules.

""The states' harm is not merely speculative; it is actual and imminent,"" Judge Beetlestone wrote. ""The final rules estimate that at least 70,500 women will lose coverage.""

The Trump administration argued that the states had not identified anyone who had lost coverage under the rules. Judge Beetlestone replied: ""There is no need to wait for the ax to fall before an injunction is appropriate, particularly where defendants have estimated that it is about to fall on thousands of women -- and, as a corollary, on the states.""

Judge Beetlestone said the final rules were likely to have harsh consequences: ""numerous citizens losing contraceptive coverage, resulting in significant, direct and proprietary harm to the states in the form of increased use of state-funded contraceptive services, as well as increased costs associated with unintended pregnancies.""

Her decision was issued less than 24 hours after Judge Haywood S. Gilliam Jr. of the Federal District Court in Oakland, Calif., granted a request by 13 states and the District of Columbia to block the rules in their jurisdictions.

""Women who lose their entitlement to cost-free contraceptives are less likely to use an effective method, or any method at all -- resulting in unintended pregnancies,"" Judge Gilliam said. Moreover, he said, many of the women are likely to ""turn to state programs to obtain no-cost contraceptives, at significant cost to the states.""

Josh Shapiro, the attorney general of Pennsylvania, who filed the lawsuit there, welcomed the decision by Judge Beetlestone.

""Today's ruling is a victory for the health and economic independence of women in Pennsylvania and across America,"" Mr. Shapiro, a Democrat, said. ""Women need contraception for their health because contraception is medicine, pure and simple.""

The attorney general of California, Xavier Becerra, also a Democrat, said: ""The law couldn't be clearer. Employers have no business interfering in women's health care decisions.""

President Barack Obama signed the Affordable Care Act in March 2010. One section of the law requires coverage of preventive health services and screenings for women. In August 2011, the Obama administration required employers and insurers to provide women with coverage at no cost for all methods of contraception approved by the Food and Drug Administration.

For its part, the Trump administration said the contraceptive coverage mandate imposed a ""substantial burden"" on the exercise of religion by certain employers. The new rules, relaxing the mandate, fulfilled a campaign pledge by Mr. Trump, who said employers should not be ""bullied by the federal government because of their religious beliefs.""

Alex M. Azar II, the secretary of health and human services, was a defendant in both cases. Caitlin Oakley, a spokeswoman for Mr. Azar, reiterated the administration's position after the court decisions.

""No American should be forced to violate his or her own conscience in order to abide by the laws and regulations governing our health care system,"" Ms. Oakley said on Monday. ""The final rules affirm the Trump administration's commitment to upholding the freedoms afforded all Americans under our Constitution.""

The administration said employers who had moral objections to certain forms of birth control should also be exempt from the contraceptive coverage mandate.

Congress and the courts have long recognized the importance of respecting moral convictions as well as religious beliefs, the Trump administration said, and as an example it cited the exemption from military service available to certain ""conscientious objectors.""

Moreover, it said an early version of the First Amendment, proposed by James Madison, protected not only freedom of religion, but also ""the full and equal rights of conscience.""

The rulings issued in Pennsylvania and California were preliminary injunctions. The judges in both cases said the states were likely to succeed on the merits of their claims and to suffer irreparable harm in the absence of a court order.

Mark L. Rienzi, the president of the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty, said Monday that his organization would appeal the court decisions on behalf of its client the Little Sisters of the Poor, an order of Roman Catholic nuns who object to the contraceptive coverage mandate.

""We never wanted this fight, and we regret that after a long legal battle, it is still not over,"" Mother Loraine Marie Maguire of the Little Sisters said. ""We pray that we can once again devote our lives to our ministry of serving the elderly poor as we have for over 175 years."""
205,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/14/us/politics/nato-president-trump.html,"WASHINGTON -- There are few things that President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia desires more than the weakening of NATO, the military alliance among the United States, Europe and Canada that has deterred Soviet and Russian aggression for 70 years.

Last year, President Trump suggested a move tantamount to destroying NATO: the withdrawal of the United States.

Senior administration officials told The New York Times that several times over the course of 2018, Mr. Trump privately said he wanted to withdraw from the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Current and former officials who support the alliance said they feared Mr. Trump could return to his threat as allied military spending continued to lag behind the goals the president had set.

In the days around a tumultuous NATO summit meeting last summer, they said, Mr. Trump told his top national security officials that he did not see the point of the military alliance, which he presented as a drain on the United States.

At the time, Mr. Trump's national security team, including Jim Mattis, then the defense secretary, and John R. Bolton, the national security adviser, scrambled to keep American strategy on track without mention of a withdrawal that would drastically reduce Washington's influence in Europe and could embolden Russia for decades.

Now, the president's repeatedly stated desire to withdraw from NATO is raising new worries among national security officials amid growing concern about Mr. Trump's efforts to keep his meetings with Mr. Putin secret from even his own aides, and an F.B.I. investigation into the administration's Russia ties.

A move to withdraw from the alliance, in place since 1949, ""would be one of the most damaging things that any president could do to U.S. interests,"" said Michèle A. Flournoy, an under secretary of defense under President Barack Obama.

""It would destroy 70-plus years of painstaking work across multiple administrations, Republican and Democratic, to create perhaps the most powerful and advantageous alliance in history,"" Ms. Flournoy said in an interview. ""And it would be the wildest success that Vladimir Putin could dream of.""

Retired Adm. James G. Stavridis, the former supreme allied commander of NATO, said an American withdrawal from the alliance would be ""a geopolitical mistake of epic proportion.""

""Even discussing the idea of leaving NATO -- let alone actually doing so -- would be the gift of the century for Putin,"" Admiral Stavridis said.

Senior Trump administration officials discussed the internal and highly sensitive efforts to preserve the military alliance on condition of anonymity.

After the White House was asked for comment on Monday, a senior administration official pointed to Mr. Trump's remarks in July when he called the United States' commitment to NATO ""very strong"" and the alliance ""very important."" The official declined to comment further.

American national security officials believe that Russia has largely focused on undermining solidarity between the United States and Europe after it annexed Crimea in 2014. Its goal was to upend NATO, which Moscow views as a threat.

Russia's meddling in American elections and its efforts to prevent former satellite states from joining the alliance have aimed to weaken what it views as an enemy next door, the American officials said. With a weakened NATO, they said, Mr. Putin would have more freedom to behave as he wishes, setting up Russia as a counterweight to Europe and the United States.

An American withdrawal from the alliance would accomplish all that Mr. Putin has been trying to put into motion, the officials said -- essentially, doing the Russian leader's hardest and most critical work for him.

When Mr. Trump first raised the possibility of leaving the alliance, senior administration officials were unsure if he was serious. He has returned to the idea several times, officials said increasing their worries.

Mr. Trump's dislike of alliances abroad and American commitments to international organizations is no secret.

The president has repeatedly and publicly challenged or withdrawn from a number of military and economic partnerships, from the Paris climate accord to an Asia-Pacific trade pact. He has questioned the United States' military alliance with South Korea and Japan, and he has announced a withdrawal of American troops from Syria without first consulting allies in the American-led coalition to defeat the Islamic State.

NATO had planned to hold a leaders meeting in Washington to mark its 70th anniversary in April, akin to the 50-year celebration that was hosted by President Bill Clinton in 1999. But this year's meeting has been downgraded to a foreign ministers gathering, as some diplomats feared that Mr. Trump could use a Washington summit meeting to renew his attacks on the alliance.

Leaders are now scheduled to meet at the end of 2019, but not in Washington.

Mr. Trump's threats to withdraw had sent officials scrambling to prevent the annual gathering of NATO leaders in Brussels last July from turning into a disaster.

Senior national security officials had already pushed the military alliance's ambassadors to complete a formal agreement on several NATO goals -- including shared defenses against Russia -- before the summit meeting even began, to shield it from Mr. Trump.

But Mr. Trump upended the proceedings anyway. One meeting, on July 12, was ostensibly supposed to be about Ukraine and Georgia -- two non-NATO members with aspirations to join the alliance.

Accepted protocol dictates that alliance members do not discuss internal business in front of nonmembers. But as is frequently the case, Mr. Trump did not adhere to the established norms, according to several American and European officials who were in the room.

He complained that European governments were not spending enough on the shared costs of defense, leaving the United States to carry an outsize burden. He expressed frustration that European leaders would not, on the spot, pledge to spend more. And he appeared not to grasp the details when several tried to explain to him that spending levels were set by parliaments in individual countries, the American and European officials said.

Then, at another leaders gathering at the same summit meeting, Mr. Trump appeared to be taken by surprise by Jens Stoltenberg, the NATO secretary general.

Backing Mr. Trump's position, Mr. Stoltenberg pushed allies to increase their spending and praised the United States for leading by example -- including by increasing its military spending in Europe. At that, according to one official who was in the room, Mr. Trump whipped his head around and glared at American officials behind him, surprised by Mr. Stoltenberg's remarks and betraying ignorance of his administration's own spending plans.

Mr. Trump appeared especially annoyed, officials in the meeting said, with Chancellor Angela Merkel of Germany and her country's military spending of 1 percent of its gross domestic product.

By comparison, the United States' military spending is about 4 percent of G.D.P., and Mr. Trump has railed against allies for not meeting the NATO spending goal of 2 percent of economic output. At the summit meeting, he surprised the leaders by demanding 4 percent -- a move that would essentially put the goal out of reach for many alliance members. He also threatened that the United States would ""go its own way"" in 2019 if military spending from other NATO countries did not rise.

During the middle of a speech by Ms. Merkel, Mr. Trump again broke protocol by getting up and leaving, sending ripples of shock across the room, according to American and European officials who were there. But before he left, the president walked behind Ms. Merkel and interrupted her speech to call her a great leader. Startled and relieved that Mr. Trump had not continued his berating of the leaders, the people in the room clapped.

In the end, the NATO leaders publicly papered over their differences to present a unified front. But both European leaders and American officials emerged from the two days in Brussels shaken and worried that Mr. Trump would renew his threat to withdraw from the alliance.

Mr. Trump's skepticism of NATO appears to be a core belief, administration officials said, akin to his desire to expropriate Iraq's oil. While officials have explained multiple times why the United States cannot take Iraq's oil, Mr. Trump returns to the issue every few months.

Similarly, just when officials think the issue of NATO membership has been settled, Mr. Trump again brings up his desire to leave the alliance.

Any move by Mr. Trump against NATO would most likely invite a response by Congress. American policy toward Russia is the one area where congressional Republicans have consistently bucked Mr. Trump, including with new sanctions on Moscow and by criticizing his warm July 16 news conference with Mr. Putin in Helsinki, Finland.

Members of NATO may withdraw after a notification period of a year, under Article 13 of the Washington Treaty. Such a delay would give Congress time to try blocking any attempt by Mr. Trump to leave.

""It's alarming that the president continues to falsely assert that NATO does not contribute to the overall safety of the United States or the international community,"" said Senator Jeanne Shaheen, a New Hampshire Democrat who is among the lawmakers who support legislation to stop Mr. Trump from withdrawing from the military alliance. ""The Senate knows better and stands ready to defend NATO.""

NATO's popularity with the public continues to be strong. But the alliance has become a more partisan issue, with Democrats showing strong enthusiasm and Republican support softening, according to a survey by the Ronald Reagan Institute.

Kay Bailey Hutchison, Washington's ambassador to NATO and a former Republican senator, has sought to build support for the alliance in Congress, including helping to organize a bipartisan group of backers.

But even if Congress moved to block a withdrawal, a statement by Mr. Trump that he wanted to leave would greatly damage NATO. Allies feeling threatened by Russia already have extreme doubts about whether Mr. Trump would order troops to come to their aid.

In his resignation letter last month, Mr. Mattis specifically cited his own commitment to America's alliances in an implicit criticism of Mr. Trump's principles. Mr. Mattis originally said he would stay through the next NATO meeting at the end of February, but Mr. Trump pushed him out before the new year.

Acting Defense Secretary Patrick M. Shanahan is believed to support the alliance. But he has also pointedly said he thinks that the Pentagon should not be ""the Department of No"" to the president.

European and American officials said the presence of Mr. Mattis, a former top NATO commander, had reassured allies that a senior Trump administration official had their back. His exit from the Pentagon has increased worries among some European diplomats that the safety blanket has now been lost."
206,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/15/science/north-korea-biological-weapons.html,"WASHINGTON -- Pound for pound, the deadliest arms of all time are not nuclear but biological. A single gallon of anthrax, if suitably distributed, could end human life on Earth.

Even so, the Trump administration has given scant attention to North Korea's pursuit of living weapons -- a threat that analysts describe as more immediate than its nuclear arms, which Pyongyang and Washington have been discussing for more than six months.

According to an analysis issued by the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey last month, North Korea is collaborating with foreign researchers to learn biotechnology skills and build machinery. As a result, the country's capabilities are increasing rapidly.

""North Korea is far more likely to use biological weapons than nuclear ones,"" said Andrew C. Weber, a Pentagon official in charge of nuclear, chemical and biological defense programs under President Obama. ""The program is advanced, underestimated and highly lethal.""

The North may want to threaten a devastating germ counterattack as a way of warding off aggressors. If so, its bioweapons would act as a potent deterrent.

But experts also worry about offensive strikes and agents of unusual lethality, especially the smallpox virus, which spreads person-to-person and kills a third of its victims. Experts have long suspected that the North harbors the germ, which in 1980 was declared eradicated from human populations.

Worse, analysts say, satellite images and internet scrutiny of the North suggest that Pyongyang is newly interested in biotechnology and germ advances. In 2015, state media showed Kim Jong-un, the nation's leader, touring a biological plant, echoing his nuclear propaganda.

But compared to traditional weapons, biological threats have a host of unsettling distinctions: Germ production is small-scale and far less expensive than creating nuclear arms. Deadly microbes can look like harmless components of vaccine and agricultural work. And living weapons are hard to detect, trace and contain.

The North's great secrecy makes it hard to assess the threat and the country's degree of sophistication. Today, the North might well have no bioweapons at all -- just research, prototypes, human testing, and the ability to rush into industrial production.

Still, Anthony H. Cordesman, a former Pentagon intelligence official now at the Center for Strategic and International Studies, said the North ""has made major strides"" in all technical areas needed for the production of a major germ arsenal.

In unclassified reports, the Trump administration has alluded to the North's bioweapons program in vague terms. President Trump did not broach the subject of biological weapons during his meeting with Mr. Kim in Singapore, according to American officials.

The lack of detail and urgency is all the more surprising given that John R. Bolton, Mr. Trump's national security adviser, has long described it as a regional and even a global threat.

In 2002, as under secretary of state for arms control and international security in the George W. Bush administration, Mr. Bolton declared that ""North Korea has one of the most robust offensive bioweapons programs on Earth.""

Last century, most nations that made biological arms gave them up as impractical. Capricious winds could carry deadly agents back on users, infecting troops and citizens. The United States renounced its arsenal in 1969.

But today, analysts say, the gene revolution could be making germ weapons more attractive. They see the possibility of designer pathogens that spread faster, infect more people, resist treatment, and offer better targeting and containment. If so, North Korea may be in the forefront.

South Korean military white papers have identified at least ten facilities in the North that could be involved in the research and production of more than a dozen biological agents, including those that cause the plague and hemorrhagic fevers.

United States intelligence officials have not publicly endorsed those findings. But many experts say the technological hurdles to such advances have collapsed. The North, for instance, has received advanced microbiology training from institutions in Asia and Europe.

Bruce Bennett, a defense researcher at the RAND Corporation, said defectors from the North have described witnessing the testing of biological agents on political prisoners.

Several North Korean military defectors have tested positive for smallpox antibodies, suggesting they were either exposed to the deadly virus or vaccinated against it, according to a report by Harvard Kennedy School's Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs.

Smallpox claimed up to a half billion lives before it was declared eradicated. Today, few populations are vaccinated against the defunct virus.

Starting three years ago, Amplyfi, a strategic intelligence firm, detected a dramatic increase in North Korean web searches for ""antibiotic resistance,"" ""microbial dark matter,"" ""cas protein"" and similar esoteric terms, hinting at a growing interest in advanced gene and germ research.

According to the Middlebury Institute analysis, at least 100 research publications that were jointly written by North Korean and foreign scientists have implications for military purposes, such as developing weapons of mass destruction. The collaborations may violate international sanctions.

Joseph S. Bermudez, Jr., a North Korean military analyst, said it is entirely likely that the North has already experimented with gene editing that could enhance bacteria and viruses.

""These are scientists, and scientists love to tinker,"" he said.

Western concerns about the North's program jumped in June 2015, after Mr. Kim posed in a white lab coat alongside military officers and scientists in a modern-looking pesticide facility called the Bio-Technical Institute, his arms outspread toward shiny lab equipment.

The plant allegedly produced pesticides. The photos showed enormous fermenters for growing microbes, as well as spray dryers that can turn bacterial spores into a powder fine enough to be inhaled. Mr. Kim was beaming.

Melissa Hanham, a scholar who first identified the site's threatening potential, said equipment model numbers showed that the North had obtained the machinery by evading sanctions -- laundering money, creating front companies or bribing people to buy it on the black market.

She said the evidence suggests the North succeeded in building a seemingly harmless agricultural plant that could be repurposed within weeks to produce dried anthrax spores.

Arms-control analysts say intrusive inspections are needed to see whether a facility is intended for peaceful aims or something else.

""A nuclear weapons facility has very visible signals to the outside world,"" Mr. Bermudez said. ""We can look at it and immediately say, 'Ugh, that's a nuclear reactor.' But the technology for conducting biological weapons research is essentially the same as what keeps a population healthy.""

Americans felt the sting of bioweapons in 2001 when a teaspoon of anthrax powder, dispatched in a handful of envelopes, killed five people, sickened 17 more and set off a nationwide panic. The spores shut down Congressional offices, the Supreme Court and much of the postal system, and cost about $320 million to clean up.

Federal budgets for biodefense soared after the attacks but have declined in recent years.

""The level of resources going against this is pitiful,"" said Mr. Weber, the former Pentagon official. ""We are back into complacency.""

Dr. Robert Kadlec, the assistant secretary for preparedness and response at the Department of Health and Human Services, said, ""We don't spend half of an aircraft carrier on our preparedness for deliberate or natural events.""

The National Security Council's top health security position was eliminated last year, so biological threats now come under the more general heading of weapons of mass destruction.

Still, on the Korean Peninsula, troops gird for a North Korean attack. According to the Belfer report, American forces in Korea since 2004 have been vaccinated against smallpox and anthrax.

Recently, Army engineers sped up the detection of biological agents from days to hours through Project Jupitr, or the Joint United States Forces Korea Portal and Integrated Threat Recognition, a Department of Defense spokeswoman said.

The comptroller general of the United States, after a request from the House Armed Services Committee, is currently conducting an evaluation of military preparedness for germ attacks.

""If you're a country that feels generally outclassed in conventional weapons,"" Ms. Hanham said, a lethal microbe such as anthrax might seem like a good way ""to create an outsized amount of damage.""

Such an attack would maximize casualties, she said, while terrorizing the uninfected population. For North Korea, Ms. Hanham added, ""That would be the twofold goal.""

207,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2019/01/15/world/americas/ap-cb-cuba-tourism.html,"HAVANA -- President Donald Trump's Cuba policy is driving millions of dollars from the island's private entrepreneurs to its state-run tourism sector, the opposite of its supposed goal, according to new government figures.

Trump announced in June 2017 that he was tightening limits on U.S. travel to Cuba in order to starve military-linked travel businesses and funnel money directly to the Cuban people.

He restricted Americans' ability to travel to Cuba on their own, rather than with a tour group. At the same time, he allowed U.S. cruise lines to continue to take passengers to Cuba, where they pay millions to disembark at military-run docks and make quick trips onshore that are generally coordinated by government tour agencies that stejrer travelers to state-run destinations.

Cuban government figures from the first full year under Trump's policy show occupancy of private bed-and-breakfasts in Havana plunged to 44 percent in 2018 after years at near capacity in the wake of President Barack Obama's start of normalization with Cuba, said Michael Bernal, commercial director for the Ministry of Tourism.

Even as the private sector suffered, U.S. travel to Cuba was growing, from 618,000 in 2017 to 630,000 last year, Tourism Ministry figures say. Most of those travelers came by ship, avoiding the confusing rules on travel to the island with package tours that are guaranteed to comply with the law.

The shift to cruises meant the average U.S. stay on the island dropped from six days to three, said Jose Luis Perello, a former University of Havana professor who studies Cuba's tourism industry.

That has had a devastating effect on owners and employees of Cuba's 24,185 private bed-and-breakfasts and 2,170 private restaurants known as paladares. They cherished U.S. travelers as heavy tippers who crammed days full of activities like classic car rides and cooking classes that put money into private hands.

David Pajon, a university professor who bought an apartment to rent in Old Havana, said he has had to drop his rates and his income has fallen 40 percent since Trump's new policy went into effect in 2017. He still was a third empty last month, the first time in three years that he wasn't fully booked in December.

""U.S.-Cuba normalization inspired a lot of people who thought this was a good business to invest their savings in,"" Pajon said. ""And all of a sudden you have the U.S. government creating a situation that has an impact on the number of people who came, or changes the way they're coming -- on cruise ships!""

The Trump measures, which were backed by Cuban-American Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, ban U.S. travelers from doing business with tourism businesses under the military-linked conglomerate known as GAESA, which runs dozens of hotels and a major tour-bus line, among others.

Instead, Americans are going to businesses run by the Tourism Ministry, but there is no reason to believe that Cuba has any difficulty transferring money within its highly centralized single-party government, said Richard Feinberg, a Brookings Institution fellow and University of California, San Diego, professor of international political economy who studies Cuba.

""Trump's policies have reduced on-island, versus cruise ship, tourism and thus harmed B&Bs as well as other private tourism-related firms including paladares and taxistas,"" Feinberg said. Beyond that, he said, ""the only traceable impact of the Rubio sanction is to inconvenience US tourists.""

The number of U.S. travelers to Cuba grew from 162,000 in 2015, the year after Obama and then Cuban President Raul Castro announced detente, to 284,000 in 2016 and 618,000 in 2017.

The overall number of travelers grew, too, from 3.5 million in 2015 to 3.7 million in 2016, 4.3 million in 2017 and 4.7 million last year.

Nonetheless, the private sector suffered.

Enrique Nunez, owner of La Guarida, perhaps Havana's best-known restaurant, said he had to cut his employees' hours last year because his revenue fell 40 percent.

""We don't understand the U.S. rules,"" said Bernal, the tourism official. ""We heard the president's speech saying that the U.S. government supports entrepreneurs. However, that's the sector that's suffering most in Cuba.""

208,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/15/world/americas/juan-guaido-nicolas-maduro-venezuela.html,"CARACAS -- Leaders of Venezuela's opposition on Tuesday set in motion a plan to try to oust President Nicolas Maduro and create a caretaker government until new elections can be held.

The National Assembly, the opposition-controlled legislative body, declared Mr. Maduro illegitimate, hoping to trigger a Constitutional mechanism that would allow the head of the National Assembly to take over the leadership.

It was not immediately clear what effect the move would have or how Mr. Maduro's government would react. The National Assembly has been largely powerless since Venezuela's Supreme Court, which is packed by Maduro loyalists, attempted to dissolve it in March 2017.

But pressure has been growing on Mr. Maduro both domestically and abroad since the president was sworn in for his second term last week. Not long after the ceremony, an opposition leader who is head of the National Assembly, Juan Guaidó, said he would be ready to take over as president and call fair elections if Venezuelans and the armed forces backed him.

He quickly received support from Luis Almagro, the secretary general of the Organization of American States, who began calling Mr. Guaidó the country's ""interim president,"" and from Vice President Mike Pence. Mr. Pence said in a message posted on Twitter Sunday that the United States ""strongly supports the courageous decision by Juan Guaidó"" to ""declare the country's presidency vacant.""

Opposition leaders and longtime Venezuela watchers say Mr. Guaidó's challenge to the president comes at a time of unprecedented pressure on Mr. Maduro.

""It's almost a now-or-never moment,"" said Fernando Cutz, a former senior White House official who helped shape Venezuela policy under the Trump and Obama administrations.

This most recent move against the country's authoritarian president comes amid a collapsing economy and a growing humanitarian crisis.

Mr. Guaidó was briefly taken into custody by members of Venezuelan intelligence service on Sunday, then released. In an interview, he said he had been able to convince the officers that the opposition's plan to remove Mr. Maduro were constitutional and would help the country.

While that cannot be independently confirmed, the fact that Mr. Guaidó was released may indicate cracks in the security apparatus that has kept Mr. Maduro in power until now.

Sitting in a plain office at the headquarters of his political party, Popular Will, Mr. Guaidó said on Monday that opposition leaders believed they stood a good chance of seizing power from Mr. Maduro and convening a new election.

The key would be to persuade those who remain loyal to the government that they can switch allegiances and help rebuild a country devastated by an economic meltdown, acute food and medicine shortages and rampant violence.

""We are certain that we are taking the proper steps not to merely declare, but to execute"" a peaceful transition of power, Mr. Guaidó said. ""I think it is underway.""

He is cleareyed about the risks he is taking, he said. Mr. Guaidó still bears scars from being shot with rubber bullets during street protests last year.

""Anyone who gets involved in opposition efforts today can fare very poorly,"" he said.

Mr. Guaidó has called on Venezuelans to take to the streets on Jan. 23 for mass demonstrations backing his bid to remove Mr. Maduro.

In recent months, opposition leaders have struggled to organize large, sustained demonstrations amid skepticism by Venezuelans that the opposition can bring about change. Many also fear the increasingly brutal reprisals of the security forces.

As inflation has soared and food and medicine have become acutely scarce, Venezuelans have been fleeing their nation in droves. As of last November, more than three million people had left, according to the United Nations.

Mr. Cutz, the former White House official, said he feared that the opposition could emerge severely weakened if it failed to get people to protest in large numbers.

""If Maduro emerges victorious, then I feel like we are left with a relatively high likelihood of Venezuela ending up like Cuba,"" he said. ""This will become the status quo, and everyone will kind of accept it."""
209,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/01/14/us/politics/women-of-the-116th-congress.html,"For most of recorded American history, political power has looked a certain way. Portraits of power call certain images to mind -- those of older, white men, dressed in suits and depicted in formal settings.

The 2018 midterm elections ushered in a change in representation; for the first time, more than 100 women serve in the House of Representatives -- out of 435 seats -- and members of color were elected in more states than ever before.

This portraits series documents the women of the 116th Congress in their totality. Like the work of Kehinde Wiley, who painted Barack Obama's official presidential portrait, these photographs evoke the imagery we are used to seeing in the halls of power, but place people not previously seen as powerful starkly in the frames.

Viewed together, these portraits demonstrate the scale of the number of women in both the House and Senate. But, when seen as singular portraits, each image represents an individual with her own perspective -- in political beliefs, personal goals and histories.

Many of these women, spanning generations, serve as firsts in Congress: the first women representing their states, the first female combat veteran, the first Native American women, the first Muslim women, the first openly gay member of the Senate, the first woman Speaker of the House -- the list goes on."
210,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/14/us/illegal-immigrants-border-shelters-charities.html,"SAN DIEGO -- Migrants who are allowed to remain in the United States to pursue asylum are usually given a choice when they are released from detention in San Diego: Go to the Greyhound bus station and fend for themselves, or try to find a cot and a shower at a local shelter.

One way or another, once the migrants have been dropped off by discreet white Immigration and Customs Enforcement vans in border towns across the Southwest, they are no longer the federal government's problem.

President Trump has tried and failed to end a practice he derisively calls ""catch and release,"" and thousands of undocumented migrants apprehended at the border every month are still being granted routine entry to the United States while their cases are processed by immigration courts.

But as the number of migrant families in recent months has overwhelmed the government's detention facilities, the Trump administration has drastically reduced its efforts to ensure the migrants' safety after they are released. People working along the border say an ever larger number of families are being released with nowhere to stay, no money, no food and no means of getting to friends and relatives who may be hundreds or thousands of miles away.

Federal officials say they are unable to do more to help the migrants, and local governments have often been hesitant to get involved because of cost and potential liability.

Stepping into the void has been a growing network of charities, expanding along the border from California to Texas. Dating back well into the Obama administration, when the surge in migrant families began, these churches and other nongovernmental organizations have strung together millions of dollars worth of assistance to help keep migrants off the streets and speed their reunion with family members in the United States.

""The government isn't doing anything -- it's been a total make-it-up-as-we-go thing,"" said Kevin Malone, one of the founders of the San Diego Rapid Response Network, a consortium of faith-based nonprofits in the area. ""People are working 24 hours a day trying to make this happen. Everyone is strapped.""

While there has never been a good solution to the issue of what to do with migrants after they are released by immigration agents, recent steps by the Trump administration have exacerbated the situation.

Undocumented migrants are held initially at Border Patrol and ICE facilities as their claims for asylum are registered. Previously, government agents would help coordinate plans for their release, contacting family members in American cities and helping secure transportation, even sometimes paying for bus tickets. When charity-operated shelters were full, government agencies sometimes held them a little longer, until they could be transferred.

Those practices, known collectively as ""safe release,"" ended in October, according to a statement from ICE, because the agency has become overwhelmed by the number of migrants it has to process.

Part of the problem, government officials say, is that the courts have established a limit of 20 days for holding migrant children in detention, and the government has a very limited number of detention facilities that can handle both adults and children. An earlier attempt to detain them separately was struck down by the courts and rescinded. Waiting to coordinate releases with charity shelters can result in migrant families being held in detention for too long, officials say.

""After decades of inaction by Congress, the government remains severely constrained in its ability to detain and promptly remove families with no legal basis to remain in the U.S.,"" the agency said. ""To mitigate the risk of holding family units past the time frame allotted to the government, ICE has curtailed reviews of post-release plans from families apprehended along the southwest border.""

Yet those now trying to help the migrants say the government has abandoned its moral responsibility to make sure they are released safely.

Even under President Obama, the government had no infrastructure to provide services to newly released migrants; instead it relied on a cooperative relationship with private shelter operators. Now, the shelter operators say, that cooperation has become fraught.

Some charity networks have had to quickly become experts in refugee aid in American border towns. They provide showers, nutrition and clean clothes. Many ""guests,"" as the volunteers call the migrants, arrive hungry, sick or traumatized. They need fresh diapers for their infants and clean clothes for their older children.

The sole shelter in San Diego, run by Jewish Family Service of San Diego, has processed nearly 5,000 asylum applicants since it began operating two months ago. It was built ""on a wing and a prayer,"" according to Mr. Malone, and has had to move five times to find adequate space. Newly arrived migrants are provided with austere blue cots, portable showers and donated bread and fruit. They are also screened for illnesses.

Kate Clark, the director of immigration services at Jewish Family Service, said the organization stepped in nine weeks ago when it learned migrants were being ""dumped at the border."" But despite California's political leaders talking about being receptive to migrants, ""every single night, our ability to ensure that none of the migrants are sleeping on the street is questionable, because of the capacity of our shelters,"" Ms. Clark said.

Their operating costs run between $350,000 and $400,000 a month, largely raised by faith organizations and a GoFundMe account. Still, on days when 100 or more refugees are dropped off, they have little option, because of capacity constraints, other than to turn away families and leave them homeless.

""It's been a difficult couple of years, but there's never been anything like this,"" said Etleva Bejko, the director of refugee services at the organization.

The charities have also had to learn how to cope with the illnesses that migrants can develop during the difficult journey from Central America, which many make on buses and on foot.

Marcela Wash, a registered nurse who has helped treat migrants in San Diego, said that many arrive dehydrated and in various states of medical distress. Rashes, scabies, and respiratory infections have been extremely common, she said. She estimated that 80 percent of the women she saw had lice.

""Their journeys were hard, of course, but many of these things they caught either at a shelter in Tijuana or in detention,"" she said.

Once migrants are healthy enough to travel, the shelter pays to transport them to join relatives wherever they are in the country, while their cases proceed in court.

Some border towns have a more established base of nonprofit assistance for migrants, but they too have seen demands grow in recent months.

In El Paso, the Annunciation House has coordinated migrant releases with ICE for years. The migrants typically stay for a few days at the charity's main building or at one of nearly two dozen churches, hotels and other sites that are part of its shelter network. In recent months, the charity has been assisting about 2,200 migrants a week in El Paso.

On a recent afternoon, the shelter's headquarters, a red brick building about a mile from the border, bustled with activity, part migrant dormitory, part cafeteria and part triage center. Upstairs, a worker holding bundles of laundry walked past family dorm rooms with bunk beds, as the aroma of a dinner being prepared filled the halls. Downstairs, migrant families waiting for a ride to the bus station kept busy by helping to unload a UPS truck parked outside. A new batch of donations had arrived, to add to the towers of Amazon boxes full of clothing and other goods that people around the country had donated.

The cost of these operations can be crushing. In just two Texas border regions -- the El Paso and McAllen areas -- several Catholic groups, charities and local governments have spent roughly $2 million in recent years on migrant relief efforts.

On Friday, Ruben Garcia, the director of Annunciation House, was preparing to pay for several rooms at a hotel for the next seven days to handle an overflow of migrants from their shelter. The tab came to about $14,000. Depending on the number of migrants ICE releases, the shelter's hotel expenses can climb as high as $150,000 a month.

Bureaucracy and politics can tie up more significant investments at the local level. Mr. Malone, the executive director of the San Diego Organizing Project, said San Diego municipal and county officials have suggested to him they have been waiting for the state to officially declare a crisis to lend a hand. He presumed that had to do with the bottom line.

""It became just a bunch of people pointing fingers,"" said Mr. Malone. ""And at the end of the day, the other question was, 'Who is going to pay the check?' That's the real reason that no one talked about.""

The California Department of Social Services gave the shelter $500,000, but the money could only be used for ""case management,"" including intake, registration and ""know your rights"" orientations. It could not be used for most of the shelter's operating costs, or for transportation costs for the migrants, one of the primary needs. San Diego County has provided medical guidance and nursing and support staff.

""We want to help prevent a crisis,"" Mr. Malone said. ""It's been our crisis, and I've been telling them, soon it's going to be yours.""

Gov. Gavin Newsom's office did not immediately respond to requests for comment.

The city of McAllen, Tex., which has seen the largest number of migrant families during the recent surge, has contributed $517,000 since 2014 toward a relief effort run largely by Catholic Charities.

In El Paso, city leaders were forced to act after federal officials made a series of unannounced nighttime releases of hundreds of migrants during Christmas week. The city officials put migrants on municipal buses to keep them warm, took them to shelter sites and coordinated the response with the local Office of Emergency Management. El Paso officials were told that none of the cost would be reimbursed by the federal government.

""It's kind of hard to ask the federal government for emergency relief when they're creating the problem to begin with,"" Dee Margo, the mayor of El Paso, said at a recent City Council meeting.

Mr. Garcia, who runs Annunciation House, said that in October, for the first time since 2014 that he could remember, there were several releases of migrants onto the streets of El Paso without any coordination.

""I started getting calls from the police department, and everybody and their grandmother was calling me to figure out what was going on,"" he said. ""I wish to God you could get into one of their offices to ask them, 'What in the world were you thinking when you did that? What was the objective?'"""
211,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/14/magazine/all-the-presidents-memes.html,"On the 12th day of the federal government shutdown, the 45th president of the United States of America posted a meme on his Instagram account: an image of his half-glowering, half-smirking visage, hovering gigantically above the Southwestern desert, dwarfing the picture's centerpiece -- a rendering of his signature campaign promise -- and, in a familiar font, some explanatory text: ""The Wall Is Coming."" It's an image that makes you think, That's from HBO's hit series ""Game of Thrones"" -- sort of, and then makes you think about the unique privileges and burdens of living in this moment in history.

There are so many unusual aspects of Donald Trump's presidency that his willingness to communicate with the public through internet memes is often overshadowed. Typically, he retweets images made by his most enthusiastic backers -- in November he shared one of the Clintons, Barack Obama, Huma Abedin, Robert Mueller, his own deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein and others, all locked up in a prison cell together -- but the wall meme appears to be a White House original. It is also the second ""Game of Thrones"" meme the president has shared in the last two months. He does this sort of thing so often that the Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, recently felt compelled to tweet, like an exasperated high school teacher, ""Enough with the memes.""

It's impossible to overstate how peculiar it is that the most powerful man in the world, who will turn 73 in June, posts memes. It's a behavior more often associated with youth, irreverence and a surfeit of free time -- though certainly plenty of old, aggrieved people have picked up the habit in recent years. In 2016, the Trump campaign united message-board trolls and Facebook boomers, and together they disseminated so many memes that some of them began to believe -- both jokingly and not -- that their ""meme magic"" had helped Trump win the election.

In current usage, ""meme"" refers most often to an image with text overlay, designed for distribution online. They're like the bumper stickers of the digital realm, in that any one concept can be endlessly remixed to convey just about any sort of sentiment (Calvin can pee on anything). What began more than a decade ago as a fun way to imagine how cats might talk has evolved into a surprisingly fertile mode of political communication. The online database Know Your Meme has confirmed the existence of some 4,066 successful memes in the wild -- including newcomers like Big Chungus, a fake series of video games starring an obese rabbit, and classics like Doge, which featured a shiba inu speaking broken English. The actual number is certainly much higher.

You might find this very silly, and you wouldn't be wrong. But keep in mind: The president posts them.

All of this represents a long fall from the meme's origins. The word was coined by the British ethologist Richard Dawkins in his 1976 book, ""The Selfish Gene,"" as a way to conceptualize the transmission of culture in biological terms. For Dawkins, a meme, shortened from the Greek mimeme -- ""an imitated thing"" -- was a unit of culture, a building block of our mental architecture. ""Just as genes propagate themselves in the gene pool by leaping from body to body via sperms or eggs,"" Dawkins wrote, ""memes propagate themselves in the meme pool by leaping from brain to brain."" They could be as small and short-lived as a tune or catchphrase, he explained, or as large and consequential as ""God"" and ""eternal damnation.""

Genes, Dawkins argued, do not aim to propagate a species; they seek only to propagate themselves. Memes, he believed, were similarly selfish. Dawkins spends most of his chapter on memetics fixating on religion, and because he has since become such an aggressively outspoken atheist, reading the book today it is easy to get the sense that he considers religion almost parasitic. The concept of ""God,"" he figured, endures because it offers a psychological salve to people, while ""eternal damnation"" survives because it is useful as a means of social control. Thus both live on, copied from generation to generation, latching on to humanity and perpetuating themselves too effectively to be got rid of. ""Selection favors memes that exploit their cultural environment to their own advantage,"" Dawkins wrote.

Ideas, in this view, have lives of their own, and the environment in which they struggle for survival is the human mind -- our limited processing power means that only the toughest will persevere. ""If a meme is to dominate the attention of a human brain,"" Dawkins wrote, ""it must do so at the expense of 'rival' memes."" He conceded that a meme would also have to compete for airtime on the radio or TV, billboard space, column inches and book pages. But, writing back in the 1970s, he had no reason to consider what would happen if those scarcity conditions vanished. If they did, you would find yourself in a terrifyingly fecund primordial soup in which all sorts of ideas could develop, mutate, cross-pollinate, do battle, die off and be reborn. You would find yourself, well, online.

And while this primordial soup has brought forth many novel concepts, and resuscitated some old, corrosive beliefs, the things we call ""memes"" today are largely just joke formats -- mechanisms for the efficient production of humor. They develop less like new ideas and more like algal blooms, spreading until they block out the sun and consume all the oxygen, before dying out naturally (people get sick of them) or getting hit with bleach (explainer journalists write about them). Individually, these memes leave little mark on our culture. Worse than being forgettable, they become, within a year or two, embarrassing to think back on for even one second.

But taken as a whole, this swarm of cultural mayflies represents a meaningful shift in our culture. Joke-making, a sometimes cruel enterprise, has been mechanized and democratized. Humor now emerges from the ether, authorless or, more accurate, authored and improved upon by everyone. Jokes are communal now, and constant. Online, everything that happens all day -- in politics, in culture, in the news -- is rapidly repurposed for laughs, by everyone, all at once.

For the most part, this is harmless. After all, what could possibly go wrong in a culture where all anyone wants is to be perpetually amused?

Before Trump's border wall was the cause of a government shutdown, it was a mnemonic device -- less a policy proposal than a string tied around the finger. According to a recent article in The Times, the wall was a ""memory trick for an undisciplined candidate."" Trump's advisers Sam Nunberg and Roger Stone knew that getting tough on immigration would play well to a right-wing audience, but they also knew the man they were dealing with. He has a mind for the tactile, so they gave him something gigantic to hang onto: an 1,800-mile-long slab of concrete.

But Trump's talking points were never just talking points. They were more like bits. His campaign rallies were rambling, unscripted affairs, almost like an open-mic comedy set: Not a fearsome Nuremberg rally, but an aging showman road-testing material, seeing what caught the audience's attention. Early on, his speeches were ""all over the place,"" the NBC reporter Katy Tur told ""Frontline,"" but as time passed, ""he started to really hone his message, and he started to remember what lines worked."" In the same episode, the writer Marc Fisher said Trump told him that he would simply wait to see the red lights on the TV cameras in the press box turn on, indicating he was live, and then he would say ""whatever it took to keep the red light on.""

The border wall kept the lights on. At a 2016 rally in Burlington, Vt., Trump mentioned the wall to tremendous, wonderful applause, then paused and asked his audience, ""And who's gonna pay for the wall?"" The crowd roared back, ""MEXICO!"" They -- he and his crowd -- did this two more times together, then Trump laughed. ""I've never done it before, I swear,"" he said, throwing his arms up as if surprised it had worked. ""That was pretty cool. We're gonna have to use that.""

This incentive structure, in which an easily distracted person says a bunch of stuff he kind of means to an assembled audience, slowly learning what generates a reaction and what doesn't, is familiar: It's like posting online. This is the process that nudged the wall ever closer to reality, despite the fact that it was only ever supposed to be a metaphor, a shorthand, a catchphrase. It is an idea with no real owner or creator, passed from person to person, from lectern to grandstand to TV and Twitter and back again, copying itself and growing and mutating until it became big, beautiful and tipped with spikes forged from American steel. The border wall is, in the truest sense, a meme: an idea that persists not because it will benefit us but simply because it thrives in our environment. It was so effective at doing whatever it did that it couldn't be contained, spilling out of the president's brain and spreading throughout our entire body politic, cooling and hardening like bacon grease, until it finally brought everything to a standstill. And I hate to admit it, but that is a little funny."

""Woodward has set the standard for dogged and objective reporting and gripping storytelling,"" said Suzanne Nossel, the chief executive officer of PEN America, in a statement. ""His work has helped fortify American democracy for decades.""

Woodward played a central role in bringing to light Richard Nixon's role during the Watergate scandal through his reporting for The Washington Post and wrote a number of books on the subject, including ""All the President's Men: The Greatest Reporting Story of All Time,"" written with Carl Bernstein. He pioneered in the use of anonymous sources, which allowed him to report on details that might not otherwise have become public. He has also tackled a number of other presidents including George W.

Good morning.

The U.S. says it's leaving Syria, an attorney general sues Facebook and Der Spiegel fires a writer for deception. Here's the latest:

President Trump orders a full withdrawal from Syria

All 2,000 U.S. ground troops were ordered out of Syria, suddenly ending a military campaign that largely vanquished the Islamic State but ceding a strategically vital country to Russia and Iran.

""We have defeated ISIS in Syria, my only reason for being there during the Trump Presidency,"" the president said in a Twitter post. The White House did not provide a timetable or other specifics for the pullout.

Lawmakers and Pentagon officials argued that the move would betray Kurdish allies who have fought alongside American troops in Syria, and who could now be vulnerable to an attack by Turkey.

Analysis: Mr. Trump believes that U.S. forces cannot alter the strategic balance in the Middle East and should not be there -- a view that Barack Obama fundamentally shared, our national security correspondent writes.

Another angle: The abrupt withdrawal is seen by analysts as an abandonment of key U.S. allies in Syria and a boon for the Islamic State, which still controls territory in the country's southeast.

Facebook is sued over Cambridge Analytica

The lawsuit brought by the attorney general of the District of Columbia, Karl Racine, is a first step by a state attorney general to punish the social media giant for privacy violations.

The New York Times and other news organizations reported in March that Cambridge Analytica, a political consulting firm based in London, had improperly obtained the data of as many as 87 million Facebook users.

In Mr. Racine's lawsuit, he said that roughly half of Washington's residents had been exposed by Cambridge Analytica's data harvesting. He also said Facebook had misled people about the security of their data.

Another angle: If being overwhelmed by the scale of all these online privacy scandals seems familiar, it should. It's a lot like climate change.

What you can do: If you've had enough, here are six steps you can take to break up with Facebook for good.

U.S. Federal Reserve raises interest rates

The widely expected quarter-point increase signaled confidence in the health of the U.S. economy.

The Fed's chairman, Jerome H. Powell, said the choppy global economy and the recent sell-off in stocks had gotten the Fed's attention, but he called the move ""appropriate.""

U.S. stocks erased early gains after the announcement, which also indicated that rates would continue to be raised next year.

Markets were well prepared for a rate increase, but policymakers had also been expected to calm jittery investors by emphasizing that further increases in 2019 would depend on sustained economic growth.

What it means for you: Rising interest rates have consequences for savers and spenders alike.

Der Spiegel fires an award-winning journalist

The German magazine said the writer, Claas Relotius, had engaged in fabrication ""on a grand scale,"" weaving invented quotations and characters into more than a dozen major articles.

Mr. Relotius, 33, had written for Der Spiegel since 2011. He admitted to making up parts of at least 14 articles, the magazine said, adding that the figure could rise.

The details: In one article, about Fergus Falls, Minn., Mr. Relotius told of a coal plant employee who did not exist, related an anecdote about a restaurant employee to whom he gave a fictional illness and a misnamed son, and described the view of a power plant from a cafe whose windows provided no such view, according to two residents of the town who researched his claims.

More fabrications: Other articles with false or manipulated material included several that were nominated for prizes, including stories about Iraqi children kidnapped by the Islamic State, a prisoner at Guantánamo Bay and Syrian orphans forced to work in a Turkish sweatshop.

Here's what else is happening

Catholic Church: The Church in Illinois withheld the names of at least 500 priests accused of sexual abuse of minors, the state's attorney general said. And Pope Francis accepted the resignation of a Los Angeles bishop after an investigation into an accusation of misconduct with a minor.

Italy budget: The country reached a deal with the E.U. after months of defiance, agreeing to drastically reduce its debt to avoid financial penalties.

Covering COP24: When our reporter traveled to the heart of Polish coal country for the U.N. climate talks, he discovered that the setting was an apt one.

Diplomatic crisis: China detained a third Canadian, escalating tensions with the U.S. over the arrest of a top Chinese technology executive.

""I can English understand"": Switzerland's new economics minister is facing widespread criticism of his language skills.

""Stupid woman"": Did Britain's Labour leader, Jeremy Corbyn, call Prime Minister Theresa May names in the House of Commons? Amateur lip readers are poring over a video clip, and lawmakers are demanding an apology.

Russian whistle-blower: Alexander Perepilichny, who died jogging near his home in a London suburb six years ago, probably died of natural causes, a British coroner ruled.

Christmas surprise: A man in Wales opened his front door and found 14 years' worth of presents for his young daughter, given by his recently deceased neighbor.

The things they carried: A photographer documented the journey of migrants who crossed the Evros River between Turkey and Greece. He discovered that many of them perish, dying in limbo, and are never identified.

Genoa bridge: The Italian city will get a new bridge by Renzo Piano, its most famous architect, to replace a viaduct that collapsed last summer.

Petty crime: Last week, our reporter asked London residents to share their experiences with minor crimes. The Twitter post caught fire; here are some of the responses.

No parking: Oslo, Norway, is eliminating 700 street parking spots in its city center by the end of the year as part of a plan to make the area more pedestrian-friendly.

If Brexit were a restaurant: It might look like Bluebird London, which serves English food and Long Island burrata in Manhattan, our restaurant critic writes.

Secret Prague: A new wave of off-the-radar art spaces are opening in former factories, military barracks and other historic structures in the Czech capital.

Back Story

Clare Macdonald, a reader from Keene, N.H., asked us when the first electric lights were used on a Christmas tree.

It was in 1882, just three years after Thomas Edison filed a patent for his light bulb. The tree became a fixture in the experiment-filled home of an executive at his company.

Eighty walnut-size red, white and blue bulbs covered the tree, which sat on a revolving box. A newspaper article described it: ""As the tree turned, the colors alternated, all the lamps going out and being relit at every revolution. The result was a continuous twinkling of dancing colors, red, white, blue, white, red, blue, all evening.""

President Grover Cleveland popularized electric Christmas lights in the 1890s by installing them on the White House tree.

But it was not until (relatively) inexpensive strings of Christmas lights began to be sold a few years later that the tradition really caught on.

214,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/24/opinion/campaign-stops/behind-hillarys-mask.html,"RIGHT after the Sept. 11 attacks, I ran into Hillary Clinton outside an armory in Manhattan that served as a sort of clearing house for tragedy, where people brought pictures of the missing and checked for information. She talked for a long time, very freely, about Washington politicians who had always hated New York but were turning out to be helpful in the crisis.

The conversation was memorable not for the information but for her manner. For all her intensity about the city, Clinton was more relaxed than I'd ever seen her while chatting with a member of the press. She was operating in a new space -- for the moment, no one really cared that she was a senator who'd gotten elected from a state she'd never lived in, the survivor of the best-known political sex scandal in American history, the former first lady who ran for office while her husband was still president. The country had temporarily lost interest in celebrities, and she seemed to find her relative insignificance liberating.

When Clinton is nominated for president later this week in Philadelphia, we'll be talking about her as the first woman to get a crack at running the country. But she'd also be one of the most famous people ever to get the honor. In America, she's been part of the backdrop of our lives for nearly a quarter of a century. We're watching a very familiar face making a brand-new mark on history.

In 2000, when she first ran for the Senate, the fact that New York had never sent a woman to the Senate was an afterthought, given all the other stuff there was to consider. ""It was the first time I'd been a candidate and the first time I'd lived in New York,"" she recalled in a phone interview. The very idea of that race was incredible -- maybe outrageous. And it didn't begin well. She had trouble with the carpetbagging issue. At one point, Clinton attempted to woo the locals by claiming that although she'd been brought up as a Chicago Cubs fan, she had always rooted for the Yankees because people need a team in each league. This was contradictory to every law of Midwestern fandom, which holds that no matter what else you do, hating the New York Yankees is a central principle of life.

Then she turned everything around. Went on an endless ""listening tour"" of such anti-glamorous, earnest wonkiness that reporters who trailed after her from town to town began to develop nervous tics and drinking issues. But it was the perfect strategy. By the end, she had worn down her aura of outsiderdom. And she seemed to be enjoying herself. While all politicians at her level have stupendously sturdy egos, Clinton does appear to get a certain relief being in venues where the focus is on somebody else.

That year on the trail, Clinton wore the very same thing almost every day, a black pantsuit with a bright blouse. It seemed like a stroke of genius -- proof that female candidates could eliminate the endless clothing commentary by simply doing what guys do and wearing interchangeable outfits. Later, of course, she'd go back to her romance with jewel tones, and by 2008, reporters would sometimes post the color of the day at the back of the press plane. I asked her once why she'd given up the original outfit plan and she said she just got bored.

The thing I remember most about those trips from Oneonta to Cooperstown to Horseheads -- besides the tedium -- was the intense reaction she got from middle-aged women, who yelled and waved and begged for autographs. They were the ones who remembered what it was like when the newspapers had separate ""help wanted"" columns for men and women, who needed a male co-signer when they got their first car loans. I suspected that a lot of them, like me, still had credit cards in their husbands' names because that was just the way things worked when they first began to charge stuff at Macy's or use American Express.

And there was something else. Hillary Clinton represented the possibility of a second act. The country was full of women who had come of age with the women's revolution, who had tried to have it all, raising children while having good -- but maybe not spectacular -- careers. Now there was the about-to-retire first lady, in her new persona, suggesting they might be able to start a whole new episode in life. Driving around through upstate New York, Clinton was in the home territory of Susan B. Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton, who had broken the old rules about staying home, rearing the kids and then retiring to a rocking chair.

Stanton in particular argued that instead of the end, middle age could be a jumping-off point for adventure. You could do all the things you weren't able to do when the children were young -- you could travel, make speeches, start newspapers, lead rallies. You could do things no women had done before in the public arena, because you looked mature and trustworthy and people could see you had paid your dues. The prospect was so exciting, women began writing paeans to menopause as a time for ""superexaltation.""

O.K., none of that specifically came up during the listening tours. But I swear it was there in the background.

When the campaign was over, Clinton was in fact elected the first woman senator from New York, although she says she was ""too busy learning about dairy compacts and watersheds"" to think much about the feminist-history angle. Even when she ran for president in 2008, she didn't usually make it a specific campaign theme. But gender was on her mind. She frequently told audiences that her mother had been born before women had the right to vote. And when her chances of winning got increasingly slim, she'd complain, in private, that some Obama people seemed to think she was going to automatically get out of the way and defer to what the guys wanted. ""I'm not going to tell my daughter, 'Oh, I quit, because I'm the girl and they're all being mean to me,' "" she said at one point.

Over the last eight years, Clinton has grown more comfortable stressing the idea of becoming the first woman to serve as president. She thinks it really came into focus after she lost in 2008 and made that speech about putting 18 million cracks in the glass ceiling.

""This time I decided I'd be more explicit,"" she said, and ""make it part of the campaign.""

Because this is a story about Hillary Clinton you know this upbeat resolution is going to be followed by a problem. Young women are not universally crazy about the first-woman thing. Some just see her as an imperfect candidate. For others, it's because the whole gender thing seems like yesterday's news. ""There aren't as many overt questions about 'Can a woman do it? Is it something the country is ready for?' "" Clinton acknowledged.

That's probably true, and if it is, she deserves a lot of the credit. You can argue the pros and cons of Hillary Clinton's character, or her potential to change the nation, or her position on trade policy. But you can never take away the fact that she was the one who made the idea of a woman becoming president so normal that many young women are bored by it.

Clinton comes out of a very specific zone of American high school culture in the middle of the 20th century -- the girls behind the homecoming float-building committee. (She tells a story in her autobiography about being told as a teenager that she was ""really stupid"" to think she could be senior class president, losing the election and then agreeing to run the committee that did all the behind-the-scenes work.) She drew a terrible straw in 2008, when she had to run against a guy who was not only a making-history candidate himself, but also clearly a member of the prom king sector. Now she's pitted against the rich kid who throws wild parties when his parents are out of town.

The Republican convention last week made it clear how vicious this campaign is going to be -- the only real platform appeared to be the desirability of locking Hillary Clinton up, and she was blamed for everything from ISIS to the kidnapping of Nigerian schoolgirls. Donald Trump painted a picture of a wrecked, emasculated America in a dystopian world created by Obama-Clinton malfeasance. We don't know yet whether Clinton can counter forcefully with a sunnier vision. What we do know is that she won't be cowed.

Whatever her defects, she is a candidate with a very long and event-filled history of toughing things out, who finds solace in stupendously hard work and in doing her homework. She's one of the best-known people on the planet, but she can happily spend a day listening to complaints about watershed pollution or flying halfway around the world to sit through a conference on sustainable development.

When she was still secretary of state, I asked Clinton about another presidential campaign and she waved the idea aside. Her future plans, she said, involved sleeping and exercising and traveling for fun. ""It sounds so ordinary, but I haven't done it for 20 years. I would like to see whether I can get untired,"" she said.

She may never find out."
215,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/04/opinion/sunday/israeli-jews-american-jews-divide.html,"Mr. Weisman is the deputy Washington editor of The New York Times.

The events of past year brought American and Israeli Jews ever closer to a breaking point. President Trump, beloved in Israel and decidedly unloved by a majority of American Jews, moved the United States Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem in May, with the fiery evangelical pastors John Hagee and Robert Jeffress consecrating the ceremony.

In October, after the murder of 11 Jews at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh, President Trump went to that city to pay his respects. Members of the Jewish community there, in near silent mourning, came out to protest Mr. Trump's arrival, declaring that he was not welcome until he gave a national address to renounce the rise of white nationalism and its attendant bigotry.

The only public official to greet the president at the Tree of Life was Israel's ambassador to the United States, Ron Dermer.

At a Hanukkah celebration at the White House last month, the president raised eyebrows and age-old insinuations of dual loyalties when he told American Jews at the gathering that his vice president had great affection for ""your country,"" Israel.

Yossi Klein Halevi, the American-born Israeli author, has framed this moment starkly: Israeli Jews believe deeply that President Trump recognizes their existential threats. In scuttling the Obama-era Iran nuclear deal, which many Israelis saw as imperiling their security, in moving the American Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, in basically doing whatever the government of Benjamin Netanyahu asks, they see a president of the United States acting to save their lives.

American Jews, in contrast, see President Trump as their existential threat, a leader who they believe has stoked nationalist bigotry, stirred anti-Semitism and, time again, failed to renounce the violent hatred swirling around his political movement. The F.B.I. reports that hate crimes in the United States jumped 17 percent in 2017, with a 37 percent spike in crimes against Jews and Jewish institutions.

When neither side sees the other as caring for its basic well-being, ""that is a gulf that cannot be bridged,"" Michael Siegel, the head rabbi at Chicago's conservative Anshe Emet Synagogue, told me recently. He is an ardent Zionist.

To be sure, a vocal minority of Jews in Israel remain queasy about the American president, just as a vocal minority of Jews in the United States strongly support him. But more than 75 percent of American Jews voted for the Democrats in the midterm elections; 69 percent of Israelis have a positive view of the United States under Mr. Trump, up from 49 percent in 2015, according to the Pew Research Center. Israel is one of the few developed countries where opinion about the United States has improved since Mr. Trump took office.

Part of the distance between Jews in the United States and Israeli Jews may come from the stance that Israel's leader is taking on the world stage. Mr. Netanyahu has embraced the increasingly authoritarian Hungarian leader Victor Orban, who ran a blatantly anti-Semitic re-election campaign. He has aligned himself with ultranationalists like Rodrigo Duterte in the Philippines, Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil and a Polish government that passed a law making it a crime to suggest the Poles had any responsibility for the Holocaust.

The Israeli prime minister was one of the very few world leaders who reportedly ran interference for the Trump administration after the murder of the Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi and urged President Trump to maintain his alliance with the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman. Mr. Netanyahu's son Yair was temporarily kicked off Facebook for writing that he would ""prefer"" that ""all the Muslims leave the land of Israel.""

Last month, with multiple corruption investigations closing in on him and his conservative coalition fracturing, Mr. Netanyahu called for a snap election in April, hoping to fortify his political standing.

If past is prologue, his election campaign will again challenge American Jewry's values. As his 2015 campaign came to a close, Mr. Netanyahu darkly warned his supporters that ""the right-wing government is in danger -- Arab voters are heading to the polling stations in droves,"" adding with a Trumpian flourish that left-wing organizations ""are bringing them in buses.""

Israeli politicians -- and citizens -- are increasingly dismissive of the views of American Jews anyway. Evangelical Christians, ardently pro-Israel, give Jerusalem a power base in Washington that is larger and stronger than the American Jewish population. And with Orthodox American Jews aligned with evangelicals, that coalition has at least an interfaith veneer -- even without Conservative and Reform Jews, the bulk of American Jewry.

The divide between American Jews and Israeli Jews goes beyond politics. A recent law tried to reinstate the Chief Rabbinate as the only authority that can legally convert non-Orthodox Jews in Israel. Israel's chief Ashkenazi rabbi, after the slaughter in Pittsburgh, refused to refer to the Conservative Tree of Life as a synagogue at all, calling it ""a place with a profound Jewish flavor.""

Already only Orthodox Jewish weddings are legal in Israel. Reform Jews have been roughed up when praying at the Western Wall. Promises to Jewish women that the Israeli rabbinate would become more inclusive have largely led to disappointment. Last summer, the group Women of the Wall was warned that if it did not remain confined to the small, barricaded area within the ""women's section,"" its members would be barred from praying there altogether.

And the stalemate over Palestinian rights and autonomy has become nearly impossible to dismiss as some temporary roadblock, awaiting perhaps a new government in Jerusalem or a new leadership of the Palestinian Authority.

The two-state solution is increasingly feeling like a cruel joke. American Jews' rabbis and lay leaders counsel them to be vigilant against any other solution, such as granting Palestinians full rights in a greater Israel, because those solutions would dilute or destroy Israel's identity as a Jewish state. Be patient, American Jews are told. Peace talks are coming. The Palestinians will have their state.

In the meantime, the movement to boycott, divest from and sanction Israel grows stronger on American campuses, and new voices are emerging in the Democratic Party, such as Representatives Ilhan Omar of Minnesota and Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, who are willing to speak openly about Palestinian rights and autonomy where other lawmakers have declined to do so.

Of course, American Jews, like Israeli Jews, are not a monolith. Within the American Jewish population, there is a significant generational split on Israel that goes beyond ideology. Older American Jews, more viscerally aware of the Holocaust and connected to the living history of the Jewish state, are generally willing to look past Israeli government actions that challenge their values. Or they embrace those actions. Younger American Jews do not typically remember Israel as the David against regional Goliaths. They see a bully, armed and indifferent, 45 years past the Yom Kippur War, the last conflict that threatened Israel's existence.

American Jewry has been going its own way for 150 years, a drift that has created something of a new religion, or at least a new branch of one of the world's most ancient faiths.

In a historical stroke with resonance today, American Jewish leaders gathered in Pittsburgh in 1885 to produce what is known as the Pittsburgh Platform, a new theology for an American Judaism, less focused on a Messianic return to the land of Israel and more on fixing a broken world, the concept of Tikkun Olam. Jews, the rabbi behind the platform urged, must achieve God's purpose by ""living and working in and with the world.""

For a faith that for thousands of years was insular and self-contained, its people often in mandated ghettos, praying for the Messiah to return them to the Promised Land, this was a radical notion. But for most American Jews, it is now accepted as a tenet of their religion: building a better, more equal, more tolerant world now, where they live.

Last summer, when a Conservative rabbi in Haifa was hauled in for questioning by the Israeli police after he officiated at a non-Orthodox wedding, it was too much for Rabbi Steven Wernick, chief executive of the United Synagogue of Conservative Judaism, the umbrella organization of the Conservative movement in North America.

""I do not believe we can talk about a 'gap' between Israel and the Diaspora,"" Rabbi Wernick wrote in a letter to the Israeli government. ""It is now a 'canyon.'""

My rabbi in Washington, Daniel Zemel, said in despair during Kol Nidre, the Yom Kippur evening service, this fall: ""For the first time in my life, I feel a genuine threat to my life in Israel. This is not an external threat. It is an internal threat from nationalists and racists.""

He implored his congregation to act before it is too late, to save Israel from itself.

But Israelis want nothing of the sort. American Jews don't serve in the Israeli military, don't pay Israeli taxes and don't live under the threat of Hamas rocket bombardments. And many American Jews would not heed Rabbi Zemel's call.

Zionism divided American Jewry for much of the latter 19th century and the first half of the 20th century. Those divisions remained in the early decades of the Jewish state, fading only with the triumph of the Arab-Israeli War of 1967 and the peril of the Yom Kippur War.

Now many American Jews, especially young American Jews, would say, Israel is Israel's problem. We have our own.

There are roughly 6.5 million Jews in Israel. There are roughly 5.7 million Jews in America. Increasingly, they see the world in starkly different ways.

The Great Schism is upon us.

Berhanu Nega was once one of Bucknell University's most popular professors. An Ethiopian exile with a Ph.D. from the New School for Social Research in Manhattan, he taught one of the economics department's most sought-after electives, African Economic Development. When he wasn't leading seminars or puttering around his comfortable home in a wooded neighborhood five minutes from the Bucknell campus in rural Lewisburg, Pa., Nega traveled abroad for academic conferences and lectured on human rights at the European Parliament in Brussels. ""He was very much concerned with the relationship between democracy and development,"" says John Rickard, an English professor who became one of his close friends. ""He argued that you cannot have viable economic development without democratization, and vice versa."" A gregarious and active figure on campus, he rooted for the Philadelphia Eagles and the Cleveland Cavaliers, campaigned door-to-door for Barack Obama in 2008 and was known as one of the best squash players on the Bucknell faculty. He and his wife, an Ethiopian-born optometrist, raised two sons and sent them to top-ranked colleges, the University of Pennsylvania and Carnegie Mellon. On weekends he sometimes hosted dinners for other Bucknell professors and their families, regaling them with stories about Abyssinian culture and history over Ethiopian food he would prepare himself; he imported the spices from Addis Ababa and made the injera, a spongy sourdough bread made of teff flour, by hand.

Nega remained vague about his past. But students curious enough to Google him would discover that the man who stood before them, outlining development policies in sub-Saharan Africa, was in fact intimately involved in the long-running hostility between Ethiopia and neighboring Eritrea, a conflict that has dragged on for half a century. By the start of the millennium, its newest incarnation, a border war over a patch of seemingly worthless ground just 250 square miles in size, devolved into a tense standoff, with the two nations each massing along the border thousands of troops from both official and unofficial armies. One proxy army fighting on the Eritrean side, a group of disaffected Ethiopians called Ginbot 7, was a force that Nega helped create, founding the movement in 2008 with another Ethiopian exile, Andargachew Tsege, in Washington. The Ethiopian government, which had previously detained Nega as a political prisoner for two years in Addis Ababa, now sentenced him to death in absentia. Bucknell students who did learn about their teacher's past were thrilled. ""It made his classes exciting,"" Rickard says.

In Ginbot 7, Tsege served as the political leader based in Eritrea; Nega was the group's intellectual leader and principal fund-raiser, collecting money from members of the Ethiopian diaspora in Europe and the United States. That all changed one day in June 2014, when Tsege, known to everyone as Andy, made a brief stopover in Sanaa, the capital of Yemen, on his way to Asmara, the capital of Eritrea. As he sat in the airport transit lounge, waiting to board his flight, Yemeni security forces, apparently acting in collusion with Ethiopian intelligence, arrested him and put him on a plane to Addis Ababa, where he was paraded on state television and currently faces a death sentence.

Days after Tsege's arrest and extradition, Nega volunteered to replace him in Eritrea. ""Was I going to remain an academic, sitting in an ivory tower criticizing things?"" he told me. ""Or was I going to do something as an engaged citizen?"" Nega put his house up for sale and took an indefinite leave of absence from the university. It was an extended sabbatical, he told his colleagues. Only a handful of close friends, his wife and his two sons knew the truth.

On a hot July afternoon in 2015, Nega packed a suitcase, bade his wife farewell and was driven by comrades to John F. Kennedy International Airport. He carried a laissez-passer from the Eritrean government, allowing him a one-time entry into the country. Nega was heading for a new life inside a destitute dictatorship sometimes referred to as the North Korea of Africa; the regime was notorious for having supported the Shabab, an Islamist terrorist group in Somalia, and for a military conscription program that condemns many citizens over age 18 to unlimited servitude. Nega also believes he has drawn the scrutiny of the Obama administration and was worried about being stopped and turned around by Homeland Security. It wasn't until the wheels on the EgyptAir jet were up and he was settling into his seat over the Atlantic Ocean, bound for one of the most isolated and repressive nations on Earth, that he was able to relax.

The lights cut out above Nega one chilly night this July, and the rebel chief sat in darkness in a bungalow in Asmara, Eritrea's 7,600-foot-high capital. Nega had spread a map on a coffee table, and he was showing me the route for a clandestine mission that he planned to undertake the following morning. At dawn, he and a comrade would drive 300 miles southwest to the mined, militarized border between Eritrea and Ethiopia to rendezvous with intelligence sources at a rebel base camp. His contacts were smuggling across the border ""highly sensitive information"" about Ethiopian troop positions and about the strength of resistance cells inside Ethiopia, whom Nega was hoping to link up with his own fighters on the Eritrean side of the border.

""They've got documents, and they insist on handing them over only to me,"" Nega told me. ""When there is sensitive material, they first want me to see it and then filter the information to the rest of the organization."" Nega, a burly, balding 58-year-old with a rumpled facade and an appealingly unassuming manner, rubbed his forehead as the lights flickered and then returned. In recent years, Ginbot 7 has grown, and it is now guided by an 80-member council of representatives spread around the world. As commander, Nega oversees several hundred rebel fighters in Eritrea as well as an unknown number of armed members inside Ethiopia who carry out occasional attacks in the movement's name. During his frequent visits to the front lines, he spends his time meeting with fellow commanders, observing training and -- ever the professor -- leading history and democracy seminars using chalk and a blackboard in a ""classroom"" in the bush.

Nega turned back to the map and traced a straight line leading to the Tekeze River, the westernmost border between Ethiopia and Eritrea. The stream was a main crossing point for Ethiopian Army deserters fleeing to the rebels, and in recent weeks it had come under threat from advancing Ethiopian troops. ""They are moving a sizable force into this area, because we are their main target now,"" he said, referring to Ginbot 7, now known as Patriotic Ginbot 7. ""And they are pushing a large part of their army, artillery and tanks into this zone. They haven't started shelling us yet.""

The two nations, now ferocious enemies, were once joined. Eritrea, an Italian colony from 1890 until 1941, was annexed by Ethiopia after World War II; it took a three-decades-long war for the Eritreans to finally liberate themselves, in 1991. The neighbors remained at peace until 1998, when a simmering dispute over the Yirga triangle, a piece of rocky land along the border that had never been clearly demarcated in colonial maps, exploded into two years of tank and trench warfare in which 100,000 died. Today, despite a United Nations-supervised mediation that awarded the disputed territory to Eritrea, Ethiopia continues to occupy the border village Badame. Tens of thousands of troops face each other across a landscape of mines, bunkers, sniper posts and other fortifications.

Violence on the border, while infrequent, can be both sudden and brutal. In mid-June, according to the Eritrean government, Ethiopia launched a full-scale attack along the frontier at Tsorona, the first major incursion since 2012, possibly in retaliation for attacks on its forces by Ginbot 7. Eritrea claimed that it had killed 200 enemy soldiers and wounded 300, though Ethiopia downplayed its losses. ""They almost always deny it,"" Nega told me. ""As far as the Ethiopian government is concerned, nobody ever dies.""

Ethiopia, while an American ally and an economic leader by African standards, is notoriously repressive. The minority Tigrayan regime has jailed hundreds of bloggers, journalists and opposition figures, keeping itself in power by intimidating political opponents, rigging elections and violently putting down protests. Since November of last year, according to Human Rights Watch, state security forces killed more than 400 protesters in the Oromia region, which surrounds Addis Ababa. Protests have recently spread to the Amhara region, as well; in August, security forces shot dead roughly 100 demonstrators and injured hundreds more. Thousands of Oromos, a minority group that makes up about a third of the population, have been jailed without trial on suspicion of supporting the Oromo Liberation Front, a secessionist group. The Ethiopian marathoner Feyisa Lilesa, who won the silver medal at the Olympics this year, drew global attention to the government's abuses when he held his crossed arms over his head at the finish line in solidarity with his fellow Oromos; he says he fears returning home and is seeking political asylum.

Across the room in Nega's bungalow, four fellow rebel commanders, all members of the Ethiopian diaspora, were finishing their supper. The men tore off pieces of injera and dipped the bread into a thick sauce called shiro, washing down the meal with bottles of the local Asmara beer. Esat, an Ethiopian opposition satellite channel broadcast from Europe and the United States, played softly on a television in the corner. The men were part of a revolving contingent of commanders who returned to Asmara from time to time to check their email and escape the primitive conditions in the bush. ""We are five right now,"" Nega said, introducing me to his comrades from Dallas; Arlington, Va.; Calgary, Canada; and Luxembourg. ""Another, from the United Kingdom, is returning here tomorrow morning. We'll be six when he comes. Last week we were eight -- at one point we were 11.""

The house also serves as an infirmary for rebels who become ill or are wounded in combat, and it provides a temporary sanctuary for Ethiopian Army defectors who cross the front lines. One recent arrival was a former Ethiopian Air Force officer, an Oromo who had traveled north 42 hours by bus and on foot, then swum across the Tekeze River to Eritrea. He made the decision to defect while sitting in an Addis Ababa jail cell on ""false charges,"" he told me, of being a member of the Oromo secessionist movement.

""We have many like him,"" Nega said.

Nega put on his jacket to head off in search of diesel fuel for the morning journey to the border. With another rebel comrade from Virginia, we drove down the deserted, lightless streets of Asmara, searching for an open filling station, but the one we found had run out of diesel; Nega would have to return the next morning, delaying his departure for the front lines. When we returned to his home, Nega pointed to a pile of medical supplies in the hallway -- bandages, splints, antibiotics, antimalarials -- that he was planning to ferry to his fighters, and three cardboard boxes packed with solar cells that would provide some rudimentary electricity in the bush. While in the camps, Nega was dependent on his mobile phone for contact with the outside world, but even that was not guaranteed. ""They have shut off phone coverage since the incursion"" by the Ethiopians at Tsorona, he told me. ""I'll be out of touch for days.""

When I first met Nega, in late May 2016, the conditions were decidedly more comfortable. After 10 months in Asmara, Nega had flown back to the United States to attend meetings and the graduation of his younger son, Iyassu, from the University of Pennsylvania. Given his deepening involvement in a rebellion against an American ally, it was possible that this would be the last time he could visit the United States. Indeed, Nega, who is not an American citizen, had his State Department-issued ""travel document"" suspended three years ago, and his application for United States citizenship has been put on indefinite hold. He now travels on an Eritrean passport; together with his green card, it gained him entry into the country -- this time. The State Department would not comment on Nega or Ginbot 7, but Nega surmises that the Obama administration does not look favorably on his activities. Still, he insists, ""nobody is saying, 'Back off.' I think they know that this is not about being against the U.S. We are upholding the basic principles under which the U.S. was established.""

We met over Memorial Day weekend on the terrace of the upscale Café Dupont on Dupont Circle in Washington, joined by his sister Hiwot, who runs a technology start-up in New York, and Iyassu, a 21-year-old former high-school track star who was starting work at a New York investment bank in the fall. Over white wine and chicken salad, the conversation touched on Lin-Manuel Miranda's commencement address and Nega's excitement over crossing paths, after the ceremony, with Donald Trump and Vice President Joe Biden. (Trump's daughter and Biden's granddaughter were members of Iyassu's graduating class.) I asked Iyassu if he had reconciled himself to the idea of his father's new life on the front lines, and he said that he had. ""Ultimately he should continue to pursue what he believes in,"" he told me. He expressed little interest, though, in visiting his father at his Eritrean rebel camp or delving deeper into the raison d'être of the Ginbot 7 movement. ""I just got out of college -- my life has its own direction,"" he said. ""I can't take time off. ... I'm a little bit removed generationally as well.""

The elder Nega is part of a generation of Ethiopians who grew up amid violence and tumult. Over lunch, he recalled what it was like to be a high-school student when a Marxist junta, the Soviet-backed Derg, overthrew Emperor Haile Selassie and ushered in a brutal dictatorship. Nega had grown up privileged, the son of a wealthy entrepreneur, and he watched as his father's vast commercial corn and soybean farms were seized and security forces began arresting, imprisoning and executing thousands of dissidents, including many students. He and his two older sisters joined a resistance movement called the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Party (E.P.R.P.). They went underground, living in safe houses, eluding the police. His eldest sister was later captured and disappeared in the Derg's prisons. His family searched for her everywhere.

""We had people coming to our house and telling my parents, 'I saw her at this place.' My mother used to go out all over looking for her,"" Nega recalls. Her former cellmates later told him that she had died in prison, probably by committing suicide with a cyanide capsule that she wore around her neck. ""It was common to have cyanide with you because if you were caught, you would be tortured and executed, and through torture you might be forced to betray people,"" Nega said. As the crackdown in Addis intensified, the E.P.R.P. sent Nega north to Tigray province, the center of a growing guerrilla war against the Derg; there, he carried out attacks on government forces. In 1978 a power struggle erupted within the E.P.R.P. leadership, and Nega was thrown into prison. He was released one day before guards turned their guns on the remaining prisoners, killing 15. Nega escaped to Sudan, living as a refugee in Khartoum for nearly two years, then obtained political asylum in the United States in 1980.

He earned his bachelor's degree from the State University of New York at New Paltz, where he also played on the soccer team. While studying for his doctorate at the New School for Social Research, he lived in Brooklyn and wrote his dissertation on the failures of Ethiopian agriculture under the Communist regime. Meanwhile, Ethiopia was sliding deeper into calamity. When the guerrilla movements increased their attacks in Tigray in the mid-1980s, the Derg dictator, Mengistu Haile Mariam, blocked food supplies to the region, creating a devastating famine in which one million people died. Photographs of starving children, disseminated by the news media, catalyzed an international relief effort, Live Aid, and inspired the pop hit ""We Are the World,"" making Ethiopia a worldwide synonym for hunger. The famine had wound down, and the rebel war was escalating, when Bucknell hired Nega as an assistant professor in 1990. ""He never trumpeted his background, the fact that he had been a guerrilla fighter,"" says Dean Baker, a former Bucknell colleague who now heads the Center for Economic and Policy Research in Washington.

In 1991, after a decade's struggle, three rebel groups -- the Tigrayan People's Liberation Front, the Oromo Liberation Front and the Eritrean People's Liberation Front -- defeated the Derg and marched into Addis Ababa. The new government, led by the Tigrayan rebel leader Meles Zenawi, set about rebuilding the war-shattered nation. Nega finally had reason for optimism. He knew Meles well -- the prime minister had been in the same university class as his dead sister -- and after the Tigrayans consolidated power, Nega obtained a leave of absence from Bucknell and flew with his wife and two sons, both toddlers, back to Addis, determined to help rebuild the country. Nega believed that Meles ""had good intentions,"" he told me.

But Nega's enthusiasm for the new government wore off quickly. At Addis Ababa University, where he taught part-time (he had also taken over several of his father's businesses), administrators cracked down on dissent, banning the student government and the school newspaper. When Nega encouraged his students to press for academic freedoms, police assaulted them and other demonstrators; later, as unrest spread through the city, they shot 41 people dead. Nega spent a month in jail for abetting the protests. ""At night I was hearing prisoners being tortured, beaten,"" he says.

In May 2005, with the economy growing rapidly and the government's popularity appar­ently high, Ethiopia held elections, the first truly multiparty vote in Ethiopia's history, and invited international observers to attend. But the results were not to Meles's liking. Nega's Coalition for Unity and Democracy won 137 of the 138 seats on the City Council in Addis Ababa. Nega was poised to become mayor, but the government denied his party the victory and jailed him along with other C.U.D. leaders. American colleagues began a campaign to free Nega. ""The Bucknell faculty approved a motion to support him and call attention to his plight,"" Rickard says. ""We talked with journalists, ambassadors, trying to make sure that he stayed on the front burner."" International pressure helped to secure Nega's release after 21 months, and he returned to the United States. The experience ""hardened him,"" says Samuel Adamassu, a member of the Ethio­pian diaspora who has known Nega and his family since the 1980s. ""It made him realize these people are not willing to change without being forced.""

After our lunch in Washington, I attended a fund-raising rally for Ginbot 7 at the Georgetown Marriott, attended by about 500 members of the Ethiopian diaspora. Nega stood before a backdrop of Ethiopian and American flags. It would be a fight to the death, he assured the cheering crowd. ""There is no negotiation with someone who is coming to rape you,"" Nega went on in Amharic, the principal language of Ethiopia. ""We have to stop them."" The contrast between the mild-mannered academic I had met on the patio of the Café Dupont and the fiery rebel leader was striking. Nega announced that he had brought news from the front lines: Guerillas claiming loyalty to his movement had carried out their most significant attack to date, outside the town Arba Minch, in southern Ethiopia, formerly the site of an American drone base. ""We killed 20 soldiers and injured 50 of them,"" he said, calling it ""a new stage in the struggle."" (The Ethiopian government claimed they foiled the attack and killed some of the gunman.)

When Nega helped found the Ginbot 7 movement in 2008, the year he returned to teaching at Bucknell, he explained that the movement would seek to ""organize civil disobedience and help the existing armed movements"" inside and outside Ethiopia and ""put pressure on the government, and the international community, to come to a negotiation."" Yet the Ginbot 7 platform advocated destabilizing the government ""by any means necessary,"" including attacks on soldiers and police. It was a discordant message coming out of a liberal American university whose first class was held in the basement of the First Baptist Church of Lewisburg in 1846. ""It's a line that he has crossed,"" says Rickard, the English professor, who finds Nega's advocacy of violence ""troubling"" but understandable. ""He has never been a pacifist, never renounced armed struggle,"" he says. ""He has seen elections overturned, hundreds of people murdered on the streets. His sister died, and his best friend is in prison, in peril of his life. He sees violence as viable and necessary. It's kind of shocking, in a way.""

While Ginbot 7 started to foment its resistance, Ethiopia was busy rebranding itself as an economic success story. Following South Korean and Chinese models of state-directed development, Meles borrowed from state-owned banks and used Western aid money to invest heavily in dams, airlines, agriculture, education and health care. Ethiopia's economy took off, averaging nearly 11 percent growth per year for the last decade, one of the highest rates in Africa. Addis Ababa became the showpiece of the country's transformation, with a light rail system, ubiquitous high-rise construction and luxury hotels, high-end restaurants and wine bars packed with newly minted millionaires. At the same time, the country was becoming a bulwark against the spread of radical Islam in the Horn of Africa. Today Ethiopia provides 4,400 peacekeepers to an African Union force in Somalia and helps keep the peace along the tense border between North and South Sudan. In July 2015 President Obama, on an African tour, paid the first visit ever to Ethiopia by a sitting American president.

Yet in the classroom and abroad, Nega argued that Ethiopia's transformation was a mirage, created to placate Western observers troubled by the lack of democracy. ""In 2005, it became clear that legitimacy would not come through the political process, so they started this new narrative -- development,"" he told me. Nega insists that Ethiopia has ""cooked the books,"" and that its growth rate is largely attributable to huge infrastructure projects and Western development aid, with little contribution from the private sector. ""The World Bank is throwing money at Ethiopia like there's no tomorrow,"" he told me. The actual growth rate, he insists, is closer to 5 to 6 percent -- per capita income is still among the lowest in the world -- and the weakness of the country's institutions will mean that even this rate cannot be sustained.

Two months before Obama arrived, the government presided over what was widely considered a sham election, in which the ruling party won all 547 seats in Parliament, But Obama, making it clear that security trumped other concerns in the Horn of Africa, stood beside Meles's successor, Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn, and described the government as being ""democratically elected.""

""I was shocked,"" Nega told me. "" I understand the reality of power and why he supports the Ethiopian government, but to say it is 'democratically elected'? I was disgusted.""

Three days after my first meeting with Nega in Asmara, and shortly after he returned from his border rendezvous, we drove in the late afternoon in his white Hilux pickup truck through the landscape of his new life. We passed the run-down and nearly deserted Asmara Palace Hotel, formerly an Intercontinental Hotel, and a large Catholic church that Nega couldn't identify. ""I'm a lousy tourist guide,"" he said apologetically. While in Asmara, he spends most of his time hunkered down either in his residence or at a borrowed office in the center of town -- one of the few places in the city with a high-speed internet connection. Eritrea has the lowest internet penetration in the world, with only about 1 percent of the population online, and this rare broadband connection allows him to catch up regularly on Skype with his sons and his wife. ""I don't think she's very happy about my being here,"" he admitted, shifting uncomfortably. ""We have really stopped talking about it.""

Immediately following its independence in the early 1990s, under the rebel-leader-turned-president Isaias Afwerki, Eritrea was briefly considered one of the hopes of Africa. When I visited the country in 1996, five years after it won its liberation from Ethiopia, the former rebels were starting to revive the wrecked economy -- rebuilding roads, bridges and a railway to the coast, calling on the Eritrean diaspora to invest. But after the border war between 1998 and 2000, Eritrea's leadership turned inward, growing increasingly suspicious of the outside world. Afwerki suppressed dissent, expelled Western journalists and NGOs, turned down foreign aid, nationalized industries and discouraged foreign investment; according to the World Bank, per capita income is about $1,400 a year. In 2009 the United Nations Security Council imposed sanctions on Eritrea, including an arms em­bargo and a travel ban and a freeze on the assets of top Eritrean officials, for providing weapons to the Shabab, the radical Islamist group that has carried out hundreds of terrorist attacks in Somalia and neighboring Kenya. (Eritrea called the allegation ""fabricated lies."") A June 2016 United Nations report accused the Eritrean government of committing ""crimes against human­ity,"" including torture, jailing dissidents and the open-ended military conscription program that the government justifies as preparation against another Ethiopian invasion.

With virtually no investment coming into the country, Asmara has become a city frozen in time. Two donkeys meandered down Harnet Avenue, the capital's main boulevard, stopping to nibble at a patch of grass around a palm tree. As we watched the crowds walk down the tidy avenue lined by an imposing red brick cathedral, a 1930s-era Art Deco movie theater and crumbling Italian bakeries and cappuccino bars, Nega defended his decision to turn to the dictatorship for support.

""Do we really have to discuss the kind of dictatorships that the U.S. sleeps with?"" he asked me. ""Here is a country that was willing to give us sanctuary, a country that had once been part of Ethiopia. I look at any of these people, I talk to them, and they are just like me, they are as Ethiopian as I am. Why should I not get help from them?""

Nega insisted that he saw some positives in the dictatorship. ""This is the only country that says, despite its poverty, 'We are going to chart our own course -- whether you like it or not,' "" he told me. ""They are not corrupt. You see these government officials driving 1980s cars, torn down the middle. I have seen their lives, their houses. There is some element of a David-and-Goliath struggle in this thing."" He called the United Nations report describing crimes against humanity an ""exaggeration."" (A Western diplomat in Asmara I talked to, who asked not to be identified because of the political sensitivities of his position, agreed with Nega's assessment of the report, saying it was based on testimony of refugees in Europe who had ""an interest in depicting their country as badly as possible to justify their status."")

It goes without saying that Nega was reluctant to speak harshly about the nation that was providing his movement with a refuge -- and that could snatch it away at any moment. ""I don't want to butt into their personal issues,"" he said carefully. ""They've always been nice to us."" Out of the public eye, however, the rebel leader can be more critical. ""He holds no illusions about Eritrea,"" says his friend and former Bucknell colleague Dean Baker.

I asked Nega if he was confident that pressure by the rebel groups could bring down the Ethiopian government. Nega believed that momentum was on his side. ""This resistance to the state is coming in every direction now, in all parts of the country,"" he said. He was giving himself ""four or five years"" before he and his rebel forces entered Ethiopia as part of a new democratic dispensation. ""It certainly won't be a decade,"" he told me.

Until that happens, Nega will continue planning and preparing from a precarious and lonely limbo. Back at the bungalow, he led me down the corridor and showed me where he slept: a monastic chamber furnished with a single bed, an armoire and a night table strewn with jars of vitamins and blood-pressure medication. (He lost his medical insurance when he left Bucknell, but still has American insurance coverage through his wife, and he picked up a three-month supply of the medicine on his May trip to the United States.) He retrieved from the freezer a chilled bottle of Absolut and poured two glasses. We sat in the concrete courtyard, beside a clothesline draped with Nega's laundry. The power failed again, casting us into total darkness, then returned a few seconds later. The contrast with his previous life in the States -- cheering for the Lewisburg Green Dragons, his son's high-school track team; vacationing on the beaches of Maryland and North Carolina with his extended family -- could hardly have been more extreme.

""If you like comfort, and that's what drives you, you'll never do this,"" he told me, taking a sip of the ice-cold vodka. ""But sometimes you get really surprised. Once you have a commitment to something, all these things that you thought were normal in your day-to-day life become unnecessary luxuries."""

One seller's quest to compete against the gougers

Evergreen: Every year there is hullabaloo about the rarity of quality Christmas trees, and the inevitable rise in price -- more green for that green, as it goes.

Research: For some perspective, I headed underneath the train tracks on Park Avenue in East Harlem to talk to a third-generation tree seller, Dimitri Gatanas, at his family's store, Urban Garden Center.

Sales are solid this year, Mr. Gatanas said. He had sold 1,200 trees by the start of the week, and had just 250 left (though more were on the way, he promised).

Finding trees to sell is a bit of a scramble, though, and has been for years.

History: The shortage has its roots in the 2008 economic crash.

Because so many people lost their jobs, Mr. Gatanas said, he figured he'd have fewer customers. He bought fewer trees, and tree sellers nationwide did likewise. Growers responded by planting fewer trees.

Rinse and repeat a few times, and here we are.

""It wasn't an environmental disaster,"" he said. ""It was man-made.""

Economics: Mr. Gatanas has been keeping prices steady, though.

As he has for years, he sells a three-foot ""Charlie Brown"" tree for $39.99. Complain about the price if you want, but at the Chelsea Garden Center in Williamsburg, a tabletop tree of that size is $50, an employee there said.

Mr. Gatanas is also holding his own against the sidewalk tree sellers that pop up every December.

""They're either gouging you or undercutting you,"" he complained. Such is the season.

Prominent Democrats oppose gerrymandering in New Jersey by their party

Democratic lawmakers in New Jersey are trying to gerrymander Republicans into a sort of permanent minority status, a controversial maneuver that some national Democrats say is unfair, The Times's Nick Corasaniti reports.

Opponents of the plan include an attorney general under President Barack Obama, Eric H. Holder Jr., and New Jersey's governor, Philip D. Murphy, a Democrat.

One of the main criticisms of New Jersey's plan centers on a mechanism that requires districts to be drawn based on the results of the statewide votes for president, senator and governor in the last decade.

The state has voted about 55 percent Democratic in those elections.

Mr. Holder told The Times:

""The American people want redistricting reforms that help level the playing field so that elections are decided on who has the best ideas, not which party was in charge of drawing the lines. As currently constructed, the proposal in New Jersey fails to live up to those standards.""

A Facebook pop-up, with hot chocolate

My colleague Michael Gold reports:

Facebook, a company you may be familiar with, held a one-day pop-up in a kiosk at Bryant Park on Thursday to teach its users how to manage their privacy settings and control the site's personalized advertising experience.

Also, there was hot chocolate. With f-shaped marshmallows, of course.

The company has been facing scrutiny this year over how it handles user information, and both the cocoa and the privacy tutorials were intended as good-will gestures.

The people who showed up mostly seemed to be enjoying themselves as they chatted with Facebook employees wielding iPads and swiping through the company's privacy pages.

""This is such a smart move,"" a young woman said outside the kiosk.

""Yeah,"" her friend agreed. ""I think they really needed to do this.""

Both women asked not to be identified. When asked why, they cited privacy concerns.

And finally: Is anybody happy? (With Lin-Manuel Miranda)

The guy who made ""Hamilton"" ran around with the comedian Billy Eichner to ask New Yorkers if they're happy.

Many people seemed happy to meet Mr. Miranda.

One woman didn't immediately recognize him. When told who he was, she replied:

""Yeah, I know. I apply like every day on the stupid app to win tickets and I never do, so you're out of sight and out of mind because I'll never ever, ever see that show.""

It's Friday -- keep playing the ""Hamilton"" lottery.

Metropolitan Diary: In step

Dear Diary:

I was walking down East 86th Street on a Saturday afternoon. A middle-age man was strolling along ahead of me.

As I got closer to him, I could hear that he was singing ""Baby Love"" by the Supremes. I stayed behind him for a few paces, chuckling to myself. His voice wasn't bad, I thought.

I quickened my pace. He turned toward me as I began to pass him.

""I need some backup here,"" he said.

Without missing a beat I sang right on cue: ""Baby, baby, baby, baby love, my baby love.""

We smiled at each other.

""You have a nice day now,"" he said.

218,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/18/magazine/27-million-potential-hispanic-votes-but-what-will-they-really-add-up-to.html,"Two weeks after Hillary Clinton accepted the Democratic presidential nomination in Philadelphia, beaming through a hail of gigantic balloons, her campaign's ""Latinos con Hillary"" program began in five cities in Virginia. One of the kickoff parties took place at Todos Supermarket in Prince William County, in a modest white room where about 40 people gathered around three tables draped in cheap blue cloth to hear a speech by Clinton's national Latino-vote director, Lorella Praeli. When she was 2, Praeli, now 28, lost one of her legs in a car accident, but with her crutches, she commanded the room more adroitly than any of the speakers who preceded her, moving among the tables as she rallied her troops. Though the party was advertised on Facebook, most of the men and women in attendance were seasoned Democratic politicians, staff members and volunteers.

""I'm not here to make it pretty,"" Praeli said. ""The work ahead of us, the task and challenge ahead of us for the next what -- 96 days -- is huge."" She ticked through the efforts needed to register and turn out Latinos: knocking on doors, hosting phone-bank parties, convincing friends, haunting markets, teaching Spanish-speakers the how and the when and the where of voting. In her speech, the job sounded herculean. Near the end of her pitch, she asked everyone to stand and feel the energy in the room while they said, in Spanish, ""We will be the difference.""

""I want you to say it and to believe it,"" Praeli instructed. ""I want you to say it and to commit yourself."" She smiled, but these were marching orders. ""If we don't believe it, other people won't believe,"" Praeli said in Spanish. ""If we don't believe it in this room, we won't be the difference in November.""

Latinos have been hearing that they will be the difference for decades. In Spanish-language media this year, the rhetoric around the election has often gone so far as to imply that Latinos will decide the result on their own. Telemundo's election coverage runs under the slogan ""Yo Decido,"" ""I Decide."" The Univision news anchor Jorge Ramos told The Times last year that ""the new rule in American politics is that no one can make it to the White House without the Hispanic vote.""

It's true enough that 800,000 Latinos turn 18 every year, and both parties burn millions of dollars trying to woo Hispanic voters. This year, 27 million will be eligible to vote. But the idea of a fearsome Latino political power remains more myth than reality. Journalists have been writing about the so-called ""sleeping giant"" of Hispanic voters since at least the 1970s, but the fact is that voter turnout among Latinos remains dismal. It can run almost 20 percentage points lower than that of African-Americans and non-Hispanic whites. Exactly the same percentage of eligible Latinos, 48 percent, showed up for Romney versus Obama in 2012 as turned out for Bush versus Dukakis in 1988. While the raw number of Latino ballots cast has tripled since 1998, so has the number of Latino citizens who don't vote. Only once in the past 28 years, during the 1992 match among George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton and Ross Perot that spurred a jump in overall turnout, has Latino turnout exceeded 50 percent. More often than not, ""Yo Decido"" to stay home.

This year, the new spin on the old dream is that Donald Trump will finally shake the giant awake. He opened his campaign last summer by calling Mexican immigrants ""rapists,"" has repeatedly proclaimed that he will build a wall between Mexico and the United States and, until recently, has made the deportation of 11 million undocumented immigrants a cornerstone of his platform. As early as September 2015, Javier Palomarez, the president and chief executive of the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, told Politico: ""I think the greatest thing to ever happen to the Hispanic electorate is a gentleman named Donald Trump. He has crystallized the angst and anger of the Hispanic community."" He added, ""I think we can all rest assured that Hispanics can turn out in record numbers.""

Perhaps. But achieving record turnout for a demographic with a lackluster voting history isn't so simple as watching them take themselves to the polls. In June, Mi Familia Vota and the National Council of La Raza, two nonprofit groups devoted to organizing Latinos, warned that they needed more cash to match their voter registration numbers from 2012. In July, the Pew Research Center noted that ""Hispanic voters lag all registered voters on several measures of engagement"" -- they aren't paying attention to election news as closely as other citizens and they aren't thinking about the election as much. At a conference on the Hispanic vote held in New York City in January, the big unanswered question was ""Why have Latinos never really turned out in force?""

Looking for answers, I spent six months interviewing scores of Latinos in Virginia, a battleground state where the Latino share of the population has more than tripled since 1990. I met with Latino Catholics, Pentecostals and Mormons, with legal residents, citizens and undocumented immigrants. I frequented a church and a community center, soccer fields and a dance club. I lurked around Republican and Democratic events and a skateboard park. I interviewed custodians and construction workers, lawyers and real estate agents, restaurant owners and community organizers, college students and political staffers. In all, I spoke with more than 100 Virginians of various ethnic backgrounds.

For all the energy that activists, especially on the Democratic side, have put into turning out the Latino vote, I met strikingly few Latinos outside the upper-middle class who talked about voting as if it were something they did regularly. The exceptions tended to be people like Lucía Rodriguez, 61, who cleans houses and has voted regularly for more than a decade -- even in 2008 after she and her husband, a custodian, saw all their savings vanish in the mortgage crisis. For years afterward, they scrambled to keep their family afloat, working every available hour. Yet she kept on voting. Why? ""It's a civic duty,"" she said. Rodriguez explained that in Bolivia, where she had been an accountant, she learned the habit of voting because nonvoters could be penalized with fines. In her Mormon church in the United States, she was surrounded by friends who voted. To pass her citizenship test, she had to study American government and learn English. Her voting behavior entailed years of effort and experience. Through all my conversations, I began to fear that the real roots of political engagement, which lie not in quadrennial outreach programs but around dinner tables and in churches and classrooms, are far more absent from Latino life in America than most people understand.

""A person on the fence needs to be activated to turn into a voter,"" Marvin Figueroa, 30, said one humid Friday in July as he stood before a crowd of white-collar professionals at a ""Happy Hour for Hillary."" These borderline voters, he said, often need ""13 touches"" -- calls, door knocks, texts, etc. -- before they would turn out. Figueroa is Clinton's political director for Virginia. His spreadsheets contain not only Latinos but also African-Americans, millennials and Muslims: any constituent group that might be pulled into a pro-Clinton coali­tion. This evening, inside the Arlington home of a defense contractor who turned Democrat after the Tea Party swept into Congress in 2010, the audience was mostly female, mostly Caucasian and only marginally Latino. The doors to the screened-in porch were open; the air-conditioning was off; the margarita machine was on. The Spanish speakers blended into the crowd.

Statistically, the Latinos most likely to cast ballots are almost identical to other reliable American voters. They are over 40. They've lived in the United States for at least 20 years. They are Puerto Ricans and Cuban-Americans with long cultural histories of citizenship. They are college graduates.

The Latinos least likely to vote represent a different demographic slice altogether. They are under 30, single and Mexican-American. Their families earn less than $50,000 a year. They may not have completed high school.

Data capsules like these suggest that the Latino vote is simply hamstrung by the same factors that impede the Election Day turnout of all Americans: poverty, youth, lack of schooling. Political scientists showed long ago that voting goes hand in glove with affluence and education. Generally speaking, the wealthier you are, the more degrees you earn, the more likely you are to turn out. But if these were the only relevant factors, Latino voting would most likely rise naturally over time as more Latinos enrolled in college and as the age of the average American-born Latino increased. (In 2012 their average age was 18.)

Causality unravels, however, when you start picking at the numbers. Take income, for example. While nearly a quarter of Latinos live in poverty, as a group they are slightly better off than African-Americans. Yet in 2012, African-Americans had the highest turnout rates in the nation. They, not Latinos, have arguably been the decisive bloc in our last two presidential contests and in this year's Democratic primary. So poverty alone can't explain the weak Hispanic vote.

Youth and education also prove to be red herrings. Hispanics are America's youngest and least-educated major racial or ethnic group. Nearly a third of foreign-born Latinos never reached ninth grade. Some have never had a day of schooling in their lives. But if age and learning were the decisive catalysts, we would expect to find the highest voter turnout among Asian-Americans, who are our second-oldest and best-educated group. More than half of Asian-Americans hold bachelors degrees. Yet Asian-Americans tend to vote at even lower rates than Latinos. In 2012, 53 percent of their eligible voters did not go to the polls.

So what do Asians and Hispanics, two vastly different groups in terms of age, education and culture, have in common? It's obvious once you look for it: For the past 30 years, most of America's immigrants have arrived from Asia and Latin America. Both groups struggle with English. Roughly a third of Hispanic adults and a 10th of Hispanic children say that they cannot speak English ""very well."" Among Asians, the numbers are similar.

The American political system once efficiently trained immigrants in how to pull electoral levers. For all their flaws, urban political machines like Tammany Hall did an extraordinary job of recruiting poor, undereducated Irish and Italian immigrants, then shepherding their political incorporation into local and national affairs. But immigrants from Latin America and Asia were largely excluded from the old machines, both by laws limiting their naturalization and enfranchisement and by racism. The Voting Rights Act of 1965 was not extended to Hispanics and Asians until 1975. By then most of the urban machines had been dismantled, and the leading edge of our current wave of Asian and Hispanic immigrants began unpacking their bags in Los Angeles, San Francisco, New York, Atlanta and Washington.

The immigrants from Latin America immediately found themselves lumped together under the label ""Hispanic,"" even if they spoke Portuguese or an indigenous language, even if they had no ancestral link to Spain. It's tough to galvanize such a heterogeneous group. The panethnic, multilingual category of ""Hispanic"" is a uniquely American invention, created by congressional legislation in the 1970s. In her book ""Making Hispanics,"" G. Cristina Mora shows how bureaucrats, media executives and political activists built the notion to combine Mexican-Americans, Cuban-Americans, Puerto Ricans and others in census counts and federal programs. The term was always deliberately ambiguous, Mora notes, so that it could accommodate varied origin stories. There are Hispanics who swam the Rio Grande hoping for a living wage, Hispanics who flew business class to enroll in Ivy League schools, Hispanics who disembarked as Cold Warriors in Florida. There are even Hispanics whose families owned land in the Southwest before it was ever part of the United States. (These ""Hispanics"" like to joke that they didn't cross the border; the border crossed them.) Unlike African-Americans, most of whom can trace a connection to slavery, Latinos have no single common history. Trump, Figueroa once told me, ""makes us more Latino"": His threats and insults provoke a unifying sense of indignation.

Sifting thorough the numbers and this complicated history makes the 52 percent of nonvoting Latinos look rather different. The problem isn't their youth, poverty or lack of education. The problem is that when you're poor, young or undereducated, it takes more effort to overcome your immigrant family's low levels of political socialization. For first-generation Americans, politics is often just one more cultural expression that they must decipher on their own. It's rarely a priority. The immigrant parents that I spoke with swam rivers and boarded airplanes to escape violence, to earn money, to educate their children. Learning to play American politics was never on the agenda.

In Virginia, I found that serious political talk was so rare among the American-born children of Spanish-speaking immigrants that they would often ask me questions like ""What is the Tea Party?"" and ""Who is my mayor?"" Alicio Castañeda, a student at George Mason University whose parents are from Mexico, told me that after we had lunch in April, he began reading more news articles and researching deeper into the presidential candidates. He voted on Super Tuesday. His love for the soccer team Manchester United had led him to The Guardian newspaper, which reminded him that it was a big day in America. ""I've always been personally interested in politics,"" he told me, ""but I haven't had anyone to talk to about it.""

Until the 1960s, high schools often taught courses on democracy, civics and government. At the turn of the 21st century, most teenagers received one such class, or none. This drought in civics hurts all Americans, but for Latinos it's devastating. Several studies have found that merely hearing parents chat about politics or watching them cast a ballot improves the odds that a child will later vote as an adult. Yet a national survey directed by Mark Hugo Lopez in 2002 found that young Latinos were the least likely to have discussed politics with their parents. They were also the most likely to believe that voting is ""difficult.""

On Super Tuesday, I glimpsed what was missing among so many of the Latino families I spoke with when I met Kat Heller, a non-Hispanic mother, exiting a polling station with two children. Growing up in Minnesota, Heller had always tagged along with her parents when they voted. Once, when she was about 12, her father took her to watch the ballots being counted. ""I just remember feeling it was really exciting,"" she told me. ""It was seeing history happening. Everyone was waiting breathlessly."" Inside the voting booth on Super Tuesday, Heller put her 3-year-old son on her hip and asked him: ""Which do you think we should vote for?"" His 13 touches had already begun.

Absent Tammany Hall and civics in schools, the work of turning ""new Americans"" into voters often falls to volunteers like Keisy Chavez. Several weekends this summer, Chavez, 45, has stood outside of Todos Supermarket and other locations in Northern Virginia, clipboard in hand, fishing for Latinos who haven't registered to vote. On the Saturday morning that I joined her, she looked surprisingly stylish for the occasion: gold-toned sandals, brilliant white capri pants, fiery nails and a bright orange T-shirt blazoned with the words ""New Virginia Majority."" You could not engineer a better volunteer than Chavez to help turn out the Latino vote. Political appeals, social scientists have found, work best when delivered by co-ethnics. Chavez meets other requirements as well: She's bilingual, outgoing and frank.

A good rate for voter registration is two new registrations an hour. Chavez and her colleague hit the mark with four new registrations between them (the colleague waited for Chavez every time someone's dominant language was Spanish). Still, most passers-by ignored them. One 20-something with jet black hair who did stop told Chavez, in Spanish, that he was a citizen but not registered. She tried to reel him in.

""O.K.,"" she responded with a smile, ""what is the problem?""

He said that he would come back to register next week, that she should give him her phone number.

""What happens if you don't come next week?"" she asked him.

""I promise you.""

""You know what happens,"" she said. ""If you don't do it now, four more years will go by, and you won't vote.""

Back and forth they went for several minutes. Finally, seeing that Chavez wouldn't give him her number, the man walked away without registering. Winning votes, Lola Quintela of the Fairfax County Democratic Committee told me, is ""trabajo de hormiga"" -- ants' work, performed grain by grain.

The political scientist Lisa García Bedolla proposed a different method in a 2005 paper for The Harvard Journal of Hispanic Policy. Because political engagement is strongly influenced by social ties, she argues, Latinos should improve their participation by politicizing their existing social networks. (She also pushes for civics in schools.) Several of the Latinos I met seemed to vote only because they were connected to a political junkie. Manuel Fernandez, 25, a Mexican-American born in New York State, prefers rebuilding and drifting cars to reading politics, but he has voted in local and presidential elections since he turned 18 because his father, Guadencio, a businessman, persuaded him to register to vote and tells him when and how to cast his ballots. ""Dad is really into it,"" he said. ""Whenever my dad says it's voting time, we go vote.""

The Clinton campaign is splitting its strategy between the tactics. After analyzing which programs worked best during the primaries, Praeli began pushing an expansion of Nevada's bilingual Mujeres in Politics program in battleground and ""expansion"" states across the country. Mujeres in Politics marshals Latinas for the ant work of canvassing and phone banking, but it also relies on social ties to deepen the campaign's reach into Latino communities. Each Latina who participates is tasked with the responsibility of drawing in five more Latina volunteers.

""The theory for us was if you target Latinas and then you have Latinas talk to other Latinas, they're the best communicators to do that,"" Praeli told me. ""We see them as the C.E.O.s of their family and their communities. Part of my program description is you need to know that bodega with the highest foot traffic or the church secretary that can give you access to a faith community or who are the comadres in the neighborhood that have the largest influence. All you have to do is talk to a Latina to really understand that."" Of course, it doesn't hurt that Latinas have voted in higher numbers than Latinos or that they were a key base for Clinton in the primaries.

Chavez herself was lured into politics by a Latina friend. For years after she settled in Virginia from Peru, she earned money washing dishes, waitressing, cleaning bathrooms, cleaning offices, ""cleaning anything,"" she says. At one point she held three jobs: a full-time job, a part-time job and a weekend job cleaning the airport at night. In 1996, she earned her real estate license. Then in 2009, after a friend asked her to walk with Terry McAuliffe in a parade, she was so smitten by his concern for Latinos that she decided to volunteer for his campaign for governor. For Chavez, the experience was intoxicating: ""I was like, 'Whoa, I did not know any of this existed.' "" She has volunteered for Virginia Democrats every year since then. Election season feels like a party to her. ""I have the best time,"" she told me. When Praeli spoke at the ""Latinos con Hillary"" event at Todos, Chavez was there, dressed head to toenails in blue.

The widespread assumption has been that rising numbers of Hispanic citizens will turn Virginia and other states in the South permanently Democratic. Certainly, with each election since 2001, Virginia Democrats have expanded their network of experienced Latino staff members and volunteers. Praeli and Figueroa's work depends on these veterans, a fact that Clinton tacitly acknowledged before Figueroa was even hired. On June 11, five days after The Associated Press called the Democratic primary for Hillary Clinton, the former president Bill Clinton held a closed-door round table in Arlington with about 20 key Latino leaders from all over the state. He, like Praeli after him, was rallying troops.

But Latinos aren't natural Democrats, any more than they are natural Republicans. In 1984, Ronald Reagan won the presidency with nearly half their vote in California. In 2004, George W. Bush won a second term with 40 percent of the national Latino vote, setting off panic in Democratic circles. And even in 2012, 33 percent of the Latino vote in Virginia went to Mitt Romney. He also took 39 percent of the Latino vote in Florida and 42 percent in Ohio.

From the beginning, Latino voters have been up for grabs. The national electoral bloc that we now call the Hispanic vote was created by middle- and upper-class Mexican-American Democrats who wanted more clout in government and politics. According to the historian Ignacio M. García's book on the subject, they organized ""Viva Kennedy"" clubs in Texas, California, New Mexico, Indiana, Illinois and elsewhere. Working together under an absurd logo of John Kennedy riding a grinning burro, these grass-roots clubs turned out thousands of Spanish speakers in delegate-rich states, helping Kennedy squeak into the White House by a margin of less than 1 percent of the popular vote. But Republicans pushed the strategy further: In ""Making Hispanics,"" Mora shows how members of Richard Nixon's 1972 re-election campaign, who nicknamed themselves the ""Brown Mafia,"" ran Spanish-language ads on radio and television. They crafted three distinct campaigns to bring in not just Mexican-Americans but also Puerto Ricans and Cuban-Americans. With their help, Nixon was re-elected by a landslide, taking about 35 percent of what was then known as the ""Spanish speaking"" vote. The real loss for Republicans since President George W. Bush left office is that their candidates have frittered away the affections that he and Reagan earned among Latinos.

Many conservative Hispanics I spoke with in Virginia told me that they don't fit neatly into either party. They would prefer a candidate who legalizes undocumented immigrants, outlaws abortion, makes college education free, wipes out drugs and gangs, rolls back the legal right to gay marriage, supports small-business credits and raises the minimum wage. Immigration reform might be a distinguishing concern for Latinos, but a recent report from Pew found that, as in previous presidential contests, it is not the top issue for Latino voters. More Latino voters say that the economy, health care and terrorism are very important.

Several of the Catholic Latinos I met said that abortion laws were their top priority. ""If we can close that one clinic,"" Iris Chavez told me with a sparkle in her eye, referring to a Planned Parenthood-like women's clinic that was once located in Manassas, ""we can set fire to the nation."" Chavez, 26, was brought into the United States illegally from El Salvador when she was 11 and was protected by Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, which Obama created in 2012 for undocumented millennials who came to the United States as children. She works part-time as a secretary at All Saints Catholic Church, where so many Latinos attend the Sunday afternoon, Spanish-language Mass that they spill from the pews to stand three to four deep against the walls. She doesn't much like Donald Trump, she told me, but if she could vote, she would vote for him based on her belief that abortion is murder.

Chavez is the kind of Latino that Nixon's ""Brown Mafia"" was after -- the same kind that Reagan tried to embrace with his 1986 amnesty, which legalized 2.7 million Hispanics who had no criminal history, and the kind that Reince Priebus had hoped the Republican National Committee's 2012 election autopsy would provoke Republicans to seek again. If the party had followed George W. Bush's lead, Todos Supermarket might have become a site for G.O.P. events. Carlos Castro, its owner, considered himself ""almost 100 percent Republican"" until 2007, when the Republicans of Prince William County championed an anti-Hispanic ""Immigration Resolution,"" and he began to reconsider. He's now an independent. Other conservatives in the county told me that they would keep their votes out of everybody's reach until a candidate arrives whom they can fully support.

The specter of Trump has roused many Latinos to change their minds about registering; spikes have been documented in North Carolina and Georgia. In California, the rise in registrations early this year was almost double what it was during the same period in 2012. Jairo Castillo, a Nicaraguan-American construction worker in Virginia, complained to me in April that the vote ""doesn't count,"" but after Trump secured the Republican nomination in June, he registered to vote for the first time.

Even if a ""Trump effect"" among Latinos this year does help put Clinton in the White House, will those new voters stay engaged? History suggests they might not. According to the political scientists Matt Barreto and Gary M. Segura, more than a million Latinos in California registered to vote for the first time in the years after the state passed Proposition 187, a 1994 ballot initiative. Prop. 187 prohibited undocumented immigrants from state-funded institutions, like schools, and required police officers to report their arrests to federal immigration authorities. In a statewide election, the initiative passed with 59 percent of the vote. Pete Wilson, the Republican governor who had championed the measure, won re-election that same fall. Prop. 187 was soon tied up in federal court, which ruled many of its elements unconstitutional, but California's electorate soon went on to pass a ban on affirmative action (Prop. 209) and a reduction in bilingual education (Prop. 227). Both measures were widely regarded as anti-Hispanic.

Prop. 187 and its cousins had notoriously partisan effects in California. In a paper published in The American Journal of Political Science in 2006, the political scientists Shaun Bowler, Stephen P. Nicholson and Segura found that before 1994 Latinos split their votes almost equally between the two parties. By contrast, after the passage of these propositions, the probability that a Latino would identify as Republican fell by more than two-thirds, erasing all the gains that Republicans made since Ronald Reagan's 1980 campaign. Data also revealed that the propositions moved many non-Hispanic whites in California into the Democratic column. Attacking undocumented immigrants and Latinos had provoked a white backlash against Republicans that mirrors the disaffection that Trump's nomination has stirred among many party moderates this season.

But as time went on, Prop. 187's effect on Latino turnout revealed itself to be not a turning point but a blip. Last September, The Los Angeles Times noted that only 17 percent of eligible California Latinos voted in 2014. Turnout was similar among Asian-Americans, while all other racial and ethnic groups combined voted more than twice as much. ""By all accounts, the Central Valley is a place where Latino candidates should win elections,"" the reporter Kate Linthicum noted. ""Yet Latino candidates' election losses have piled up here in recent years -- in large part because Latinos aren't turning out to vote.""

Among those defeated in 2014 was Amanda Renteria, now the national political director for Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign. Renteria ran for Congress in a Central Valley district that was 74 percent Hispanic. She grew up in the Central Valley and taught math at her old high school in Woodlake before attending Harvard Business School and becoming the first Latina chief of staff in the history of the Senate. She lost her 2014 bid for Congress by 17 points. If Latinos had turned out for her at the levels that African-Americans turned out for Obama, it's possible that today she would sit in Congress.

This March, the Public Policy Institute of California released a report that detailed the gulf that has opened up in California politics since the Prop. 187 surge. ""Voters in California,"" it noted, ""tend to be older, white, college educated, affluent and homeowners. They also tend to identify themselves as 'haves' -- rather than 'have-nots' -- when asked to choose between these two economic categories. Nonvoters tend to be younger, Latino, renters, less affluent and less likely to be college educated than likely voters -- and they generally identify themselves as have-nots.""

California may be a majority-minority state in terms of its population, the report observed, but its electorate is not: 60 percent of its likely voters are white, while only 18 percent are Latino. It would be naïve, however, to expect Democrats to throw themselves wholeheartedly into the project of turning out the state's Hispanics given that they already control solid majorities in California's State Assembly and State Senate.

""We have to be honest,"" María Teresa Kumar, the president and co-founder of Voto Latino, a nonpartisan organization, told me last fall. ""When it comes to voter registration, each party is looking to the Latino community and the African-American community for enough votes. They don't need us all."" From her office in Washington, she directs efforts to engage young Latinos who are often navigating the political system for their families. ""Our job,"" Kumar said, ""is to do true political empowerment: It's mass mobilization and mass participation. And for parties, it's about how little do they need to spend to get over the top.""

If Virginia's battleground status suggests a triumph of the Latino vote, it also provides a cautionary tale about its limitations. In early August, Senator Tim Kaine, Hillary Clinton's running mate, appeared in the green-and-yellow gymnasium of Huguenot High School in Richmond. ""Yes, we Kaine!"" the crowd shouted under the floodlights. His homecoming rally doubled as a history lesson. Kaine pointed out that Virginia had gone 170 years without a president or vice-president. When he moved to Virginia in 1984, he said, neither Republicans nor Democrats bothered to campaign in the state, a situation that he attributed to a conservative lock on power that depended upon marginalizing women and minorities. ""We pushed you away from the table,"" he said. But since Barack Obama turned Virginia into a battleground, it has become a campaign stop for every would-be president. ""It's much better to live in state where no one can take you for granted,"" Kaine said.

The shift that brought volunteers like Keisy Chavez to the Democratic table actually began long before Obama. When Mark Warner was elected governor in 2001, his campaign strategy relied on winning rural, Nascar-loving Republicans, not on including minorities. But Kaine's own gubernatorial victory in 2005 used an urban-suburban strategy that relied upon the participation of Northern Virginia's fast-growing, multiethnic communities. Given Kaine's experiences arguing civil rights cases and his work as a missionary in Honduras, the shift may have reflected personal affinities. It was also a canny response to Virginia's changing demographics. According to the University of Virginia's Demographics Research Group, in 1970 only one in 100 Virginians were born outside of the United States. By 2012, that ratio had increased to one in nine. Such demographic transformations are hardly unique to the state. Between 1990 and 2008, the number of Latinos living in Arkansas, Alabama, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee grew by 602 percent, prompting political scientists to dub the region the ""Nuevo South."" ""If you put your faith in the Virginia voter,"" Kaine recalled telling the candidate Obama in 2008, ""You're going to win Virginia.""

Yet the majority of Virginia's General Assembly is still Republican, and only two of its state-level representatives, the delegates Alfonso Lopez and Jason Miyares, are Latino. Harry Wiggins, the chairman of Prince William County's Democratic Committee, described the problem like this: ""We win the presidential. We won for Mark Warner. We won for Tim Kaine. We won for Terry McAuliffe. Yet the county board we lose, because they have off-year elections, and we have very light turnout.""

Figueroa is already preparing for the inevitable drop. ""The numbers are going to plummet next year in places that count, like Prince William,"" he told me. In 2015, the Census Bureau weighed Prince William County at 22.3 percent Latino, 21.8 percent African-American and 8.7 percent Asian. The chairman of its board of supervisors, however, is Corey Stewart, a Republican, who is also chairman of Donald Trump's campaign in the state. ""When he is president and I am governor, you're going to see one helluva tag team in Virginia, and we're finally going to remove illegal immigrants,"" Stewart told The Richmond Times-Dispatch in June. The gubernatorial race will occur next year, when no other state in the country except New Jersey will be holding elections.

While Kaine spoke, Figueroa stood near the press box, tapping at his phone and taking in the scene. In the days leading up to the rally, he mentioned several times that he was working to make the event ""blacker and browner."" His handiwork was evident in the V.I.P. bleachers directly in front of the television cameras, where a group of people sat, many of them wearing the unmistakable bright blue-and-white jerseys of El Salvador's national soccer team. They were students, parents and teachers associated with the English-as-a-second-language program at Huguenot High School and its International Club. Their V.I.P. seating had come from Figueroa. Their homemade red, white and blue sign ""Juntos Se Puede!"" (""Together we can!"") gave Kaine a camera-ready opportunity that he seized, pointing to them and leading a round of ""Sí se puede!"" -- a chant that will always have special resonance for those who know that it originated not in 2008 with Obama but with Cesar Chavez and Dolores Huerta in 1972.

After Kaine finished his speech, as ""Shake It Off"" blasted through the gym, several of these students joined the throng vying for an opportunity to snap a selfie with him. I asked two of them what they knew about Kaine. ""He was mayor of Virginia,"" one said. The other added that he had lived in Honduras and was a friend of Latinos. That was all that they seemed to know. Two parents I spoke with told me, in Spanish, that they understood only pieces of Kaine's speech, which was in English. This explained why one father appeared so poker-faced through much of the rally. Unless his son translated the speeches for him, he couldn't form an opinion. He didn't understand what was being said."
219,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2017/01/25/opinion/the-real-cost-of-mr-trumps-wall.html,"President Trump on Wednesday unveiled the first proposals to make good on his promise to make America impenetrable to unauthorized immigrants and intolerable for those who are already here.

As expected, he promised to begin building a wall along the Mexican border, an enterprise that is far from certain because Congress would have to approve billions of dollars in funding. He also outlined a series of ominous regulatory changes aimed at drastically expanding the detention of immigrants who enter without permission. He is also seeking to turn more local police and corrections officials into enforcers of immigration law, while threatening to withhold funding from jurisdictions that have sensibly refused to assume that role.

The steps outlined in two executive orders set the stage for incarcerating thousands of immigrants who do not represent a threat, for widespread civil rights violations and for racial profiling. At the Department of Homeland Security on Wednesday, Mr. Trump said that immigration laws ""will be enforced and enforced strongly.""

Mr. Trump's anti-immigrant talk worked well on the campaign trail, as he convinced struggling Americans that foreigners were to blame for lost jobs and blighted communities. To carry out his promise of ramped-up immigration enforcement and border security, he will need to convince Congress and American taxpayers that spending billions to execute his plan is a worthy investment.

As is so often the case with Mr. Trump, the facts are not on his side. Illegal immigration to the United States has been on a downward trend in recent years, even as spending on border security has soared. Between 1983 and 2006, an average of 1.2 million people a year were apprehended trying to enter the country unlawfully. In 2016, just over 415,000 were caught trying to enter; most were Central Americans fleeing violence and poverty. Meanwhile, border security funding has increased from $263 million in 1990 to $3.8 billion in 2015.

Mr. Trump would add significantly to that spending. He has insisted that Mexico will ultimately pay for the wall -- a vow that is either deceitful or delusional. Mr. Trump ordered federal agencies to tally the foreign aid Mexico receives from the United States, which seems like a threat to withhold future assistance for initiatives such as narcotics enforcement and judicial programs.

Even if Mr. Trump was to cut off aid to Mexico, the savings would be modest; it got roughly $142 million in 2016, which doesn't begin to pay for a wall along the 1,989-mile border. Besides costing billions, the type of barrier Mr. Trump has proposed would cause severe environmental damage and lead to lawsuits over private land.

The executive orders do not address the fate of hundreds of thousands of young immigrants brought to the country as children who were given a temporary reprieve from deportation by the Obama administration.

While Mr. Trump has the authority to order the detention of all immigrants apprehended while entering without permission and end the practice of releasing them pending court dates -- which the executive order appears to call for -- Congress should withhold the funding needed to carry out this plan. Leaders in so-called sanctuary cities, like New York and Los Angeles, have rightly recognized that immigrants, including those here without permission, are more of an asset than a burden. Their defiance is likely now to be tested by renewed calls to turn local police officers into immigration enforcers. The courage of local leaders may help stymie Mr. Trump's misguided approach."
220,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/14/us/politics/steel-companies-trump.html,"WASHINGTON -- President Trump has latched on to the idea of using steel to build his wall along the southern border, praising himself for fulfilling two campaign promises at once: keeping out illegal immigrants and resuscitating a fledgling industry.

""They were doing very poorly when I took office, and now they're doing very well,"" Mr. Trump said of American steel makers before boarding Marine One earlier this month. ""Our steel industry was dying, and now it's very vibrant.""

But in the 10 months since the Trump administration imposed 25 percent tariffs on steel imports, prices in the United States have now fallen back to levels last seen before the tariffs were announced on March 1.

Hiring in the steel sector remains stagnant, in part because new mills have become more reliant on automation. Even with the opening and restarting of several mills last year, direct steel industry employment was 146,300 as of last November -- 4 percent lower than it was four years ago, according to the American Iron and Steel Institute. Industry analysts estimate that steel companies made about 50 announcements of plans for new mills and investments last year and about three dozen plants were built or restarted.

Investors are increasingly wary about the industry's long-term strength. Stock prices for some of the nation's biggest steel manufacturers dropped by as much as 47 percent in 2018 amid fears of slowing global economic growth and the potential for Mr. Trump to reach trade deals that remove the tariffs.

""We fully expect the players in the steel supply chain to have weaker years in 2019,"" said Philip Gibbs, a metals analyst at KeyBanc in Ohio.

The Trump administration imposed sweeping steel and aluminum tariffs on trading partners like Europe, Canada, Japan and Mexico, saying it was trying to protect American security by preventing a flood of cheap metals into the United States. The tariffs, which went fully into effect in June, initially goosed steel prices in the United States, which jumped more than 50 percent after it became clear that the tariffs would really be implemented.

Mr. Trump has routinely pointed to the rising prices as a boon to American steel companies. But the price spike ultimately hurt demand as industries that rely on the metal, like automakers and homebuilders, struggled to absorb the rising costs or passed them on to customers.

Caterpillar, the farm equipment manufacturer, said last year it would face $200 million in additional costs because of the steel tariffs. General Motors slashed its profits forecast for 2018 because of higher steel costs. Many businesses chose alternative materials or delayed investments, putting pressure on steel prices, which have since fallen.

According to S&P Global Platts, prices for American-made hot-rolled coil steel, the industry benchmark, jumped 41 percent in the first half of 2018 and then fell about 21 percent from that peak in the second half of the year. That trend is likely to continue this year.

""Steel prices remain under pressure to begin 2019,"" said Michael Fitzgerald, a metals pricing specialist at S&P Global Platts. ""Typical seasonal improvements following the slower holiday period are yet to take hold as domestic steel buyers no longer fear a supply crunch.""

American businesses and trade groups have repeatedly urged the Trump administration to remove the tariffs, arguing they hurt domestic companies, not competitors, and will ultimately undercut economic growth.

""Tariffs are taxes paid for by American families and American businesses -- not foreigners,"" said Thomas J. Donohue, the president of the U.S. Chamber of Commerce.

American steel makers are feeling the pressure. Despite strong earnings in 2018, the stock prices of steel companies have been in a deep slump as investors fret that they are being propped up by government support that will be temporary. In the last year, shares of AK Steel are down 56 percent, US Steel is down 46 percent, Steel Dynamics is down 29 percent and Nucor's stock is down 18 percent.

John J. Ferriola, the chief executive of Nucor, said that the falling stock price is head-scratching because he believes that the industry is on solid footing. While Mr. Trump's tariffs have provided a ""tailwind,"" a strong economy, tax cuts and anti-dumping measures put in place by the Obama administration have revived the steel industry, Mr. Ferriola said.

""There's a lot of doomsday talk about the tariffs and a lot of misinformation,"" Mr. Ferriola said in an interview. ""I keep hearing about how it is driving down demand and putting our customers out of business. We had a record year last year and many of our customers also had a record year.""

Nucor announced last week that it plans to build a $1.35 billion steel plant in the Midwest. However, trade experts and steel analysts worry the additional capacity could drive down steel prices even further and question whether such projects will eventually be scrapped if the economy cools.

A key for the industry will be improving efficiency while the insulation from the tariffs remains.

""Historically the U.S. steel industry has received a tremendous amount of trade protection over the last 40 years in different forms,"" said Chad Bown, a senior fellow at the Peterson Institute for International Economics. ""The issue is that during the periods that they do receive protection, they don't historically tend to invest in becoming more efficient and more competitive.""

In the near term, the steel industry's best hopes for a meaningful lift would be Mr. Trump and Congress joining forces on a major infrastructure legislation that would keep America's steel mills churning.

With such movement unlikely amid partisan gridlock in Washington, some are hanging their hopes on the possibility of a border wall built with steel slats or, as Mr. Trump recently suggested, ""steel that has concrete inside."" According to an analysis conducted by AISI, the industry's lobbying group, an all-steel barrier along the border could consume as much as three million tons of steel.

""If they decide to build a barrier and decide to make it out of steel, the industry stands ready and capable and more than able to provide the steel and assist in the construction,"" Mr. Ferriola said."
221,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/06/business/economy/donald-trump-economic-team.html,"Donald J. Trump may rail against Wall Street and business elites at his campaign rallies, but that has not stopped him from turning to many of them for economic advice. On Friday, Mr. Trump announced his economic team, just days before he is expected to give a speech in Detroit on Monday about what he would do to improve American growth.

The 13-member team -- all men -- includes several billionaire bankers and investment managers, and even a part-time professional poker player. Many have been in business with Mr. Trump before. Having such moguls on the team not only expands Mr. Trump's network of Wall Street donors and contacts, but may also reassure the financial community that it need not be too alarmed by some of the candidate's populist oratory. Even so, several of those named often have expressed views against the economic mainstream, voicing suspicions about the Federal Reserve and global trade deals.

""They certainly can provide many useful insights, assuming Trump is willing to listen to them - it's just I would like to see more diversity in terms of expertise and background,"" said James Pethokoukis, a commentator at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. He noted that the group was heavily weighted toward developers, hedge fund managers and bankers, with hardly any representatives from Silicon Valley or academia. ""I'm not sure how well the expertise on that list really matches up with some of the challenges facing the American economy.""

Kevin A. Hassett, an economist at the American Enterprise Institute, was also surprised at how few economists were selected. ""Most campaigns tend to balance academics with business folks, like those on this list,"" he said. As for whether the advisers will wield much influence, Mr. Hassett said, ""It is pretty common for campaigns to have a long list of well-known business leaders who act as 'advisers,' but there is a large variation in how active they really are.""

The team will be led by Stephen Miller, the national director of policy for the campaign, and Dan Kowalski, the deputy director. Members are:

John A. Paulson

President and chief executive of the investment firm Paulson & Co.

Mr. Paulson made billions of dollars by betting on the housing market's collapse, right before the financial crisis, and has long been an advocate of relying on gold as a guide to monetary policy.

222,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/06/business/economy/jobs-report-unemployment-wages.html,"The American jobs machine has moved back into high gear.

After a long stretch of conflicting reports, the Labor Department said on Friday that the economy in July delivered a second consecutive month of robust hiring and rising wages in a signal that the expansion is strengthening, not ebbing, as it enters its eighth year.

Stocks surged, experts expressed more confidence that the Federal Reserve was likely to raise interest rates before the end of the year, and it was clear that long-stagnant wages for ordinary workers were advancing at a healthier pace.

""This was everything you could have asked for, maybe more,"" said Michelle Meyer, head of United States economics at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. ""We're seeing new entrants into the labor market, which implies a longer runway for the business cycle.""

With the political conventions completed, the buoyant jobs numbers also have major implications for the presidential campaigns of Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump.

Not only does the new data undercut Republican arguments that the recovery is faltering, it also suggests that after years of paltry gains, deeply frustrated workers are finally seeing some benefits from the drop in unemployment, which was unchanged last month at a relatively low 4.9 percent.

Wages are up 2.6 percent over the last 12 months, a faster pace than earlier in the recovery, and many economists expect that the gain in incomes, adjusted for inflation, will accelerate later this year and into 2017.

""The idea that Republicans are touting, that the job market is a wreck, is clearly belied by the data,"" said Jared Bernstein, an economist who served in the Obama administration. ""What matters most to people isn't G.D.P. growth, it's jobs and wages.""

Longtime G.O.P. economic hands like Wayne Berman, a veteran of several Republican presidential campaigns, conceded Friday's data was favorable for Democrats, but insisted it represented a snapshot of the economy, not necessarily the underlying trends. A major failing in the recovery, Republicans note, is that millions of Americans who dropped out of the work force during the recession have still not found jobs.

July's jobs number ""is a good statistic for Clinton to pivot towards,"" said Mr. Berman, who currently serves as a top official at the Blackstone Group and advised Senator Marco Rubio of Florida during the Republican primary. He noted, however, that the economy grew at an annual rate of just 1 percent in the first half of 2016, a sharp decrease from last year.

""We're in a very mixed economic picture now,"" said Mr. Berman, recalling the presidential campaign of Senator Bob Dole two decades ago, when attacks on Bill Clinton's economic record failed to resonate at a time of rising prosperity. ""You can't say this is like 1996, when there was no oxygen for Bob Dole's arguments.""

The July increase in payrolls stands in sharp contrast to data released just last week showing disappointing economic growth in April, May and June.

A reason for the difference is that parts of the economy are still suffering from the continuing fallout from low oil prices as energy companies cut back on investment. Government spending also has been weak and many companies, at least for now, prefer to hire more workers rather than invest in new equipment and increase their efficiency and output.

If business and government investment continue to lag, that could undermine the long-term ability of the American economy to be more productive and raise living standards for most workers.

In late spring, the government reported that job creation in May was much weaker than economists had expected; a big rebound in June similarly caught the experts off guard. The July data helps clear up some of the confusion.

""This is a validator,"" said Michael Gapen, chief United States economist at Barclays. ""This is a report that indicates that the slowdown in hiring earlier in the year has been reversed.""

June's gain was revised upward by 5,000 jobs, and May's by 13,000. The combination of better gains in the spring and July's increase in hiring means that the Federal Reserve is likely to have a more vigorous debate about raising interest rates when it meets in September. But most experts think the Fed will wait until December to be sure the economy remains on a solid track.

The Fed said in July, after the most recent meeting of its policy-making committee, that the economy was growing more strongly and there were fewer clouds on the horizon, suggesting it was giving greater consideration to rate increases later this year.

But on the policy-making front, William C. Dudley, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and an influential adviser to Janet L. Yellen, the Fed's chairwoman, said on Sunday that current economic conditions still called for ""caution in raising U.S. short-term interest rates.""

Job openings are spreading. ""It's been a really good summer for hiring all across the country,"" said Tom Gimbel, chief executive of LaSalle Network, a recruiting and staffing firm based in Chicago. ""Business has been great. Kids coming out of college are getting hired, and we're seeing a lot of activity in the $50,000 to $150,000 category.""

The upswing in jobs last month also coincided with a sharp drop in unemployment among the least-educated workers, a group that has missed out on nearly all the gains of the current recovery thus far.

Other measures of the labor market suggest that underlying joblessness is higher than the official 4.9 percent rate, although nowhere near the 42 percent level Mr. Trump suggested last fall.

The broadest measure of unemployment calculated by the Labor Department, which includes workers who want full-time positions but cannot find them, stood at 9.7 percent in July.

To arrive at his figure, Mr. Trump apparently compared the total civilian population aged 16 and up -- about 253.6 million people -- with the 102 million Americans who are not in the labor force, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data.

But in addition to the 7.7 million currently counted as unemployed, that larger figure includes more than 50 million Americans above the age of 55 who say they don't want to work and are, for the most part, retired. It also takes into account 13.5 million Americans age 16 to 24, most of them in school, and millions of women who have chosen to stay home to care for their young children. None of those people are considered unemployed by the Labor Department.

The payroll figures, which reflect hiring at companies and in the public sector, revealed broad-based job gains, not just in lower-paid sectors like retail and leisure and hospitality, but in high-paying fields like professional and business services as well.

The household survey, which has offered a mixed picture in the past, was also robust.

The jobless rate for high school dropouts, which has been elevated throughout the recovery, fell more than a full percentage point to 6.3 percent, suggesting that employers who had previously ignored these lower-skilled workers are now taking a second look.

As the unemployment rate has fallen, some employers have raised salaries to retain their best workers and attract new ones. Increases in the minimum wage in many states recently, and increases in the lowest-tier salaries by big employers like Walmart, Target and Aetna, are also beginning to ripple through the broader work force.

But a two-tier job market remains in place, with workers in the same region facing radically different conditions depending on their level of education and skills.

In San Francisco, even the most junior software engineers hired at Sunverge, a maker of energy storage systems for solar electricity users, command starting salaries of just over $100,000.

A little more than 60 miles to the east, at Sunverge's assembly plant in Stockton, Calif., where the unemployment rate is 9 percent, new blue-collar workers can expect to earn about $14 an hour, or $29,000 a year.

Sunverge is bulking up in both cities. But hiring technical talent is much more time-consuming, said Stu Statman, Sunverge's chief of engineering.

""It doesn't seem like it's that hard to find good factory workers in Stockton,"" Mr. Statman said. ""In San Francisco, if you're talking about software engineers or developers, it's very hard. It takes a long time, and there's a huge amount of hunger out there for people with these skills."""
223,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/29/opinion/the-democrats-win-the-summer.html,"PHILADELPHIA -- Donald Trump has found an ingenious way to save the Democratic Party. Basically, he's abandoned the great patriotic themes that used to fire up the G.O.P. and he's allowed the Democrats to seize that ground. If you visited the two conventions this year you would have come away thinking that the Democrats are the more patriotic of the two parties -- and the more culturally conservative.

Trump has abandoned the Judeo-Christian aspirations that have always represented America's highest moral ideals: toward love, charity, humility, goodness, faith, temperance and gentleness.

He left the ground open for Joe Biden to remind us that decent people don't enjoy firing other human beings.

Trump has abandoned the basic modesty code that has always ennobled the American middle class: Don't brag, don't let your life be defined by gilded luxuries.

He left the ground open for the Democrats to seize middle-class values with one quick passage in a Tim Kaine video -- about a guy who goes to the same church where he was married, who taught carpentry as a Christian missionary in Honduras, who has lived in the same house for the last 24 years.

Hillary Clinton's Convention: Day 4

Arguments, provocations and observations from Times Opinion writers.

July 28, 2016

Trump has also abandoned the American ideal of popular self-rule.

He left the ground open for Barack Obama to remind us that our founders wanted active engaged citizens, not a government run by a solipsistic and self-appointed savior who wants everything his way.

Trump has abandoned the deep and pervasive optimism that has always energized the American nation.

He left the ground open for Michelle Obama to embrace the underlying chorus of hope that runs through the American story: that our national history is an arc toward justice; that evil rises for a day but contains the seeds of its own destruction; that beneath the vicissitudes that darken our days, we live in an orderly cosmos governed by love.

For decades the Republican Party has embraced America's open, future-oriented nationalism. But when you nominate a Silvio Berlusconi you give up a piece of that. When you nominate a blood-and-soil nationalist you're no longer speaking in the voice of Lincoln, Theodore Roosevelt and every Republican nominee from Reagan to McCain to Romney.

Democrats have often been ambivalent about that ardent nationalistic voice, but this week they were happy to accept Trump's unintentional gift. There were an unusually high number of great speeches at the Democratic convention this year: the Obamas, Biden, Booker, Clinton, the Mothers of the Movement and so on.

These speakers found their eloquence in staving off this demagogue. They effectively separated Trump from America. They separated him from conservatism. They made full use of the deep nationalist chords that touch American hearts.

Trump has allowed the Democrats to mask their deep problems. A Democratic administration has presided over a time of growing world chaos, growing violence and growing anger. But the Democrats seem positively organized and orderly compared to Candidate Chaos on the other side.

The Sanders people have 90 percent of the Democratic Party's passion and 95 percent of the ideas. Most Sanders people are kind- and open-hearted, but there is a core that is corrupted by moral preening, an uncompromising absolutism and a paranoid unwillingness to play by the rules of civic life.

But the extremist fringe that threatens to take over the Democratic Party seems less menacing than the lunatic fringe that has already taken over the Republican one.

This week I left the arena here each night burning with indignation at Mike Pence. I almost don't blame Trump. He is a morally untethered, spiritually vacuous man who appears haunted by multiple personality disorders. It is the ""sane"" and ""reasonable"" Republicans who deserve the shame -- the ones who stood silently by, or worse, while Donald Trump gave away their party's sacred inheritance.

The Democrats had by far the better of the conventions. But the final and shocking possibility is this: In immediate political terms it may not make a difference.

The Democratic speakers hit doubles, triples and home runs. But the normal rules may no longer apply. The Democrats may have just dominated a game we are no longer playing.

Both conventions featured one grieving parent after another. The fear of violent death is on everybody's mind -- from ISIS, cops, lone sociopaths. The essential contract of society -- that if you behave responsibly things will work out -- has been severed for many people.

It could be that in this moment of fear, cynicism, anxiety and extreme pessimism, many voters may have decided that civility is a surrender to a rigged system, that optimism is the opiate of the idiots and that humility and gentleness are simply surrendering to the butchers of ISIS. If that's the case then the throes of a completely new birth are upon us and Trump is a man from the future.

If that's true it's not just politics that has changed, but the country."
224,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/14/business/economy/americas-inequality-problem-real-income-gains-are-brief-and-hard-to-find.html,"Working families finally got a raise.

Early on Tuesday, the Census Bureau provided some long-awaited good news for the beleaguered working class: The income of the typical American household perched on the middle rung of the income ladder increased a hearty 5.2 percent in 2015, the first real increase since 2007, the year before the economy sank into recession.

Households all the way down the income scale made more money last year. The average incomes of the poorest fifth of the population increased 6.6 percent after three consecutive years of decline. And the official poverty rate declined to 13.5 percent from 14.8 percent in 2014, the sharpest decline since the late 1960s.

The numbers are heartening, confirming that the sluggish yet consistent recovery of the American economy has finally begun to lift all boats. They fit the story coming from the job market, which is about as tight as it has been in a very long time. They follow rises in the minimum wage across many states and municipalities.

""This shows the importance of robust labor markets,"" said Jared Bernstein, a former top economic adviser to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. ""If working-age Americans are going to get ahead, it is through a paycheck.""

And yet this positive news -- while clearly undermining Donald J. Trump's unbridled pessimism about the American economy -- does not justify unbridled celebration, either.

""The next question is why did it take such a long time for things to look good?"" said Arloc Sherman of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning policy analysis group. As Sheldon H. Danziger of the Russell Sage Foundation put it, it's great news that men's earnings from work increased 1.5 percent. But they are still lower than in the 1970s.

The answer does not just involve sluggish growth. It is also about its distribution. Gains may be finally trickling down to those at the bottom of the ladder. But the numbers still offer a lopsided picture, with a gargantuan share of income rising to the top. While the bottom fifth of households increased their share of the nation's income, by the census's definition, to 3.4 percent from 3.3 percent, the richest 5 percent kept 21.8 percent of the pie, the same as in 2014.

""There's an inequality problem,"" Mr. Sherman added.

Against the backdrop of the last few decades, the income gains revealed on Tuesday underscore how difficult the American economy has made it for average workers to get ahead. In nearly every successive economic cycle, progress came slower and harder than in the previous one.

The data, which measured how Americans were doing six years into the economic recovery, show that incomes in the middle, measured in 2015 dollars, were still 1.6 percent below the previous peak of $57,423 a household, which was attained in 2007, just before the economy sank into what has come to be known as the Great Recession.

How does that look compared to the nation's recent history? After the economy slipped into recession in 1969, it took only three years for incomes in the middle to rebound and surpass their previous peak. After the downturn of 1973, it took five; after back-to-back recessions in 1981 and 1982, it took seven.

And, except for the long expansion that ran from 1991 through 2000, it has been getting worse. The economic growth from late 2001 to about the end of 2007 never even managed to deliver incomes above the previous peak for the typical household, reached near the end of Bill Clinton's presidency. The expansion underway today may not get there, either.

Today, median household incomes are still 2.4 percent below the absolute peak they hit in 1999 -- when Facebook had yet to come into existence, the big news in the music business was Napster, and the good times in Silicon Valley were about to come crashing down with the collapse of the dot-com bubble.

At the bottom of the ladder, households at the 10th percentile -- those poorer than 90 percent of the population -- are still a bit poorer than they were in 1989. Americans have managed to develop an internet economy, invent social media and build driverless cars since then, but not to improve the lot of those at the bottom.

What's more, changes starting in 2013 in the way the census asks people about their incomes can distort comparisons with previous years. After adjusting the data for these changes, according to Elise Gould of the Economic Policy Institute, the income of American households in the middle of the distribution last year was still 4.6 percent below its level in 2007 and 5.4 percent below where it was in 1999.

Of course, the Census Bureau's numbers on income and poverty don't add up to a perfect representation of families' means. For one thing, they include only ""money income"" -- excluding in-kind government benefits like housing vouchers or food stamps. They don't include the impact of taxes, ignoring the earned-income tax credit, which provides substantial help to families with low earnings.

The official poverty line, moreover, is assessed using a basket of necessities defined in the 1960s -- which has little to do with people's lives today. Over the last few years the census has also published an alternative Supplemental Poverty Measure -- which keeps a better tab on Americans' income and expenditures. Using that count, poverty dipped to 14.3 percent, the lowest level since the census began compiling it in 2009.

Analysts like Scott Winship of the right-leaning Manhattan Institute have argued for some time that long-term income numbers, like those published by the Congressional Budget Office, suggest that Americans in the middle of the income distribution and below have not done badly over recent decades. He concludes that the best strategy to promote the welfare of working Americans is to focus on improving overall economic growth. The fixation with inequality and income distribution, he says, will produce bad policy.

The current census data does suggest that growth can ultimately bring prosperity to average Americans. Still, it also points to the persistence of wide inequality as being at the center of the story.

Across the entire bottom 60 percent of the distribution, households are taking home a smaller slice of the pie than they did in the 1960s and 1970s. The 3.4 percent of income that households in the bottom fifth took home last year was less than the 5.8 percent they had in 1974. With their share shrinking with almost every economic cycle, it is hardly a surprise that it takes longer for them to experience any income gains at all. Growth, alone, is not adding to their prosperity as it once did.

By contrast, households in the top 5 percent have profited nicely from America's expansions. In 2015, they took in $350,870, on average. That is 4.9 percent more than in 1999 and 37.5 percent more than in 1989.

Historical precedent suggests the latest economic expansion is getting long in the tooth. Lawrence Summers, Treasury secretary under Bill Clinton and a top economic adviser in President Obama's first term, says there are better than even odds today that the United States will tip into a recession within three years. In July, Deutsche Bank said the probability of a recession within the next 12 months had jumped to 60 percent, the highest since August 2008. JPMorgan thinks the odds are 37 percent.

For all but Americans at the very top, that means that the punch bowl may well be taken away again before the party really gets going. That is not how a well-functioning economy should work."
225,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/02/magazine/what-could-be-wrong-with-a-little-moral-clarity.html,"If, in politics, words are weapons, they often prove themselves double -- edged. So it was when, on the summer night that Alexandria Ocasio -- Cortez learned that she had won a Democratic congressional primary over a 10-term incumbent, she provided a resonant quote to a TV reporter. ""I think what we've seen is that working -- class Americans want a clear champion,"" she said, ""and there is nothing radical about moral clarity in 2018."" Dozens of news videos and articles would cite those words as journalists worked to interpret what Ocasio -- Cortez's triumph, repeated in November's general election, might represent for the American left and its newest star.

Until recently, ""moral clarity"" was more likely to signal combativeness toward the left, not from it: It served for decades as a badge of membership among conservative hawks and cultural crusaders. But in the Trump era, militant certainty takes precedence across the political spectrum. On the left, ""moral clarity"" can mean taking an unyielding stand against economic inequality or social injustice, climate change or gun violence. Closer to the center, it can take on a sonorous, transpartisan tone, as when Senator Robert Menendez, a Democrat, and former Speaker Paul Ryan, a Republican, each called for ""moral clarity"" in the White House reaction to the murder of the journalist Jamal Khashoggi. And it can fly beyond politics altogether, as when the surgeon and author Atul Gawande writes that better health care ""does not take genius. It takes diligence. It takes moral clarity."" We hear about moral clarity any time there is impatience with equivocation, delay, conciliation and confusion -- whenever people long for rapid action based on truths they hold to be self -- evident.

Moral clarity is long defined by usage as a capacity to make firm, unflinching distinctions between evil and good, and to take action based on those distinctions. These are fighting words: They mean knowing the enemy, which is the first step to taking up arms against the enemy. But they're potentially applicable to any side of a fight. What adrenaline does for the body, moral clarity does for semantics: It generates a surge of willpower, serving as a prelude to -- and maybe a pretext for -- combat.

This zeal can be abundant on all sides of the battle. As a slogan, though, ""moral clarity"" has much more particular origins. There was, originally, only one way to be right about it.

""Moral clarity"" was literally forged in war. The phrase first became popular in the early 1950s, soon after the onset of the Cold War, then subsided slightly during the 1960s and 1970s. It would revive during the 1980s -- as Ronald Reagan preached unrelenting struggle against the ""evil empire"" of the Soviet Union -- and reach unprecedented heights in the wake of the Sept. 11 attacks. For decades, moral clarity functioned as a shibboleth, an efficient means of discovering, then assailing, anyone too weak -- willed to wage war against America's ideological foes or incipient spiritual collapse. And more than any other writer on the right, the Catholic neoconservative William Bennett -- Reagan's education secretary and the ""czar"" of George Bush's war on drugs -- would be the one who became synonymous with moral clarity.

Whether in foreign policy or domestic culture wars over narcotics, faith and sexuality, Bennett proved that a discourse of righteousness could pay political dividends. It was Bennett who, interviewed by CNN on the first anniversary of Sept. 11, regretfully observed that recent discourse seemed to be ""softening, trying to soften the memory"" of the previous year's atrocity. Focus had to be maintained, he argued: ""We have to act. And to act, we have to have resolution. And for resolution, we have to have clarity."" A graduate of Harvard Law School, Bennett cited Bruce Willis's character in ""Die Hard"" as an exemplar of clarity while pushing confidently for an invasion of Iraq. In a book he had recently published, titled ""Why We Fight: Moral Clarity and the War on Terrorism,"" he preached the necessity of subjecting Americans to an aggressive re -- education in ""our history, undistorted by the lens of political correctness and pseudosophisticated relativism."" The chief enemies at home, it seemed, were postmodernist professors, multicultural activists and intellectuals like Susan Sontag, whose skepticism about the impending quest for vengeance overseas rendered them, effectively, traitors. Bennett was not alone in prosecuting such a claim: At the time, the former New Republic editor Andrew Sullivan suggested that the ""decadent left"" might constitute ""what amounts to a fifth column.""

During the 2004 presidential campaign, George W. Bush would defend the prosecution of the war he started by reiterating Bennett's themes -- the vigilance and courage required for single -- minded action, the flaccidity of dissent. ""I will continue to lead with clarity,"" Bush said during one news conference, ""in a resolute way."" This clarity, of course, proved more perishable than first believed: American momentum in the Middle East soon petered out inside a self-made labyrinth, replete with traps and dead ends. An administration that had crowed about resolution and clarity soon found itself waffling, brutally and helplessly, between what Donald Rumsfeld parsed as ""known unknowns"" and ""unknown unknowns."" If suppressing Al Qaeda meant taking over Iraq, did maintaining a hold on Iraq imply bombing Iran? How should the American state engage with the various hostile factions emerging from the cinders of Iraq? What, precisely, would be the morally crystal -- clear approach to Syria?

Over the past 15 years, the association of ""moral clarity"" with a bellicose approach to overseas affairs has faded only slightly. ""Rarely does international politics present a moment of such moral clarity,"" Charles Krauthammer wrote in The Washington Post in 2014 -- defending what others perceived, no less clearly, as an Israeli war of collective punishment that killed more than 2,000 Palestinians in Gaza, mostly civilians. (""Moral clarity"" has been a euphemism in constant use through this conflict, as in Alan Dershowitz's book ""The Case for Moral Clarity: Israel, Hamas and Gaza."") After the death of John McCain, a fierce advocate for any and all wars, the senator was praised for his ""voice of moral clarity"" by Jennifer Rubin, another conservative columnist at The Post. Rubin contrasted McCain's enthusiasm for doing the right thing overseas with the Trump administration's indifference to human rights, but President Trump himself was no stranger to the discourse of clarity regarding Muslims. ""Anyone who cannot name our enemy is not fit to lead this country,"" he said during a 2016 campaign speech, adding that ""anyone who cannot condemn the hatred, oppression and violence of radical Islam lacks the moral clarity to serve as our president.""

There seemed to be an opening, after Barack Obama's election, for ""moral clarity"" to become a liberal watchword. Perhaps the philosopher Susan Neiman, whose 2008 book ""Moral Clarity: A Guide for Grown-Up Idealists"" argued for a liberal re -- embrace of such language, could have served as its Bennett. Yet by 2011, it had become clear that, regarding foreign policy and economics, the Obama White House would lean instead toward pragmatism and accommodation, not the stubborn force of moral commitment. Alexandria Ocasio -- Cortez's congressional bid was preceded by a decade in which many youthful nonreactionaries despaired of democratic institutions' ability to deliver any kind of systemic change -- and chafed at the obtuse contempt with which older, more established liberals frequently reacted to demands for bolder action. It's only natural that, having been chosen to replace one such established Democrat, Ocasio -- Cortez would argue that ""moral clarity"" was not the province of radicals or dreamy idealists, but exactly the kind of principled action her constituents had voted for.

The weapon of clarity works differently depending on who's wielding it: It tends to be a blessing for insurgent underdogs and a curse for domineering overlords. For those already in power, clarity can be as tragically easy to obtain as the vanity it often resembles -- a combination of narcissism and hubris that's liable to produce calamitous outcomes. In politics, as in all things, it should be possible to match decisive action with intelligent consideration. Clarity achieves only the first of those two; left to its own devices, taken as a virtue in itself, it tends to generate more problems than it solves. Strategic vision requires something more than narrow intensity. It develops by admitting its limits and working to understand the enemy at a high resolution -- the kind that only humble relativity can access.

Near the end of ""Moby -- Dick,"" Ahab furiously addresses the ""clear spirit of clear fire, whom on these seas I as Persian once did worship."" If any character in literature is an avatar of moral clarity, it's Melville's maniacal captain, who defies all omens of disaster and single -- mindedly pursues revenge upon the being he has named his evil enemy. Such clarity gets him, and all but one of his crew members, killed. With such lessons in mind, it's hard to read the recent Foreign Affairs essay by the latest secretary of state, Mike Pompeo -- in which he presses for regime change in Iran and worshipfully references ""the power of moral clarity"" -- without suppressing a certain shiver."
226,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/13/us/politics/trump-inauguration-investigation.html,"WASHINGTON -- Federal prosecutors are examining whether foreigners illegally funneled donations to President Trump's inaugural committee and a pro-Trump super PAC in hopes of buying influence over American policy, according to people familiar with the inquiry.

The inquiry focuses on whether people from Middle Eastern nations -- including Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates -- used straw donors to disguise their donations to the two funds. Federal law prohibits foreign contributions to federal campaigns, political action committees and inaugural funds.

The line of questioning underscores the growing scope of criminal inquiries that pose a threat to Mr. Trump's presidency. The special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, is focusing on whether anyone in the Trump campaign conspired with Russia to tip the 2016 presidential election in Mr. Trump's favor, while prosecutors in New York are pursuing evidence he secretly authorized illegal payments of hush money to silence accusations of extramarital affairs that threatened his campaign.

The inquiry into potential foreign donations to the inaugural fund and the super PAC is yet another front being pursued by multiple teams of prosecutors. Thomas J. Barrack Jr., a billionaire financier and one of Mr. Trump's closest friends, raised money for both funds.

""Tom has never talked with any foreign individual or entity for the purposes of raising money for or obtaining donations related to either the campaign, the inauguration or any such political activity,"" said Owen Blicksilver, a spokesman for Mr. Barrack. The inaugural committee focus was reported earlier on Thursday by The Wall Street Journal.

The super PAC, Rebuilding America Now, was formed in the summer of 2016 when Mr. Trump's presidential campaign was short of cash and out of favor with many major Republican donors. While Mr. Trump insisted that he could finance his own campaign, he refused to dig too deeply into his own pockets.

According to several of the people familiar with the investigation, Paul Manafort, who then headed the campaign, suggested that Mr. Barrack step into the void by creating and raising funds for the political action committee, which could raise unlimited amounts of money as long as it avoided coordinating closely with the candidate.

In an interview with investigators a year ago, Mr. Barrack said that Mr. Manafort seemed to view the political committee as an arm of the campaign, despite laws meant to prevent such coordination, according to a person familiar with the interview.

Federal election law requires a cooling-off period of at least 120 days before campaign staff members join a political committee backing the same candidate, but Mr. Manafort dispatched two friends from the campaign, Laurance Gay and Ken McKay, to run the operation. A press officer said at the time that the committee violated no rules because the campaign never paid the two men. Neither man returned repeated phone calls seeking comment.

According to filings with the Federal Election Commission, the committee raised $23 million, making it one of the most important sources of funds for advertisements, polls and other political expenditures on Mr. Trump's behalf. Most money came from several big donors, including from Linda McMahon, a professional wrestling executive who donated $6 million and was later appointed by Mr. Trump to head the Small Business Administration.

Everyone Who's Been Charged as a Result of the Mueller Investigation

Thirty-four people have faced criminal charges that stem from the investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election.

Aug. 21, 2018

Prosecutors from New York and from Mr. Mueller's team have asked witnesses whether anyone from Qatar or other Middle Eastern countries also contributed money, perhaps using American intermediaries. Among other issues, they asked about a Mediterranean cruise that Mr. Barrack and Mr. Manafort took after Mr. Manafort was fired in August 2016 from the Trump campaign because of a scandal over his previous work for pro-Russian politicians in Ukraine. Mr. Manafort was in serious financial trouble at the time, and Mr. Barrack, who has an extensive business network in the Persian Gulf, may have been attempting to help him find clients.

On the cruise, the pair met one of the world's richest men, Hamad bin Jassim bin Jaber Al Thani, the former prime minister of Qatar. Until 2013, Mr. Al Thani presided over the country's $230 billion sovereign wealth fund. He remains a highly influential member of the nation's governing royal family.

Investigators also sought information from a businessman, Rashid Al Malik, an associate of Mr. Barrack's who heads a private investment firm in the United Arab Emirates, according to a person familiar with the inquiry. Mr. Malik, whose lawyer did not immediately respond to a request for comment, has been described as close to a key figure in the U.A.E.'s government.

After Mr. Trump was elected, any troubles he had finding donors appeared to have vanished. His inaugural fund raised $107 million -- four times as much as the pro-Trump political action committee and twice as much as the amount raised for President Barack Obama's first inauguration. Mr. Barrack was its chairman, and Rick Gates, a longtime business associate of Mr. Manafort's who served as deputy campaign chairman, ran it.

The inquiry into the inaugural fund appears to involve prosecutors from United States attorney's offices in Manhattan and Brooklyn, people familiar with the investigation said. The fund has long been a source of infighting among White House advisers and personal friends of Mr. Trump's, who blamed each other for news reports about questionable expenditures.

The prosecutors in Manhattan were apparently following up on leads from their case against Michael D. Cohen, the president's former longtime fixer. Mr. Cohen was sentenced on Wednesday to three years in prison, in part for organizing payments to cover up sex scandals that could have threatened Mr. Trump's chances of winning the White House.

Among other documents seized during raids on Mr. Cohen's home and office in the spring, investigators found a tape recording of a conversation with Stephanie Winston Wolkoff, a friend of Melania Trump's, who ran entities that collected $26 million from the fund. Ms. Winston Wolkoff blamed Mr. Barrack for news reports questioning the payments to her and criticized him for failing to properly manage the account, according to people who spoke with her. She complained about how he had handled the money to several friends, including Mr. Cohen, those people said.

The inaugural committee complied with all laws and ""has not been contacted by any prosecutors,"" said Mr. Blicksilver, who is also a spokesman for the fund. Its finances ""were fully audited internally and independently,"" and donors were fully vetted and disclosed to the Federal Election Commission, as required, he said.

In fact, though, the fund has already run into trouble related for both donations and expenditures. Mr. Gates, who is awaiting sentencing for crimes related to a financial fraud scheme he executed with Mr. Manafort, has testified that he may have submitted personal expenses for reimbursement from the fund. A later review of the inaugural expenses found no issue with his reimbursements, a person close to Mr. Gates said.

And this year, a well-known Republican lobbyist, Sam Patten, pleaded guilty to arranging for a Ukrainian oligarch and another foreigner to buy $50,000 worth of tickets to an inaugural event, using an American as a straw purchaser.

Investigators have also asked witnesses whether any foreigners also contributed illegally to the inaugural committee. Once Mr. Trump was elected, foreign governments were frantically trying to build connections to the incoming administration, including Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. Although it hosts and heavily subsidizes an American military base, Qatar is constantly striving to counter the influence of its powerful neighbors, also allies of the United States."
227,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/14/business/economy/us-census-household-income-poverty-wealth-2015.html,"WASHINGTON -- Americans last year reaped the largest economic gains in nearly a generation as poverty fell, health insurance coverage spread and incomes rose sharply for households on every rung of the economic ladder, ending years of stagnation.

The median household's income in 2015 was $56,500, up 5.2 percent from the previous year -- the largest single-year increase since record-keeping began in 1967, the Census Bureau said on Tuesday. The share of Americans living in poverty also posted the sharpest decline in decades.

The gains were an important milestone for the economic expansion that began in 2009. For the first time in recent years, the benefits of renewed prosperity are spreading broadly.

The data was released into a heated presidential race, where Democrats seized on the statistics to promote Hillary Clinton's candidacy and undercut Donald J. Trump's dark assessment of the nation's well-being.

""It has been a long slog from the depths of the Great Recession, but things are finally starting to improve for many American households,"" said Chris G. Christopher Jr., director of consumer economics at IHS Global Insight. He said the gains had continued this year.

The economic recovery, however, remains incomplete. The median household income was still 1.6 percent lower than in 2007, adjusting for inflation. It also remained 2.4 percent lower than the peak reached during the boom of the late 1990s. The number of people living in poverty also remained elevated, although it shrank last year by about 3.5 million, or roughly 8 percent.

Mark R. Rank, a professor of social welfare at Washington University in St. Louis, said the new data ""is obviously good news."" But he noted that poverty and income inequality in the United States remained more extreme than in most developed countries. ""It would take a lot to move that needle,"" he said.

The Census Bureau also reported that the share of Americans with health insurance continued to increase. It said that only 9.1 percent of the population had no health insurance last year.

Several states, including Alaska, Indiana and Pennsylvania, expanded their Medicaid programs in 2015, taking advantage of increased federal funding under the Affordable Care Act. Private sector coverage also increased as companies hired more workers and offered them better benefits.

With the presidential election looming in less than two months, the annual report provided immediate fodder.

""We lifted three and a half million people out of poverty, the largest one-year drop in poverty since 1968,"" President Obama said on Tuesday at a rally in Philadelphia for Mrs. Clinton. ""The uninsured rate is the lowest since they began keeping records. The pay gap between men and women shrank to the lowest level on record,"" he said, adding, ""Thanks, Obama.""

Mr. Trump, the Republican nominee, has repeatedly cited the stagnation of household income as evidence of a broader economic malaise. He did not address the new report directly at a rally in Clive, Iowa, but he said the Obama administration's economic policies had failed.

""Poverty is beyond belief,"" Mr. Trump said. ""It's time to break up the failed Democratic control over our inner cities, and provide real hope and opportunity to every single community in this nation.""

The Census Bureau's annual report, based on a survey of 95,000 households, is the latest evidence that 2015 was a good year for the economy. Employers added more than three million jobs as the unemployment rate fell to 5 percent. Hourly pay increased by 2 percent, adjusting for inflation. Americans drove more miles in their cars. Even housing showed some signs of a revival.

The details of the bureau's report revealed that the gains last year were both broad and deep. Notably, lower-income households saw the largest income gains in percentage terms. Real household incomes rose 7.9 percent for households in the 10th percentile and 6.3 percent for those in the 20th percentile. By contrast, the increase was only 2.9 percent for those households in the 90th percentile.

""You know the old saying, 'When the economy sniffles, the least advantaged catch pneumonia?'"" said Jared Bernstein, an economist at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a Washington research organization, and a former adviser to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. ""Well, that works the other way, too. The benefits of closing in on full employment disproportionately flow to the least advantaged.""

The increase in median income outpaced average income, which rose 4.5 percent to $79,263. The median income is the amount that divides households evenly between those that make less and those that make more. Average income is generally higher because some households make a lot more.

The gains, however, came mostly from job growth rather than wage growth. More people are working, but many of them are still struggling to maintain their standard of living.

Jeff Labruzzo, 56, said he was still earning significantly less than before the recession. Mr. Labruzzo, who lives in southwest Louisiana, treats building sites for termites before concrete is poured. The construction business remains soft, and Mr. Labruzzo said he faced increased competition from firms that employ illegal immigrants. He had five workers, but he recently let two of them go.

""Things are to the point where I'm thinking about just closing up the business and letting my income drop,"" Mr. Labruzzo said. As a veteran, he said he could then qualify for government health benefits.

Last year's income gains do not fundamentally alter the economy's long-term trajectory. Growth remains slow despite the Federal Reserve's campaign to stimulate the economy. Predictions of faster growth, followed a few months later by disappointment, have become an annual ritual.

Both Fed officials and outside economists argue that stronger growth requires action by fiscal policy makers. But Democrats and Republicans are at loggerheads over the best steps, and there is little suggestion that a breakthrough is in the offing.

""It is encouraging that our economic recovery is lifting Americans out of poverty and boosting wages,"" said Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, the minority leader. ""But instead of building on this progress, Washington Republicans want to turn back the clock.""

Republicans responded in kind, presenting the data as evidence Democrats should step aside.

""Today's report is another disappointing confirmation that too many Americans are still struggling to provide for their families and reach their full potential,"" said Representative Kevin Brady of Texas, the chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. ""The federal government invests billions of dollars each year in programs to help low-income Americans, but more than 43 million people continue to live in poverty.""

The distribution of income in the United States remains tilted toward the affluent. Last year's gains by lower-income households were not enough to shift measures of income inequality.

The data also was a mixed bag for minority groups. Poverty rates fell most sharply for African-American and Hispanic households, but their income gains were smaller than for white households.

""One good year does not reverse decades of stagnation,"" Mr. Bernstein said. ""Middle- and low-income households need a lot more than one good year. We need to keep this going."""
228,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/13/us/politics/bolton-iran-pentagon.html,"WASHINGTON -- Senior Pentagon officials are voicing deepening fears that President Trump's hawkish national security adviser, John R. Bolton, could precipitate a conflict with Iran at a time when Mr. Trump is losing leverage in the Middle East by pulling out American troops.

At Mr. Bolton's direction, the National Security Council asked the Pentagon last year to provide the White House with military options to strike Iran, Defense Department and senior American officials said on Sunday.

The request, which alarmed then-Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and other Pentagon officials, came after Iranian-backed militants fired three mortars or rockets into an empty lot on the grounds of the United States Embassy in Baghdad in September.

In response to Mr. Bolton's request, which The Wall Street Journal first reported, the Pentagon offered some general options, including a cross-border airstrike on an Iranian military facility that would have been mostly symbolic. But Mr. Mattis and other military leaders adamantly opposed retaliating, arguing that the attack was insignificant -- a position that ultimately won out, these officials said.

Such a strike could have caused an armed conflict and could have prompted Iraq to order the United States to leave the country, said a senior American official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal policy deliberations.

Since Mr. Bolton took over from H.R. McMaster in April, he has intensified the administration's policy of isolating and pressuring Iran -- reflecting an animus against Iran's leaders that dates back to his days as an official in the George W. Bush administration. As a private citizen, he later called for military strikes on Iran, as well as regime change.

Mr. Bolton has made headway on some issues, like persuading Mr. Trump to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal, but has had less success with others, like maintaining an American military presence in northeastern Syria to counter Iranian influence -- something Mr. Bolton vowed to do only weeks before the president announced in December that he was pulling out.

In asking for military options, a senior administration official said, Mr. Bolton was merely doing his job as national security adviser. He pointed out that the Iranian-backed militants also targeted the American Consulate in Basra.

""The N.S.C. coordinates policy and provides the president with options to anticipate and respond to a variety of threats,"" said a spokesman for the National Security Council, Garrett Marquis.

Mr. Bolton, 70, is not the only Iran hawk in Mr. Trump's circle of top advisers. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo declared in a speech at the American University in Cairo last week that ""countries increasingly understand that we must confront the ayatollahs, not coddle them.""

Earlier this month, he warned Iran against launching three spacecraft, describing them as a pretext for testing missile technology that is necessary to carry a warhead to the United States and other nations. His statement appeared aimed at building a legal case for diplomatic, military or covert action against the Iranian missile program.

It was surprising because Iran has used these modest space missions, mostly to deploy satellites, since 2005. The senior American official said that the Pentagon and the intelligence agencies disagreed with Mr. Pompeo's interpretation of the threat posed by the satellite launches.

Speaking on Sunday on CBS's ""Face the Nation"" during a visit to Abu Dhabi, in the United Arab Emirates, Mr. Pompeo discounted the argument that Mr. Trump's decision to withdraw 2,000 American troops from Syria in the coming months undercuts Washington's ability to achieve its other goals in the region.

""That certainly includes in Syria,"" he said. ""It certainly includes into Iran, if need be.""

But Mr. Pompeo also opposed the idea of an airstrike on Iran after its attack on the embassy, according to a former senior administration official. On Sunday, he declined to comment about The Journal's report. On each stop of his Middle East trip, Mr. Pompeo, a former Army officer, has spoken of the need to counter Iran, but has not talked of military action.

When Mr. McMaster, then a three-star Army general, took over as national security adviser in early 2017, he ordered a new overall war plan for Iran. Mr. Mattis, who is himself an Iran hawk from his days as a Marine Corps commander in the region, delivered options. But those plans were not for the kind of pinpoint strikes that Mr. Bolton envisioned after the attack on the American Embassy on Sept. 6.

On the Sunday following the attack, the senior American official said, Mr. Bolton's deputy at the time, Mira Ricardel, convened an emergency meeting of national security aides to Mr. Trump, called a deputies committee meeting, and asked for retaliatory options.

On Sept. 11, the White House said in a statement, ""The United States will hold the regime in Tehran accountable for any attack that results in injury to our personnel or damage to United States government facilities. America will respond swiftly and decisively in defense of American lives.""

What happened next illustrates Mr. Bolton's management style. As the president's national security adviser, he has largely eliminated the internal policy debates that could air high-level disagreements.

Mr. Bolton does not want to hear opposing views, these officials said, abhors leaks and wants to control everything that flows to the president. But the result is that there is not much consideration of options and, more important, the risk of escalation, according to these people.

The Pentagon declined to comment on Mr. Bolton's request for military options, saying in a statement, ""The Department of Defense is a planning organization and provides the president military options for a variety of threats; routinely reviewing and updating plans and activities to deal with a host of threats, including those posed by Iran, to deter and, if necessary, to respond to aggression.""

A senior administration official said the United States would continue to pursue the withdrawal of Iranian-backed forces from Syria and a political solution in that country. He said the United States was leaving a contingent of American troops at the Al Tanf base in south-central Syria, as a deterrent to Iranian movements in that region.

The past few days have been turbulent for Mr. Bolton. He traveled to Turkey to present a list of conditions for the Syria withdrawal, including a pledge by the Turks not to attack America's Kurdish allies in Syria. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan rejected that demand and refused to see Mr. Bolton.

On Sunday, Mr. Trump backed up his national security adviser, declaring on Twitter that the United States would ""devastate Turkey economically if they hit Kurds.""

With Mr. Pompeo overseeing the nuclear negotiations with North Korea and taking a prominent role on China policy, Mr. Bolton has made Iran the heart of his focus as national security adviser. He scored an early victory when Mr. Trump withdrew from the nuclear deal negotiated by his predecessor, Barack Obama.

Mr. McMaster, backed by Mr. Mattis and former Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson, had talked Mr. Trump out of withdrawing from the deal on multiple occasions. Even Mr. Pompeo tried to salvage the deal with the Europeans in the days before the president's decision.

In March 2015, when Mr. Obama was negotiating the agreement, Mr. Bolton called for a military strike on Iran, writing in The New York Times that diplomacy would never prevent it from acquiring nuclear weapons.

""The inconvenient truth is that only military action like Israel's 1981 attack on Saddam Hussein's Osirak reactor in Iraq or its 2007 destruction of a Syrian reactor, designed and built by North Korea, can accomplish what is required,"" Mr. Bolton wrote. ""Time is terribly short, but a strike can still succeed.""

Before he joined the Trump administration, Mr. Bolton advocated ""the overthrow of the mullahs' regime in Tehran."" Once in office, he told Voice of America that leadership change was ""not the objective of the administration.""

The news of Mr. Bolton's effort to find a way to strike back at Iran comes as evidence is rising that Tehran is considering -- or at least threatening -- to leave the nuclear agreement.

The chief of Iran's nuclear program, Ali Akbar Salehi, an M.I.T.-educated physicist who helped negotiate the deal, said on Sunday that Tehran had begun ""preliminary activities for designing"" a process for enrichment of uranium.

The actual enrichment -- which he said would be at 20 percent purity, just short of being sufficient to build a nuclear weapon -- would violate the accord. Under its provisions, Iran could not enrich uranium at any significant quantities until 2030.

But the Iranian government has been under pressure to respond to Mr. Trump's withdrawal and the reimposition of sanctions by the United States. European powers have been urging Iran not to leave the deal, fearing it would give the United States an excuse for military action.

Mr. Salehi did not say what the ""preliminary activities"" were, or give a timetable for action. But he said the country wanted to produce ""modern fuel"" for its Tehran Research Reactor, a small, aging reactor that was given to it, during the shah's reign, by the United States."
229,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/31/business/economy/the-challenge-of-cutting-coal-dependence.html,"It won't be easy to get rid of coal.

Worried the nation might miss its 2020 target to drastically cut emissions of carbon dioxide, the German government proposed a steep levy last year on the most heavily polluting generators. The tax was intended to deliver a decisive blow against lignite or brown coal, the dirtiest fuel around and Germany's main source of electricity.

Germany views itself as a leader in the push against climate change. It is probably the world's most enthusiastic investor in renewable energy, mainly wind and sun. But even the powerful Chancellor Angela Merkel couldn't quite pull it off.

Facing blowback from labor unions and governments in coal country, Berlin backed off, replacing the levy with a subsidy of 1.6 billion euros to gradually mothball eight coal-fired plants and shut them down permanently by 2023.

Environmentalists hated it. ""Instead of being fined for polluting by the proposed new climate levy, utilities will instead get paid for keeping their oldest and most inefficient lignite plants on standby,"" noted a report for Oxfam on Germany's energy policies by the environmental nonprofit E3G. It ""amounts to a golden handshake for utilities at the expense of taxpayers and consumers.""

And that wasn't all. The chancellery also rejected a push by Barbara Hendricks, the environment minister, to establish a road map to the total phaseout of coal, hoping to postpone timing decisions until after national elections next year.

Berlin's hesitance may seem like little more than a snag in Germany's vaunted ""Energiewende."" At least the coal generators are scheduled to shut down eventually.

But the resistance in the greenest of green countries underscores a more substantial challenge to the international effort to drastically reduce fossil fuels in the world's energy supply: workers and retirees, local economies and communities still depend on the fuels the rest of us hope to let go of to preserve the planet for our children and our children's children.

I'm old enough to remember President Jimmy Carter going on TV on April 18, 1977, declaring a ""moral equivalent of war"" against dependence on foreign oil, and telling Americans that ""we need to shift to plentiful coal."" It seems unfair to simply tell the communities that worked on this shift: ""We're sorry, but it didn't work out.""

But making those who will suffer from this transformation whole is not just a matter of fairness. A successful transition to a low-carbon future requires their support. And yet they remain pretty much an afterthought in the public debate over climate change.

""The scale and the scope of the transition is enormous,"" said Matt Baker, a former commissioner with the Colorado Public Utilities Commission who is now a program officer for energy and climate at the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation. ""You can't do it in the time frame we are thinking about without the consent of the so-called losers in the transition.""

Germany may have few coal workers left: Only about 63,000 jobs are directly or indirectly related to coal out of a total work force of 43 million. But they are well organized into powerful unions. Even in the United States, where 50,000 remaining coal miners have next to no political power, the fate of coal country has grabbed the headlines during the presidential campaign.

Employment in American coal mines has been falling for decades, pushed more by market forces than environmental policy. The steep downturn of late is mainly because of a glut in the global steel market and extra-cheap natural gas. President Obama's Clean Power Plan has not yet kicked in, placed on ice by the Supreme Court. Still, Hillary Clinton singled out coal country for government assistance, offering $30 billion over 10 years.

The stakes are even larger in China. It is the world's largest consumer of coal -- burning as much as every other country combined. After years adding coal-fired generators at breakneck speed, the government in Beijing finally acknowledged the public health costs and ordered limits on new construction.

Yet even as environmentalists welcome the decision as a watershed in the transition out of the world's most polluting fuel, striking coal miners have taken to the streets, protesting unpaid wages and government plans to cut 1.3 million coal jobs out of a total of nearly six million to reduce overcapacity as the country's growth slows.

There are several reasons to be skeptical about the world's transition out of coal. Sure, official data suggest that the world's production peaked in 2013. China's coal consumption appears to have declined 3.3 percent last year. But experts note that despite the new limits, there are still lots of new coal-fired generators being built.

To protect jobs and tax revenue from small coal mines, Chinese local governments have been known to fib when Beijing has demanded they stop producing coal. They stop reporting production numbers but don't shut them down.

Finally, even the most renewable-friendly nations have not figured out how to draw more than a modest share of their power from wind and sun -- which can't be counted on to deliver energy continuously. At the same time, coal remains the easiest and often cheapest source of base power. So from Germany to India, strategies to increase the share of renewable energy in the power mix have relied on a coal base.

""The way many jurisdictions are going is to follow the German model,"" said Mark C. Thurber, associate director for research at Stanford University's Program on Energy and Sustainable Development. ""It seems totally nuts, but it follows from the fact that renewables have a lot of support, and other than that, people do what they know, which is coal.""

India draws 62 percent of its power from coal and is already the second-largest consumer after China and ahead of the United States. Coal consumption is growing about 7 percent a year to power the country's economic catch-up.

""There is not much research into backing out coal with something else,"" Mr. Thurber said. ""They are just throwing renewables at a coal base."" While environmentalists welcomed India's announcement last year that it would increase investment in solar energy, they were less pleased by its plans to triple coal production from 2013 to 2020.

This means the world's climate change strategy cannot rely on the quick replacement of the dirtiest fuel around. Increasing investment in technologies like carbon capture and storage may prove indispensable to meet the limits on carbon dioxide emissions needed to prevent a catastrophic warming over coming decades.

Even after all this is dealt with and the obstacles are overcome, the human dimension will remain.

It will require a lot of attention, and more than a few billion dollars. Simply assuming that displaced coal miners will make a smooth transition into jobs in newfangled energy industries, which have a different geographical footprint and require a different skill set, is a cop-out.

The world's energy transition cannot be portrayed simply as ""Big Coal vs. virtuous wind and solar."" Horrible as this might sound to economists -- who believe in taxing polluters, not rewarding them -- the energy transition may require paying the dirtiest generators, as Germany has done, to stick around.

""Climate campaigners have to address the real‐world concerns of people who may not come out on top during the transition,"" Craig Morris, an environmental blogger, wrote in German Energy Transition. ""Several degrees of warming by 2100 may sound scary, but not nearly as much as long‐term joblessness just a few years from now."""
230,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/15/us/politics/trump-putin-meetings.html,"WASHINGTON -- The first time they met was in Germany. President Trump took his interpreter's notes afterward and ordered him not to disclose what he heard to anyone. Later that night, at a dinner, Mr. Trump pulled up a seat next to President Vladimir V. Putin to talk without any American witnesses at all.

Their third encounter was in Vietnam when Mr. Trump seemed to take Mr. Putin's word that he had not interfered in American elections. A formal summit meeting followed in Helsinki, Finland, where the two leaders kicked out everyone but the interpreters. Most recently, they chatted in Buenos Aires after Mr. Trump said they would not meet because of Russian aggression.

Mr. Trump has adamantly insisted there was ""no collusion"" with Russia during his 2016 presidential campaign. But each of the five times he has met with Mr. Putin since taking office, he has fueled suspicions about their relationship. The unusually secretive way he has handled these meetings has left his own administration guessing what happened and piqued the interest of investigators.

""What's disconcerting is the desire to hide information from your own team,"" said Andrew S. Weiss, who was a Russia adviser to President Bill Clinton. ""The fact that Trump didn't want the State Department or members of the White House team to know what he was talking with Putin about suggests it was not about advancing our country's national interest but something more problematic.""

The mystery surrounding the meetings seems to have drawn attention from the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, who is examining ties between the president and Russia. And it has generated a furor in Congress, where Democrats are pushing to subpoena the notes of the president's interpreters or perhaps the interpreters themselves.

Veterans of past administrations could not recall a precedent for a president meeting alone with an adversary and preventing his own advisers from being briefed on what was said. When they meet with foreign leaders, presidents typically want at least one aide in the room -- not just an interpreter -- to avoid misunderstandings later.

""All five of the presidents whom I worked for, Republicans and Democrats, wanted a word-for-word set of notes, if only to protect the integrity of the American side of the conversation against later manipulation by the Soviets or the Russians,"" said Victoria J. Nuland, a career diplomat who worked for Dick Cheney and Hillary Clinton, among others.

That would seem an even greater imperative for Mr. Trump, who knew there were questions about his relationship with Mr. Putin given that American intelligence agencies concluded that Moscow tried to help elect him.

""If any president would have wanted witnesses and protection, it ought to have been Donald Trump,"" said Richard N. Haass, the president of the Council on Foreign Relations and adviser to four presidents, most recently as President George W. Bush's State Department policy planning director. ""And yet he chose not to, and that adds fuel to the fire that something here is not right.""

Mr. Trump's defenders acknowledge Mr. Trump's approach does not resemble the way his predecessors operated, but note that he has been an unorthodox president in so many ways that it does not prove anything untoward. And, they say, he has reason to feel burned since previous interactions with foreign leaders have leaked, including full transcripts of telephone calls with the leaders of Mexico and Australia published in The Washington Post.

""Of course I was disappointed with Helsinki, but I do not just look at how the president handles specific meetings with Putin,"" said Luke Coffey, a foreign policy scholar at the Heritage Foundation. ""Instead, I'm most interested in what the actual policies are coming out of the administration.""

He cited additional sanctions, weapons sent to Ukraine, increased Pentagon spending meant to counter Russian aggression and opposition to a new Russian pipeline to Europe. All that, he said, ""is proof that this is one of the toughest administrations on Russia since Reagan.""

The question of Mr. Trump's meetings with Mr. Putin was revived by a pair of news stories last weekend. The New York Times reported that after Mr. Trump fired the F.B.I. director James B. Comey in 2017, the bureau opened a counterintelligence investigation to explore whether the president was acting on Russia's behalf. The Post reported that Mr. Trump had gone to unusual lengths to conceal details of his talks with Mr. Putin, including taking his interpreter's notes.

The White House dismissed the stories as unfair smears. ""The liberal media has wasted two years trying to manufacture a fake collusion scandal instead of reporting the fact that unlike President Obama, who let Russia and other foreign adversaries push America around, President Trump has actually been tough on Russia,"" Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, said in a statement.

Mr. Trump has been in contact with Mr. Putin since shortly after his election in November 2016. Mr. Putin sent him a congratulatory telegram and the two spoke by telephone on Nov. 14.

They spoke a few more times before meeting in person for the first time as presidents on July 7, 2017, in Hamburg, Germany, during a Group of 20, or G-20, economic summit meeting. Aside from interpreters, the only others in the room were Rex W. Tillerson, then the secretary of state, and Sergey V. Lavrov, the Russian foreign minister.

Every Time Trump Has Talked to Putin

President Trump and President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia have had at least five face-to-face meetings and nine publicly reported phone conversations since Mr. Trump won the election in 2016.

Jan. 15, 2019

The inaugural meeting came at a sensitive time. Mr. Trump's team learned that day that one of the biggest secrets of his presidential bid was about to become public: At the height of the campaign, his son, son-in-law and campaign chairman had met at Trump Tower with Russians on the promise of obtaining dirt on Mrs. Clinton from the Russian government. Mr. Trump's team was scrambling to respond to a request for comment by The Times.

Mr. Trump's meeting with Mr. Putin that day lasted more than two hours. Afterward, Mr. Trump took his interpreter's notes and instructed the interpreter not to brief anyone. Mr. Tillerson told reporters that the leaders discussed everything from Syria to Ukraine, but he also described ""a very robust and lengthy exchange"" on the election hacking.

A few hours later, Mr. Trump sought out Mr. Putin again during a dinner for all the leaders. Videotape later made public showed Mr. Trump pointing at Mr. Putin, who was seated across and down a long table, then pointing at himself and then making a pumping motion with his fist.

Mr. Trump later told The Times that he went over to see his wife, Melania Trump, who was sitting next to Mr. Putin, and the two leaders then talked, with Mr. Putin's interpreter translating. No American officials were present, and the White House did not confirm the encounter until more than 10 days later, after it was independently reported.

The day after the two meetings, as Mr. Trump was on Air Force One taking off from Germany heading back to Washington, he telephoned a Times reporter and argued that the Russians were falsely accused of election interference. While he insisted most of the conversation be off the record, he later repeated a few things in public in little-noticed asides.

He said that he raised the election hacking three times and that Mr. Putin denied involvement. But he said Mr. Putin also told him that ""if we did, we wouldn't have gotten caught because we're professionals."" Mr. Trump said: ""I thought that was a good point because they are some of the best in the world"" at hacking.

Asked how he weighed Mr. Putin's denials against the evidence that had been presented to him by Mr. Comey; John O. Brennan, then the C.I.A. director; and James R. Clapper Jr., then director of national intelligence, he said that Mr. Clapper and Mr. Brennan were the ""most political"" intelligence chiefs he knew and that Mr. Comey was ""a leaker.""

Later on the same flight to Washington, Mr. Trump huddled with aides to decide how to respond to the emerging story by other Times reporters about the Trump Tower meeting. He personally dictated a misleading statement, saying the meeting was about Russian adoptions without admitting that it was actually intended to accept Moscow's aid for his campaign, as emails obtained by The Times later documented.

The confluence of the two conversations with Mr. Putin even as Mr. Trump's team was grappling with questions about the Trump Tower meeting have fueled further suspicions.

""If you add up all these pieces, it's a very damning picture at a minimum of how to handle national security,"" said Mr. Weiss, who is now at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace. ""If there's a more nefarious explanation, it's obviously more disturbing.""

Mr. Trump next encountered Mr. Putin in person on Nov. 11, 2017, at a meeting of the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation forum in Da Nang, Vietnam. No formal meeting was scheduled, but the two chatted anyway, and Mr. Trump later indicated that Mr. Putin again denied any election interference. ""I really believe that when he tells me that, he means it,"" Mr. Trump said.

The two stayed in touch by phone. Mr. Trump called after Mr. Putin was re-elected in a contest heavily managed by the state in his favor. Although wary aides wrote in his briefing papers, ""DO NOT CONGRATULATE,"" Mr. Trump went ahead and congratulated Mr. Putin.

Their most famous meeting came on July 16, 2018, in Helsinki, where they talked for more than two hours accompanied only by interpreters. At a subsequent news conference, Mr. Trump seemed to again accept Mr. Putin's denial of election interference over the conclusions of American intelligence agencies.

But what happened behind closed doors remained shrouded. The Kremlin later reported that the leaders reached important agreements, but American government officials were left in the dark. American intelligence agencies were left to glean details about the meeting from surveillance of Russians who talked about it afterward.

Within months, Mr. Trump was angling for another meeting, perhaps at the White House or in Paris. Finally, they scheduled a get-together in Buenos Aires in December on the sidelines of another G-20 meeting.

Days before, Russian forces seized three Ukrainian naval vessels, but Mr. Trump seemed intent on sitting down with Mr. Putin, telling reporters as he left the White House for Buenos Aires that the meeting was still on. Just an hour later, after aides briefed him again on Ukraine standoff, he canceled the meeting on Twitter, catching the Russians off guard.

But when he arrived in Buenos Aires, Mr. Trump ended up having another informal conversation with Mr. Putin at the leaders' dinner. Once again, little information emerged about what they discussed, even to other American government officials.

""I've never heard of a president conducting one-on-one meetings with his Russian counterpart without note-takers or without afterward offering readouts to his top aides,"" said David J. Kramer, a former assistant secretary of state under Mr. Bush. ""Putin is privy to what the two discussed -- why can't senior administration officials be trusted and looped in too?"""
231,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/15/opinion/trump-roberts-shutdown.html,"Our institutions give us strength. Fortunately, people with civic courage are working to protect them.

For me, the most disturbing thing about the Trump presidency is the way each week, like a steady drip of acid, Donald Trump tries to erode the thing that truly makes us great as a country and the envy of so many around the world -- the independence and nonpartisan character of our courts, our military, our F.B.I., our Border Patrol and our whole federal bureaucracy.

No modern president has been more willing to use U.S. service members or border police as props for his politics, to blithely declare without evidence that most of the 800,000 federal workers going unpaid during the government shutdown are Democrats, to refer to the Pentagon leadership as ""my generals"" and ""my military,"" and to denounce different federal judges who have ruled against him as a ""so-called judge,"" an ""Obama judge"" and a ""Mexican"" judge (even though he was born in Indiana).

Why is this so important? Because America's core governing institutions were not built to be ""conservative"" or ""liberal."" They were built to take our deepest values and our highest ideals and animate them, promote them and protect them -- to bring them to life and to scale them. They are the continuity that binds one generation of Americans to the next and the beacon for how we work together to build an ever more perfect union.

At their best, these institutions have created the regulatory foundations and legal and security frameworks that have made America great -- that have enabled innovation to be sparked, commerce to flourish and ideas to freely blossom. Rather than serving any party or person's whims, these institutions have promoted and protected enduring American values, laws, norms and ideals.

The independent, nonpartisan quality of our institutions is one of the biggest reasons so many people want to immigrate to America and why some people are even ready to build rafts out of milk cartons to get here.

So when an American leader denigrates those institutions, tries to erode their independence or turns them into political props, he damages the very core of what makes our country unique.

And that's why today I would like to give a shout-out to Supreme Court Chief Justice John Roberts for having the integrity and courage to call Trump out for this behavior, to draw a red line around the judicial branch and to signal to Trump -- politely but firmly -- to keep his hands off its independence and nonpartisan charter.

Roberts did so in November, after a federal district judge in San Francisco put Trump's asylum policy on hold and the president denounced him as an ""Obama judge.""

Responding to a query made by The Associated Press, Chief Justice Roberts said: ""We do not have Obama judges or Trump judges, Bush judges or Clinton judges. What we have is an extraordinary group of dedicated judges doing their level best to do equal right to those appearing before them.""

Roberts added, on that day before Thanksgiving, that an ""independent judiciary is something we should all be thankful for.""

That brushback pitch by Roberts -- a high fastball right under Trump's chin -- was highly unusual, but an important example to others. Of course, our judges are appointed by politicians with the hope that they'll reflect their own or their party's ideological bent on issues that come before them -- and they often do.

Roberts knows that. But what he also knows is that central to our system is that every American is able to expect an impartial hearing before those judges, who, once they assume their place on the bench, should be loyal only to the Constitution and their interpretations of it.

It was Roberts, appointed by George W. Bush, who cast the deciding vote to save Obamacare in June 2015. Other times he's disappointed liberals and will surely do so again. Judges judge.

But Roberts understood that to maintain the power and legitimacy of his court, he had to defend the principle of judicial independence and the presumption of nonpartisanship from Trump's assaults -- and he did.

It was not easy. Because Roberts had to protect his branch of government and keep it elevated, without getting embroiled in some Twitter spat with a president who will throw mud at anyone and who respects no institutional red lines or nonpartisanship. The chief justice pulled it off.

What a contrast with the silence of the lambs -- how Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan bent their institution, their branch of government, to Trump's will.

I've spent four decades reporting from countries with weak institutions -- like Russia, China, every Arab state, Turkey, Iran, Venezuela -- where the arbitrary whims of the leader or his party are the basis of all decision-making, not the rule of law, built on independent institutions.

But Trump appreciates none of this. It would be easy to attribute it all to malevolence. But I think a lot of it is sheer ignorance. I don't think Trump ever took civics. I don't think he ever understood the separation of powers or the meaning of independent agencies. That's why the shutdown doesn't bother him. His instincts are those of a banana republic dictator.

That's also why Trump is so comfortable with the likes of Vladimir Putin and so willing to damage the thing that makes America most special.

And that's why I so appreciate Roberts's quiet pushback so much. It's why I also appreciate those retired military officers who have been willing to call out Trump's abuse of norms and his willingness to use the U.S. military as a prop for his political purposes.

As CNN reported, Trump used a Thanksgiving Day call to U.S. service members abroad to ""justify his controversial deployment of nearly 6,000 U.S. troops to the southern border. Without evidence, he painted Air Force Gen. David Lyons as a proponent of his hard-line immigration policies after Lyons said U.S. troops are fighting in Afghanistan to prevent terrorists from reaching 'our shores again.'""

On a post-Christmas visit to Iraq, CNN reported, Trump used his appearance before troops to hammer Democrats for not supporting his wall funding ""and also posed for photographs with at least one service member who was holding a Trump-Pence campaign sign, and he autographed red 'Make America Great Again' hats for troops in fatigues, despite military guidelines that prohibit active-duty troops from participating 'in partisan political activities' and the expectation that they keep their political views private while in uniform.""

The Washington Post reported that on a tour of Border Patrol stations in McAllen, Tex., last week, ""Trump gathered 15 agents, dressed in uniforms and tactical gear, to stand next to him as he filmed a minute-long video. 'They have done an incredible job,' said Trump, sporting a 'Make America Great Again' hat. 'But we all want to see a wall or a barrier because that will make your job even easier.' ... The agents remained silent, but the visual message was clear: Trump wanted viewers to believe Customs and Border Protection, an agency of 59,000 employees, is firmly behind him in a political skirmish that has resulted in a partial government shutdown.""

The Post quoted Rachel Kleinfeld, a national security analyst at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, as saying: ""It's an in­cred­ibly dangerous cycle. In countries where democracy breaks down, you have institutions of the state that do not serve the people -- they serve political parties' interests. And when people stop believing that security protects people equally, you have a return to private justice.""

That is why I salute William H. McRaven, the retired Navy admiral who oversaw the 2011 Navy SEAL raid in Pakistan that killed Osama bin Laden. In August, McRaven wrote an open letter to Trump via The Washington Post to protest his abusing his power to remove the security clearance of former C.I.A. director and Trump critic John Brennan.

McRaven, a Navy SEAL for 37 years, wrote: ""I would consider it an honor if you would revoke my security clearance as well, so I can add my name to the list of men and women who have spoken up against your presidency.""

You cannot exaggerate how unusual it is for our chief justice and retired senior military officers to challenge Trump's excesses the way they have. They were bred to keep themselves and their institutions out of politics at all costs. But they understand the greater costs of what Trump is doing.

We owe these people a debt for their civic courage, because the biggest national security threat to our country today is from within (and it is only going to get worse in the next two years).

That threat is from a president without any shame or respect for the impartiality of our core institutions, who is backed by a party without any spine and by a network, Fox, without any integrity.

This is not a test. This is a real, live emergency for our democracy.

232,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/15/world/americas/guaido-maduro-venezuela.html,"CARACAS, Venezuela -- Leaders of Venezuela's opposition on Tuesday set in motion a plan to try to oust President Nicolás Maduro and create a caretaker government until new elections can be held.

The National Assembly, the opposition-controlled legislative body, declared Mr. Maduro illegitimate, hoping to trigger a constitutional mechanism that would allow the head of the assembly to take over the leadership.

It was not immediately clear what effect the move would have or how Mr. Maduro's government would react.

Rafael Chavero, professor of constitutional law at the Central University of Venezuela, said the next steps were not clear. ""You have to think outside the box,"" he said. ""There is no magic formula to get out of dictatorships.""

The National Assembly has been largely powerless since Venezuela's Supreme Court, which is packed by Maduro loyalists, attempted to dissolve it in March 2017.

But pressure has been mounting on Mr. Maduro, both domestically and abroad, since he was sworn in for his second term last week. Not long after the ceremony, an opposition leader, Juan Guaidó, the head of the National Assembly, said he would be ready to take over as president and hold fair elections if Venezuelans and the armed forces backed him.

On Tuesday, Vice President Mike Pence spoke with Mr. Guaidó on the phone to recognize ""his courageous leadership"" and to ""express the United States' resolute support for the National Assembly of Venezuela as the only legitimate democratic body in the country,"" according to a statement from the office of the vice president.

Earlier, on Twitter, Mr. Pence said the United States ""strongly supports the courageous decision by Juan Guaidó"" to ""declare the country's presidency vacant.""

Mr. Guaidó has also received support from Luis Almagro, the secretary general of the Organization of American States, who called him the country's ""interim president.""

The expressions of support have emboldened those opposition leaders who remain in Venezuela -- and who have not been imprisoned -- to pursue the high-stakes plan to try to oust Mr. Maduro. They have extended an olive branch to the security forces in the hope that enough middle- and low-level members break ranks, and that Mr. Maduro loses a critical pillar of support.

Until recent days, the National Assembly had been regarded as ineffectual, and led by politicians who had lost popular support as their efforts to challenge Mr. Maduro faltered repeatedly. It was also stymied by divisions in its ranks and a ruthless security apparatus that has jailed critics and opponents, tortured hundreds of suspected dissidents and foiled rebellions within the security forces.

But longtime Venezuela watchers say this challenge to the president comes at a time of unprecedented opposition to Mr. Maduro.

""It's almost a now-or-never moment,"" said Fernando Cutz, a former senior White House official who helped shape Venezuela policy under the Trump and Obama administrations.

The country's authoritarian president was inaugurated for a second term amid a collapsing economy and a growing humanitarian crisis. As inflation has soared and food and medicine have become acutely scarce, Venezuelans have been fleeing their nation in droves. As of last November, more than three million people had left, according to the United Nations.

Ahead of Mr. Maduro's inauguration, a group of countries that includes Canada, Colombia, Brazil, Peru and Argentina issued a statement calling Mr. Maduro's second term ""illegitimate"" and his government ""dictatorial and oppressive.""

Mr. Guaidó, 35, has stopped short of calling himself the nation's rightful leader. But the day after Mr. Maduro's second swearing-in, Mr. Guaidó invoked an article of Venezuela's Constitution that transfers power to the president of the National Assembly in the event that the presidency becomes vacant.

Mr. Guaidó was not a household name at home or abroad before he was sworn in as the new leader of the National Assembly on Jan. 5. But on Sunday, his profile rose dramatically after masked agents from Venezuela's intelligence service took him into custody.

The men grabbed him at gunpoint and hustled him into a car -- but seemed unsure what to do once they had him, Mr. Guaidó told The Times in an interview.

They questioned him on his plans to assume the country's leadership and call a new election, and then let him go, Mr. Guaidó said on Monday from the plain office that serves as the headquarters of his political party, Popular Will.

""They asked me if we were serious people, and I said that of course, that we could protect the Venezuelan people and that Maduro could not do it,"" Mr. Guaidó said.

He said he had assured the men ""there would be amnesty for all those who support us."" Some of them removed their masks, saying, ""Look at our faces and don't forget us,"" he said.

Then they let him go.

While that exchange cannot be independently confirmed, the fact that Mr. Guaidó was released may indicate cracks in the security apparatus that has kept Mr. Maduro in power until now. It helped bolster opposition leaders' belief that they stand a good chance of seizing power from Mr. Maduro and holding a new election.

""We are certain that we are taking the proper steps not to merely declare, but to execute"" a peaceful transition of power, Mr. Guaidó said. ""I think it is underway.""

The key would be to persuade those who remain loyal to the government that they can switch allegiances and help rebuild a country devastated by an economic meltdown, acute food and medicine shortages and rampant violence, he said.

Venezuela's communications minister, Jorge Rodríguez, called the detention of Mr. Guaidó a rogue operation that had not been ordered by the government. He said the men who carried it out had been ""dismissed"" and would be punished.

In the wake of Mr. Guaidó's detention, Mr. Maduro dismissed his political rivals, saying they have long sought to seize power through ""adventure, improvisation, coups."" Their plan, he said, was destined to fail.

""Here the people of Venezuela will continue to rule with Nicolás Maduro at the head of the presidency of the country,"" Mr. Maduro said in remarks to the Constituent Assembly.

Mr. Guaidó is an industrial engineer who got his start in politics through activism in student movements. He was a protégé of Leopoldo López, a prominent opposition leader who was jailed during street protests in 2014 and is currently under house arrest in Caracas.

Mr. Guaidó is cleareyed about the risks he is taking, he said. He still bears scars from being shot with rubber bullets during street protests last year.

""Anyone who gets involved in opposition efforts today can fare very poorly,"" he said.

Mr. Guaidó has called on Venezuelans to take to the streets on Jan. 23 for mass demonstrations backing his bid to remove Mr. Maduro.

In recent months, opposition leaders have struggled to organize large, sustained demonstrations amid skepticism by Venezuelans that the opposition can bring about change. Many also fear the increasingly brutal reprisals of the security forces.

Mr. Cutz, the former White House official, said he feared that the opposition could emerge severely weakened if it failed to get people to protest in large numbers.

""If Maduro emerges victorious, then I feel like we are left with a relatively high likelihood of Venezuela ending up like Cuba,"" he said. ""This will become the status quo, and everyone will kind of accept it."""
233,the guardian,http://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/dec/20/strained-relations-after-diplomatic-intrigue-keep-americans-and-cubans-divided,"Incidents in which two dozen diplomats were said to be victims of 'attacks' have put an end to a fragile détente

In front of the US Embassy in Havana stands a rusting forest of flagpoles, initially erected to fly 138 black flags to obscure a scrolling electric ticker board installed by the Bush administration to send messages to the Cuban people.

The poles are bare now, and the ticker board was unplugged in 2009 as the Obama administration made the first steps of a negotiation that eventually led the two countries to restore diplomatic relations in 2015.

But over the past two years, the embassy has once again become the centre of a diplomatic intrigue which has put an end to that fragile détente.

Two dozen US intelligence officers, diplomats and family members fell ill between November 2016 and August 2017, often after hearing high-pitched noises, with symptoms ranging from nausea to memory loss.

Though the cause remains unknown, the Trump administration has said the diplomats were victims of ""attacks"", and dramatically slashed its diplomatic staff in Havana.

A string of explanations have been put forward to explain the symptoms - from sonic attacks and weaponised microwaves, to mass hysteria and viral infections.

Real or imagined, deliberate or accidental, the fallout from the incidents has hurt ordinary Cubans.

After increasing sevenfold in the three years since diplomatic relations were restored, the number of Americans visiting Cuba has started to fall sharply, bringing with it a sharp drop in incomes.

US tourists arriving to the island by plane have declined by over a third so far this year.

""Even though we're in high season, we're really feeling the drop in US tourists,"" says Claudia Laguna, who is now struggling to keep her rental business in the Miramar district of Havana afloat.

""Europeans hardly leave tips, North Americans leave fantastic tips,"" she adds.

After non-essential staff were evacuated, the embassy stopped issuing visas. Cubans must now travel to the US Embassy in Georgetown, Guyana, to apply for official documents - a journey most cannot afford.

Across the island, tens of thousands of people have seen their plans to emigrate and rejoin family abroad put on indefinite hold.

Maritza Damera, 47, a paediatrician, said she would already be living in New Jersey with her husband and youngest daughter if it wasn't for the drawdown.

""My family is divided. I can't leave, but I'm not working either. I feel like my life is on hold,"" she said from her soviet-style apartment block in East Havana.

Keen to keep relations with the US from unravelling further, the Cuban government's reaction was initially temperate, but as the saga dragged on its statements became increasingly acerbic, accusing Washington of indulging in ""science fiction"".

Carlos Fernández de Cossío, director of US affairs at the Cuban Foreign Ministry, said that even the use of the term ""attack"" was a ""deliberate political manipulation"".

""Up until now the US government has been unable to provide any objective evidence that something happened,"" he said in a recent interview with state media.

Another foreign ministry official, speaking on condition of anonymity, described the episode as a ""falsification"" or ""a feint"" by the old adversary.

""The people who have benefited from this are the hardliners on both sides,"" said former Cuban diplomat, Carlos Alzugaray, pointing to Cuban American rightwingers and factions in the Communist Party wary of rapprochement. ""This is a gift to them.""

He scoffed at claims by unnamed US officials in September that communications intercepts indicate Russia may be behind the attacks, arguing that no third party - Cuban, Floridian or Russian - could attack diplomats on the island without the knowledge of state security: ""If Russia were to do this they'd need authorisation from the Cubans. And if they were to ask us we'd tell them to go to hell.""

Cuban perceptions of the mystery are shaped by past confrontations with the US, which are regularly reprised in the tightly-controlled state media, commemorated in monuments, and taught at schools.

In 1961, the CIA gave mortars to anti-Castro rebels in Eastern Cubato fire at US-controlled Guantanamo Bay Naval Base then blame Cuba for the attack, creating a pretext for intervention. The plotters were foiled by Cuban intelligence.

The same CIA reportedly helped introduce African swine fever to the island in 1971, in an episode of viral warfare that resulted in the culling of half a million pigs.

And Cuba's own diplomats have been attacked: in 1980, a member of the Cuban delegation to the United Nations, was shot dead in New York City by the anti-Castro paramilitary group, Omega 7. To this day, the group's founder, claims he was trained by the CIA.

""Cubans have good reason to be suspicious of the US because of the litany of examples of US officials trying to undermine the Cuban government, from the false flag operations of the early 1960s, to the Bay of Pigs invasion, to the numerous attempts to assassinate Fidel Castro,"" said Jonathan Hansen, a historian at Harvard University. ""Recent reports of sonic or microwave attacks - whether or not they are real - fit right in with this."""
234,the guardian,http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/04/elizabeth-warren-likability-sexism-2020-presidential-race,"Elizabeth Warren, the Massachusetts senator and longtime consumer protection advocate, became the first Democratic candidate to formally enter the 2020 presidential race on Monday, with a New Years Eve announcement that seemed timed to pre-empt the slew of candidacies from her fellow Democrats that are expected in the coming months. In a five-minute video, she stands in her kitchen and emphasizes the injustice of rising economic inequality, an issue she has focused her career on with an almost religious devotion. The Hillary Clinton comparisons followed immediately, with Politico asking just hours later: ""How does Elizabeth Warren avoid a Clinton redux - written off as too unlikeable before her campaign gets off the ground?""

The comparison to Clinton is an odd one, since there is considerable political daylight between the two women. Warren advocates for redistributive efforts far to the left of what Clinton campaigned for, even after her campaign was shifted into a more progressive position following the bruising 2016 primary fight against Bernie Sanders. Warren has called for an end to corporate personhood, has declared trickle-down economics ""a lie"" and has tentatively endorsed a ""Green New Deal"". The two women can seem to have little in common besides a party affiliation and a haircut.

The fact is that Elizabeth Warren is likable. She speaks frankly and in moral terms, avoiding the cajoling sliminess of politicians such as the reptilian Texas senator Ted Cruz, or her probable Democratic primary opponent, New Jersey senator Corey Booker. She is better at avoiding the air of professorial condescension that was sometimes indulged by her fellow former legal scholars Barack Obama and Bill Clinton. At times, she even achieves the unaffected folksiness that endears voters to politicians such as Beto O'Rourke or Ronald Reagan. She has an air of kindly authority that might remind you of your old school teacher - probably because she used to be one.

But none of this is what we mean when we ask whether or not Elizabeth Warren is ""likable"", just as it was not what was meant when that tiresome question was asked about Clinton in the 2016 election cycle. Instead, the question of ""likability"" as it is applied to women candidates has become a kind of cipher through which pundits, strategists and ordinary Americans discuss our collective discomfort with women in power. The claim that a woman candidate is not ""likable"" is a code for saying she defies our shared cultural understanding that power and authority are implicitly male, and that women who claim them are illegitimate, threatening or breaking the rules. If it were possible for Warren to be ""likable"", under this rubric, it would only be if she were able to adhere to prevailing ideas of what is appropriate behavior for her sex - that is, if she were not seeking public office at all.

Of course, there are reasons for committed progressives to dislike Warren. She was a registered Republican in the early 1990s, and in the past she has made enthusiastic proclamations of the virtues of the free market, statements that are likely to strike the Democratic party's left wing as suspicious or naive. Troublingly, she recently made a stupid and unforced error when she took a DNA test to prove her Native American ancestry. The test was meant to dispel Donald Trump's accusation that Warren fabricated her heritage - her calls her ""Pocahontas"" - in order to take advantage of affirmative action programs. It was a smear that was designed by the president to pique the racist enthusiasms of his base, and it worked. But by taking the test, Warren angered Native Americans, who have correctly argued that their culture is more than DNA, and she has made the rookie mistake of engaging with Trump on his own bad-faith terms. If she is to be successful against him in a general election, she will have to learn to deflect his attacks more intelligently, without playing into his hands.

But the biggest obstacle to Warren's candidacy will be sexism, and not only from the trumped-up mobs of rightwingers who are sure to start chanting ""Lock her up"" in reference to her at Trump's next rally. Misogyny is alive and well in the Democratic party; it knows no political affiliation. Much of the sexism that Warren will face will be from Republicans, but it will also come from Democratic voters - men and a few women who are liberals, leftists and progressives. Many of these voters are people who esteem themselves to be feminists or otherwise free of bias, but who will nevertheless find themselves uncomfortable with a woman in power, unable to articulate what it is that bothers them about Elizabeth Warren - except for a vague sense that they just don't like her."
235,the guardian,http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/dec/17/columbia-university-antisemitic-graffiti-jewish-professor-email,"The incident, coupled with the university's response to the murder of Jews in Pittsburgh, has left some students feeling 'deeply uncomfortable'

Everything was business as usual at Columbia University's Teachers College on a Monday morning in mid-December. A single public safety officer sat behind a table at the entrance to Horace Mann Hall, where students clustered inside a towering classroom auditorium. On upper floors, the hallways and offices were quiet and calm.

But less than two weeks before, a Jewish professor who had walked into one of those offices at the Columbia-affiliated graduate school felt afraid: on Elizabeth Midlarsky's walls, someone had spray-painted two bright red swastikas and the derogatory term ""Yid"". The case is still under investigation.

Columbia University, former president Barack Obama's alma mater, has long been synonymous with student activism and progressive values. In American history textbooks, the institution is often mentioned as high school students learn about college protests and strikes during the Vietnam era. That legacy acts as a backdrop for a school whose backbone is made of left-leaning political action, yet whose response to recent racist incidents has been questioned many of its students.

""I will say that walking around campus, there is a sense that when these types of things happen, it could be anybody,"" said Ramsay Eyre, a 19-year-old sophomore at Columbia involved in student council. ""That is a really deeply uncomfortable feeling for a lot of students.""

Eyre added: ""You always think that, being in New York City at one of the world's largest and most liberal universities, that this kind of thing can't happen, but then it happens.""

In the last few months, a disquiet has crept over Columbia's campus. It started after a massacre in Pittsburgh left 11 people dead in an attack that targeted Jews at the Tree of Life synagogue. In an email to students and staff after the attack, Columbia failed to reference Jews or antisemitism, though they did list other vulnerable communities who have been targeted in recent years, including ""worshippers"", ""civil rights and anti-racist protesters"", ""groups gathered to celebrate an LGBT Latin night at Pulse Nightclub"" and two black shoppers shot dead in Kentucky.

The sprawling statement that never explicitly addressed anti-Jewish hate upset many on campus, who voiced concerns on social media and directly to administrators.

""I know a lot of my friends were devastated by that email,"" said Gidon Halbfinger, a Jewish studies major. Columbia's message was eventually revised to reflect the concerns of Jewish students and alumni, but at that point the damage had been done.

Then came the graffiti attack on Midlarsky's office.

""Jews on campus were already feeling a little bit uncomfortable,"" Halbfinger said. ""And then this was a really overt sign that this stuff exists close to home.""

The vandalism comes amid a spike in antisemitic incidents in the United States. Anti-Jewish hate crimes surged by 37% in 2017, according to the FBI.

The Anti-Defamation League's New York and New Jersey chapter has fielded hundreds of calls reporting antisemitic hate speech or hate crimes since the Pittsburgh shooting. Evan Bernstein, the group's regional director, said recent incidents involve everything from harassment, to antisemitism in the classroom, to swastikas on lockers, to antisemitic slurs, to violent assaults.

""We're seeing this uptick in New York, which everyone thinks is this liberal state,"" Bernstein said. ""When you're seeing that kind of rise, especially in schools, that makes me take pause.""

Other New York universities have had swastikas appear on their grounds in recent years, but Bernstein said the hate crime at Columbia was different. Usually, that kind of act is perpetrated in a more public venue, but here it was meant to be up close and personal.

""It was inside the building in someone's intimate space,"" Bernstein said.

Columbia sent another email following the vandalism. This time, Jewish students felt the language was more on par with what the situation deserved.

""The university strongly denounces this antisemitic act that seeks to create fear and to intimidate members of our community,"" the statement read.

But some Columbia students said some professors and administrators still didn't talk to them about the hate crime. Neither Eyre nor Halbfinger could recall a single in-person comment from staff.

Nor were students always vocal themselves. Orit Guggenheim, a Columbia sophomore and the incoming president of Aryeh: Columbia Students Association for Israel, wrote an op-ed for Columbia's student newspaper urging her classmates to care about antisemitism after the Pittsburgh shooting.

She said the attack reinforced her belief that students at Columbia are not interested in addressing anti-Jewish hate as one of the many social causes they promote.

""Besides sporadic Facebook posts on my news feed, there has been again a significant lack of response from my peers,"" Guggenheim said.

Despite a rising tide in antisemitic violence in the US, Guggenheim and Halbfinger, who are both Jewish, said they feel physically safe at Columbia.

But recently a video of a Columbia student went viral after he was recorded in front of the institution's main library screaming: ""White people are the best thing that ever happened to the world."" The student in question, Julian von Abele, has denied that his words were meant to be racist, but they have been interpreted by many as an outburst of white supremacy on Columbia's campus.

The incident is under investigation by the office of student conduct and community standards, and the school released yet another statement in response.

""We are alarmed at the rise of incidents of racism and hate speech in our world today,"" the message read.

To Eyre, these online statements aren't enough. The university administration must recognize that these tendencies toward prejudice are not so far removed from campus.

""We ... think that in some way we live in a bubble that's separate from some of those issues,"" Eyre said. ""And really, we don't."""
236,the guardian,http://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2019/jan/14/another-day-another-reason-to-be-elated-by-congresswoman-alexandria-ocasio-cortez,"Another day, another reason to be elated by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. This time the newly sworn-in congresswoman - who in a matter of weeks has reshaped the political conversation in her own party and a country hit by the longest government shutdown in US history - aims squarely at CBS News. For its lack of black journalists.

Tweeting to her 2.4 million followers, Ocasio-Cortez wrote: ""This [White House] admin has made having a functional understanding of race in America one of the most important core competencies for a political journalist to have, yet CBS News hasn't assigned a *single* black journalist to cover the 2020 election."" In true AOC style - bold, snappy, forthright, instantly meme-able - she added: ""Unacceptable in 2019. Try again.""

Before we wade into the response with the defiance of a student paying homage to The Breakfast Club on a college roof, let's unpick this further. Ocasio-Cortez was responding to a CBS News producer revealing its team covering the 2020 US presidential campaign. Asian, Arab-American and Latino journalists were included, but no black reporter. This matters, not because of some facile quota system that says we need one of each race or it's not true representation. It matters because a functional understanding of race is central to US (and indeed UK) politics. And when the conspicuously absent race happens to be the one discriminated against and weaponised the most, that tells us something, too.

This is why we need people in power, and holding power to account, who know about the complexities of race through lived experience. And it's why it takes someone like Ocasio-Cortez, who is Puerto Rican, to notice, understand and call it out. But oh, how the establishment loathes it when such truths are spoken. Especially by a bright young woman who the right are so obsessed by (ie fear) that Fox News spent more than two hours covering her first five days in Congress.

The response is always some predictable shade of defensiveness. The politics editor of the National Journal, Josh Kraushaar, wrote: ""Another thing AOC has in common with Trump: media scold."" He went on: ""If there aren't strict racial quotas for every batch of hires, does it mean a company is racist?"" To which Ocasio-Cortez patiently explained: ""Do you understand how fundamental the black experience is to American politics? One race isn't substitutable for another. It's not about 'quotas'. It's about understanding the country you're living in.""

A recent New York Times op-ed describes Ocasio-Cortez as ""a potent symbol for a diversifying Democratic party: a young woman of colour who is giving as good as she gets in a political system that has rarely rewarded people who look like her."" Like Barack Obama, Ocasio-Cortez did not choose to be a symbol, but who she is will always count as much as what she says. And, so far, what she says is thrilling."
237,the guardian,http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/dec/31/terry-mcauliffe-2020-president-democrats,"Riding a wave of election victories driven by women and minority candidates and voters, the Democratic party now must choose its next standard-bearer, the candidate who would defeat Donald Trump in a 2020 presidential showdown.

Perhaps noted white man Terry McAuliffe?

The former Virginia governor and longtime party fixture made a case for his potential candidacy on CNN on Sunday, dismissing State of the Union host Dana Bash's challenge that he was being unrealistic about his home-party appeal, ""considering that you are a white man"".

""What do voters want? They want results,"" McAuliffe said, ignoring the premise of the question and going on to pitch himself as a ""southern governor"" who helped lead a Democratic transformation in his state and supported Democratic policy priorities such as healthcare access for all.

""I'm obviously looking at [a run],"" he said, adding: ""I have got time. I have got a lot of great relationships ... I have 40 years of working for this party. I have plenty of friends in many states. So I don't have to rush into this.

""But ... here's the message for Democrats. They don't want an angry liar in the White House. They want someone who is compulsively optimistic and realistic. And the Democrats have to lay out an agenda of success of what we plan to do.""

As the ranks of potential Democratic candidates swell - and leading names such as senators Kamala Harris, Cory Booker, Kristen Gillibrand and Elizabeth Warren build campaign machinery - the question of which candidate is the appropriate face for the party in the upcoming election cycle has sharpened.

Some Democratic advisers, pointing to Hillary Clinton's loss to Trump in 2016, have urged the party toward a pick such as McAuliffe or former vice-president Joe Biden, candidates seen in some quarters as having potentially strong crossover appeal among independents and moderate Republicans.

Opposing counsel within the party, however, describes that view as exactly wrong, pointing to Barack Obama's consecutive victories as evidence that the candidate matters more than identity politics and pointing out that Trump's 2016 win was a warning to avoid the establishment.

By this view, a candidate such as McAuliffe, a former Democratic National Committee chairman who ran campaigns for both Clintons, does not represent the future of a party with which 56% of women, 84% of black voters and 63% of Hispanic voters identify, according to Pew.

The crowd of Democrats making preparations for 2020 offers voters a range of options. Harris, a former state attorney general of Jamaican and Indian Tamil descent, has already selected a campaign manager and has narrowed her choice of campaign headquarters down to two cities, the New York Times reported.

Booker, the first African American US senator from New Jersey, is building operations in the early voting state of Iowa, as the Guardian reported in September.

Warren, the first woman US senator from Massachusetts, is hiring staff and reviewing her past writings and speeches for vulnerabilities of the kind that could emerge under the thousand-watt glare of a presidential campaign.

Gillibrand, who replaced Clinton in the Senate, is considering campaign manager candidates, the Times said.

Half-a-tier below is Beto O'Rourke, the Texas representative who mounted an unexpectedly robust challenge to US senator Ted Cruz in 2018, and who is seen as capable of energizing the Democratic party grassroots while possibly repeating his trick of appealing to Republicans.

Bernie Sanders, the independent Vermont senator, has demonstrated broad electoral appeal with particular strength among voters looking outside the establishment.

Early polling of the potential Democratic field has found Biden ahead of the pack, although that result reflects the longtime senator and former vice-president's unusually strong name recognition.

Looming over the selection process is Trump, whose anemic approval rating of about 41%, on average, makes him an extremely vulnerable incumbent.

But the president's nasty political style could inform voter opinions about the best candidate to take him on: a sunny figure like Booker, who might hew to the high road, or a more enthusiastic scrapper such as Warren or Harris, both of whom have leveled damaging critiques at the president.

If none of those options fits, the answer may be waiting in the wings.

""So my argument would be, I am a governor,"" McAuliffe said on CNN. ""I was a southern governor, and at a time of very few statewide elected officials. And I took a state that was red. All statewide were Republicans, and when I left office, all Democrats. We are now a blue state.

""Why? Because we delivered on the things that matter to the voters in this country."""
238,the guardian,http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/06/black-woman-donald-trump-democrats-kamala-harris,"Life, as Donald Trump has known it for the last two years, has just changed forever. Quagmired in a government shutdown of his own making, Trump's ability to manipulate his world is already severely constrained in this very new year. The more he struggles against his new surroundings, the more he sinks.

Last week the president could only watch his beloved cable news channels as a bystander to the biggest tectonic shifts, as the Democrats took control of the House of Representatives and Senator Elizabeth Warren became the first candidate to officially emerge to run against him next year. And it won't be long before the House launches several investigations into corruption and incompetence, while the Mueller investigation continues to tighten several nooses around all things Trumpian.

So it may be early, but it's not too soon to survey who is best placed to eject Trump from the White House, if indeed the 45th president makes it that far.

It's no coincidence that the first candidate to emerge against Trump - and enrage him - is a woman. Warren, the Massachusetts senator, represents at least two constituencies that have driven grassroots politics over the last decade.

That is something Trump should recognise from his own campaign. Almost every US election since 2006 has been defined by a wave of voters seeking change, especially in the shape of a new candidate promising to reform a broken system.

Nancy Pelosi swept to power as House speaker first in 2006 amid the disaster of President Bush's second term, and she returned this week to the same position promising adult supervision of an even more calamitous Republican. Each cycle in between - with the exception of Obama's reelection in 2012 - has seen the same dynamic of turfing out incumbents in the pursuit of hope and change.

Warren has long given voice and academic heft to the argument that the root cause of the broken system is a broken economy, skewed by Wall Street and the super-wealthy. But on that basis, as with most other policies, she will find herself in a crowded space with most of the other Democrats who will join her in this contest.

The second factor propelling Warren's candidacy is the dramatic political turn in November's midterms: the sharp shift among women voters. Democrats held a 19-point advantage among women, according to the exit polls, six points higher than two years earlier. In particular, Democrats moved from a nine-point loss among white women to parity with Republicans as married women shifted allegiance.

This is not a trend that Trump knows how to stop. In fact, his reaction to Warren's candidacy only underscores his limited grasp of the shifting political realities that kicked his own party out of power late last year. He told Fox News this week that ""you'd have to ask her psychiatrist"" to know if Warren believes she can win, and he continued to troll her on Twitter about her Native American family roots.

Outside Trump's wall of delusion and distractions, a host of strong women candidates is poised to join Warren. Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota have often found themselves entirely misjudged by the men around them. Gillibrand was considered vulnerable in her first Senate election in 2010, but she trounced all comers in all of her contests. Klobuchar proved more than a match for the clumsy bullying of supreme court nominee - now Justice - Brett Kavanaugh last year.

But one likely candidate particularly intrigues. Kamala Harris embodies the driving force pushing Democrats to record turnouts in non-presidential contests over the last two years: women of colour. The California senator has served just two years in Congress - like the last freshman senator to win the Democratic nomination, in 2008. But unlike Barack Obama, Harris has a very significant record of public service in her pre-Senate career, serving as her state's attorney general for six years and as San Francisco's district attorney for seven years.

While all the Democratic candidates can appeal beyond their own demographics, personal perspectives can and do influence political character. There's no mystery about why Trump performs so well with older white men. And there should be no surprise that Harris - the daughter of Indian and Jamaican immigrants - has already won the overwhelming support and respect of influential women of colour who will help shape the Democratic primaries.

Harris, like the other candidates of colour, will face the same questions Obama did in 2008 about appealing to the white working-class voters across the rust-belt states that Hillary Clinton narrowly lost to Trump. However, working-class challenges are most acutely experienced by minorities, and each of the former industrial states that tipped the 2016 election - Pennsylvania, Michigan, Wisconsin - have diverse electorates that shifted decisively against Trump last year.

The test for Harris, and all the other Democrats, is whether she can effectively demonstrate that she is listening and responding to those voters in order to overcome the culture wars that Trump will happily wage. Obama succeeded in 2008 by showing he was the adult in the middle of a financial crisis. He succeeded again in 2012, by showing Mitt Romney was out of touch with economic reality. If anything, Trump fills both boxes even more snugly than his predecessors.

Well before the general election, the candidates will need to navigate the primary and caucus voters, where Democrats - even in less diverse states like Iowa - tend to be more progressive and want more change, not less. There's no reason to think a candidate of colour cannot succeed there, where Obama did in 2008. The biggest difference this time around is that the largest state of all has moved forward its primary - with all its nominating delegates - to March, three months ahead of where it used to be. That state, California, is home to Kamala Harris.

All the challengers will claim they can appeal to working-class and middle-class voters with more affordable healthcare and education, and a fairer economy. The key primary test for all candidates will be who can best take the fight to Trump while still talking to voters beyond the reach of his tweets.

In politics they say you should never wrestle with a pig, but the desire to stay clean did little for Trump's opponents in 2016. Voters expect their candidates to stand up for themselves while still talking about what matters in their lives. The test for the female (and male) candidates of 2020 is how to sling mud without getting stuck in it.

Outside the National Archives in Washington, a sign says ""Closed.""

""We're sorry,"" it reads. ""Due to the shutdown of the federal government, the Washington DC facility is closed.""

This museum is not alone; government-funded Smithsonian museums in New York and Washington, as well as the National Zoo, are closed due to a partial government shutdown, which kicked off on 22 December over border security issues, forcing thousands of federal workers to work without pay or take unpaid time off.

""We can't reopen until we have a federal budget, so it all depends on a call from the White House,"" said Linda St Thomas, the chief spokesperson of the Smithsonian Institution. ""When we get federal funding, we will reopen immediately.""

All 19 museums, including the National History Museum, the African Art Museum and the Portrait Gallery, are losing out on a great number of visitors. They're accustomed to drawing 1 million visitors a month, according to St Thomas.

""We go by month, it depends on the weather,"" she said. ""I think it's roughly 1 million visitors for all 19 museums for the month of January.""

All special events and programs, including lectures and films scheduled at the museums has been postponed until after the shutdown or are cancelled. The highly coveted exhibits - including the Oprah Winfrey retrospective at the National Museum of African American History and Culture, and the presidential portrait of Barack Obama at the National Portrait Gallery - will resume after funding is restored.

The US Botanic Garden in Washington is also open daily, ""having been funded for the fiscal year"", said Devin Dotson, its head of public affairs. ""We continue to welcome visitors from across the United States and around the world to explore our collection.""

The estimated 2019 budget for all Smithsonian museums is $957m. The funding includes a multi-million dollar roof repair of the Hazy Center, a renovation of thew National Air and Space Museum, funding to fix the ongoing infrastructure at the National Zoo and a renovation of the west wing at the National Museum of American History.

In the meantime, the Washington tourism board is trying to shed light on other attractions for culture-seeking visitors; like the food scene and live sport (which may or may not satisfy art aficionados).

""While we're disappointed the Smithsonian museums are closed, the vast majority of things for visitors to see and do throughout Washington's neighborhoods remain open,"" said Elliott L Ferguson II, president and CEO of Destination DC. ""It's a great time to find a deal in the city and explore our Michelin-rated dining scene, watch a hockey or basketball game at Capitol One Arena or catch a show at one of the city's many venues.""

Other museums are still open, including the National Museum of Women in the Arts, the Phillips Collection, the Museum of the Bible and National Law Enforcement Museum. The Newseum, a museum devoted to journalism, announced yesterday that they are offering free admission to federal employees during the shutdown.

While the National Zoo is closed, the Smithsonian claims ""essential personnel"" are on site to care for the animals during the shutdown, though they remain closed to the public.

Museum-goers remain disappointed by the closure, by what it represents to museum workers and arts administrators.

""This administration has made it clear through budget cuts and ignorant tweets that the arts and cultural education are of little value or importance,"" said Whitney Bell, a Los Angeles-based artist, writer and founder of a talk series called The Stories Of Women.

""Hundreds of thousands of jobs furloughed and millions of Americans left without access to our most important cultural institutions, historic landmarks and influential art, and for what?"" she asks.

""A xenophobic wall that flies in the face of the melting-pot ideology this country was built on. This, like everything else Trump has done, is designed to whip up and manipulate fear to further an agenda that only protects his pitiful legacy, at the expense of the American people."""

'remember when i was like hey i have no tears left to cry and the universe was like HAAAAAAAAA bitch u thought,"" Ariana Grande confided in her 59.4 million Twitter followers last month. It was the kind of darkly funny self-deprecation her fans have come to know and love - more like a text you'd send to your best friend than to a group as big as the population of Italy.

This has been the worst year of her life, as a visibly emotional Grande herself said when she accepted the woman of the year award at the Billboard Women in Music awards recently. Released in April, her single No Tears Left to Cry marked her return to music after the terror attack at her Manchester concert in May 2017. Earlier this year, she ended her two-year relationship with the rapper Mac Miller after his substance abuse became, in her words, ""toxic"" (he died of an accidental overdose in September). The following month, after a highly public whirlwind romance, Grande called off a short-lived engagement to the Saturday Night Live comedian Pete Davidson.

But it has also been her biggest year professionally. Her fourth album, Sweetener, was widely acclaimed and will be up for best pop vocal album at the 2019 Grammy awards. A new, non-album single, Thank U, Next, has broken streaming records; an album of the same name is promised imminently. In March, she will embark on a world tour, promising a special show for Manchester.

In the throes of personal upheaval and heartbreak - not to mention the workaday grind - Grande has not only found resilience but sought to spread it. Her One Love Manchester concert raised £17m for victims and their families. Three months later, while still experiencing post-traumatic stress disorder and anxiety, she performed at the Concert for Charlottesville benefit for victims of an attack at a far-right rally in Virginia. This March, she met survivors of the Parkland, Florida school shooting at the March for Our Lives in Washington DC.

Grande has aligned herself with Black Lives Matter, against Trump, and for gun reform and gender equality. She articulated her post-Manchester philosophy to Elle magazine as trying ""to spread the fucking light"". She went on: ""Not everyone is going to agree ... but that doesn't mean I'm just going to shut up and sing my songs. I'm also going to be a human being who cares about other human beings; to be an ally and use my privilege to help educate people.""

Musically, too, she has turned towards the light. Sweetener is a steadfast expression of optimism, its title track a reference to seeking out and savouring the good. On Thank U, Next, she expresses gratitude for the lessons of her past relationships - including that with Davidson, only three weeks after their split. One fan tweeted: ""Who is Ariana's therapist and are they accepting new clients?""

Almost every review and interview has marvelled at her fortitude - she is the inverse of the archetypal child star who grows up without coping mechanisms. A former Broadway and Nickelodeon performer, Grande has been in showbusiness for close to half her life. But the events of the last 18 months make it easy to forget that her public image was once not so at odds with that of the young star warped by early fame.

In 2014, the media gossip site Gawker proclaimed, 21-year-old Grande ""went from 'that girl from Nickelodeon' to one of the biggest divas on the planet. Allegedly."" It detailed (largely unsubstantiated) rumours that she had shoved a TV presenter to get her good side on camera, employed a personal water attendant, made fans at a meet-and-greet cry and wished that another crowd of fans would ""all fucking die"". Jezebel embraced with gusto the tabloid rumour that Grande demanded to be ""literally carried like a baby"" by her staff, eventually claiming to substantiate it with ""OVERWHELMING photographic evidence"".

Whether Grande's reputation at this time was deserved is unclear (she did edit the caption of a photograph showing her being carried to clarify that her ""toes were LITERALLY BLEEDING""). But ""diva"" was an appropriate label in one sense: Grande's 2013 debut album, Yours Truly, laboured to communicate her mastery of a virtuoso vocal range that has been compared to Mariah Carey, often at the expense of the songs and, infamously, the enunciation. With her public image little more developed than that of a little girl with a big voice, it was easily distorted by what became known as ""donutgate"".

In July 2015, TMZ published security footage of Grande, then 22, larking about in a California doughnut shop with her new boyfriend. She licked a doughnut she hadn't paid for and remarked: ""I hate Americans. I hate America."" The shop's health rating was lowered and the owner said he thought Grande should be charged; a former Miss Kansas said she was ""disgusted that someone can lack so much decency"".

Looking back, the outrage reflects either a more innocent time or an early indicator of today's ""alternative facts"" bubble. Grande apologised for her word choice, saying she was expressing frustration at high child obesity rates in the US - a PR move that raised eyebrows but not her reputation. The 2016 DNC email hack revealed that ""donutgate"" cost her a gig at the Obama White House.

Yet, for all her notoriety among gossip bloggers and rightwing pundits, Grande was not quite a household name when her Manchester concert was attacked. By then she had pivoted to cheeky, forthright pop on her well-received third album, Dangerous Woman, landing her somewhere between demure Taylor Swift and the more daring Demi Lovato in the layperson's pop-star nexus.

The suicide bomber struck in the foyer at 10.30pm on 22 May 2017, just after the encore. Twenty-three people were killed and 139 wounded. Grande's mother, Joan, was in the audience, desperately searching for her child. ""Everyone was leaving, and I was going towards the stage,"" she told Elle. ""Those minutes when you don't know what's happening - there are no words."" Grande's statement to her fans that night momentarily became the most-liked tweet in history: ""broken. from the bottom of my heart, i am so so sorry. i don't have words.""

As the New York Times critic Jon Pareles wrote in his review of Sweetener: ""No pop career should ever have a terrorist attack as a milestone."" But it is undeniable that Grande's response to the Manchester bombing changed her public image. She struck a stateswomanly figure at the star-studded One Love event, defiantly performing her raunchiest hits at the request of one victim's mother after the Daily Mail suggested that the bomber targeted the concert because of her sexualised aesthetic. She closed with a stripped-back rendition of Somewhere Over the Rainbow that was no less moving for its technical prowess. Her image - until recently subject to definition by other people - came into focus as standing for courage, integrity, resilience, hope.

Even Piers Morgan, never one to let go of a stick with which to beat women, admitted to having ""misjudged her"". She was weeks shy of her 24th birthday. ""We put a lot on her shoulders,"" said her manager, Scooter Braun. ""And she took over. You know, for the rest of her life, she can say that she is exactly who she claims to be."" The following month she was made the first honorary Mancunian, the city council moving unanimously to recognise the contribution of this ""young American woman for whom it would have been understandable if she never wanted to see this place again"".

Speculation that her new music might be maudlin by the weight of what it had to acknowledge proved misplaced. Lingering on ""the absolute worst of humanity"" would give it power, she told Time: ""The last thing I would ever want is for my fans to see something like that happen and think it won."" With Sweetener, Grande embraced joy without pretending it was easy. Working with Pharrell and producer Max Martin, she landed on a looser, more idiosyncratic sound, placing emotional acuity above vocal technique. ""Here is my bleeding heart, and here is a trap beat behind it,"" is how she characterised it.

Critic Lindsay Zoladz named Sweetener the year's pop album to beat: ""A defiant record, chronicling both the difficulty and necessity of choosing to be happy."" Grande has credited this defiance to more than a decade in therapy, first dating to her parents' divorce and ramped up post-Manchester. The tweet shouting out her therapist was ""funny as fuck"", she replied, ""but in all honesty, therapy has saved my life so many times. if you're afraid to ask for help, don't be.""

Part of that work, Grande has said, has been advocating for good despite the risk of backlash - and, tellingly, doing so not just as a fundraising figurehead, but in small interactions that reflect a commitment to acting with integrity. When a fan linked Miller's drink-driving charge to Grande's having ""dumped him for another dude"" as ""just the most heartbreaking thing happening in Hollywood"", Grande addressed the fan in a searing but respectful shutdown: ""shaming/blaming women for a man's inability to keep his shit together is a very major problem. let's please stop doing that.""

She was similarly scathing of Morgan's criticism of Little Mix's nude album shoot last month: ""i look forward to the day you realize there are other ways to go about making yourself relevant than to criticize young, beautiful, successful women for everything they do"". Such ""clapbacks"" are a well-established currency of the celebrity ecosystem, but at a time when the highest-profile celebrities - Beyoncé, Taylor Swift, Adele - are defined by their silence, Grande explains herself, and even apologises.

When, in July, her fans questioned a tasteless joke by Davidson (he said, to demonstrate Grande's celebrity: ""Britney Spears didn't have a terrorist attack at her concert""), Grande engaged. ""This has been v tough and conflicting on my heart,"" she tweeted (and, more recently, deleted). "" ... I, of course, didn't find it funny."" This month, chided by Kanye West for seeming to dismiss his mental illness to promote her new song Imagine she apologised for the ""probably insensitive"" remark without conceding much: ""With all due respect, i don't need to use anyone to promote anything. period.""

Gossip blogger Elaine Lui, once one of Grande's least sympathetic commentators, wrote approvingly of the woman emerging from ""the girl who got caught on camera licking donuts"". Lui wrote: ""She is showing how you can move on from it and organically change the way you are perceived without it feeling like she's putting on and discarding personalities for convenience."" Thank U, Next felt like the culmination of that work. When it appeared a few weeks after the end of her engagement, it was reasonable to expect a scorched-earth diss about moving on to better things. Instead it was a beatific thank you from Grande to her exes. ""Rather than zap the pain from memory, Grande assesses the damage and rebuilds from the ground up,"" wrote Vulture, naming it the best song of 2018. At the time of writing it has spent five weeks on top of the Billboard Hot 100, the first single by a female artist to do so since Sia's Cheap Thrills in August 2016, and six weeks at No 1 in the UK.

The song's much-hyped, big-budget ""video event"", spoofing teen movies Mean Girls, Legally Blonde, 13 Going on 30 and Bring It On, also broke a number of records, but by perpetuating archetypes rather than subverting them, it threatened to overshadow the lyrics' quietly revolutionary sentiment. Similarly, another recent YouTube partnership, the Dangerous Woman Tour Diaries, was uncompelling, Grande's presence unfocused in the meandering, PR-drawn definition of ""documentary"". It suggests a risk that the forthrightness that make her so compelling could become more distant as her star rises.

For now, Grande burns bright as a symbol of resilience: a young woman who defied the belittling diva narrative; who says she emerged from tragedy ""loving a bit more fearlessly"" than she did before; who named a song after her then-very-new fiance because, as she put it, ""i been the fuck thru it and life's too short to be cryptic n shit about something as beautiful as this love"" - and who stayed strong when that soured, too. The question of whether celebrities are role models by default seems quaint when the US president reportedly ran for office to boost his own profile above that of Gwen Stefani. But Grande's resolute, clear-eyed optimism represents a different way to be: that it is possible to choose to be hopeful, even when that seems futile.

""Sometimes it's kind of just about being the light in a situation,"" said Grande of the power of pop music. The same could be said of the space she has created for herself in contemporary culture. Whether she caught wind of a society-wide turn towards hope or sparked it herself, it seems to be spreading. Some of this year's biggest songs - the 1975's Love It If We Made It; Bastille and Marshmello's collaboration with its chorus, ""I want you to be happier"" - were earnest expressions of hope in an uncertain future. Avengers: Infinity War, Mission: Impossible - Fallout and Deadpool 2 had storylines about the rewards of acting with kindness and empathy. Even Pantone said its colour of the year - a vibrant burnt coral, carefully chosen to represent ""a feeling that's out there in the zeitgeist"" - symbolises ""our innate need for optimism"".

Perhaps Grande realised its importance sooner than everyone else. Accepting Billboard's woman of the year award, she said she may well be at the peak of her artistry, ""but as far as my personal life goes I really have no idea what the fuck I'm doing"". She continued, her voice thickening: ""I just want to say that if you're someone out there who has no idea what this next chapter is going to bring, you're not alone in that."" Then she pulled herself together and beamed. ""Ew. I'm not going to cry."""
241,the guardian,http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jan/13/john-delaney-don-quixote-american-dream-president-2020,"The former congressman and multimillionaire insists he can unite the party and take the White House back from Trump

At an old electricity substation in north-west Washington, perhaps fittingly for the Donald Trump era, colourful murals of John F Kennedy have disappeared behind wooden boards for months, due to construction work. But a few minutes' walk away, past a Metro station, a bland shopping mall and the Maryland border, is the new election campaign headquarters of a man working hard and spending big in an attempt to assume the Kennedy mantle.

Elizabeth Warren, Tulsi Gabbard and Julián Castro may now have stolen his thunder, but former congressman John Delaney was the first Democrat with national political experience to formally announce a 2020 presidential campaign. Hoping to prove that the early bird catches the worm, he did so all the way back in July 2017. He has been hustling for votes ever since, with a Kennedy-inspired message of common purpose. Critics, opinion polls and his campaign Twitter account (with just 12,000 followers) suggest he is more Don Quixote, embarked on a romantic but doomed quest.

Delaney has made 21 trips to Iowa, the first caucus state, visiting all 99 counties and making 214 stops. He has also made 10 trips to New Hampshire, the first primary state, visiting seven counties and making 96 stops. Having spent $3.5m, recruited staff and opened offices, he has become Exhibit A for America's never-ending campaign, in stark contrast to the UK and other countries where general elections take a month or two, four or five years apart.

""I do think our election cycles are very long and I don't think that's great,"" admits the affable Delaney. But he reasons: ""The presidency of the United States is a very unique elected position. So if anything merits a longer vetting process, the presidency does to some extent. In general our election cycles are too long, but this job is so consequential that I don't think it's a bad thing to give people more time to get to know you.""

Weren't people sick of politics after the traumatic 2016 election? Not a bit of it.

""People were totally excited to talk about 2020,"" he says. ""Democrats are quite excited to turn the page on the current president, so for most it's not too early to talk about 2020. Most Democrats are not saying, 'Well, let's give this guy a chance.' They're way past that. The notion of who's going to be our nominee in 2020 and how do we beat him is something every Democrat in this country really wants to talk about.""

'A sense of stewardship'

Another much scrutinised quirk of the American electoral system is the arbitrary power of Iowa and New Hampshire, neither representative of the country's racial diversity. Warren, a Massachusetts senator and the first major candidate to enter the contest after announcing an exploratory committee, earlier this month campaigned in Iowa until she went hoarse. There are still more than 650 days until election day.

Again, Delaney defends a process that requires politicians to meet voters in their living rooms and coffee shops rather than run nationally.

""If you had a primary on one day and everyone voted the same day they"" - he points to a big flatscreen TV showing cable news - ""would determine the nominees. So I think there's a valuable role for a few states to go early and the states have to be of a size that you can actually campaign in them. You can't campaign in California in a grassroots way. It's too big.

""Iowa and New Hampshire fit that size, and you get the sense that the people who are engaged in politics in Iowa and New Hampshire carry a sense of stewardship with them of the role they play. They don't actually think they pick the president. They think they ask the right questions and there's a valuable role for that.""

Delaney backed Hillary Clinton last time but offers an unexpected criticism: ""Neither Hillary or Bernie [Sanders] campaigned in Iowa or New Hampshire the way you're supposed to. They came and did big events. That's not what the people expect. They expect to sit down in small group gatherings and ask you questions.""

Recent research by the New York Times found that American elections have always been long, drawn out affairs by international standards. In 1960, Kennedy declared his candidacy 11 months before polling day. In 1992, Bill Clinton threw his hat in the ring more than a year ahead of the vote. For 2008, Republican John McCain formed his exploratory committee in November 2006. Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton launched theirs in January 2007.

For the epic 2016 election, it was December 2014 when Republican establishment favourite Jeb Bush said he would ""actively explore"" a bid. Senator Ted Cruz was the first major candidate to formally announce, in March 2015. Clinton entered the race a month later, followed in June by Trump's now infamous descent on a Trump Tower escalator.

Delaney, however, has broken all records for hitting the ground running. His logic is simple: name recognition.

""I think I'm the right person for the job,"" he said, ""and I have the right vision, but not enough people knew who I was and so the way to solve that problem is to get in early. To some extent the race is starting now and I had to almost run a pre-race so that I was in the game when the race started.""

Even so, it appears he will soon be joined by enough Democratic candidates to constitute a football team and a Broadway chorus. When Delaney finds himself on a crowded debate stage, how will he try to stand out? ""You have to have tremendous clarity as to why you're running for president,"" he said.

And why are you? ""The central issue facing this country is how deeply divided we are and someone has to bring us together so that we can actually do the kind of things we need to do to prepare our country for the future. The world is changing so fast and we're just sitting on our hands and unless we actually get back to this notion of common purpose - which doesn't mean we agree with each other on everything, far from it, we should have great debates - but some notion of common purpose, I really worry about our future.""

Among his ideas is getting the president to debate on the floor of the House of Representatives four times a year, similar to prime minister's questions in the UK.

""That would fundamentally change how the American people think about these issues and think about their leaders and think about common ground,"" he says. ""Everything can change. We've seen that across history. Trends that you think are unshakeable get shaken, so we can change these trends. We just have to be committed to do it.""

Delaney is the author of a book, The Right Answer, the title of which refers to a 1958 speech in which Kennedy said: ""Let us not seek the Republican answer or the Democratic answer but the right answer."" He is hoping to provide the antidote to the current hyperpartisan malaise.

Viable candidates also need a personal narrative and Delaney has one. ""I think I have the perfect background,"" he insists, while admitting he is hardly objective. Born and raised in New Jersey, the son of an electrician, he describes himself as ""a blue-collar kid, first in the family to go to college"", who went on to found two financial companies, becoming the youngest chief executive on the New York stock exchange.

In 2012 Delaney ""rolled up my sleeves and went into the Congress"", showing willingness to work across the aisle. ""I've had the experiences you need,"" he says. ""I've lived the American dream. I know how the private sector works, but we should never elect someone who's never done public service as our our president, and I think we're seeing that with our current president.""

A hard sell to the left?

A father of four daughters who enjoys watching the Washington Capitals ice hockey team, Delaney was the sixth-richest member of Congress with an estimated net worth of $93m. He is friends with Tom Steyer, the billionaire philanthropist seeking Trump's impeachment. His plush new campaign HQ in Friendship Heights, with campaign posters decorating cubicles for 35 staff, shares a floor with RBC Wealth Management.

All of which means that the white, male 55-year-old centrist is a hard sell to the left. The progressive group Democracy for America's first presidential pulse poll was led by Sanders on 36.14%, followed by former vice-president Joe Biden at 14.87%. Delaney limped in 22nd, on 0.09%.

Asked if Sanders or Warren can win the nomination, he replies carefully: ""I think that someone who comes forth and wants to build a big tent party has a better chance of winning.

""If we as a Democratic party say we're going to become the party the American people are looking for, which is a party that's honest, civil, respectful, focusing on common ground, positive, optimistic and has big ideas about the future and welcomes progressives, centrists and disaffected Republicans, I think we'll run the table in 2020. If we step forward and say we're going to be the party of 'half the country is wrong about everything they believe' and drive further divisions, then we're not going to win.""

Delaney is likely to be up against African American candidates such as senators Cory Booker and Kamala Harris. There are some who argue that a person of his gender and race is the last thing the party, which just elected its most diverse contingent to the House, needs in 2020.

""If people feel that way, I respect their views,"" he says. ""I think their reasons for feeling that way are good intentions. Do I think that is where the whole party is? No, and that's for the Democratic voters. I tend to think that the American people in general and the Democratic party voters in particular make a deeper analysis of who they're looking for.

""You could have someone who's an African American running for president who doesn't stand for any of the things that the Democratic party stands for. I just don't think the Democratic party is going to vote for someone because of the colour of their skin. They care about their values. They care what they're going to fight for. They care about their vision for the future."""
242,the guardian,http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/dec/31/white-house-press-briefings-demise,"Laptops and phones, winter coats and scarves, a hubbub of different languages. A row of cameras sits on a bench. John Roberts of Fox News has a steely expression as he clutches a mic. Jim Acosta of CNN, press pass reinstated after his run-in with the president last year, speaks simultaneously to his own viewers: ""We'll see how much time we have Sarah Sanders. As we've seen in recent weeks, these briefings can end very quickly.""

Then a voice on the public-address system: ""The press briefing will begin at 1.20pm. Thank you."" The hundred-or-so journalists crammed into the seats and aisles erupt in knowing laughs and groans. Sanders eventually enters at 1.35pm. It will be the White House press secretary's sole briefing in the whole of November - a paltry total she will match in December.

The question-and-answer session was described as must-see television in the early months of the Trump administration, gripping millions of viewers and earning the accolade of parody on the TV variety show Saturday Night Live. But now the daily press briefing is no more. It has effectively become a monthly press briefing, raising concerns that it might soon disappear altogether.

""That would be a tragedy and a campaign point in 2020,"" said Anthony Scaramucci, who served as White House communications director for 11 days in 2017. ""I pray that that does not happen. For the president to be successful, you don't want that to be a campaign talking point in 2020. The American people intuitively know that there needs to be an open communication between the White House and the free press.""

The first official White House press secretary was George Akerson under President Herbert Hoover in 1929. In recent decades the position became best known to the outside world for the briefing, in which the press secretary stands at a podium and fields questions from reporters in a briefing room (formerly a swimming pool) in the west wing.

Few have made such an explosive start as Sean Spicer, whose debut briefing in January 2017 included a tirade at the media and the now-infamous assertion about Donald Trump's inauguration: ""This was the largest audience to ever witness an inauguration - period - both in person and around the globe.""

Spicer's briefings became a compulsive, car-crash spectacle. There was fluster, ill-fitting suits, gaffes such as ""Holocaust centres"" and Melissa McCarthy's deathless impression of him with motorised lectern on Saturday Night Live. Scaramucci said: ""They were must-watch television because he made a decision that he was going to lie and so everyone knew he was lying. There was a contradiction to the press briefing. Every Spice Girl has a nickname. His was Liar Spice.""

When Spicer was replaced by Sarah Sanders, the ship steadied, even though the falsehoods and acrimonious exchanges did not. Briefings became scarcer and lost the old momentum. It was like a long-running TV series that had passed its prime but did not know when to quit.

Sanders gave 11 briefings in January, seven in February, eight in March, eight in April, eight in May, five in June, three in July, five in August, one in September, two in October and one in November, making a total of 59, according to a count by Martha Joynt Kumar, director of the White House Transition Project. Each of the last three was alongside other officials, not on her own.

Over the comparable period in 2010, Barack Obama's press secretary, Robert Gibbs, held 95 briefings, Kumar's research found. And from January to November 2002, George W Bush's press secretary, Ari Fleischer, held a total of 85 briefings.

Sanders is not only more infrequent but also terser. Her briefings were usually around 15 to 18 minutes, according to Kumar, whereas Gibbs's were usually around an hour and Fleischer's were about 25 minutes.

The shift coincides with the press enjoying increasing access to Trump himself. It has become a ritual for the president to stop on the South Lawn and take questions from a scrum of media, albeit competing with the roar of the Marine One helicopter, before he boards and flies away. Combined with his insatiable tweeting, he has effectively rendered the press secretary close to redundant.

Kumar writes: ""The basic finding is that Sarah Sanders doesn't give briefings when Trump is doing multiple interviews and Q&As. October is a clear, though somewhat extreme, example. Together, Trump gave 71 interviews and short Q&As and she gave two briefings. In January, on the other hand, she gave 11 briefings and he did a total of 15 interviews and Q&As.""

The White House Correspondents Association has raised the issue with the administration. Olivier Knox, its president and author of a 2013 article headlined ""Save the (terrible) White House briefing"", said: ""It's largely happened with the president of the United States being significantly more available in terms of taking questions from reporters on the South Lawn and in a series of interviews. He's become much more his own spokesman.

""I don't know any White House reporter who thinks the president should take fewer questions. It's a little bit messy but that's to be expected. I don't know if they know they can ask the marines to turn off the helicopter.""

But the decline of briefings by the press secretary is concerning, Knox argues. ""The people who are hurt the most are the smaller news outlets. If you're down to one, two or three people in your Washington bureau, having a set time when the White House is available for questions is important.""

Scaramucci, who during his brief tenure insisted that live TV coverage of the briefings should resume, said: ""Any time that the press can talk to the principal and can talk to the principal in volume, which has been experienced in this White House, is in general a very good thing for free press. I would, however, caution that it is still necessary for the comms team to have a regular interaction with the press because there are many things that go on inside the White House and the administration that the comms team and the press secretary need to discuss that is perhaps different from the principal.

""So it's not a great excuse to use the accessibility of the principal as an alibi for having less press conferences.""

Trump's freewheeling question-and-answer sessions, interviews and tweets, along with a steady flow of White House leaks, have arguably made this the most transparent presidency in American history. Yet in other ways this administration, with its flouting of norms and lurches from crisis to crisis, is also the most opaque.

Mike McCurry, who was press secretary to President Bill Clinton in the pre-Twitter 1990s, said: ""If you have a president who gives you his innermost thoughts by tweets, why do you need a spokesperson to amplify what the president has already told you? But there's an accountability function where the press has an opportunity to ask about federal government and all the other things going on.

""It was religious that we would do some kind of briefing every day. It was sacrosanct that someone would stand up at the White House every day and answer questions as an essential part of American democracy. The idea you could go a month without a briefing is astonishing."""
243,the guardian,http://www.theguardian.com/law/2019/jan/04/trump-administration-un-human-rights-violations,"The Trump administration has stopped cooperating with UN investigators over potential human rights violations occurring inside America, in a move that delivers a major blow to vulnerable US communities and sends a dangerous signal to authoritarian regimes around the world.

Quietly and unnoticed, the state department has ceased to respond to official complaints from UN special rapporteurs, the network of independent experts who act as global watchdogs on fundamental issues such as poverty, migration, freedom of expression and justice. There has been no response to any such formal query since 7 May 2018, with at least 13 requests going unanswered.

Nor has the Trump administration extended any invitation to a UN monitor to visit the US to investigate human rights inside the country since the start of Donald Trump's term two years ago in January 2017. Two UN experts have made official fact-finding visits under his watch - the special rapporteurs on extreme poverty and privacy - but both were invited initially by Barack Obama, who hosted 16 such visits during his presidency.

The silent treatment being meted out to key players in the UN's system for advancing human rights marks a stark break with US practice going back decades. Though some areas of American public life have consistently been ruled out of bounds to UN investigators - US prisons and the detention camp on Guantánamo Bay are deemed off-limits - Washington has in general welcomed monitors into the US as part of a wider commitment to upholding international norms.

Jamil Dakwar, director of the American Civil Liberties Union's human rights program, said the shift gave the impression the US was no longer serious about honoring its own human rights obligations. The ripple effect around the world would be dire.

""They are sending a very dangerous message to other countries: that if you don't cooperate with UN experts they will just go away. That's a serious setback to the system created after World War II to ensure that domestic human rights violations could no longer be seen as an internal matter,"" Dakwar said.

Among the formal approaches that have failed to receive a response from the US over the past several months are queries about family separation of Central Americans at the US border with Mexico, death threats against a transgender activist in Seattle and allegations of anti-gay bias in the sentencing to death of a prisoner in South Dakota.

The new breach with international experts comes at a perilous moment for the US, both externally and within its own borders. Externally, Trump has forged an increasingly unilateral path on foreign policy: in June he shocked the world by pulling the US out of the UN human rights council, complaining it was a ""cesspool of political bias"", and he has caused further consternation by siding with the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, despite evidence linking Prince Mohammed to the murder of the Washington Post columnist Jamal Khashoggi.

Domestically, Trump has run roughshod over the constitutional rights of asylum seekers at the US border, attempted to deny the legal existence of transgender people and introduced tax cuts that have greatly exacerbated income inequality in a country in which 40 million people live in poverty, among many other controversies.

The timing of the break in relations with UN investigators coincides with the publication in June of the official findings of Philip Alston's visit to the US to research poverty. As UN special rapporteur on extreme poverty, Alston castigated the Trump administration for aggravating levels of inequality that were already the most glaring in the western world.

Alston's robust criticism was received badly by Nikki Haley, then US ambassador, who accused him of biased reporting. She hinted that the administration was minded to turn its back on international accountability by saying it was ""patently ridiculous"" that the UN should focus on America's internal human rights standards when it could be looking into countries like Burundi.

It is not known whether the decision to sever cooperation with the UN monitors was directly related to the spat over Alston's report. But emails seen by the Guardian involving top US state department officials in Geneva show that by July they were rebuffing contact with international agencies on grounds that they were ""considering how best to engage with special procedures"", the blanket term for the network of UN special rapporteurs.

In a statement to the Guardian, the state department declined to explain why it was no longer responding to UN experts or to say whether non-cooperation was now permanent policy. A spokesman said the US remained ""deeply committed to the promotion and defense of human rights around the globe"", but pointedly omitted any reference to US compliance domestically.

Similarly, the spokesman expressed ""strong support"" for UN special rapporteurs, but only in the context of their investigations into other countries. The US backs those mandates ""that have proven effective in illuminating the most grave human rights environments, including in Iran and DPRK [North Korea]"", he said.

Paradoxically, the Trump administration's decision to shun the UN's independent watchdogs places the US among a tiny minority of uncooperative states. There are very few countries that resist international oversight from UN special rapporteurs - one of them is North Korea.

Individual UN experts expressed dismay at the US cold shoulder they are now receiving. Alston said the move would set ""the most unfortunate precedent as the US has always tried to press other countries to be accountable. This sends a message that you can opt out of routine scrutiny if you don't like what is being said about your record on human rights.""

Felipe González Morales, the UN special rapporteur on the human rights of migrants, has twice approached the US government requesting a formal visit to inspect how the country is handling immigration including the crisis at the Mexican border - once in March and then in July. He has yet to receive a reply.

""In the absence of an official visit, we cannot publish a country report to be presented to the UN human rights council,"" he said.

The UN expert on adequate housing, Leilani Farha, told the Guardian that she was concerned about the silence emanating from the US state department. Having been appointed to the post in 2014, she made five official complaints to the Obama administration and in each case received ""timely, thoughtful and constructive responses, even if we continued to disagree"".

Farha expressed unease at the new lack of engagement at a time when so many human rights problems were cropping up in the US, including a homelessness crisis in many cities.

""This suggests the US has abandoned even the most rudimentary forms of human rights accountability, and a whittling away of access to justice for those in the US whose human rights may have been violated,"" Farha said. ""It also demonstrates a rather inappropriate arrogance, at a time when human rights in the US are particularly fragile.""

The US government will not be able to avoid international scrutiny entirely. In 2020 it will face a routine ""universal periodic review"" undertaken by the human rights council - an obligation Trump cannot escape despite having withdrawn US membership."
244,the guardian,http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jan/03/elizabeth-warren-sexism-likable-election-2020,"It wasn't Donald Trump, it wasn't Lindsey Graham, it wasn't any of the ageing white men who dominate the Republican party. It was, in fact, Barack Obama who in 2008 framed an unfortunate test for female politicians when he told his rival Hillary Clinton: ""You're likable enough, Hillary.""

When Clinton ran for the presidency again in 2016, more than one headline referred to her ""likability problem"", and when Senator Elizabeth Warren in effect launched her own campaign this week, it did not take long for the old trope to rear its head. ""How does Elizabeth Warren avoid a Clinton - written off as too unlikable before her campaign gets off the ground?"" asked a tweet from the Politico website.

Warren had a quick riposte, tweeting a video of herself on a train on Wednesday with the comment: ""I hear women candidates are most likable in the quiet car!""

The exchange illustrated how ""likability"" appears to still be a women-only test. Misogyny may have been a crucial factor in Clinton's narrow defeat by Trump, a man caught on video bragging about groping women. It could return with a vengeance in the 2020 election with Senators Warren, Kirsten Gillibrand, Kamala Harris and Amy Klobuchar potentially bidding to smash the final glass ceiling.

Shilpa Phadke, the vice-president of the women's initiative at the Center for American Progress thinktank in Washington, said: ""Of course voter sexism and outright misogyny still exist. There's a constant focus for women on what they're wearing, what they look like and the tone of their voice. It's almost as if they're not only running for president but also running for Miss America.

""The research shows women have to find a sweet spot so they are 'warm enough'. They're expected to conform to certain positive stereotypes and avoid certain negative stereotypes. This double standard doesn't just exist in politics: if the presidency is gendered, so is business, so is the media, so is Hollywood. What's happening with Elizabeth Warren is no different from what is faced by working women every day.""

Phadke pointed, however, to surveys that show a strong majority of Americans say they are ready to elect a female president, as well as to Clinton's victory by nearly 3m ballots in the popular vote.

Male candidates face intense scrutiny on many counts but ""likability"" is seldom part of the lexicon. ""I have never been asked by anyone personally or professionally whether a male candidate is likable or not,"" said Bob Bland, the co-president of Women's March.

It's notable, she adds, that ""no one was asking that question when Elizabeth Warren was just a senator. Nobody was asking that question when Hillary Clinton was just secretary of state ... So this is something that only happens to women when they ask for more power, when they say, 'You know what? I am qualified for this position and I'm going to go for it.' There is an invisible line in our society, and particularly in American politics, where if women ask for 'too much' they get punished for it and the way that is done is they are labelled unlikable.

""Instead of asking whether women are likable enough to win, why don't we ask all of the questions that we would ask any male candidate?""

'There's a double standard'

Writing on the GQ website, Luke Darby argues: ""Obama was 'cool' if you liked him, or aloof and professorial if not. Bernie Sanders has good favorables. Mitt Romney is heading to the Senate now despite being a crossbreed of a career executive and a Brooks Brothers mannequin. But Warren, like Clinton before her, has to have the ability to be liked.""

Neil Sroka, the communications director of the progressive group Democracy for America, notes that in 2016 Sanders had a ""gruff demeanor"" but pulled off a ""curmudgeonly grandfather"" act that proved popular. ""That wouldn't work for a female candidate and that speaks to sexism. There is a double standard.""

Women are held to different standards from men when it comes to likability, according to Chloe Safier, a gender and women's rights consultant. ""The feminine version of likability does not allow for much ambition, intelligence or power-seeking,"" she said.

Safier was a graduate student at Harvard when Warren was teaching at its law school. ""In my memory, she was eminently likable,"" she continued. ""She's brilliant, warm and funny in an irreverent way. The discussion around a woman presidential candidate's 'likability' is an updated, #MeToo-era adaptation of discussing a woman's looks or clothes. It's a thinly veiled attempt at tearing someone down because they don't conform to rigid, limiting standards of gender-specific behaviour.""

Trump fires off insults like a scattergun but seems to especially relish attacks on women and people of colour. He has taunted Warren for her claim of Native American ancestry by branding her ""Pocahontas"". In October, Warren released a DNA test intended to support the claims, but it seemed to generate more controversy.

Safier warned: ""I think Trump will be vicious to any opposing candidate in 2020, but if the opposing candidate is a woman, I think he will be vicious in a particularly gendered way. He will pick apart a woman candidate's looks, demeanour and 'likability', because he knows that will elicit a reaction.

""And the press will pick up on that reaction, generating news cycles and debates about those things and whether he had a right to say them. We'll be talking about that, instead of Warren's policies and agenda. It's a distraction circus, and one that Trump will use to his benefit.""

Warren, 69, vowing to take on wealthy elites and Washington corruption, has hit the ground running after announcing on New Year's Eve that she was launching a presidential exploratory committee. She has made some key political hires in Iowa, the leadoff caucus state, and will travel there on Friday.

Her early moves coincide with Thursday's formation of a new House of Representatives boasting a record 102 women. Nancy Pelosi was elected speaker for the second time, but only after a firestorm of Republican attack ads during the midterm elections - a measure of how she is singled out for vitriol in a way that the Democrats' Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, is not.

Bonnie Morris, a women's history professor and author of 16 books including The Feminist Revolution, said: ""Quite a few belligerent and unattractive men have been accepted as global leaders. It seems it's fine when men are brusque and domineering. Women are cast in the home as a diplomat or a hostess: you're expected to be a conduit between personalities and not have one that sticks out yourself.""

Morris does ""not expect anything positive"" from Trump in the 2020 election campaign. ""But the media has an opportunity to create a completely different format that ignores insulting tweets from the White House and sets a higher tone.""

Sroka agreed that, as in the midterms, the president was likely to unleash a tide of misogyny, racism and xenophobia. He said: ""The idea of a woman beating him is perhaps one of the most frightening things Trump can imagine, save for attending the inauguration in a prison jumpsuit."""
245,the guardian,http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jan/11/donald-trump-fbi-investigate-working-russia-report,"The FBI in May 2017 opened an inquiry into whether Donald Trump was working on behalf of Russia, the New York Times reports.

Citing unnamed former law enforcement officials, the paper reported Friday that in the days after the president fired the former FBI director James Comey, law enforcement officials were so worried about Trump's behavior that they began investigating whether the president was working against American interests and on behalf of Russia.

Counterintelligence investigators were reportedly considering whether Trump's actions constituted a national security threat, an extraordinary line of inquiry against a sitting US president. They also sought to determine whether the president was knowingly working for Russia.

The White House on Friday night dismissed the New York Times report as ""absurd"".

""James Comey was fired because he's a disgraced partisan hack, and his Deputy Andrew McCabe, who was in charge at the time, is a known liar fired by the FBI,"" said the White House press secretary, Sarah Sanders, said in a statement.

""Unlike President Obama, who let Russia and other foreign adversaries push America around, President Trump has actually been tough on Russia,"" she added.

Rudolph Giuliani, one of Trump's attorneys, also downplayed the significance of the investigation. ""The fact that it goes back a year and a half and nothing came of it that showed a breach of national security means they found nothing,"" Giuliani told the paper.

Friday's remarkable report is sure to ramp up the pressure for a White House already feeling the heat from months of investigations. Trump's former campaign chairman Paul Manafort in August 2018 was convicted of financial crisis and later pleaded guilty to conspiring to defraud the US and conspiring to obstruct justice. Trump's longtime lawyer and aide Michael Cohen is set to begin a three-year prison sentence in March after pleading guilty to fraud, campaign finance violations and lying under oath.

Manafort was charged as part of the investigation by the special counsel Robert Mueller into Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election. The deputy attorney general, Rod Rosenstein, appointed Mueller shortly after Comey's firing in May 2017 to lead the investigation into Russian meddling and ties between the Trump campaign and Russian officials. Mueller is reportedly also investigating whether the president tried to impede the investigation into Russia's role in the election.

Mueller took over the FBI's counterintelligence investigation after being appointed, the New York Times reported, just days after it was first opened. FBI spokespeople did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

The report may also raise new questions for congressional investigators probing Russian meddling. Newly in control of the House of Representatives, Democrats have vowed to further scrutinize Trump's Russia ties."
246,the guardian,http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/commentisfree/2018/dec/19/michael-flynn-prospect-jail-time-trump-russia-inquiry,"You can surely understand the unseemly haste from Sarah Sanders. If you were the White House press secretary, you'd definitely want to wrap up your rare media briefing after just 15 minutes. You'd also want a shiatsu massage, a large hot toddy and the best lawyer money can buy.

""Do your job Sarah,"" shouted one reporter, clearly frustrated by a press secretary whose last on-camera briefing was 21 days ago. But she was doing her job, guys. Her job is to dodge all the pesky questions, so 42 seconds of daily briefing time seems about right.

Rarely has a White House seemed so festive and so felonious at the same time. Tuesday was the day Team Trump released an utterly heartfelt and heart-warming photo of Donald and Melania holding hands, surrounded by a small forest of Christmas trees festooned with enough scarlet baubles to decorate Red Square.

Gone was all that nasty talk of hush money for porn stars, jail time for lawyers and conspiracies with tabloid rags. For a brief moment, captured for eternity in an official portrait, they could hide among the yuletide pines and forget about all the plea deals.

But the season of goodwill to all men did not extend all the way down Pennsylvania Avenue to the US courthouse. There, yet another senior aide to the president found himself staring at a now familiar fate for those who get too close to Trump: swapping the White House for the Big House.

For Michael Flynn, Trump's first national security adviser, the prospect of jail time is even more rich than a tin plate of plum pudding. General Flynn famously led the pitchfork mob at the 2016 Republican convention in a charming chant of ""Lock Her Up!""

""We do not need a reckless president who believes she is above the law,"" Flynn declared, in a statement that only proves there is a god of irony after all. ""Lock her up! You know why we're saying that? If I did a tenth of what she did, I would be in jail today.""

For someone who once ran the Defense Intelligence Agency, Flynn wasn't all that intelligent. Then again, he got fired from that job for reportedly being ineffective and disruptive: two qualities that made him the perfect fit for the misfit toys known as Team Trump.

As Judge Emmet Sullivan pointed out on Tuesday, Flynn posed something more than a tenth of the national security risk represented by Hillary Clinton's private email server. That's because Flynn was actually working with hostile foreign officials to undermine American national security while serving in the presidential campaign and subsequent transition as, um, national security adviser.

At the same time as President Obama was imposing sanctions on Russia for interfering with the 2016 election, Flynn was telling his Russian friends not to worry. For some strange reason, Flynn later lied to FBI agents about this un-American ruse. Flynn and his business partners were also undeclared agents representing the president of Turkey while at the same time advising the president of the United States.

It's hard to know how you can make America great again if you're spending so much time and energy making Russia and Turkey great too.

""Arguably, this undermines everything this flag over here stands for. Arguably, you sold your country out,"" said Judge Sullivan, who asked out loud whether Flynn had committed treason. The judge later steered the court away from reading too much into his questions about treason, which must have been so very reassuring for the defense.

But his true feelings about Flynn's crimes were hard to avoid. ""I'm not hiding my disgust, my disdain, for this criminal offense,"" said the judge, who earned successive appointments from presidents Reagan, Bush and Clinton.

This perhaps was not the outcome Flynn's lawyers or even Robert Mueller's prosecutors had in mind when they arrived at the court for a little gentle sentencing. Both sides recommended no jail time for Flynn because he was cooperating so very helpfully in Mueller's broader investigations into all things Trumpy.

Even Flynn's old boss seemed to be hoping for some Christmas cheer from the court, wishing his old national security adviser some very sporting good fortune. Of course, he couldn't help slide in a little hint about, you know, not spilling your guts about all that Russian stuff, nudge nudge.

""Good luck today in court to General Michael Flynn,"" tweeted Trump. ""Will be interesting to see what he has to say, despite tremendous pressure being put on him, about Russian Collusion in our great and, obviously, highly successful political campaign. There was no Collusion!""

Some lawyers might call this leading the witness. Others might just call it mind-numbingly obvious. But this is the season for gifting, and it is now public knowledge that this president loves re-gifting, so let's give him the benefit of some reasonable doubt, shall we?

This wasn't a great day in the annals of Trump legal history, or philanthropy for that matter.

New York's attorney general declared that the Trump Foundation had agreed to close down amid a broader lawsuit seeking millions in restitution. Barbara Underwood said the foundation had engaged in ""a shocking pattern of illegality"" and served as ""little more than a checkbook to serve Mr Trump's business and political interests.""

At a time when people the world over turn their attention to the neediest among us, it's good to know that Trump always recognized that he was the neediest of them all.

Of course this holiday season is also a time when the world takes stock of itself. Trump can look back at all the investigations that have indicted or jailed his former aides and friends, and look forward to so much more of the same.

Meanwhile a small army of Democratic candidates can contemplate whether and how quickly to run against Trump for president next year. There may be a temptation among them to overthink their message to voters as they ask for support across a weary nation.

But they should know that we can still only faintly see the outlines of Trump's corruption through the wrapping paper. We don't even know what Flynn has told Mueller about the Trump family's ties to Russia. So don't get too excited, too early. This is the gift that keeps on giving."

248,the guardian,http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/14/syrian-kurds-trump-turkey-assad-ypg,"Since last month's announcement that the US will imminently withdraw its troops from Syria, President Trump has backtracked. The White House has declared that the withdrawal may yet take a number of months, amid a series of other contradictory remarks from senior American officials over whether the US plans to withdraw its troops entirely or to maintain some presence in eastern Syria. On Sunday Trump generated further confusion by declaring plans for a ""safe zone"" in Syria across the border with Turkey (without explaining who would enforce this zone, and where it would be located), even declaring that the US would ""devastate Turkey economically"" if it attacked Syria's Kurds.

A precipitous withdrawal would be indeed be bad news: it could pave the way for an Islamic State resurgence - the jihadist organisation is thought to still have 30,000 fighters at large in Syria and Iraq - as well as expanded Iranian influence.

And both of these outcomes could be hastened if there is a conflict between Turkey and Syria's Kurds. Turkey has national security concerns over the People's Protection Units (YPG), the organisation that dominates the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which has fought alongside the US under the auspices of the campaign to defeat Isis.

The YPG is affiliated with the Kurdistan Workers' party (PKK), which has fought the Turkish state for more than 40 years. The future of the YPG in Syria's north-east, where it established its own self-governed autonomous region during the civil war, is a thorn in Turkey-US relations that first emerged under the Obama administration. Yet the US has still failed to establish a sustainable, viable strategy that can alleviate Turkish concerns but also maintain the SDF as a buffer against the Assad regime and Iran, as well as the critical fighting force it has been in the war on Isis.

It is not too late. A potential US withdrawal combined with widespread concerns of a bloody Turkish-YPG conflict has added urgency and impetus to the need to find a compromise with Ankara over the future of the SDF. The US, in concert with its European (particularly French) allies, should push Turkey and the YPG to make some difficult choices.

Ankara's long-term approach to the Kurdish question in Syria would be to go back to the 2014 peace process aimed at ending its conflict with the PKK. That could still be revitalised down the line and provide a lasting solution. In the meantime, Turkey must be appreciative of the reality that US interests in Syria, and those of its allies, can only be secured if there are reliable on-the-ground partners who provide immediate solutions in a difficult landscape.

The YPG has been that solution, filling a security void in 2014 at a critical moment for the international community. But that does not mean the US cannot push the organisation to share power on a more equitable basis and make support conditional on its willingness to share power with other groups (Kurdish and Arab). The objective here would be to establish credible and legitimate governing structures as well as alternative partners to the YPG, who can then alleviate some of Turkey's concerns.

There are limited alternatives. Turkey lacks the capacity to suppress the YPG in eastern Syria (it has attempted, and failed, to defeat the PKK within and across its borders without success for decades). It would struggle to keep the peace in the Kurdish-dominated northeast if it deployed its already stretched armed forces, risking in the process a quagmire that enables the ascendancy of jihadist terrorist groups.

The YPG could turn to and embrace the Syrian regime if it is left to choose between either a Turkish onslaught or negotiations with an administration that is in the process of normalising its relationship with the international community. The YPG is inseparable from Syria's security and governing structures, yet Turkey will lose the capacity to shape the landscape altogether if the YPG is forced into the regime's orbit of influence.

Contrary to the hyperbole surrounding Turkish apprehensions toward the YPG, Ankara has in fact engaged the Democratic Union party (PYD), the YPG's political wing, before and has hosted its head, Salih Muslim. The Turkish government is not entirely averse to negotiating with the organisation, while Ankara found in the 90s that by cooperating with the US and by developing stronger relations with the Iraqi Kurds, it became far more capable of influencing events in Iraq.

A compromise is not beyond reach. The US, Turkey and YPG all stand to lose if Assad and his backers take control of the east. It would be the worst outcome for the Syrian people and the region at large.

249,the guardian,http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/dec/22/beto-orourke-voting-record-2020-election-democrats,"Betomania has befallen Washington elites: Democratic pundits, political operatives and influencers are having a collective swoon over Democratic representative Beto O'Rourke. He is fresh off a failed Senate run, where he generated internet fame for his skateboarding, musicianship and sunny disposition. Now, he is Washington's version of Elvis Presley on Ed Sullivan, only the screaming teeny-boppers are Beltway politicos: one rainmaker touted him as ""Obama, but white"", a Wall Street-funded group called Third Way declared that ""we are big Beto fans"" and a former Obama aide penned an entire love letter touting O'Rourke 2020, without even once mentioning where the Texas congressman stands on a single legislative issue.

Perhaps the fuzziness around O'Rourke's political positions isn't a mistake. Maybe it is designed to obscure facts about his record that may prove to be inconvenient in a Democratic primary. After all, this is a lawmaker who abruptly backed off unequivocally supporting Medicare for All, aligned himself with the party's Wall Street faction, voted to gut financial regulations, supported Republican-crafted tax cuts, boosted the fossil fuel industry - and then broke his own pledge to reject donations from oil and gas executives.

A liberal heartthrob who votes with Republicans

The 46-year-old O'Rourke has racked up a voting record helping Republicans ram parts of their agenda through the Congress. In an era of growing economic inequality, O'Rourke has split with the majority of his party to vote for Republican initiatives to weaken Wall Street regulations and accelerate bank mergers - and he once voted for a Republican bill that Democratic legislators said was designed to block the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau's from combatting racially discriminatory lending. He also voted for a key part of Donald Trump's so-called deportation force.

Meanwhile, despite the imminent climate catastrophe facing our planet, O'Rourke has often taken the side of carbon polluters. He has repeatedly voted to help the fossil fuel industry increase its exports. He even helped the GOP defeat a Democratic measure designed to limit the possibility of offshore oil drilling in the Gulf of Mexico. (For more, click here to read a story I wrote this week about Beto's voting record.)

The big story here is not just O'Rourke's record - but also the unstated message of the substance-free hype surrounding his potential presidential candidacy.

In light of O'Rourke's voting record, Betomania signals that Democratic power players are not first and foremost searching for candidates whose records prove they are committed to a set of policies that will address the emergencies facing America and the world. Instead, they are frantically seeking a new version of Barack Obama - a conflict-averse politician who proudly boasted of being ""a blank screen on which people of vastly different political stripes project their own views"".

Why another Obama would be a tragedy

Replicating an Obama presidency would be better than what we have now. But it would still be a tragedy. That's because the fundamental premise of Obamaism - and its predecessor, Clintonism - is that there is always a policy that can at once serve the people and the powerful. And recent history has showed that is both false and dangerous.

The fantastical mythology of a satisfactory ""third way"" between the corporate class and the rest of us posits that the Democratic party's insurance industry backers can be enriched and healthcare policy can still be humane; its Wall Street sponsors can eviscerate industries and workers can still earn enough to survive; and its fossil fuel donors can keep pumping out carbon and the ecosystem can still sustain human life.

The alluring idea is that we never actually have to answer that haunting question of labor lore: ""Which side are you on?"" Obamaism leads us to believe that we do not need to choose, and that we can actually have it all - as long as we always make sure to line up behind policies that appease the super-wealthy.

It is, in other words, the ideology undergirding the argument recently put forward by former vice-president, Joe Biden, who insisted: ""I don't think 500 billionaires are the reason why we're in trouble ... the folks at the top aren't bad guys.""

It is easy to understand the political utility of this third-way legend: it lets Democrats continue raising gobs of cash from satisfied corporate donors and moguls, and it at least provides voters with more palatable rhetoric than what the Republican party offers. And yet the record of third-way policies over the past few years have made painfully clear that Obamaism's refusal to choose a side can be a nihilistic choice unto itself.

You can't stand with both the 1% and 99%: you have to choose

Obamacare, for instance, posited that we do not have to choose between profits and human lives, and that no matter what, we must avoid antagonizing the healthcare industry with ideas like Medicare for All. The policy assumes that the healthcare industry can still hit paydirt in a system that also provides all Americans with decent medical care.

Eight years into the experiment, the industry has indeed been raking in record profits, and health insurance CEOs were paid more than $340m in 2017 alone. At the same time, 27 million people are uninsured, millions more are struggling to afford medical care and prescription drugs, and patients still face the threat of insurance industry death panels cutting off their benefits. The situation is now so dire that one out of every three GoFundMe campaigns are fundraising drives to pay medical bills - all while former Obama aides get hired to help the insurance industry block Medicare for All in the new Congress.

When it came to economic inequality, Obamaism similarly sought a third way between the super-rich and everyone else.

It was bailouts for bankers and support for a slightly higher minimum wage. It was an economic stimulus bill, but also a proposal to slash social security benefits. It was a few actions to strengthen workplace protections, but abandoning a drawn-out fight for laws strengthening unions. It was a modest uptick in antitrust enforcement, but doing little to systematically hinder monopolization, which has given corporate behemoths more market power to prevent wage increases. It was slapping a few fines on Wall Street firms after the financial crisis, but refusing to prosecute top financial executives - a policy enshrining de facto legal immunity for a predatory banking industry that fleeces workaday Americans.

And when it came to the environment, Obamaism presumed that we do not have to choose between ExxonMobil and a habitable ecosystem. Obama's particular third way on energy policy was somewhat tougher emissions and efficiency standards and yet also strong support for more drilling, fracking and fossil fuel exports (Weeks after a recent scientific report warning of catastrophic climate change, Obama told an audience that he should be thanked because ""suddenly America is the largest oil producer - that was me, people"".)

Heading into the 2020 presidential election, O'Rourke's soaring speeches and charisma may suggest he would offer a better version of this dangerous form of corporate fealty - but in Congress, his votes tell a different story. His telegenic brand seems to offer the same blank screen as Obama - and his record offers the same third-way ideology.

Of course, another third-way presidency - whether in the form of O'Rourke or some other stalking horse - would save us from more Trump. But here's the thing: it would almost certainly still be death.

More healthcare policy that coddles profiteers will mean yet more riches for insurance executives, and yet more desperation, suffering and casualties for everyone else. Another Democratic president who appeases the corporate lobby by avoiding bare-knuckled brawls over wages, union rights and monopoly power will be another four years marked by more crushing poverty that wipes out entire communities. More Obamaism intent on further increasing fossil fuel production will deliver something between a holocaust and a full-fledged mass extinction, according to climatologists.

The math and science of this reality is tough to explicitly dispute, and so as they now gear up to influence the 2020 presidential primary, the Beltway crowd has been rolling out new tactics to pursue their fever dream of an Obama clone.

The misguided idea that Democrats need a centrist to win

One such tactic is hawking their agenda of corporate appeasement as a Democratic party necessity to attract independent voters in an allegedly conservative country. To win, the party must ""affirm core American beliefs in free enterprise, individual initiative and self-reliance and put strengthening markets' ability to provide broader opportunities before government redistribution"", wrote two officials of the Progressive Policy Institute, a deceptively titled thinktank for pro-business Democrats.

Those officials' odes to Ayn Rand somehow didn't mention their group's own poll that showed a whopping three-quarters of all Americans say they want to expand social security and Medicare. Another 54% say they support Medicare for All - and that included 75% of independent voters. A new poll by Yale University found that 80% of registered voters support a Green New Deal in which the government takes strong action to fight climate change.

Amid this shift in public opinion, environmental, labor and economic justice movements now threaten to take over the Democratic party. And so another tactic of the status quo crowd has been saccharine demands for comity. This rhetorical maneuver was best summarized by a recent Boston Globe editorial deriding firebrand Senator Elizabeth Warren: the screed decried the outspoken Wall Street critic as too ""divisive"" for the presidency, and called instead for ""a unifying voice"".

But, then, Obama provided exactly that for eight years as president - and his conflict-averse program nonetheless left us with a country that is now more oligarchy than democracy. Another blank-slate Democrat who pretends there is a unifying third way between the 99% and the 1% and who refuses to take sides in big fights against corporate power - that may excite Betomaniacs, establishment Democrats and those with stakes in the status quo, but it won't rescue our country and it won't save the planet.

250,the guardian,http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/live/2019/jan/10/trump-us-mexico-border-wall-shutdown-live-updates,"Secretary of State Mike Pompeo is giving a foreign policy speech in Cairo right now that is a direct rebuke of Obama's speech there a decade ago.

Adam Kredo from the Washington Free Beacon reports:

Pompeo took direct aim at Obama, standing in the same city the former president did when he advocated a fundamental shift in U.S. policy in the region, one that denies Islamic radicalism as the root of jihadi fervor.

""Remember: It was here, in this very city, another American stood before you,"" he said. ""He told you that radical Islamist terrorism doesn't stem from ideology. He told you 9/11 led my country to abandon its ideals, particularly in the Middle East.""

""He told you that the United States and the Muslim world needed 'a new beginning,'"" Pompeo continued. ""And the results of these misjudgments were dire. In falsely seeing ourselves as a force for what ails the Middle East, we were timid about asserting ourselves when the times -- and our partners -- demanded it.""

America, under Obama, ""underestimated"" the scourge of radical terrorism.

Steve King, the controversial Iowa Republican congressman, gave an interview with the New York Times after a serious primary challenger emerged against him yesterday. King, known for his racially charged comments, made yet another inflamatory statement.

Good morning, Donald Trump is on his way to the Mexican border, the government shutdown has reached its 20th day and there's growing speculation that a national emergency may be declared in an attempt by Trump to force construction of a wall.

It's Thursday in American politics."
251,the guardian,http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/dec/20/beto-orourke-congressional-votes-analysis-capital-and-main,"Beto O'Rourke's spirited run for the US Senate in Texas last month has prompted powerful voices in the Democratic party establishment to tout the outgoing Texas congressman as a 2020 presidential candidate who, as the party's standard-bearer, would offer a vision of America contrasting against that of Republicans.

However, a new analysis of congressional votes from the non-profit news organisation Capital & Main shows that even as O'Rourke represented one of the most solidly Democratic congressional districts in the United States, he has frequently voted against the majority of House Democrats in support of Republican bills and Trump administration priorities.

Capital & Main reviewed the 167 votes O'Rourke has cast in the House in opposition to the majority of his own party during his six-year tenure in Congress. Many of those votes were not progressive dissents alongside other left-leaning lawmakers, but instead votes to help pass Republican-sponsored legislation.

O'Rourke has voted for GOP bills that his fellow Democratic lawmakers said reinforced Republicans' anti-tax ideology, chipped away at the Affordable Care Act (ACA), weakened Wall Street regulations, boosted the fossil fuel industry and bolstered Donald Trump's immigration policy.

Consumer, environmental, public health and civil rights organizations have cast legislation backed by O'Rourke as aiding big banks, undermining the fight against climate change and supporting Trump's anti-immigrant agenda. During the previous administration, Barack Obama's White House issued statements slamming two GOP bills backed by the 46-year-old Democratic legislator.

O'Rourke's votes for Republican legislation - which at times put him at odds with a majority of Texas Democratic lawmakers in Congress - underscore his membership in the New Democrat Coalition, the faction of House Democrats most closely aligned with business interests.

O'Rourke did not respond to questions from Capital & Main about his votes.

O'Rourke was one of a number of younger Democratic candidates who ran unexpectedly strong campaigns in traditionally Republican states in the 2018 midterm elections. His speeches, grassroots fundraising and rejection of corporate PAC money helped his campaign build a strong online following among activists who were hoping the election would result in a Democratic senate majority.

In recent weeks, the possibility of an O'Rourke presidential candidacy has been boosted by former Obama aides and fundraisers, as well as by Third Way - a finance-industry funded thinktank that previously made headlines deriding Democratic senator Elizabeth Warren. He has also been lauded by former Hillary Clinton aide Neera Tanden of the Center for American Progress, a Democratic thinktank whose officials recently slammed Republican tax and immigration legislation that O'Rourke voted for. Much of the party elite's support for an O'Rourke candidacy has not mentioned his policy record or agenda.

In the last two years, O'Rourke was among the top fifth of all lawmakers voting against his own party's positions. FiveThirtyEight has calculated that in that same time period, O'Rourke has voted for the Trump administration position roughly 30% of the time. The website said that is above what analysts predict would come from a legislator representing a district as Democratic as O'Rourke's. For comparison, O'Rourke's congressional district votes more Democratic than than most districts in Massachusetts, according to the Cook Political Report.

Each vote reviewed below was one in which O'Rourke broke from the majority of legislators in his own party.

Consumer protection

Since its creation in 2010, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB) has been under relentless assault by Republicans, who have sought to help the financial industry limit its authority. At times, they have found an ally in O'Rourke.

In one instance, the Texas Democrat helped the GOP challenge the agency's bulletin, which asserted its ""authority to pursue auto lenders whose policies harm consumers through unlawful discrimination"".

Republicans in 2015 introduced legislation to repeal that directive. Civil rights groups such as the NAACP opposed the GOP measure and House Democrats said it was designed to halt ""recent actions to root out discriminatory practices among auto lenders"". The Obama White House said it strongly opposed the Republican bill.

O'Rourke nonetheless officially co-sponsored the bill and voted for it. Echoing the GOP's line of attack on the CFPB, the Democrat faulted the agency for a ""lack of openness"", which he asserted had created ""uncertainty, criticism of the CFPB's conclusions, and has made loans more expensive to borrowers"". While O'Rourke later voted against using the Congressional Review Act to kill the CFPB's regulation, the original bill he voted for set the stage for the GOP to repeal it under Trump.

Also in 2015, O'Rourke voted for a Republican bill that Democrats said would weaken lending disclosure protections for home mortgage borrowers. The Obama administration agreed, issuing a veto threat declaring that the GOP bill aimed to ""unnecessarily delay implementation of important consumer protections designed to eradicate opaque lending practices that contribute to risky mortgages, hurt homeowners by removing the private right of action for violations, and undercut the nation's financial stability"".

The bill passed with the support of O'Rourke, who said: ""I believe it is a practical, short-term compromise that will provide long-term benefits to consumers in the United States."" He argued that the GOP legislation would allow regulators to ""continue working with banks to ensure that they are ready to fully comply with the law"" and ""ensure that ""consumers applying for home mortgages are given all the information they need"".

Fossil fuels and energy

During his Senate race, O'Rourke was lauded for his rhetoric about the threat of climate change. In Congress, he has questioned the safety of natural gas fracking, and he has high ratings from the League of Conservation Voters.

O'Rourke, however, has also cast key votes with Republicans to boost the fossil fuel industry whose carbon emissions are at the root of the climate crisis.

For instance, O'Rourke was one of only a handful of House Democrats who voted for Republican bills to lift the 40-year-old oil export ban.

During the legislative debate over lifting the ban, the Democrats' committee report argued that ""the extreme approach taken by this bill not only repeals current crude export restrictions, but also ensures that no export restrictions - for any reason - could be implemented or enforced in the future"". The Democratic report added that ""the bill could have potentially vast consequences for consumers, the environment and climate change"".

O'Rourke twice voted to lift the ban.

At the same time, O'Rourke helped Republicans vote down Democratic legislation to prevent drilling in the eastern Gulf of Mexico, and he backed a separate GOP bill to speed up natural gas exports.

He also supported GOP legislation that Democrats said was constructed to protect the utility industry. Republicans said the measure was designed ""to ensure reliable electricity service and reduce the risk of fires and fire hazards caused by inadequate vegetation management"" in areas where power lines cross federal lands. Repeating charges made by Democrats in the bill's committee report, Arizona Democratic representative Raúl Grijalva said during the floor debate: ""The bill waives liability for companies that start forest fires or cause other damage. This is nonsense and shifts an incredible burden and risk onto American taxpayers.""

O'Rourke was one of 69 Democrats to support the bill, which passed.

Immigration and criminal justice

In representing the border city of El Paso, O'Rourke has been an outspoken advocate for immigration reform. His Senate campaign website said he wants to ""pass the Dream Act and ensure that undocumented immigrants who were brought here as children, known as Dreamers, find a permanent home and citizenship in the US."" It also declared that he wants to ""end the militarization of our immigration enforcement system"". O'Rourke this month made headlines slamming the Trump administration's immigration policy.

However, he was one of a group of Democrats who broke party ranks to support Republican legislation to waive requirements for Customs and Border Protection (CBP) agents and job applicants to take polygraph tests - a proposal that was part of the Trump administration's plan to assemble a deportation force.

A 2012 Government Accountability Office report noted that CBP uses polygraph tests as part of employment background checks ""to mitigate the risk of employee corruption and misconduct"" and recommended the agency consider expanding the tests.

In April of 2017, the Trump administration issued a memo pushing for authority to waive the polygraph tests in order to expedite the hiring of thousands of new CBP agents. Critics immediately raised red flags - the American Immigration Lawyers Association said it was a plan ""to water down hiring standards"". Tom Jawetz, the Center for American Progress' vice-president for immigration, told Univision that ""many agents brought on beforehand who had not gone through a polygraph were cooperating with cartels and subject to corruption"". James Tomsheck, the CBP's former head of internal affairs, called the idea of waivers ""preposterous"" in light of what the polygraph tests had been finding.

Two days after the Trump administration's memo, Republicans led by immigration hardliner Representative Martha McSally of Arizona introduced legislation to allow the polygraph tests to be waived. Democrats adamantly objected.

New Mexico Democratic representative Michelle Lujan Grisham, chairwoman of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus, said: ""Eliminating the critical polygraph requirements for certain CBP applicants only undermines our nation's safety, given this agency's historic connection to organized crime, drug cartels, and corruption."" She asserted that ""no other federal law enforcement agency in the country - not the FBI, DEA, ATF or Secret Service - makes any exceptions to their polygraph exam"".

Democratic congressman Luis Gutierrez, declared that: ""Anyone who votes for this bill is voting to support and implement Donald Trump's views on immigration, his desire to militarize our southern border, and his fantasy of a mass deportation force.""

O'Rourke opted to join Republicans in voting for the bill, which passed. He said the measure was necessary to ""help speed up the hiring process and provide the CBP Commissioner additional authorities to recruit and hire quality CBP officers and border patrol agents"".

During the same two-month stretch, O'Rourke also broke ranks from his party in supporting GOP legislation that, according to GovTrack, would ""add the killing or attempted killing [of] a law enforcement officer to the list of aggravating factors in federal death penalty cases"".

The Leadership Conference on Civil Rights said the bill was ""an unnecessary and misguided attempt to politicize the unfortunate deaths of law enforcement officers and could ultimately exacerbate existing tension between law enforcement and the communities they serve, especially African Americans"".

Democratic representative Jerry Nadler of New York argued that it would change the fundamental threshold for capital punishment by ""impos[ing] a death penalty for attempted murder"".

O'Rourke was one of 48 Democrats to join Republicans in supporting the legislation, which passed.

Regulating Wall Street

O'Rourke has a somewhat mixed record on financial issues, according to the watchdog group Americans for Financial Reform (AFR). At times he has voted with Democrats to protect existing regulations. Still, he has also frequently aided the GOP in some of its efforts to deregulate Wall Street.

For instance, in 2014 and 2018 O'Rourke cast votes for GOP bills that included provisions weakening the so-called Volcker Rule, which aims to prevent financial firms from using depositors' savings for their own speculative trading.

In 2017 and 2018, O'Rourke also voted for:

GOP legislation that Democrats said would empower financial institutions to shield themselves from bank examiners.

A package of Republican bills that Democrats said would reduce independent audits of corporations, deregulate stock exchanges and high-frequency trading.

A Republican bill to permit larger number of bank holding companies to take on more debt.

And a Republican bill that Democrats said would ""eliminate meaningful, clear disclosures to consumers about their privacy rights, including their ability to opt-out from having their information sold to unaffiliated third party companies"".

Healthcare

O'Rourke has been a supporter of improving Obamacare, expanding Medicaid and adding a public option to compete with private insurance. At times, though, he broke with the majority of House Democrats to help Republicans try to chip away at the healthcare law, and in one instance, he backed a GOP bill Democrats said was designed to prop up the Trump administration's attempts to replace Obamacare.

The ACA established the independent payment advisory board to recommend ways to reduce Medicare spending. According to the nonpartisan Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, the language creating the board prohibited it from proposing rationing, reduced benefits, higher premiums or restricted eligibility.

Despite those safeguards, Republicans led by former vice-presidential nominee Sarah Palin soon pointed to the board as proof that Democrats were aiming to create ""death panels"". As that mythology spread throughout conservative media, Republicans in 2015 and 2017 brought up legislation to stoke those fears and eliminate the board. O'Rourke defied his party and twice voted with Republicans to kill the board. He also officially co-sponsored both measures.

Additionally, when Republicans were pushing to replace the ACA with Trump's American Health Care Act (AHCA), O'Rourke voted for Republican legislation to provide special tax credits for Cobra benefits - an initiative that Democratic representative Richard Neal of Massachusetts said was ""simply a backdoor way for states to discriminate against existing conditions"".

Taxes

In 2017, O'Rourke joined his party in voting against Trump's tax cut package. His Senate campaign website cited deficit concerns about those tax cuts' cost.

But that was not the end of the story. Within months, Republicans began pressing a new package of tax cuts that Democratic groups such as the Center for American Progress deemed the ""tax scam 2"". One piece of that package was a proposal that a critical Los Angeles Times editorial said ""would carve out a new tax shelter for start-up businesses"". The Center for American Progress singled out those provisions as one of the objectionable aspects of the tax package.

As Democrats sought to present a unified front against the new GOP tax cuts, O'Rourke broke ranks with House Democrats - and most of the Texas Democratic delegation - to vote for the GOP legislation. He supported the initiative, even though the Congressional Budget Office warned that the bill would expand the deficit."
252,the guardian,http://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/dec/20/genuinely-brilliant-from-cover-to-cover-your-favourite-books-of-2018,"We asked for your picks for the most outstanding books of the year. From novels by Sally Rooney and Gail Honeyman to memoirs by Brett Anderson and Michelle Obama, here's what some of you said

Fiction Eleanor Oliphant is Completely Fine by Gail Honeyman

Beautifully written. Made me laugh. Made me feel like crying. Deeply moving but uplifting throughout.

Ann Woods, Liverpool

The beautiful prose grabs you while the story makes you sad, optimistic, moved and intrigued from beginning to end. And it has a great ending. My daughter in her twenties and my mum in her nineties have loved it too. Now that's an achievement.

Jane, England

It tackled a serious subject with wit, mirth and intelligence. A real page turner without being too taxing and heavy. Easy to read and follow the story without the need for a dictionary by your side. A simple story with a solid message behind.

Katey, Ashfield

Normal People by Sally Rooney

Quietly beautiful. This is the kind of book I could carry on reading forever, following the existence of the two main characters as they roll in and out of each other's lives like waves on a beach.

Lana Petrovic, Auckland

No book has ever told such a simple story in such a way that has made me reconsider everything about the way in which I think and reflect. And I don't even think this was Rooney's intention. I have never been so emotionally affected.

Anonymous, Melbourne

I liked Conversations With Friends, but in Ireland we tend to completely overhype Irish writers (in my opinion) so when Normal People came out I was worried that it would be a second book that had been overdone. I could not have been more wrong. I'm going to read it again over Christmas. I admire Sally Rooney so much but am also extremely jealous of her ability to build characters. Well done her!

Blathnaid Connolly, Dublin

Akata Warrior by Nnedi Okorafor

I got so bored of the same old fantasy and sci-fi tropes (to the point that I went off reading for a while), and along came Nnedi Okorafor and Afrofuturism and blew me away. I'd already read her Binti series of novellas (small but perfectly formed) and thoroughly enjoyed them. Akata Warrior for me was another step up. I read the book like I used to read when I was a kid - couldn't wait for the next page, the next chapter. |The story is about a Nigerian-American girl that discovers she has an aptitude for magic and gets drawn into the magical Leopard society that teaches (and keeps an eye on) her. Nnedi Okorafor draws on her own background and knowledge of Nigerian culture to create something amazing.

tinimaus, Germany

The House with Chicken Legs by Sophie Anderson

With echoes of Hans Christian Andersen and Arthur Ransome's Old Peter's Russian Tales, it has everything you would expect to find in a traditional tale - and more. It was magical, poignant and macabre. It is the children's book I wish I'd written.

Mrs R

Melmoth by Sarah Perry

This story is very well told. Carefully crafted for maximum creepiness and suspense. I have had to put it down at some points because the tension is so great that I have to ensure I am in the best environment (not on the bus!) to fully absorb the next passage. Perry is a superb author.

Mark Budding, Tadley

Milkman by Anna Burns

Milkman was an impressive and challenging book ... I read it in four days straight and was torn between wanting to get out of this fear about what would happen immediately after, and being unable to let go of the narrator and her story. The best book by far of the year, but certainly not a feel good novel.

Allie Pasieka, N'Djamena

Everything Under by Daisy Johnson

It's a visceral, dreamy, and often sinister reworking of the Oedipus myth, which explores fate, gender, the liminal, and language. The structure is what really hooked me in, at first it feels a bit disorienting but it's such an effective and lucid way to tell the story; the characters and threads all start to intertwine in a masterfully coherent way. I felt like this novel was so deserving of it's Man Booker prize shortlisting.

Gaby, London

From a Low and Quiet Sea by Donal Ryan

Well crafted, compassionate portrayal of the pain of losing loved ones, the joyous mindlessness of youth before being confronted with responsibility (for a death, in this case), a crashing ending with justice inadvertently accomplished.

J. Trunzo, France

Powerful novel, timely and beautifully written. Captured the migration issue at the same time as a fully developed exploration of being Irish.

Keith, Dublin

Less by Andrew Sean Greer

Comic novels rarely work for me so it was a surprise to find in Less a beautiful novel about love and ageing that was also very, very funny. Arthur Less is a novelist on the verge of turning 50 and struggling to get his new novel published. To avoid his ex-boyfriend's wedding, he accepts a variety of literary invites from around the world. Without ever indulging in cruelty, Greer consistently generates laughs from the reader, particularly in his hero's unduly confident attempts to speak German.

Gerard Scott, Newcastle

My Year of Rest and Relaxation by Ottessa Moshfegh

This was a genuinely brilliant novel from cover to cover: right up to its devastatingly great punch of an ending, it haunts you in all the best ways, and carries on long after you've finished.

Paula Stones, London

The Mars Room by Rachel Kushner

Here is a book that definitively reveals the dark underbelly of the American experiment in maximum freedom with unfettered financial power, the dark cost of the puritan election, the two great highs with such indifference to the lows: world record incarceration rates. There is a calmly deployed but very significant hint of near Shakespearean power and range in the unique characters, across a near Dostoevskian American underground as backstory ... It is a great book when you stand back and consider the near definitive statement of the cost of the wasp American Dream.

Steve C, Beijing

Convenience Store Woman by Sayaka Murata, translated by Ginny Tapley Takemori

This book came up and smacked me on the face halfway through reading it. The novel manages to make such fantastically astute social commentary while under the guise of being a frivolous tale of a woman working in a convenience store, with no real plot. I found the references to Japanese culture, manners and etiquette charming and very accurate, and Murata's protagonist was endearing and well-rounded. A joyful romp of a read, with sharp social critique hidden within the narrative. Very clever stuff.

Freya Parr, Bristol

Middle England by Jonathan Coe

Coe writes richly, humorously and simply: his books are easy to read but still manage to be complex and allusive. His writing is always human and humane and even in the maelstrom of hate, social-media abuse, overt and covert racism, his characters manage to be very real and there is (almost) always subtle empathy for even the most awful of people.

Dauvit Alexander, Birmingham

The Overstory by Richard Powers

This book is a vast, towering, moving panorama about our emotional and physical engagement with the natural world around us, specifically trees. It's packed full of plot, and moves much quicker than you'd expect from a novel fitting this description - it's one of the best books I've read in the past decade.

zendik32

The lives of the characters and their interaction with forests riveted me, and I recorded memorable passages and stories that I will use in my lectures to help me drive home points that are normally dry and clinical. How can one forget such an impactful passage as this: ""The pen moves; the ideas form as if by spirit hand. Some thing shines out, a truth so self-evident that the words dictate themselves. We're cashing in a billion years of planetary savings bonds and blowing it on assorted bling."" Bravo, Mr Powers.

Bruce S Post, Vermont

The Seven Deaths of Evelyn Hardcastle by Stuart Turton

This book was brilliant. There was so much scope to be completely lost in a complex and unique (yet strikingly familiar) plot but the author's attentive style of writing meant you were captivated and never adrift throughout the book. This was a truly enjoyable read - you're cleverly led to believe the book's twist only to realise there are more twists just around the corner. A book that makes you question what's next rather than question reality. Truly excellent.

Matt North, Yorkshire

The Shepherd's Hut by Tim Winton

Others books may have been more experimental, more daring or more challenging but something raw, visceral and alive like The Shepherd's Hut doesn't need such trickery. This simple tale of an unwanted teenage runaway who comes across an itinerant preacher living in a cabin in the middle of nowhere, wins by simply moving the reader. The rawness of the language, which utilises Aussie slang to great effect, is only matched by the rawness of wilderness it describes.

Nick Goodey, New York

Non-fiction Slay in Your Lane by Yomi Adegoke and Elizabeth Uviebinené

Never would I have thought a modern take on the British black female experience would be covered so wonderfully and with such excitement by two British black females. The range of topics were discussion worthy, and filled me for weeks with talking points ... BUY A COPY FOR THE NEW YEAR AND BE SURPRISED AND EXCITED.

Angie Leonie, West Midlands

Becoming by Michelle Obama

Revelatory portrait of America and fascinating insight into what it was like to be hurled from a regular, everyday existence to moving into the White House.

M. MacKenzie, Scotland

Returning to Reims by Didier Eribon

In this ""memoir"", Eribon examines the failures of neo-liberalism to address the underclass or feed people's aspirations, and its ongoing attempts to homogenise the bourgeoisie - all of which create the current malaise across the ""liberal"" West and continues to haunt and inform today's headlines. It's a tremendous, challenging and profoundly educational read

Craig Tapping, Vancouver

I'll Be Gone In The Dark by Michelle McNamara

One woman's obsessive search for the Golden State Killer ... [McNamara's] lucid analysis often pitted with personal anecdotes and painstaking details makes it the most unequivocally pivotal book of the year. A fitting tribute to one gone too soon, before she could witness the yield of her diligence.

Steve Campbell

Coal Black Mornings by Brett Anderson

A book stuffed with beautiful, heartbreaking detail and of the myriad of influences that formed the back-bone of Suede. A rare autobiography from a true English one-off artist who's less concerned to offer the usual rags-to-riches story of fame and fortune but to show the life before - one of failure and sadness. And it's all the better and richer for it. You don't need to be a Suede fan either to enjoy this, but it helps.

Leighton Carter, Surrey

Leonardo da Vinci by Walter Isaacson

Well researched and beautifully written. And Isaacson writes so descriptively about da Vinci's paintings. It's like having an art scholar whispering in your ear as you wander through the gallery. His insights and emotion as he interprets the paintings are exquisite. I felt I could continue reading for ever, carried away on waves of intellect and emotion.

Ian Widdop, Johannesburg

Dopesick by Beth Macy

This book suited my spirit this year. I have spent the whole year in a state of rage about so much in the world and in this book, I felt the righteous fury of reading how families were let down by big pharma and the health system in the US. It became clear in the book how some doctors and health professionals were seeing clearly the problem of opioid abuse, yet they were overridden by the business imperative of Purdue Pharma. May the Sackler family be known in infamy for the catastrophe which has come about from their business. So many times, I had to put the book down and vent to my partner. It made me mad as hell.

Chloe Williams, Spain

Poverty Safari by Darren McGarvey

I cannot recall in my lifetime reading anything more urgent and essential. McGarvey's dissection of working class life ... is concise, compelling and deeply moving. It caused a great many changes in my attitude and sensibilities. Though the subject matter is difficult, there is no question that the rewards the reader stands to gain are legion.

Joe Taylor, Bristol

The Salt Path by Raynor Winn

To be able to follow the wonderful journey made by Raynor and Moth was quite moving. These are real people making the best of a real life crisis. It was a privilege to share their journey.

Edward Crook, Penrith

Crashed by Adam Tooze

This is, by far, the best book I've read in 2018 ... a fascinating and comprehensive work, even if you are prone to disagree with his conclusions - the data, analysis and the thrust of his argument are well worth hearing and compelling in the extreme. The narrative and research both incredibly strong - this is essential reading for understanding the most important event(s) of our time (and it's not dry!).

David Hayter, South London"
253,the guardian,http://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/12/were-reactivating-the-peoples-army-inside-the-battle-for-a-hard-brexit,"With Westminster gridlocked, Nigel Farage has spent the past four months mobilising his troops at Leave Means Leave rallies around the country

A huge queue snakes around Bolton Wanderers football club, but this is no regular Saturday. These supporters are here for a political rally. It is mid-September 2018, and Leave Means Leave has just started a tour of Brexit Britain. This cross-party pressure group was formed in 2016 to ensure a ""clean Brexit"" - in other words, a hard one. Now, with Brexit looking anything but clean, it has decided to step things up. Half a dozen rallies have been announced, and the organisers promise this is only the start.

Outside the ground, people stand next to an open-topped Leave Means Leave battle bus to take selfies. Its colour scheme echoes that of the European Union flag, but with an extra fizz - blue and orange, instead of blue and yellow. The rally is sold out and takes place in a conference centre adjoining the stadium. It is packed with more than a thousand people, most of them middle-aged and elderly. On every seat, there is a little welcome pack for those who have paid their £5.98 to attend: a Stop The Brexit Betrayal banner, a Believe In Britain pen, a union jack flag.

Leave Means Leave's chairman, John Longworth, is the former director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, while its founder and vice chair, Richard Tice, is CEO of the asset management group Quidnet Capital. They make for impressive frontmen - Longworth with his record in business, Tice with his Dr Kildare good looks. Longworth tells the audience that, wherever he has worked, he has had a direct link to Brussels. ""I knew more than most people how the European Union worked. I knew what they were up to, and that's why I voted to leave.""

But nobody is here to listen to him. ""Ladies and gentlemen, the next person needs little introduction,"" Tice begins. ""He is one of the original Brexiteers. He has slowly but surely changed the course of British political history, and he, without question, will go down as one of the most significant political figures in the last 50 or 60 years... He has survived plane crashes that would have killed most people because he is a true patriot, ladies and gentlemen!""

Nigel Farage walks down the centre of the room and it feels as if the sea has parted. He holds his hands aloft as the faithful roar him on, a messiah without portfolio. While he has never been an MP, it is hard to argue with Tice's proposition that he is one of Britain's most influential politicians. At a time when rightwing politics are sweeping the world, Farage is the closest thing we have to a Donald Trump, Viktor Orbán or Jair Bolsonaro - a populist insurgent. In 2016, while the mainstream parties encouraged the British public to remain in Europe, he mobilised 17.4 million people to vote leave. Now, after two years away, Farage has returned to the frontline - and he is furious that the ""political class"" is trying to thwart the will of the people. If he is denied the Brexit he spent a quarter of a century battling for, where will he take the fight next?

When he speaks, Farage makes it clear that his is a reluctant return. He could be making squillions in the City, or breaking bread with Trump, rather than addressing the Brexiters of Bolton. ""I didn't think we'd have to do this again,"" he tells the crowd. ""I thought we'd won on June 23 2016, in what was the greatest democratic exercise in the history of this nation. We voted to leave, and I thought our politicians would deliver. Well, they haven't. So you know what, we're back and we'll fight them again!""

Two days before the rally, Donald Tusk, president of the European council, posted a photograph on Instagram of himself offering Theresa May a selection of cakes, accompanied by the caption: ""A piece of cake, perhaps? Sorry, no cherries."" It was a reference to an earlier speech he had given, arguing that the prime minister could not cherrypick areas of the single market as Britain leaves the EU. Farage is apoplectic about this slight, which he sees as typical of the arrogance of the EU. His message is simple: no Eurocrat has the right to ridicule a British prime minister, however inept.

He takes us back to the greatest day of his life. ""Let's remind ourselves what actually happened on June 23 2016, what happened despite the big political parties, despite the big companies, despite the big banks, despite big global politics, including of course President Obama coming to our country"" - ""Boooo!"" shout the crowd - ""to tell us what we should do. Despite the threats of disaster. Do you remember? From George Osborne there was going to be an emergency budget... They almost told us that if we dared to vote leave, a plague of black locusts would descend on our land. And despite all those threats, we voted to leave. We voted, folks, for independence.""

He says it is now up to Leave Means Leave supporters to ensure that Brexit is not betrayed. ""The vast majority of our politicians want to dilute it, suspend it, overturn it. And one or two former senior politicians like Tony Blair"" - ""Boooo!"" ""Lock him up!"" - ""do not want to give us Brexit.""

Farage foments the crowd with consummate skill. As he reaches a climax, every word becomes a sentence. ""With Mrs May's Chequers plan, the very best we would get is Brexit. In. Name. Only. And. That. Is. Not. Good. Enough. Is it?"" It may be pantomime, but his anger is visceral. The language is clever and deliberate. Like his friend Trump, Farage is careful to distance himself from the political class. He might still be a member of the European parliament, but he is not One of Them. He is here to fight for the Everyman and the Everywoman, struggling to make themselves heard in a world dominated by globalisation and liberal elites.

In June 2016, Farage was less subtle. He posed in front of that notorious Ukip poster with the slogan Breaking Point: The EU Has Failed Us All, showing hundreds of refugees, most of them non-white, crossing the Croatia-Slovenia border in 2015. The poster was reported to police for inciting racial hatred, and even Farage's fellow Brexiter Michael Gove said it made him ""shudder"".

Since then, Farage's frame of reference has become more coded. Blair, Obama, the BBC, London: he doesn't need to say much more than this to generate a boo from his followers - just the name, the institution, the city is enough. It's dog-whistle politics on a new level, although the crowd occasionally give him away: at a mention of London, an audience member heckles, ""They're all foreigners in London!""

Now 54, Farage is in many ways a throwback to a Britannia that ruled the waves, when men and women were addressed as ladies and gentlemen, and prejudices were hidden behind tight smiles. There is a nihilistic sentimentality to his politics; his Britain is one where we still happily smoke our way to cancer and drink ourselves silly before lunch - because no bloody bureaucrat, least of all a European, is going to tell us what's good for us. But beneath the patriot-next-door persona, Farage has changed in many ways - in his language, his alliances, his status across the world. As Ukip has become increasingly irrelevant (membership was down from 39,000 in July 2016 to 23,600 in August 2018), Farage's global influence has grown.

His friendships now cross continents, but they tend to be with white, male, rightwing populists: Trump, Steve Bannon or Hungary's prime minister Viktor Orbán. Last April, Farage tweeted his support for Orbán, who has been accused of Islamophobia and antisemitism, calling him ""the strongest leader in Europe and the EU's biggest nightmare"". The pair share an antipathy towards the Jewish Hungarian investor and philanthropist George Soros, who has given away much of his vast fortune through the Open Society foundation, ""to build vibrant and tolerant democracies"". In June, Farage told Fox News: ""Soros is actively encouraging people to come across the Mediterranean, to flood Europe... Thank goodness Viktor Orbán and Hungary have got the confidence to stand up against him... If you criticise Soros, his media friends accuse you of being an antisemite. It is quite extraordinary. I really feel that Soros in many ways is the biggest danger to the entire western world.""

Today's rally in Bolton is coming to an end, and Tice asks everybody to wave their flags and placards, and to make as big a noise as possible. ""Stand up and let the world see that we believe in Britain, and we want to stop the Brexit betrayal!"" The room cheers as one.

""God bless Great Britain!"" shouts a voice from the back of the hall.

I start to feel self-conscious. ""Aren't you going to wave your flag?"" says the man next to me.

On the way out, I meet a woman dressed in floral pinks and purples. Joan Johnson was chair of Bolton Ukip, until she defected back to the Tories after Britain voted to leave; like many Ukip members, she felt the party had served its purpose. But she's still a Farage fan. Is he Britain's greatest populist politician? ""Yes, I think he is."" What does it mean to be a great populist? ""It means he's a good leader. He's very outspoken, and he tells the truth. He is popular and he is populist, in that he's a leader of the people.""

""He's not a typical politician,"" adds Diane Parkinson, Johnson's friend and another former Ukip activist. ""There's no diplomacy, no sitting on the fence. He's an outcast."" Farage has this in common with other successful populists - an ability to portray himself as the outsider: little David with a fag in one hand and a pint of bitter in the other, kicking out at the all-powerful Goliath.

Bolton is an ethnically diverse city; in 2011, 20% of its population did not identify as white British. Yet everybody here today appears to be white. ""Yes, I noticed that,"" Johnson says, before adding that there is no tension between the city's white and Asian populations. She does not believe relationships between Bolton's Asian and European migrants are as harmonious. ""A lot of the Indians and Pakistanis have their own businesses and they work hard at it. But then you've got your people from eastern Europe coming in, perhaps also wanting to set up businesses, and there are fights.""

""Too many cultures,"" Parkinson says. ""The eastern Europeans saw an opportunity to come over. I'd do the same. It's all about survival. They're taking low-paid jobs, but the British people don't want those low-paid jobs because they've got the benefits system to fall back on.""

On the bus back to Manchester, I meet Alexa Michael, a Conservative councillor for Beckenham in London. ""Nigel says what a lot of ordinary people are thinking but are too frightened to say,"" she tells me. ""He's got the common touch, even though he's got quite a posh background. It's no surprise that people in Bolton, the old mill towns, what you might call working-class areas, were more inclined to vote leave than some of the more prosperous areas.""

And yet the Bolton audience more closely resembled her - smartly dressed, very middle class - not the working-class voters we are often told Farage appeals to.

***

It's a week later, and the battlebus has moved on to Birmingham's National Conference Centre. Again the event is sold out and the 1,000-strong crowd is every bit as white and grey as Bolton's. A dozen miles away, the Conservative party is holding its annual conference. ""I want you to make a big noise today,"" Longworth tells the audience, ""not least because we want those people down the road to hear you.""

Tice takes over, to drum home the purpose of the meeting. ""We know why we're here, don't we? We want to send a very simple message that they should just Chuck Chequers."" Chuck Chequers; No Deal? No Problem; Leave Means Leave: the leavers have both the simplest arguments and the strongest soundbites.

He makes a joke about the battlebus. ""We had such fun deciding how big a number we were going to put on the bus."" This is a reference to the £350m Boris Johnson emblazoned on his Vote Leave bus, the sum we were meant to be saving on EU membership and spending on the NHS every week (he had not accounted for rebates, grants and subsidies). ""I was all for putting 'Save £39bn'!"" Tice says. He pauses to let the audience laugh. ""Unbelievably, I was outvoted - but I believe in democracy."" Thirty nine billion pounds is now the anticipated Brexit divorce bill.

Conservative MP Peter Bone takes to the stage. He talks of the horror of being at the mercy of Europe. ""We didn't fight world wars...""

""No more German cars!"" shouts a member of the audience.

""... to be subservient,"" Bone continues. ""We want to make our own laws in our own countries... The thing that annoyed people enormously was, when we make laws they're not judged by our own judges, they're not decided in our supreme court - they're decided somewhere in Europe by a bunch of judges, half of whom are not qualified anyway.""

""No, they aren't,"" cries a woman at the back.

This might be Margaret Atwood's Gilead; you would fear for the safety of those European judges were they here today.

Bone does a decent job of whipping up the anger, but he knows he's only the warm-up act. ""I think there's someone else,"" he says.

""Mr Brexit!"" calls a voice in the crowd.

""Nigel Farage! Mr Brexit, as somebody says at the front."" Bone gets his biggest cheer, and Tice takes over for the already familiar introduction. ""The vilification, abuse, threats to his family, what he's put up with is unbelievable. His courage manifested when he was unfortunately in a very serious plane crash on one election day. It would have killed many people. Bless him: he dragged himself out, wiped away the odd bit of blood, dusted himself down and promptly lit a cigarette. He is a true patriot. He is possibly the original Brexiter.""

Again the sea splits for Farage, and again he looks more spiv than saviour. There is a touch of Private Walker, the black-market wheeler-dealer in Dad's Army, whose absence from the regular armed forces was explained by a corned-beef allergy. ""Good afternoon, Birmingham,"" he begins. ""I've given the best part of my adult life, battling, fighting, campaigning for one thing - that we, the British people, should be masters of our own destiny, running our own lives, in control of our own country. And. That. Referendum. On. June. 23rd. When. We. Won. That. Vote. Was. The. Happiest. Day. Of. My Life.""

Farage has an advantage over many politicians in knowing how to make his audience laugh. ""We were told by the party leaders that whatever we decided they would abide by,"" he says. ""Indeed, do you remember Mr Cameron?""

""Boooo!"" comes the catcall.

""That's surprising, because most of the country has forgotten about him!"" There is laughter across the room.

""Mr Cameron spent £9m of taxpayers' money putting that outrageous leaflet through every door in the land.""

""Shame! Shame!"" Cameron is heckled in absentia.

""How I enjoyed posting mine back through the letterbox of No 10,"" Farage continues, ""with a few suitable annotations, but not ones I am going to share with you on a public platform.""

Then he's back on the attack. ""Now we are told that we didn't understand what we were voting for. You. Are. All. Thick. And. Pig. Ignorant. They even have the effrontery to tell us that people were lied to - despite the fact that the greatest lie of all was told back in the 1970s, when my parents' generation were told they were joining nothing more than a common market which was about friendship and free trade. Even if Boris's figures on the side of a bus were a bit on the high side, it is nothing to the half a century of lies we have been told by the establishment.""

Farage's argument here is straightforward. The referendum was nothing to do with the terms of leaving, and nobody thought it was; we were simply asked whether we wanted in or out. He even attempts to claim the moral high ground when it comes to the migration argument. The EU, he states, is supremacist. Why should somebody from Europe have more right to live in our country than, say, somebody from Africa or Asia? It's the only line that is not met with a resounding cheer.

But by the time he is done, calling on the audience to stop the Brexit betrayal, they are chanting for more. Lynne, a friendly, middle-aged woman who has been sharing her Polos with me, is on her feet. I ask her why she feels so strongly. She talks about the need for sovereignty, to be able to make our own laws and reclaim our pride. Is it anything to do with immigration? ""No,"" she says. ""Not really."" She pauses. ""But Birmingham isn't as clean as it used to be. Is it? They leave their furniture in the street."" Who - the Europeans? ""No, the Muslims. There are areas that are predominantly Muslim. I'm not racist. They're not to blame. But they don't love our country like we do. They put mattresses in the street. They all drive nice cars, mind - Mercs and BMWs. And then they've got their rubbish piled up."" She offers me another Polo.

I look for Farage, but the man of the people has done a disappearing act. The last time we met, in 2009, he took me to his local pub for breakfast (three pints of Landlord), told me his political hero was Enoch Powell, and talked with pride of his German wife Kirsten and his love of a good lapdance club. But the more renowned this populist becomes, the less accessible he is; Farage declined to be interviewed for this article.

Meanwhile, the less starry members of Leave Means Leave are happy to talk. I ask Peter Bone what populism means to him. ""Doesn't populist mean what most people want?"" he says.

Longworth comes up with a similar definition. ""It's to do with being popular among people, so if populism means we're actually supporting people's democratic rights, I'm all for it.""

As the audience leave, I scan the hall for somebody who looks a bit younger, and spot Jared Day. He is in his 20s, and a wheelchair-user. Day is a smart, engaging man who voted remain but has since become a leaver. Why? ""The EU's lack of respect. I thought the photo that Donald Tusk posted was very distasteful.""

Unlike many politicians, Day has no problem explaining why populism means much more than being popular. ""Populism is more about nationalist lines, the nation state. When you hear about populist governments, they tend to be more internal-looking, almost isolationist.""

Contemporary populism is by its nature oppositional. In his 2016 book The Populist Explosion, a study of how the great recession shaped US and European politics, author John B Judis distinguishes between left- and rightwing populism as follows: ""Leftwing populists champion the people against an elite or an establishment. Theirs is a vertical politics of the bottom and middle, arrayed against the top. Rightwing populists champion the people against an elite that they accuse of favouring a third group, which can consist, for instance, of immigrants, Islamists, or African-American militants. Rightwing populism is triadic: it looks upward, but also down upon an out group."" This feels very much the Leave Means Leave approach.

On my way out, I catch two pairs of sisters chatting. Like Day, their youth makes them stand out. Jill and her sister, who does not give her name, are wearing Brexit sweatshirts, while two identical twins, who also won't give their names, are formally dressed in skirts and jackets; they could be extras for a film about the suffragette movement.

Jill is a chemistry teacher from Sheffield who says she wants Brexit for her pupils. She believes there will be more money for them when we leave, and they will have a better chance of getting decent jobs. One of the twins also teaches, and is looking forward to a brighter future. All four women tell me they despise the mainstream media, particularly the Guardian, because it is a purveyor of fake news. What they dislike most is the notion that they must be ignorant or bigoted to have voted leave. The twins take up Farage's theme, finishing each other's sentences.

""They demonise us...""

""... And make out we're really stupid...""

""... That we don't know what we voted for...""

""And I think that's disgusting.""

Jill, who is wearing union jack trainers, says: ""Demonise is the exact word. I so object to that. I'm not far right or racist. And that, I'm afraid, is the media.""

The women talk about wages being undercut by EU workers, how hard the trade unions have fought for the minimum wage, the need for controlled migration and to look after our own.

As for the notion that British people don't want many of the jobs the Europeans do, Jill is not having any of it. ""Absolute rubbish,"" she says. ""That's like saying the kids I teach are lazy. They're not. They want a job and can't get one, because it's been taken by somebody from the European Union.""

All four women sing from the same hymn sheet, despite coming from opposite ends of the political spectrum. ""The main thing that got me into politics was the magnificent patriot Nigel Farage,"" Jill says. The twins are Corbynistas, dismayed that the Labour leader has suppressed his anti-Europe instincts.

The conversation leaves my head spinning; in some ways, left and right seem an irrelevance in Brexit Britain. Perhaps that's why some Labour MPs have been happy to align themselves with Leave Means Leave. Yet look more closely and you realise that the group is not as cross-party as it would have us believe. All six members of its advisory board are white, male Conservatives. Of the 25 MPs it names as supporters on its website, 24 are Conservatives or members of the DUP. The one exception is the independent MP Kelvin Hopkins, who was suspended from the Labour party in 2017 after it was alleged he sexually harassed a local activist. (He has denied the claims.) Of the 44 prominent members pictured on Leave Means Leave's website, all are white and 43 are men; Andrea Jenkyns, the Conservative who succeeded Ed Balls as MP for Morley and Outwood, is the only woman.

***

It's a Tuesday night in October and we're in Bournemouth, which voted to leave Europe by a margin of 9%. Like the other events, tonight's rally is sold out. Before the speakers start, the audience is shown a film about how intransigent the EU has been in negotiating Brexit. The narrator asks: ""When we asked for cooperation on security, the boys in Brussels said Non! When Mrs May offered flexibility on Labour mobility, the boys in Brussels said Non! Mrs May even offered them more of our money, and this time the boys in Brussels said they wanted more! The UK has consistently offered the boys in Brussels huge concessions yet it is never enough for these unaccountable Eurocrats who, let's remember, spend an awful lot of their time... drunk.""

On the screen, a cartoon inebriated Eurocrat topples over, and the crowd cheer. Alcohol is a recurring theme tonight. JD Wetherspoon boss Tim Martin was due to make an appearance, but he has gone down with a tummy bug, so we are played a video of him addressing a rally in Torquay the previous week instead.

""Lord Bamford, Sir James Dyson, Tim Martin... have you noticed how all the great entrepreneurs are Brexiters?"" John Longworth says. ""Tim set up a chain of almost 1,000 pubs.""

""And Nigel's drunk in most of them!"" heckles a man in front of me affectionately.

Tice has perfected his introduction over the past month. ""He is possibly the original, truest Brexiteer!"" he begins.

""He should be prime minister!"" cries a voice from the front.

Tice tells the story of Farage's helicopter crash, this time leaving a gap for the audience to applaud each heroic act. ""It would have killed many people, but not our good friend. He dragged himself out of the plane, wiped away the blood from his head, from his eyes, dusted himself down... ""

""Hoorah!""

""Put his hand in his pocket... ""

""Hoorah!""

""Reached out for a packet of cigarettes and lit a fag.""

""Hoooooorraaaaah!""

Farage begins with a humblebrag. ""Good evening, Bournemouth. I'm going to take issue with the deputy chair's introduction. I'm not the original Brexiteer. That was Henry VIII."" He appears to be in a jovial mood. ""My day started when I got off the battlebus in Christchurch. I went round Christchurch market, and I met some stallholders and members of the public, and then it all went wrong."" Pause. ""We found a pub.""

This is Farage the seaside standup, and the audience lap it up. ""The day after the referendum, there was an emergency debate in the European parliament. I thought I'd better show up, you know, 'cos I've worked quite hard over there. I've always tried to make positive and helpful contributions. And there waiting for me was European commission president Jean-Claude Juncker, who came up, put an arm round me, and said... 'Bastard!'""

The hall erupts. Then Farage flips the mood. ""I said to them, 'That morning when I came here, 17 years ago, I said I would lead a campaign to take the United Kingdom out of the European Union, and you laughed at me. Well,' I said, 'you're not laughing now, are you?'""

And suddenly Farage flips again; now he's mobilising his troops. ""This is the most important campaign that has ever been fought in British history. This. Campaign. Is. About. Right. And. Wrong. We are simply asking our politicians to do what they promised.""

There was a time, he says, when he trusted May when she said that no deal was better than a bad deal. ""She kept on telling us Brexit means Brexit, but little did we know that she is a woman who is too weak to negotiate with the European commission."" He pauses. ""I'd much rather we sent someone like Trump, personally!"" The audience applauds.

Now it's time for strategy, as Farage tells supporters how to confront MPs. ""I don't want you writing letters to them. Go and visit them at their surgeries, queue around the block, meet them face to face, make them feel the heat, make them understand that being part of a customs union, being a vassal state with laws made somewhere else, is unacceptable. And that if they do this, you will never give them your vote again. Make. Them. Feel. The. Heat. We in Leave Means Leave are reactivating the people's army.""

The language is tough and militaristic, and Farage's delivery chilling. He warns that if he is forced to fight a second referendum we'll see a very different Farage: ""This time, no more Mr Nice Guy."" I can't help thinking back to his victory speech after the referendum, delivered at 4am on 24 June 2016. Farage boasted that Brexit had been achieved ""without a single bullet being fired"". It was only eight days after the strongly pro-EU Labour MP Jo Cox had been murdered on her way to a constituency surgery. Her killer, Thomas Mair, shouted ""Keep Britain independent""and ""Britain first"" as he shot and stabbed her. But Farage appeared to have forgotten that.

***

On 13 November, Theresa May announces that the UK and the European Union have reached an agreement; the next day the Cabinet signs off on the deal. Leave Means Leave organises a protest outside Downing Street. On 15 November, Brexit secretary Dominic Raab is one of four ministers to resign amid calls for the prime minister to step down.

Britain remains gridlocked; Westminster is in chaos and yet nothing changes. On 10 December, the day before the Commons is due to have its say on the deal, May announces the vote will be delayed. The following day Graham Brady, chair of the 1922 Committee, announces that the threshold has been reached for a vote of no confidence in the prime minister; at least 48 letters have been submitted by Tory MPs. Although May survives, winning by 200 votes to 117, she appears to have as little chance of getting her deal through the Commons as she did before.

Meanwhile, there is a similar upheaval in Farage's world - revolution leading to stasis. On 22 November, Ukip leader Gerard Batten announces that he has appointed far-right activist and former EDL leader Tommy Robinson as a special adviser on ""rape gangs"" and prison reform. In an interview on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Farage says he is ""appalled"", that Ukip is becoming a party of ""street activism"", and that Batten has sabotaged his own efforts to make Ukip ""a non-racist, non-sectarian party"". This is the same Farage who masterminded the Breaking Point poster; the same Farage who talked only days ago about mobilising a people's army. On 4 December, he announces that he is quitting Ukip ""with a heavy heart"": he has lost his battle to ""professionalise"" the party he helped found in 1993. But the truth is, he has outgrown Ukip. Its once marginal voice is now mainstream, and Farage has bigger political fish to fry.

***

It is 14 December, and all the big guns are out for the Leave Means Leave rally at the Queen Elizabeth II Centre, opposite the Houses of Parliament. Jacob Rees-Mogg, JD Wetherspoon boss Tim Martin, the DUP's Sammy Wilson and, of course, Farage, line up to deliver the same message - No Deal? No Problem - only with more urgency. There is a new chant: ""Let's go bigger than Europe. Let's go Global. Let's Go WTO."" Inconsistency appears to be a virtue for this populist campaign; globalism is now presented as a positive rather than a negative.

Tonight, the two Labour MPs who have spoken at previous rallies, Kate Hoey and Graham Stringer, are on the same bill, giving the event a more genuinely cross-party feel. But there is nothing diverse about the audience, and the whiteness is, if anything, even more stark than at previous rallies - not least because nearly every security officer on the door is black.

This is the first rally held in the heart of remain-land - London - and the mood is darker, more defiant. There is a sense of the battle lines hardening: only two days ago, chancellor Philip Hammond described hard Brexiters as ""extremists"".

Tonight, all six speakers have the knack of being able to incite the crowd or make them laugh - even the antediluvian Rees-Mogg, dubbed the honourable member for the 18th century. Hoey asks how we can trust the government to take us out of the EU when it is led by a prime minister who is a remainer, a chancellor who regards Brexiters as extremists and a Speaker ""who has a Bollocks to Brexit sticker on his car"". Tim Martin concludes his speech by quoting Paul Simon (""You just slip out the back, Jack/Make a new plan, Stan/You don't need to be coy, Roy/Just get yourself free""). Puce-faced Sammy Wilson delivers a barnstorming unionist speech (""The EU is demanding the price for leaving is splitting the United Kingdom. Never!"") and says that not even Arthur Daley would have had the brass to flog the Chequers deal to the British public.

As always, though, Farage is the star turn. He makes the familiar jokes about booze, dismisses the ""jumped-up foreign bureaucrats"" of Brussels, and describes the Italian government (which has scrapped humanitarian protection status for asylum seekers) as ""rather splendid"". But this is a more muted, restrained Farage. He admits he is worried.

""I'm afraid, folks, I don't see the great Brexit betrayal as anywhere near finished. I'm now more fearful than at any time I have been during this process that, outrageous and monstrous though it is, we're going to finish up being sent back for a second referendum... My message, folks, is it would be wrong of us not to get ready, not to prepare for the worst-case scenario... Let us be ready not just to fight back, not just to be ready for that referendum, but if it comes we'll win it next time. By. A. Much. Bigger. Majority."" Back in January 2018, Farage surprised everyone by calling for a second referendum, on the grounds it would deliver a bigger leave majority. But it was a classic Farage blip, and he has never called for one since. Last August, he dismissed the idea as ""not the people's vote, but the George Soros vote"".

After his speech in London, Farage is mobbed. A huddle forms around him, comprised mainly of the few young people in the audience. A woman in her 20s, draped in a union jack, asks for a selfie. Her friend, also draped in a union jack, pushes her way forward. ""Excuse me, seeing as I got her these tickets, the least you can do is give me a kiss,"" she says to Farage.

This is the closest I've been to him in three months of following the Leave Means Leave campaign - within shouting distance. So I do just that. Earlier this evening, someone in the audience asked who people should vote for, now that Farage has quit Ukip. The question went unanswered, so I ask again. ""Nigel, who should we vote for?""

""Who asked that?"" he says.

""I asked that,"" I bellow, deep within the bosom of the Faragistas. He looks at me.

""Well, let's find out, shall we? At the moment I couldn't vote for anybody. But let's see how this plays out. The cards haven't fallen yet. I meant what I said tonight. All the Eurosceptics are hoping we're going to get through this, but I'm actually more pessimistic.""

Do we need to mobilise? ""Yes. When you build an army, you don't do it wanting to fight a war. But if a war happens, you've got it. And that's what we've now got to do."" And with that he's off, flanked by two security men.

I shout one of his own slogans after him as he walks away. ""Nigel, no more Mr Nice Guy?"" He turns on his heels, walks back and looks me in the face. For once there isn't a hint of a smile. ""Oh listen. Listen. If they make us do this again, I shall be a bit tougher than last time.""

254,the guardian,http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/dec/16/rudy-giuliani-trump-robert-mueller-interview,"Donald Trump's personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, on Sunday ruled out a face to face interview between the president and special counsel Robert Mueller - because he fears investigators would try to trap Trump into lying.

As pressure increases on Trump in a range of investigations, Giuliani told Fox News Sunday that an interview would happen ""over my dead body"".

Trump has given written answers to Mueller about whether his 2016 election campaign colluded with Russia. But the White House has refused to engage with requests for a sit-down interview to answer questions about whether Trump obstructed justice after he became president - most notably by firing FBI chief James Comey.

Asked if Trump would sit for an interview with Mueller, an irate Giuliani said sarcastically on Sunday: ""Yeah, good luck!""

After events in the Mueller inquiry have intensified in recent weeks, involving grave consequences for criminal conduct for some key Trump allies, Giuliani said he was ""disgusted"" with the conduct of the Mueller investigation. He accused the special counsel's lawyers of setting a ""perjury trap"" for Michael Flynn, Trump's short-lived national security adviser.

Flynn will be sentenced on Tuesday for lying to the FBI about his contact with Russian officials during the transition period after Trump won the election in November 2016 and was preparing to take office in January 2017.

Flynn last year admitted lying to investigators about his communications with Russia's ambassador to the US in December 2016. The discussions related to sanctions that Barack Obama as president had imposed on Moscow over its interference in the US election, and a United Nations security council vote on halting new Israeli settlements.

But Flynn's lawyers, in appealing for leniency, noted that FBI agents had decided not to warn him that it was a crime to lie during an FBI interview ""because they wanted Flynn to be relaxed"".

They had wiretaps of the Russian ambassador which theylater used to confront Flynn to show he had lied. Flynn then agreed to co-operate with Mueller's investigation and has given ""substantial assistance"" to the Trump-Russia investigation and other inquiries.

Mueller recommended to a judge that Flynn, who participated in 19 interviews, should not be given a prison sentence.

A sentencing memo said Flynn had given firsthand accounts of ""interactions between individuals in the presidential transition team and Russia"".

Giuliani said on Sunday: ""I am disgusted with the tactics they have used in this case ... what they did to General Flynn should result in discipline - they are the ones who are violating the law.""

Asked about a face-to-face interview between Trump and Mueller, Giuliani scoffed: ""Yeah, good luck! After what they did to Flynn, the way they trapped him into perjury ... over my dead body.""

Officials, however, have balked at the notion that Flynn would not have already been acutely aware of the risks of lying to federal investigators.

Giuliani's remarks came as new polling showed six in 10 Americans now believe Trump has been untruthful about the investigation into Russia's interference in the 2016 presidential campaign.

Half of Americans polled said the investigation has given them doubts about Trump's presidency, according to a new national NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll.

""The dam has not burst on Donald Trump,"" said the Democratic pollster Peter Hart, whose firm conducted the survey with Republican pollster Bill McInturff. ""But this survey suggests all the structural cracks in the dam,"" he told NBC News.

The poll was conducted in the week former Trump fixer Michael Cohen was sentenced to three years in prison for offences including breaking campaign finance laws by arranging hush money payments. Large sums were paid to porn actor and producer Stormy Daniels and Playboy model Karen McDougal to prevent them talking in the final days of the 2016 election campaign about alleged affairs with Trump.

Cohen - denounced as a ""pathological liar"" by Giuliani - has said Trump knew about the payments. And in court last week, in vital corroborating evidence, the publisher of National Enquirer admitted it had coordinated with Trump's presidential campaign to pay McDougal $150,000 ""in concert with the campaign"".

The agreement between American Media Inc (AMI) and federal authorities that means the company will not face charges, said that in August 2015, Cohen and ""at least one other member of the campaign"" met AMI's chief executive David Pecker, who ""offered to help deal with negative stories"" about Trump during the presidential campaign. Reports have suggested that Trump was the other person in the room.

In a second interview on Sunday with ABC's This Week, Giuliani said: ""Whether it happened or didn't, it's not illegal.""

On Sunday morning, Donald Trump posted on Twitter: ""Remember, Michael Cohen only became a ""Rat"" after the FBI did something which was absolutely unthinkable & unheard of until the Witch Hunt was illegally started. They BROKE INTO AN ATTORNEY'S OFFICE! Why didn't they break into the DNC to get the Server, or Crooked's office?""

The latter references involve the Democratic National Committee (DNC), the governing body of the Democratic party, and, presumably, Hillary Clinton, Trump's rival for the White House, whom he nicknamed Crooked Hillary because she was investigated by the FBI for using a private server for emails while she was secretary of state, and admonished, though cleared of any illegal activity."

Goaded by Rush Limbaugh and Ann Coulter, Trump makes a last-minute declaration he won't sign Republican legislation to keep the government open and demands $5bn for a border wall.

256,the guardian,http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jan/08/gun-control-democrats-background-check-bill,"Five days after taking over the majority in the chamber, House Democrats are set to introduce a bill that would significantly expand the requirements for background checks on gun sales.

In a major victory for gun control advocates, the legislation aims to close longstanding loopholes in federal law, which requires criminal background checks when guns are sold by licensed dealers but allows private citizens to sell and transfer guns to each other without any background check.

Closing these loopholes has been the top priority of the growing American gun control movement since the 2012 mass shooting at Sandy Hook elementary school, which left 20 children and six educators dead.

""I am thrilled that for the first time in decades, the United States House of Representatives will no longer sit silent as our nation reels from the growing gun violence epidemic,"" the former Democratic congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords said in a statement. The bill will be introduced on the eighth anniversary of the Tucson, Arizona, mass shooting that targeted one of Giffords' constituent meetings. Giffords, who survived being shot in the head in an attack that left six people dead, now leads one of the country's leading gun control groups.

While the new bill - a top priority of the new House Democratic majority - is expected to pass the House, it is likely to be blocked from becoming law by the Republican-controlled Senate.

Still, even the partial passage of what Democrats are calling a ""universal background checks bill"" represents a significant step forward for American gun control advocates, as well as a sign of how far the Democratic party has moved to embrace gun control as a winning issue.

Early in the Obama administration, national Democratic leaders avoided getting involved in the gun control debate, following the Bill Clinton-approved strategy that saw gun control as the toxic ""third rail"" of American politics.

In 2016, after a mass shooting at an Orlando nightclub that left 49 people dead, House Republican leaders refused even to allow a debate on gun control legislation, prompting a dramatic protest by Democrats, who staged a 26-hour sit-in on the floor of the House of Representatives.

The new legislation is expected to be significantly stronger and more comprehensive than the background check compromise that advanced after the Sandy Hook shooting, which would have closed the background check loophole for gun sales on the Internet and at gun shows but left other private sales unregulated. That compromise failed to gain enough votes to overcome a potential filibuster in the Senate.

The stronger bill would not have seen the light without the continued activism by gun violence survivors, Peter Ambler, the executive director of Giffords' gun control group, told the Guardian. ""We'll do everything we can to get this across the finish line,"" he added.

Giffords and other gun violence survivors, including students from the Parkland, Florida, high school who helped galvanize a national youth movement for gun control after a school shooting left 17 people dead there last year, are expected in Washington to mark the bill's introduction.

Public opinion polls routinely find that overwhelming majorities of American voters, including Republicans and gun owners, support requiring background checks for all gun buyers. But the policy has been opposed by the National Rifle Association, gun manufacturers, and other gun rights advocates, who argue that increased legal regulations on gun buying is not an effective approach to deterring gun crime, and who also oppose most governmental regulation of guns on principle.

An estimated 22% of Americans who bought a gun in recent years did so without a background check, according to the best recent survey data. Nearly 40,000 Americans were killed with firearms in 2017, the majority of them gun suicides, according to statistics from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention."
257,the guardian,http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/dec/17/dont-blame-jakelin-caals-death-father-us-policies,"There are still unknown facts about the death of Jakelin Caal, the seven-year-old Guatemalan girl who died in the custody of US Border Patrol. Caal became seriously ill while being bussed to a detention center located about 90 miles from the New Mexican desert where she and her father were picked up. US officials have blamed Caal's father, insisting that Caal had not had food or water for days when she arrived and that Caal's father signed a form asserting she was healthy when she arrived.

Caal's father has insisted that this is false -- that his daughter had been eating and drinking, that they hadn't undertaken the kind of long desert crossing portrayed in the press, and that the form the US cites was in English, a language he does not speak.

We do know that Caal did not receive treatment for 90 minutes after she began showing symptoms. In the coming days, more information about Caal's death may emerge that will allow us to determine what US officials knew, whether they reacted quickly or not, and whether the medical care she received was adequate.

But these questions are almost secondary, because US responsibility for the suffering of migrant children is already very clear. When asked about Caal, a White House spokesman replied: ""Does the administration take responsibility for a parent taking a child on a trek through Mexico to get to this country? No."" This attempt to shift blame onto desperate parents ignores critical facts.

First, Border Patrol, aware that the desert is more difficult to monitor, deliberately seeks to make the desert crossing more deadly for migrants. They have been repeatedly caught destroying stashes of water left in the desert by humanitarian groups, and an investigation by No More Deaths concluded that this was ""not the deviant behavior of a few rogue border patrol agents, [but] a systemic feature of enforcement practices in the borderlands.""

An ex Border Patrol agent has written about how he once gave water to a four-year-old boy after he found a family lost in the desert. A fellow-officer arriving on the scene then kicked the jug out of the child's hands, saying, ""There's no amnesty here."" Temperatures in the desert are so extreme that bodies are quite literally vaporized in a matter of days, meaning that there is no telling how many people perish in the crossing.

Second, it's impossible to look at migration without its context. Caal was an indigenous Mayan who came from severe poverty in the village of Raxruhá. It's worth remembering that the United States has been a direct cause of the conditions of indigenous Guatemalans over the last half century. Many Americans have forgotten the 1954 coup in which the US overthrew the country's reformist government, leading to decades of US-backed authoritarian rule. They have also forgotten this country's role in providing financial and military support for a genocidal government that massacred Guatemala's indigenous population by the tens of thousands during that country's civil war. Contemporary conditions in Guatemala are in significant part our responsibility.

The United States has actually made it more likely that immigrants will choose to brave the desert, by closing down other options. During the overland journey from Central America to Mexico, many people are beaten, robbed, kidnapped, and sexually assaulted on the journey, by everyone from cartel members to Mexican immigration police. It is, indeed, a dangerous journey to bring a child on, but there are often few other options even for those who wish to legally seek asylum.

The US has imposed massive carrier fees on airlines who allow people to board without visas, even if they are doing so for the purpose of entering the asylum process. And the Trump administration, for all that it performatively wrings its hands over the welfare of children, has also systematically cancelled the few existing programs that allowed a small number of endangered minors to come to the United States to seek asylum without needing to make the perilous trip through Mexico.

Men crossing with their children, as Caal's father did, face a particularly difficult set of options. There are not dedicated facilities to detain dads together with their kids, and separations of fathers from children happened under both Obama and Trump. Last year, a father hanged himself in his cell after his child was ripped from his arms.

It's difficult for migrants to obtain reliable information about their options, because the government, for political reasons, publicly denies that it continues to ""catch and release"" migrants at the border, or that it is continuing to separate families. (In reality, both practices are happening regularly.) Migrants rely on word-of-mouth intelligence, or the questionable say-so of coyotes, to understand what will happen to them when they cross the border. A dad who wanted to avoid any chance of being separated from his child might be advised to cross at a remote location where Border Patrol was less likely to catch them.

Finally, while Jakelin Caal fell ill on a bus and not in a DHS holding facility, it's worth mentioning that conditions in DHS custody are truly terrible. A child died earlier this year shortly after leaving the South Texas Family Residential Center, where hundreds of women and children -- including pregnant women and people with serious health conditions -- are confined in close quarters, more than an hour's drive from any hospital that can provide specialist care. At border holding cells, adults and children are regularly forced to sleep on hard concrete floors, drink contaminated water, sit in their own filth, and endure physical and psychological abuse from border guards. The very facility where Caal was held had previously been cited for contaminated water.

Jakelin Caal's case shows the disturbing human reality of Central American migration. But far beyond her tragic death, US policies and practices continue to contribute to the pain and misery of tens of thousands of desperate families.

258,the guardian,http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jan/11/trump-administration-evangelical-influence-support,"In setting out the Trump administration's Middle East policy, one of the first things Mike Pompeo made clear to his audience in Cairo is that he had come to the region as ""as an evangelical Christian"".

In his speech at the American University, Pompeo said that in his state department office: ""I keep a Bible open on my desk to remind me of God and his word, and the truth.""

The secretary of state's primary message in Cairo was that the US was ready once more to embrace conservative Middle Eastern regimes, no matter how repressive, if they made common cause against Iran.

His second message was religious. In his visit to Egypt, he came across as much as a preacher as a diplomat. He talked about ""America's innate goodness"" and marveled at a newly built cathedral as ""a stunning testament to the Lord's hand"".

The desire to erase Barack Obama's legacy, Donald Trump's instinctive embrace of autocrats, and the private interests of the Trump Organisation have all been analysed as driving forces behind the administration's foreign policy.

The gravitational pull of white evangelicals has been less visible. But it could have far-reaching policy consequences. Vice President Mike Pence and Pompeo both cite evangelical theology as a powerful motivating force.

Just as he did in Cairo, Pompeo called on the congregation of a Kansan megachurch three years ago to join a fight of good against evil.

""We will continue to fight these battles,"" the then congressman said at the Summit church in Wichita. ""It is a never-ending struggle ... until the rapture. Be part of it. Be in the fight.""

For Pompeo's audience, the rapture invoked an apocalyptical Christian vision of the future, a final battle between good and evil, and the second coming of Jesus Christ, when the faithful will ascend to heaven and the rest will go to hell.

For many US evangelical Christians, one of the key preconditions for such a moment is the gathering of the world's Jews in a greater Israel between the Mediterranean and the Jordan River. It is a belief, known as premillenial dispensationalism or Christian Zionism - and it has very real potential consequences for US foreign policy.

It directly colours views on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, and indirectly, attitudes towards Iran, broader Middle East geopolitics and the primacy of protecting Christian minorities. In his Cairo visit, Pompeo heaped praise on Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, for building the new cathedral, but made no reference to the 60,000 political prisoners the regime is thought to be holding, or its routine use of torture.

Pompeo is an evangelical Presbyterian, who says he was ""brought to Jesus"" by other cadets at the West Point military academy in the 1980s.

""He knows best how his faith interacts with his political beliefs and the duties he undertakes as secretary of state,"" said Stan van den Berg, senior pastor of Pompeo's church in Wichita in an email. ""Suffice to say, he is a faithful man, he has integrity, he has a compassionate heart, a humble disposition and a mind for wisdom.""

As Donald Trump finds himself ever more dependent on them for his political survival, the influence of Pence, Pompeo and the ultra-conservative white Evangelicals who stand behind them is likely to grow.

""Many of them relish the second coming because for them it means eternal life in heaven,"" Andrew Chesnut, professor of religious studies at Virginia Commonwealth University said. ""There is a palpable danger that people in high position who subscribe to these beliefs will be readier to take us into a conflict that brings on Armageddon.""

Chesnut argues that Christian Zionism has become the ""majority theology"" among white US Evangelicals, who represent about a quarter of the adult population. In a 2015 poll, 73% of evangelical Christians said events in Israel are prophesied in the Book of Revelation. Respondents were not asked specifically whether their believed developments in Israel would actually bring forth the apocalypse.

The relationship between evangelicals and the president himself is complicated.

Trump himself embodies the very opposite of a pious Christian ideal. Trump is not churchgoer. He is profane, twice divorced, who has boasted of sexually assaulting women. But white evangelicals have embraced him.

Eighty per cent of white evangelicals voted for him in 2016, and his popularity among them is remains in the 70s. While other white voters have flaked away in the first two years of his presidency, white evangelicals have become his last solid bastion.

Some leading evangelicals see Trump as a latterday King Cyrus, the sixth-century BC Persian emperor who liberated the Jews from Babylonian captivity.

The comparison is made explicitly in The Trump Prophecy, a religious film screened in 1,200 cinemas around the country in October, depicting a retired firefighter who claims to have heard God's voice, saying: ""I've chosen this man, Donald Trump, for such a time as this.""

Lance Wallnau, a self-proclaimed prophet who features in the film, has called Trump ""God's Chaos Candidate"" and a ""modern Cyrus"".

""Cyrus is the model for a nonbeliever appointed by God as a vessel for the purposes of the faithful,"" said Katherine Stewart, who writes extensively about the Christian right.

She added that they welcome his readiness to break democratic norms to combat perceived threats to their values and way of life.

""The Christian nationalist movement is characterized by feelings of persecution and, to some degree, paranoia - a clear example is the idea that there is somehow a ""war on Christmas"","" Stewart said. ""People in those positions will often go for authoritarian leaders who will do whatever is necessary to fight for their cause.""

Trump was raised as a Presbyterian, but leaned increasingly towards evangelical preachers as he began contemplating a run for the presidency.

Trump's choice of Pence as a running mate was a gesture of his commitment, and four of the six preachers at his inauguration were evangelicals, including White and Franklin Graham, the eldest son of the preacher Billy Graham, who defended Trump through his many sex scandals, pointing out: ""We are all sinners.""

Having lost control of the House of Representatives in November, and under ever closer scrutiny for his campaign's links to the Kremlin, Trump's instinct has been to cleave ever closer to his most loyal supporters.

Almost alone among major demographic groups, white evangelicals are overwhelmingly in favour of Trump's border wall, which some preachers equate with fortifications in the Bible.

Evangelical links have also helped shape US alliances in the Trump presidency. As secretary of state, Pompeo has been instrumental in forging link with other evangelical leaders in the hemisphere, including Guatemala's Jimmy Morales and the new Brazilian president, Jair Bolsonaro. Both have undertaken to follow the US lead in moving their embassies in Israel to Jerusalem.

Trump's order to move the US embassy from Tel Aviv - over the objections of his foreign policy and national security team - is a striking example of evangelical clout.

The move was also pushed by Las Vegas billionaire and Republican mega-donor, Sheldon Adelson, but the orchestration of the embassy opening ceremony last May, reflected the audience Trump was trying hardest to appease.

The two pastors given the prime speaking slots were both ardent Christian Zionists: Robert Jeffress, a Dallas pastor on record as saying Jews, like Muslims and Mormons, are bound for hell; and John Hagee, a televangelist and founder of Christians United for Israel (Cufi), who once said that Hitler and the Holocaust were part of God's plan to get Jews back to Israel, to pave the way for the Rapture.

For many evangelicals, the move cemented Trump's status as the new Cyrus, who oversaw the Jews return to Jerusalem and rebuild the Temple.

The tightening of the evangelical grip on the administration has also been reflected in a growing hostility to the UN, often portrayed as a sinister and godless organisation.

Since the US ambassador, Nikki Haley, announced her departure in October and Pompeo took more direct control, the US mission has become increasingly combative, blocking references to gender and reproductive health in UN documents.

Some theologians also see an increasingly evangelical tinge to the administration's broader Middle East policies, in particular its fierce embrace of Binyamin Netanyahu's government, the lack of balancing sympathy for the Palestinians - and the insistent demonisation of the Iranian government.

Evangelicals, Chesnut said, ""now see the United States locked into a holy war against the forces of evil who they see as embodied by Iran"".

In a speech at the end of a regional tour on Thursday, Pompeo reprised the theme, describing Iran as a ""cancerous influence"".

This zeal for a defining struggle has thus far found common cause with more secular hawks such as the national security adviser, John Bolton, and Trump's own drive to eliminate the legacy of Barack Obama, whose signature foreign policy achievement was the 2015 nuclear deal with Tehran, which Trump abrogated last May.

In conversations with European leaders such as Emmanuel Macron and Theresa May, Trump has reportedly insisted he has no intention of going to war with Iran. His desire to extricate US troops from Syria marks a break with hawks, religious and secular, who want to contain Iranian influence there.

But the logic of his policy of ever-increasing pressure, coupled with unstinting support for Israel and Saudi Arabia, makes confrontation with Iran ever more likely.

One of the most momentous foreign policy questions of 2019 is whether Trump can veer away from the collision course he has helped set in motion - perhaps conjuring up a last minute deal, as he did with North Korea - or instead welcome conflict as a distraction from his domestic woes, and sell it the faithful as a crusade."
259,the guardian,http://www.theguardian.com/media/commentisfree/2019/jan/13/us-tv-trump-speech-broadcasters-fact-checking,"Broadcasters criticised for giving president access, as fact checking becomes a media event

Donald Trump's speech on the Mexican ""border crisis"", delivered live from the Oval Office last week, marked a milestone in his brief but historically chaotic presidency; it revealed serious errors of judgment that weren't simply down to him. Unfortunately for commercial media outlets, it was their shortcomings that attracted almost as much attention and criticism as the scaremongering speech itself.

It is the hallmark of many non-Democratic countries that tinpot dictators appear, at the drop of a hat, on national broadcast outlets. Even in functioning democracies you can measure the importance of a national moment by whether the head of state or government pops up in prime time. For this reason appearances by US presidents on all TV networks were traditionally a relatively rare occurrence. When they do happen, the decision to run them is made on an ad hoc basis by the heads of those networks.

Until Trump, the establishment organisations of US public life - which include the president and the major television stations - were so closely aligned on the circumstances for accessing the airwaves that clear rules seemed unnecessary, at least in the age of media deference to the presidency; Richard Nixon managed nine live addresses to the nation.

The last time an American president requested airtime and was refused was when Barack Obama wanted to address the nation on immigration policy in 2014. The networks' reasoning included the fact that Obama had been allowed Oval Office addresses before, and this seemed to not be as big a deal.

This time, the danger that Trump would use the platform to spread nonsense and untruth in a thinly veiled campaign for a personal policy was weighed carefully against the fact that Trump had not yet had an Oval Office address and that it would be ""newsworthy"", on account of the ongoing impasse over funding the government.

In fact, Trump has already made 17 presidential addresses, but only the latest was given seated behind his desk in the White House. Obama only gave 20 such speeches in the whole of his eight-year tenure.

The policy background is the punishing government shutdown that threatens the wages of 800,000 workers over the insistence by Trump that Congress give him $5.7bn (£4.5bn) to build a border wall with Mexico. The centrepiece of his xenophobic campaign platform, his dream of building the wall, has been stymied by both cost concerns and the laws of physics (large stretches of the US-Mexican border are not wall friendly). His request that public funds be made available to erect a fence - a cheaper, if no less ridiculous, option - has met with Democratic opposition, and ultimately a failure to fund many government activities.

The inability of 11 separate network heads to say ""no"" to Trump caused frustration on a number of levels. It was yet another sign, said some commentators, of the networks not ""getting it"", following the normal rules of engagement with a presidency that is abnormal to the point of dysfunction.

A more nuanced point is that journalists employed by the same networks are often subject to abuse and even physical danger because of Trump's hostility to the press: CNN correspondent Jim Acosta had his press credentials withdrawn for upsetting the president, and Katy Tur of NBC had to be given secret service protection at Trump rallies during his campaign.

Allowing a president noted for his untruthfulness access to their networks arguably put protocol above national interest, or perhaps, more honestly, prioritised ratings over principle.

Brian Stelter, CNN's media editor, told the New Yorker he thought the decision was driven by tradition: ""It is not that television networks are unaware or uninterested in the president's mendacity,"" he said. ""But I think that tradition, that custom, of broadcasting the president simply outweighs the concerns.""

Given the refusal to allow Obama airtime, this argument looks a trifle disingenuous, made more so by the attendant ratings. The speech and an accompanying rebuttal by Democrat leaders Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer were seen by more than 43 million viewers. Trump remains strong box office.

The viewing figures are, however, only one aspect of a series of coordinated events. There was the prelude to the speech, in which Trump invited network bosses to lunch and told them he didn't, in fact, want to be on TV at all, but his advisers were making him. There was the Democratic rebuttal and the subsequent memes. There was the discussion about the speech (see above) and there was the fact checking which has now become a media event in itself.

The assumption that the speech might be false and misleading opened up the opportunity for a fact-checked meta-narrative to run alongside the event. The (non-profit) Associated Press won the prize for worst use of fact checking with a tweet that read: ""AP fact check: Democrats put the blame for the shutdown on Trump. But it takes two to tango. Trump's demand for $5.7bn for his border wall is one reason for the budget impasse. The Democrats' refusal to approve the money is another.""

In a move that strayed beyond satire, AP then adjusted its own fact check to better conform to the facts.

The Trump Show is a live experiment in what happens when the complete fusion of politics, technology and public entertainment occurs. Journalists and politicians alike struggle to find a footing that keeps them simultaneously relevant and rational. As Trump was sniffing uncomfortably behind his desk on Tuesday, potential contenders for 2020 were popping up on Instagram using the platform's fleeting Stories function, frolicking with their dogs or having their teeth cleaned.

Meanwhile, on the southern border, where the real policy story is playing out, there was scant coverage of fringe groups harassing asylum seekers sheltered by churches. And the wider story about the growing crisis in processing immigration cases was eclipsed.

This time next year we will be in full-on primary season as part of the run up to the 2020 election, and the era of Trump might be drawing to a close. The television networks and press corps might imagine there will then be a return to normality. But this heightened environment of mediated and unmediated communications is the new reality.

Interaction between politicians, the public and the press has been permanently altered. The fourth wall has come down far faster than the border wall could ever be constructed. As yet it is not entirely clear that the commercial media has decided what role it could - or should - play in this changed world."
260,the guardian,http://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/dec/21/should-geoffrey-rush-be-dropped-from-the-new-storm-boy-film,"When Geoffrey Rush signed on play an ageing version of the titular character in the upcoming Storm Boy reboot, the producers would have been over the moon. They had just, after all, secured one of Australia's most famous and acclaimed actors to lend his gravitas to a seminal Australian text, originating as a children's book written by Colin Thiele in the 1960s.

Playing a grown-up Mike ""Storm Boy"" Kingsley, who narrates to his granddaughter a melancholic story about his childhood experiences living on an isolated coastline, it is a role custom-built for gravitas. The producers would have been more than happy - chuffed, even - to pay Rush a reported $500,000 for his participation.

But now, oh, the irony. The veteran Oscar, Emmy and Tony-winning actor is an albatross hanging around the film's neck and the source of a terrible conundrum for the producers.

With the film set to open in Australian cinemas on 17 January (having already been delayed from an original 2018 release), the producers are no doubt worried that Rush's name will render the film dead on arrival. The veteran actor is now at the centre of separate allegations of sexual misconduct from multiple parties - most recently Orange is the New Black star Yael Stone, who this week gave damning testimony to the New York Times and ABC's 7.30. Rush has strenuously denied the allegations levelled by Stone.

""Bird like him, never die"" is the unforgettable line delivered in both film versions of Storm Boy, bestowing upon the beautiful pelican Mr Percival a symbolic eternity. Mythical creatures waddling along the beaches of our childhood memories might never die, but in reality careers perish and films flop. We are at a point in history now when the old saying ""all publicity is good publicity"" has been categorically disproved.

The current time is a period of heightened scrutiny for the off-screen behaviour of film and television cast and crew, particularly when it comes to issues around sexual misconduct. Nobody wants to be seen as condoning inappropriate behaviour or fanning the fires of community outrage.

The Storm Boy producers found themselves in a similar situation as the producers of the American sitcom Roseanne (after its star, Roseanne Barr, published a racist tweet in May mocking former Barack Obama adviser Valerie Jarrett) as well the producers of Netflix's House of Cards and the feature film All the Money in the World (both starring Kevin Spacey, who has been accused of numerous instances of sexual assault and misconduct).

In these examples recompense was delivered swiftly and decisively. Barr was fired and her titular character killed off, as was Kevin Spacey's character - Frank Underwood - in House of Cards. The producers of All the Money in the World, led by its director Ridley Scott, instigated one hell of a chess movie when, with only weeks before the film's scheduled release, they decided to remove Spacey from the picture and replace him with Christopher Plummer.

The producers of Storm Boy have three main options to choose from. The first: they remove Geoffrey Rush completely and reshoot his scenes (which serve primarily as a framing device) with another actor. The second: they delay it even further, knowing there will almost certainly never be a ""good"" time for it to be released. And the third: go ahead as planned, hoping that the film will weather the, er, storm.

None of those options are good, but for everybody other than Geoffrey Rush, option one is the best. An actor such as Jack Thompson - or even somebody younger, like Russell Crowe - could fit this role perfectly and would free the film from negative publicity. This option would also be the best way of ensuring the hard work of hundreds of people who contributed to the film would not be diminished as a result of the fallout from allegations made against one of the actors involved.

Reshoots however would be expensive, running into six digits. While it is true that Storm Boy wouldn't have the coffers of a studio-backed Hollywood production, the film could find extra financing, perhaps even spinning its taxpayer-subsidised status to its advantage. Might Screen Australia be prepared to chip in for a 'Storm Boy relief fund"" on the grounds that spending a little more could result in a significantly better performance at the box office?

If this did indeed turn out to be the case (we are of course discussing hypothetical situations), it might be money well spent. Storm Boy has the potential to make very big bucks. It is not unreasonable to compare its commercial potential to other recent live-action Australian films involving animals, such as Red Dog (which grossed over $21.4m locally) and Oddball (which grossed over $11m locally). Splashing around extra cash for a de-Rushed version might protect the investment.

On the other hand, a reshot version of the film starring Jack Thompson or Russell Crowe might still flop, and an unchanged version starring Geoffrey Rush might still be a hit. These are difficult decisions and the crystal ball appears clear for nobody.

Mr Percival will remain a beloved character. How his new film will be received might be a far sadder story."
261,the guardian,http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/dec/21/trump-syria-withdrawal-us-troops,"Donald Trump unexpectedly announced that the US would be pulling its troops out of Syria on Wednesday, and the entire national security establishment exploded in anger that one of our many wars may be ending.

Members of Congress, like Republican senators Bob Corker and Lindsey Graham - who have never met a war they didn't like - are furious that Congress wasn't consulted in the decision. Members of the media have proclaimed that the ""winners"" here are Assad and Putin, despite the fact that the stated mission in Syria was never to fight them in the first place. And pundit after pundit derided that this decision is a win for terrorists, with no thought to whether we are creating just as many terrorists by being there at all.

Lost in the discussion was any semblance of questioning whether it's in America's interests to have thousands of troops fighting and dying in yet another Middle Eastern country. Does anyone know what the long term military strategy in Syria would be, or how we would ever exit?

Does anyone care that many legal experts - regardless of how evil Assad or Isis was and is - think sending troops into Syria was illegal, given that Congress never debated or approved sending troops there? Should we fight in Syria forever, just because Russia also thinks we should leave? What percentage of the American public even knew to begin with over 2,000 troops have been on the ground in Syria occupying a third of the country for years?

First under Obama, and then under Trump, the US military quietly built up its on the ground presence in Syria without any public debate and often under the veil of official secrecy. The American public often only found out that troops were stationed there because of leaks to the media or quiet announcements long after they arrived.

In fact, just six days ago the Washington Post reported that US troops would be stationed in Syria ""indefinitely"" and now occupy over one third of the country. The Post referred to it as our ""hidden war in Syria"". No one seemed to care about that at the time, but now that troops may be coming home, everyone is upset.

Maybe if Congress has not used the last decade to totally abdicate its constitutional responsibility to debate and approve of wars the US is involved in, and if they were actually up front to the American people about the extreme costs of fighting yet another war, they would have a leg to stand on. But their stance seems to now be: we only get upset when troops get to come home without our approval, not when they are deployed in yet another war zone.

If Congress wants to keep the forever war in the Middle East going for another generation, then there's an easy solution: vote on it! Congress can authorize a military engagement anytime they want. But you can bet they won't do it; they don't want to be on the hook for when it inevitably turns into a quagmire costing the US billions in blood and treasure, just like every single other war we have been involved in has been for the last decade and a half.

And then there's the pundit class: It's amazing that on the one hand, everyone considers Trump a know-nothing, unstable maniac (a totally reasonable opinion!), yet are perfectly okay with him leading the US military into yet another long term military engagement with countless incredibly complicated geopolitical factors at play.

Agreeing that US troops shouldn't be indefinitely occupying Syria is not defense of Trump. His foreign policy is, of course, just as much a disaster as his domestic policies. He has markedly increased the number of drone strikes in the region from the Obama administration with hardly any scrutiny - despite the fact that rules of engagement have been loosened and more civilians are at risk of a fiery death than ever before.

He has backed an appalling war in Yemen leading to the world's largest famine, and his administration is also itching for a larger war with Iran. And his military budget has exploded. (Speaking of, does anyone in Congress have an opinion on the fact that we seem to be engaged in a secret war in Somalia now, again without any public debate?)

But what if, on balance, Trump actually made the right decision here, regardless of how he came to it or how he announced it? It is mind boggling that we, as a nation, are unable to appreciate that thousands of Americans will now no longer be in harm's way, fighting a war that Congress never debated and that much of American public never even knew was happening.

Currently, we now have men and women who weren't even born when the 9/11 attacks occurred eligible for combat in the Middle East under the 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force, which was passed to fight al-Qaida in Afghanistan. They are stationed in too many countries to count, fighting enemies that didn't exist when the law was passed. In fact, one soldier who was just one year old when the 9/11 attacks occurred was just killed in Afghanistan earlier this month.

It should go without saying that Assad is a murderous dictator and Isis is completely depraved. That doesn't mean anyone against more war in Syria remotely supports these horrible people or doesn't care for the plight of the Syrian people.

The entire post-9/11 military strategy has been an abject failure. It has cost trillions of dollars, millions of lives, and there is no indication anyone is better off, whether it's the American public or innocent civilians in the Middle East. In the meantime, we've engendered hatred from multiple generations of Afghans, Iraqis, Yemenis and many others.

You can still despise Trump just as much as yesterday, but the fact that some of our troops are coming home - at least for now - is a good thing."
262,the guardian,http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jan/04/trump-transgender-military-ban-limits-court-ruling,"Court handed president first legal victory on the issue, overturning decision by federal judge who blocked the policy

A US court on Friday ruled in favor of a Trump administration policy barring certain transgender people from serving in the armed forces, handing the president his first legal victory on the issue after several defeats.

The US court of appeals for the District of Columbia circuit overturned a decision by a federal judge in Washington DC that blocked the policy, saying it probably violates the constitutional rights of transgender recruits and service members.

Donald Trump announced in March that he would endorse a plan by former defense secretary Jim Mattis to restrict the military service of transgender people diagnosed with a condition called gender dysphoria.

The appeals court victory is limited because other federal courts issued injunctions against the policy, which applied nationwide. The administration already has asked the US supreme court to weigh in on the issue.

The high court is due to consider whether to hear three separate government appeals at its private conference on 11 January.

The various injunctions allowed transgender troops to join the ranks as of 1 January 2018.

""Today's ruling is a devastating slap in the face to transgender service members who have proved their fitness to serve and their dedication to this country,"" said Shannon Minter, legal director of the National Center for Lesbian Rights, one of the groups challenging the policy.

The three-judge panel said in an unsigned opinion that district court judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly was wrong to conclude that the new restrictions were essentially the same as the original ban, which she had also blocked.

""It was clear error to say there was no significant change,"" the judges wrote in the ruling.

The new plan, for example, ""appears to permit some transgender individuals to serve in the military consistent with established military mental health, physical health and sex-based standards"", the court said.

The American Psychiatric Association defines gender dysphoria as a ""clinically significant distress"" due to a conflict between a person's gender identity and their sex assigned at birth. Not all transgender people suffer from gender dysphoria, according to the association, which opposes a military ban.

The gender dysphoria restriction replaced an outright ban on transgender service members, which Trump announced in July 2017 on Twitter.

Trump's move reversed Democratic former president Barack Obama's policy of allowing transgender troops to serve openly and receive medical care to transition."
263,the guardian,http://www.theguardian.com/film/2018/dec/18/the-favourite-olivia-colman-rachel-weisz-emma-stone,"The three stars talk rivalry, royalty, referendums and the depiction of women running the country in their new period drama. Will the script's filthy language affect their Oscar chances?

Rachel Weisz and Emma Stone play love rivals in The Favourite, a period romance set in the court of Queen Anne. That's underselling it: this ain't your usual corset soap. The script is swearier, the stakes higher. Whoever wins the heart of the bedraggled monarch (Olivia Colman) earns not just a place in her four-poster, but safety, unlimited cake, a palace or two, plus free rein running the country at a time of peasant dissent and war with the French.

Off screen, Weisz and Stone are also rivals: both so brilliant in the film - the former as Lady Sarah, a sexy strategist in the Malcolm Tucker mould; the latter as Abigail, a bracingly aspirational maid with an immaculate accent - they're up for the same awards. But that, they nod as one, is the limit of it.

""I find it very strange,"" says Stone. ""The narrative attached to women that they are in competition. I've felt more competitive energy from men - at least in work experiences."" Why, she ponders: ""It's almost like sibling rivalry. Or perhaps there's something threatening about a woman asserting herself in that dynamic.""

She smiles at Weisz, who deadpans back: ""Yeah, lots of my best friends are women,"" and continues: ""The idea of the competitive, bitchy woman is a traditional trope from Hollywood stories. The bitch, the vamp ... the list goes on. It's creating a fiction. Everything permeates into cliche. It's a safe place.""

""And it's a cliche,"" chips in Stone, having a bit of an epiphany, ""because they're written by men. Mostly, women in films are fighting over a man ...""

""... which is, if you're a man, the way it should be, right?"" says Weisz. ""Sexy! Watch those bitches fight over me! It's a wish-fulfilment fantasy of being hot and desirable and wanted by women so much that they're ready to kill each other. You can understand it, from that point of view.""

They laugh, perched on a sofa with the friendly restraint of colleagues 18 years apart who haven't seen each other in ages but are keen to sing from the same hymn sheet. Stone is a self-confessed ""people pleaser"", happy to share thoughts on why frankness is key in relationships and, later, to discuss whether mortality is a luxury with nods to the Bible, the Torah and the Qur'an. Weisz - then six weeks on from giving birth - is game, but guarded. She swears she knows me, but she doesn't. Maybe it's just being back in London. Despite a decade in Manhattan, she seems deeply British. Although this is quite a swanky hotel, she swigs PG Tips from a flask.

Still, they're both eager to bridge any cultural divide. So when Weisz calls the current climate in the US ""like civil war"" and Stone politely demurs (""that was about slavery""), and Weisz says, sorry, she wasn't taught much American history, to which Stone says, well, she's right ""in terms of the emotionality"", and Weisz nods and says, ""and there's so much racism that comes with it"" and Stone says, ""of course"", they are united again in eagerness to agree.

The Favourite is Weisz's second collaboration with the Greek director Yorgos Lanthimos (after 2015's The Lobster, which also featured Colman). It is fantastic: a nutty slice of punk fruitcake with an enormous wallop of melancholy. It's also - with three female leads running the country as the men ponce about in big wigs - a prime example of what movies might look like post #MeToo.

Except it isn't. ""It's been in production for many years,"" says Weisz, dry as gin, ""so unless Yorgos is a soothsayer ..."" Adds Stone: ""It has nothing to do with the very important and very necessary movement talking about people who have abused people and done it because of their position of power.""

Invoking #MeToo in publicity risks diminishing its import, thinks Weisz: ""When you say something a lot, you forget what it means. Actually, those two little words are very moving. Women standing up, being strong in numbers and saying, this happened to me, too."" Adds Stone: ""It's tragic that so many people can use that phrase.""

Still, they will allow that the film is topical for its portrait of an erratic head of state, singularly ill-equipped for the job: ""The queen is an incredibly capricious leader,"" says Weisz, ""who is whimsical and changes her mind with the wind, and there are world leaders I can think of at the moment who might also be such a thing. Or are doing something just for their own ego.""

Like whom? She goes for the homegrown example: ""David Cameron promising a vote for Brexit. He wanted to get the votes from the eurosceptics so he would get voted in again [in 2015]. Turns out he didn't need it - he won by a landslide. I'm not sure he did that for the good of England or because he wanted to be elected. It was just for him, right? People just do things for the good of themselves. Don't you think?"" She and Stone look back at me, bonded in quizzicality.

A couple of months later, I'm granted an audience with her majesty: Olivia Colman, fresh from the set of The Crown season three, in which she plays the current monarch. Maybe channelling that queen's reticence, or perhaps because of a genuine bashfulness, she declares early on she doesn't think about anything much and is a terrible spokesperson for the film, for feminism, for everything except, possibly, tea: ""It's like a cuddle,"" she says. ""It's history.""

But actually, steer Colman towards something like Brexit and she comes out fighting just like Weisz: ""I've always tried to not show what I am [politically], because it's just a fucking can of worms. But when that vote came through it felt like a sense of mourning - for the people who didn't want to go, anyway.""

She can't raise the issue with older people who voted to leave, she says, gentle as ever, ""because I'm not sure I could do it in a rational way. I feel very, very angry."" At whom? ""Everybody, really. People that voted [for Brexit], people that withheld information, fake news - saying there was all this money that could be thrown back into our coffers. That's just nonsense. And it was good, believable nonsense. You can see why people voted for it, but I didn't know you were allowed to lie. I don't understand about that.""

She noticed something similar when filming in Ohio earlier this year: ""I was really surprised at the poverty in the most powerful nation. The guy in charge is never going to help the people who voted for him. It was all really puzzling. I'm not very eloquent about politics but I know what I feel about him. America sort of seems like a sadder place. I don't mean to offend any Americans, but it felt nationalistic rather than patriotic.""

Playing all these queens, though - she was also a young Queen Mum in 2012's Hyde Park on Hudson - has made her reassess her republicanism: ""I don't think I was ever a royalist,"" she says, before adding her traditional apology (""... it feels awful to say"").

""But I do think [Elizabeth II] is a remarkable human being. So I feel differently about it all now. I'm a weirdly left socialist monarchist. She's like a rock, and I sort of look to her. Her mouth is sewn together, but there's the odd little gesture. Those brooches she wore [to meet Trump] that were given to her by Obama; her European hat to open parliament.""

Colman watched this year's royal wedding from her sofa, crying for joy: ""They really love each other! They're lovely people. I felt this is all going to go in a really good direction."" She wells up just thinking about it.

What makes Colman inspired casting for both Anne and Elizabeth is that emotional accessibility is key to her appeal. She's one of us - spurning the hotel's Badoit to fetch herself a glass of tap from the bathroom. I make a worried noise. ""This isn't Calcutta,"" she scoffs kindly. Ask if she thinks the film's swearing (half a dozen cunts, multiple fucks, Weisz telling Nicholas Hoult he smells like ""a 96-year-old French whore's vajuju"") might jeopardise its awards chances in the US and she cackles back: ""Who gives a fuck?""

""Though [cunt] really is a big no-no. It's sort of equal to the n-word in America. Here the n-word is way up there and cunt is sort of all right. But the people who vote are all in the industry and less puritanical and shocked by stuff.""

Anyway, she says, ""the awards chat makes me want to be sick in my mouth. I've done some jobs before but this is a different beast. It's sort of a machine you have to do."" She feels for her publicist, what with her client forever declining gladhandings. ""I like being at home with my husband.""

That's the other thing about The Favourite. While Weisz and Stone already have Academy Awards, the film is fast-tracking Colman to the A-list. She is the frontrunner for next year's best actress Oscar, edging ahead of Glenn Close and Lady Gaga after a string of wins. And she's dressing, if not talking, accordingly. As Anne, Colman is fat and dilapidated, hobbled by gout and grief. Today, she is red carpet ready in a slim black trouser-suit with ribbony bits.

Yet the politics of campaigning sit ill with a woman who makes a rule of watching the British Bafta contenders first, then turning her attention to the rest. And who, this year, as she won't have time to see all the nominees, is writing to the voting panel to ask permission to abstain.

Blimey. Most people just vote anyway.

""But that feels so naughty. I think maybe I'm just really square."" In 2011, she starred as an abused wife in Paddy Considine's brilliant Tyrannosaur, which Bafta ignored in its best film nominations: ""Very few people watched it and it broke my heart a bit."" With The Favourite ""I feel that if people like it they should vote for it and it should be very honest. That should be all it is.""

She glugs her glass and smiles, vaguely pained. Colman is, just for clarity, every bit as lovely as you'd expect: ""If I'm really honest, I've always dreamed of holding an Oscar. But I'm really trying to sort of keep everything in check, keep calm. This is silly. What are the chances? I don't want to get excited. I don't want to face that disappointment. I just want to be on an even keel. I'm a mum, a wife, I'm a mate. I'm other things. You can see how people get sort of swept into it and I want to stay sane.

""I really value being able to do what I want and that's changing. That has been slowly changing for years and I've had my problems with it. I find it very upsetting when I think about it too much. But if I had a big red button to stop it I wouldn't press it, because I love my job so much. I'm getting better and better roles, roles I dream of. But more people are seeing them.""

Colman's approachability - plus the fact her national treasure status came from small screen work (Peep Show, Rev, Broadchurch, The Night Manager, Fleabag) - mean people might assume a familiarity that's actually one-sided. Add an Oscar to the mix and things could get sticky.

""Me and husband [Ed Sinclair] have been together 25 years,"" she says, slightly suddenly - though she does frequently mention in interviews how nice and handsome he is. ""So if anyone's going to get a fucking grip, it's him."" In The Favourite, Sarah shows her fidelity to Anne by warning her she looks like a badger before she leaves wearing new makeup. Would Ed do the same? ""No, he's lovely. He'd say: 'You look gorgeous' even if I've clearly got salad in my teeth. But he understands I'd rather have people at our house than go out.""

No, she says, she never had a bad experience with strangers, though ""it's just weird"" when people take photos without asking when her children are there: ""And it's odd that they know me and I don't know them. It's unbalanced. So I just move like a shark. Don't stop. Sort of safer. Walk quickly.""

Playing royalty, then, has upped her empathy with them. The courtier system in Hollywood is, she nods, ""unnerving"". Ditto the protectors and the retinue, the shrinking pool of people to trust, the barrier built between you and the audience.

""I like humans,"" she says unnecessarily, if not completely unregally. ""I believe in the goodness of people. So it is quite sad because it was one of the joys in life, talking to people.""

* The Favourite is released on 1 January."
264,the guardian,http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/dec/29/donald-trump-two-years-halfway-america,"It's nearly half-time and we're still here. On 20 January it will be two years since the businessman and reality TV celebrity Donald Trump took the oath as president, spoke of ""American carnage"" and boasted about his crowd size, leaving millions to wonder if the US, and the world, could survive him.

It will also be two years until the next inauguration in Washington. Has the 45th president kept his campaign promises and made America great again? Or has he proven an existential threat to the republic, stoking internal divisions, destroying its reputation abroad and assailing norms and values, the rule of law and reality itself?

For sure, Trump is testing his infamous January 2016 claim - ""I could stand in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shoot somebody, and I wouldn't lose any voters"" - to destruction.

True, there has been no new war, no major terrorist attack, no economic crash - at least not yet - such is the soft bigotry of low expectations. There is also a school of thought that this presidency was necessary, that the rise of a narcissistic authoritarian has brought about a moment of reckoning, forcing white Americans to confront a racism many had dismissed as ambient noise and forcing everyone to confront a broken politics.

""There's no question that the institutions of our democracy are being tested every day in terms of the fundamental checks and balances built into our constitution,"" said Leon Panetta, a former defence secretary and CIA director. ""There are some days when you wonder whether the system is going to work well, but I think generally we've been able to survive. But presidencies ought to be about a hell of a lot more than just survival.""

Bill Galston, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution thinktank in Washington and former policy adviser to President Bill Clinton, agrees: ""America is surviving; it isn't thriving. Our institutions have undergone a stress test. They have bent; they haven't broken.""

Most observers agree that Trump has remained true to himself and his candidacy, the anti-Barack Obama. Last month he awarded himself an A+, asking on Fox News: ""Is that enough? Can I go higher than that?""

Trump presides over a strong economy with unemployment at its lowest rate for half a century, though Democrats argue that he is building on Obama's foundations and warn of a spiralling national debt. He passed sweeping tax reform in what critics say was a giveaway to the super-rich at the expense of working families. He slashed regulations with little heed for the environment (he denies the science of climate change).

He appointed Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh to the supreme court, and many more conservative judges to the lower courts, delighting his base but infuriating millions of women and men after allegations of sexual assault against Kavanaugh were brushed aside. He has failed to build the wall he promised on the Mexican border but enforced an anti-immigration policy that separated children from their parents.

Overseas, Trump has praised authoritarians while alienating old allies and rattling the post-second world war liberal order. His relationship with the Russian president, Vladimir Putin, remains a mystery, exemplified by a summit in Helsinki that led to cries of treason, but special counsel Robert Mueller has caught several criminals in Trump's orbit and has cast a long shadow over the White House. Trump's trade war with China could hurt the people who elected him the most.

Larry Jacobs, director of the Center for the Study of Politics and Governance at the University of Minnesota, says: ""Trump is squandering one of America's greatest strengths, which is its allies. Stand back and say, is America more powerful than when he got elected in 2016? The answer has to be no. There has been only slippage.""

Along the way, the Republican party has done little to stop him, with most critical voices in the Senate - John McCain, Bob Corker, Jeff Flake - stilled by death or retirement. Even so, Jacobs retains faith in the country's resilience. He said: ""I'm not one of those people who think American democracy is ending. This is not a late-night horror movie. This is a country that had hundreds of years of democracy with a civil war, the McCarthy hearings and a lot more. The country has been through the wringer and democracy has held.

""When I look at the performance of institutions, I'd say it's largely operational. The media has been described as the enemy of the people but the press looks more vibrant and aggressive in its reporting than at any time since Watergate. Trump is an aberration in his conduct but the operation of the American electoral system, judiciary and media continue.""

Trump also provokes questions of character, ethics and temperament. His White House has been a vortex of chaos with a record turnover of staff. He surrounded himself with ageing white men and members of his own family, inviting accusations of corruption. He drew moral equivalence between white nationalists and anti-fascist protesters after deadly violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, and appears to reserve particular venom for women and people of colour. He has attacked the media as ""the enemy of the people"" while chalking up thousands of false statements. His Twitter account brims with insults, lies, vulgarity and bad spelling.

Sidney Blumenthal, a biographer of Abraham Lincoln, says: ""Trump is certainly the person with the worst character ever to be president. At two years and counting, the damage may equal the damage done by the worst presidents which brought on the civil war, and the damage done by Andrew Johnson who encouraged the Ku Klux Klan and white nationalist attacks on Reconstruction that brought about legalised segregation.""

Blumenthal, a former senior adviser to Clinton, warns that even if Trump - who lost the popular vote in 2016 and saw House Republicans routed in 2018 - is defeated in 2020, his legacy will endure. ""The idea that there can be a simple restoration and the country can pick up where we left off the minute before Trump took the oath is a dangerous illusion. We're going to have to deal with the damage. It is too profound that it is an unprecedented assault on our constitution.""

And yet there is a striking paradox. Over the past two years, Trump has also caused a democratic renaissance. The first Women's March on Washington the day after his inauguration was probably the biggest single-day demonstration in recorded US history, with an estimated 725,000 people. In November 2018, 49% of the voter-eligible population showed up at the polls, the highest midterm turnout seen since 1914. Activists, authors, journalists and satirists have thrived in an age when politics suddenly matters again. The complacent myth of a post-racial country, which some espoused after Obama's election, has been exploded, forcing some long-overdue conversations.

Asked if he considers Trump a white supremacist, Rashad Robinson, president of the advocacy group Color of Change, replies instantly: ""Absolutely."" But he adds: ""If Trump was the only one, he couldn't survive. There is potential for us to be more honest and more clear and see what people do when things are hard. When you're getting your tax breaks and your judges, are you willing to go along with racism?""

The president has shaken up norms once taken for granted, he adds. ""Trump and the right have sort of called the bluff on those things where we thought the system was supposed to work: you can't steal a supreme court seat, you can't say racist things to a black female reporter, you can't lie every day and get away with it. The bluff has been called and we can't rely on the old structures and rules of cordiality.""

But the ""resistance"" to Trump has produced a surge of civic activism. Robinson says: ""As much as the levers of power are being used, racial justice is winning as never before. People are working across silos as they haven't in the past. There's a new level of engagement.""

One example is Jjana Valentiner, an actor and makeup artist from Salt Lake City, Utah, now living in Washington, who stood outside the White House with candles on the night of Trump's election. ""I was in shock,"" she recalls. ""I was just numb. I heard a lot of people say it felt like a death.""

Valentiner's response is to regularly hand-deliver boxes of cupcakes to members of Congress, the media and others she wants to thank for ""saving democracy"", helped by a GoFundMe page that has raised more than $2,000 to date. She reflects: ""We had stages of grief and, now that we're two years in, I can look at it and go, right, it was necessary because I think it's exposing a lot of what was under the surface already that needed to be exposed, especially for white folks.

""I actually think we're going to get through this and I think we're going to be stronger and better because of it.""

Neil Sroka, communications director of the progressive group Democracy for America, also finds consolation in the country's response. ""A giant Trump-shaped cloud sits over everything, but the silver lining is that the rise of this administration has led to a progressive awakening that had been thought of as possible but not guaranteed,"" he says. ""What many folks have realised is how fragile institutions are and in a lot of ways Trump himself hasn't rotted the trust, but the wrecking ball Trump has been to our democratic norms has exposed the rot that lay beneath the surface.""

Race has been at the core of the Trump presidency, just as it is at the core of America. Sroka adds: ""In January 2017, we had millions of white liberals running around saying this isn't our country and what the last two years have shown is that, yes, this is our country and the only way we're going to fix it is to fundamentally change our politics.""

Trump is as American as Obama. His presidency has laid bare America's soul and shaken its oldest institutions, including the church. Michael Curry, presiding bishop and primate of the Episcopal church, says: ""I think in most folks there's a sense that something's out of kilter. We don't know exactly what, and that's not a liberal or conservative thing, but there's something in the way we're even engaging each other.""

Curry, 65, who shot to fame at the wedding of Prince Harry and Meghan, says he is now having more conversations with members of Congress and people in government about spiritual values. Despite it all, does he remain optimistic? He pauses and leans back, then replies: ""I believe in hope. I believe in God. This isn't the first time the human race has been in trouble and I expect it won't be the last.

""We're in the midst of some tough times right now but like the old slaves used to say, tough times don't last always. As long as there's a God."""

New Knowledge, one of the firms hired by the Senate intelligence committee, says that social media companies could have provided more valuable data to the committee and also could have presented it in a more accessible format, CNN reported. The companies provided the ""bare minimum,"" according to the report.

The Saudi government released a statement last night condemning two resolutions passed by the Senate, which would end US involvement in the Saudi war in Yemen and officially blame crown prince Mohammed bin Salman for the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.

The kingdom said the Senate's position is ""based upon unsubstantiated claims and allegations"" and represents ""blatant interferences in the Kingdom's internal affairs.""

""The Kingdom categorically rejects any interference in its internal affairs, any and all accusations, in any manner, that disrespect its leadership ... and any attempts to undermine its sovereignty or diminish its stature,"" the Saudis said.

House Democrats are planning to vote on several gun control bill when they take control of the body next month, Politico reports.

They plan to move legislation to require a background check on all gun sales, among other bills.

The legislation is unlikely to actually become law because it cannot pass the Republican-controlled Senate.

Earlier this month, prominent Democratic senators were joined on Capitol Hill by anti-gun violence activists and shooting survivors to push for stronger gun laws.

Donald Trump expressed hope Monday morning that the supreme court would uphold a federal judge's decision finding Obamacare to be unconstitutional.

The supreme court has previously ruled to uphold the landmark healthcare law, but the Texas judge ruled that after a GOP tax overhaul eliminated the tax penalty for Americans who don't have health insurance under the individual mandate, the grounds for finding it constitutional have disappeared.

""The DEDUCTIBLE which comes with ObamaCare is so high that it is practically not even useable! Hurts families badly. We have a chance, working with the Democrats, to deliver great HealthCare!"" Trump said in a tweet. ""A confirming Supreme Court Decision will lead to GREAT HealthCare results for Americans!""

Former President Barack Obama ripped the ruling in a Facebook post over the weekend, calling it ""a reminder that Republicans will never stop trying to undo"" the law's protections.

Donald Trump this morning says it's impossible to have ""Boarder Security"" without building his proposed wall along the US-Mexico border.

He has threatened to shut down the government if Democrats do not agree to provide money for the wall as part of government spending bills.

""Anytime you hear a Democrat saying that you can have good Boarder Security without a Wall, write them off as just another politician following the party line,"" Trump said in a tweet. ""Time for us to save billions of dollars a year and have, at the same time, far greater safety and control!""

Incoming House speaker Nancy Pelosi is looking to stop talk of impeaching Donald Trump among her fellow Democrats, Politico reports.

Pelosi and her allies are looking to protect special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation, and allow him to finish his work before considering impeachment proceedings.

""We must wait to see the entire picture and then engage the American people about how we go forward as a nation,"" Pelosi told Politico. ""We must protect the integrity of the Mueller investigation, so that the American people can get the full truth.""

A Russian disinformation campaign used every social media platform to spread messages to help Donald Trump in the 2016 election and after he took office, according to a new report prepared for the Senate Intelligence Committee.

The report is scheduled for release Monday and has been obtained by the Washington Post and New York Times.

""What is clear is that all of the messaging clearly sought to benefit the Republican Party -- and specifically Donald Trump,"" says the report, prepared by Oxford University's Computational Propaganda Project and Graphika. ""Trump is mentioned most in campaigns targeting conservatives and right-wing voters, where the messaging encouraged these groups to support his campaign. The main groups that could challenge Trump were then provided messaging that sought to confuse, distract and ultimately discourage members from voting.""

The interference effort was run by a Russian company called the Internet Research Agency, which has been hit with criminal charges. Their activity peaked at key moments like presidential debates and party conventions.

The Russians especially targeted black voters with their fake Facebook and Instagram accounts, according to the two papers' accounts of the report. They had dozens of accounts targeting the black community, and ran Facebook ads targeted at users who had shown interest in black history, Malcolm X, and the Black Panther Party.

The Russians created accounts like @blackstagram on Instagram, which had more than 300,000 followers, and fake websites like blackmattersus.com, blacktivist.info, blacktolive.org and blacksoul.us, as well as YouTube channels focused on police brutality and the Black Lives Matter movement.

According to the Senate report, the Internet Research Agency created 81 Facebook pages. Of those, 25 targeted the political right and gained 1.4 million voters, and 30 targeted African American audiences and gained 1.2 million followers.

Rightwing pages supported Trump, while left wing pages promoted Bernie Sanders or the Green Party candidate Jill Stein over the Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton.

More than 99% of all engagement came from 20 Facebook pages controlled by the agency, including ""Being Patriotic,"" ""Heart of Texas,"" ""Blacktivist"" and ""Army of Jesus."""
266,the guardian,http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/dec/29/donald-trump-impeachment-congress-house-senate,"The shutdown, attacks on the judiciary, the politicization of the military. All confirm it: Congress must impeach. Now

After his first bizarre year, Donald Trump's apologists told us he was growing into the job and that in his second year he would be more restrained and respectful of democratic institutions.

Wrong. He's been worse.

Exhibit one: the ""wall"". After torpedoing Mitch McConnell's temporary spending deal to avert a shutdown, he's holding hostage more than 800,000 government employees (""mostly Democrats"", he calls them, disparagingly) while subjecting the rest of America to untoward dangers.

On-site inspections at power plants have been halted. Hazardous waste cleanup efforts at Superfund sites are on hold. Reviews of toxic substances and pesticides have been stopped. Justice department cases are in limbo.

Meanwhile, now working without pay are thousands of air traffic controllers and aviation and railroad safety inspectors, nearly 54,000 Customs and Border Protection agents, 42,000 coast guard employees, 53,000 TSA agents, 17,000 correctional officers, 14,000 FBI agents, 4,000 Drug Enforcement Administration agents, and some 5,000 firefighters with the US Forest Service.

Having run the Department of Labor during the 1995 and 1996 shutdowns, I'm confident most of these public servants will continue to report for duty because they care about the missions they're upholding. But going without pay will strain their family budgets to the point that some will not be able to.

Shame on him for jeopardizing America this way in order to fund his wall - which is nothing but a trumped-up solution to a trumped-up problem designed only to fuel his base.

In his second year, he's also done even more damage to the nation's judicial-criminal system than he did before.

At least twice in the past month he has reportedly raged against his acting attorney general for allowing federal prosecutors to reference him in the crimes his former bagman Michael Cohen pleaded guilty to committing.

This is potentially the most direct obstruction of justice yet. He's now pressuring an official whom he hand-picked and whose entire future depends on him, to take actions that would impair the independence of federal prosecutors.

Last month he blasted Jon Tigar as an ""Obama judge"", after Tigar blocked the administration's limits on asylum eligibility to ports of entry, a decision summarily upheld by the ninth circuit court of appeals and sustained by the supreme court.

Chief Justice Roberts issued a rare rebuke. ""We do not have Obama judges or Trump judges,"" he wrote, adding that an ""independent judiciary is something we should all be thankful for"".

Which prompted this rejoinder: ""Sorry Chief Justice John Roberts, but you do indeed have 'Obama judges,'"" followed by a baseless and incendiary claim that ""they have a much different point of view than the people who are charged with the safety of our country"" and their ""rulings are making our country unsafe! Very dangerous and unwise!""

In his second year, he has displayed even less commitment to keeping the military non-partisan than he did initially. During a teleconference with US troops and coast guard members last month he continued his rampage against the judiciary, calling the ninth circuit ""a big thorn in our side"" and ""a disgrace"".

Then he turned last week's surprise visit to American troops in Iraq and Germany into a political rally: praising troops wearing red ""Make America Great Again"" caps, signing a ""Trump 2020"" patch, and accusing Nancy Pelosi and other leading Democrats of being weak on border security.

Some Americans are becoming so accustomed to these antics that they no longer see them for what they are - escalating attacks on core democratic institutions.

Where would we be if a president could simply shut down the government when he doesn't get his way? If he could stop federal prosecutions he doesn't like and order those he wants? If he could whip up public anger against court decisions he disapproves of? If he could mobilize the military to support him, against Congress and the judiciary?

We would no longer live in a democracy. Like his increasing attacks on critics in the press, these are all aspects of his growing authoritarianism. We normalize them at our peril.

America's democratic institutions remain strong, but I'm not sure they can endure two more years of this. Trump must be removed from office through impeachment, or his own decision to resign in the face of impeachment, as did Richard Nixon.

Republican members of Congress must join with Democrats to get this task done as quickly as possible. Nothing is more urgent. It must be, in effect, America's new year's resolution.

267,the guardian,http://www.theguardian.com/technology/2018/dec/22/facebook-sheryl-sandbrook-faces-axe,"After months of revelations about the firm, the executive is being talked of as a sacrifice, not founder Mark Zuckerberg

Facebook's already terrible year is ending on a new low, as Mark Zuckerberg and his beleaguered executive team battle another share price slide, this time triggered by new revelations about the company's relaxed attitude to the privacy of its 2.2 billion customers' data.

Shares dropped more than 7% on Tuesday after it was revealed that the company had bent its own data rules for clients including Netflix, Spotify, Amazon, Microsoft and Sony.

The latest damaging report, published by the New York Times on the back of a District of Columbia lawsuit accusing the social media giant of exposing residents to political manipulation by ""failing to protect"" user data during the 2016 US presidential election, will surely be disagreeable to Zuckerberg, Facebook's 34-year-old founder, chief executive and controlling stockholder.

But it is Sheryl Sandberg, former chief of staff at the US treasury under Larry Summers and the woman brought in a decade ago to be the ""adult"" in Facebook's executive ranks, who is largely taking the heat for the company's mounting operational, financial, political and public relations challenges.

Clearly, Sandberg has much to account for as chief operating officer. Facebook's travails, which have seen it shares drop nearly 40% since their July peak, are not Sandberg's alone to carry, though on some days it appears the 49-year-old has been doing much of the heavy lifting.

""There's little doubt the company is facing critical challenges and has made some egregious mistakes,"" says Kathryn Kolbert of the Athena Centre for Leadership Studies. ""The fact that Sandberg was brought in to be the adult in the room does not absolve Zuckerberg of responsibility.

""Mark Zuckerberg is the CEO of a multibillion-dollar company, and he's been at it a while. He's a grown-up. He ought to be responsible. But from what I see, there isn't the sense that both should be accountable.""

Five weeks ago, Sandberg's key role in shaping the company's response to multiple crises was exposed, again by the New York Times. These have included the revelations of Russian interference in the 2016 election, the Cambridge Analytica scandal, and the decision to hire a rightwing opposition research company, Definers Public Affairs, to apply aggressive political campaign tactics to Facebook's PR and to look into the finances of high-profile investor George Soros days after he publicly criticised the big US technology companies.

Facebook claimed that the research into Soros ""was already under way when Sheryl sent an email asking if Mr Soros had shorted Facebook's stock"".

However, the backlash against Sandberg, until recently a figurehead for tech-branded progressive feminism, has barely relented.

The bestselling author, who just a year ago was riding high on the success of Option B, a follow-up to her empowerment manual Lean In, is taking hits from all sides.

Sandberg, as the executive who helped develop Google's ad-supported business strategy before joining Facebook, was in the firing line in September when the company became the focus of an American Civil Liberties Union complaint alleging that its advertising system allows employers to target job ads based on gender.

Three weeks ago, before a sold-out audience at the Barclays Centre indoor arena in Brooklyn, former first lady Michelle Obama said Sandberg's belief that women can always ""have it all"" if they assert themselves across their personal and professional lives - a key tenet of Sandberg's Lean In philosophy- is ""a lie"".

""It's not always enough to lean in because that shit doesn't work all the time,"" Obama reportedly said.

Then last week the civil rights group NAACP launched a week-long boycott of Facebook after a report it had commissioned highlighted concerns over voter suppression, ad targeting and the company's own issue with workplace diversity.

""We know that we need to do more: to listen, look deeper and take action to respect fundamental rights,"" Sandberg said in a conciliatory statement.

According to Nathalie Molina Niño, author of Leapfrog: The New Revolution for Women Entrepreneurs, part of the hostility aimed at Sandberg is certainly related to her gender. ""The higher a woman gets in terms of success, the greater the culture that enjoys taking her down,"" Niño says. Indeed, negative posts on Sandberg's own Facebook page are largely written by men.

At the same time, Niño points out, Lean In missed the mark because it failed to reflect the experience of most women who are balancing work and family.

As a result, Sandberg has become synonymous with a particular brand of female empowerment that is considered out of touch with notions of inclusiveness.

""It's applicable only to women in the corporate world and that's a fairly small, marginal group,"" Niño says. What Lean In showed, in fact, ""is in contrast to what is true for most women, and the backlash against Sandberg is a reflection of that reality"".

But Sandberg is not standing back. It is a measure of her resilience, as well as solid support from Zuckerberg and Facebook's board, that she has stayed put.

In an interview with the news network CNN, Zuckerberg said: ""Sheryl is a really important part of this company and is leading a lot of the efforts to address a lot of the biggest issues that we have. She's been an important partner for me for 10 years ... I hope that we work together for decades more to come.""

While Sandberg is taking the heat for Facebook's problems, Zuckerberg appears to be relatively unscathed. ""The company is facing incredible challenges and has made egregious mistakes, so Zuckerberg should bear primary responsibility,"" says Charles Elson, expert in corporate governance at the University of Delaware.

Forcing Sandberg out, he says, would solve the perception that the company is taking action, but achieve nothing in terms of resolving the seemingly insurmountable issue of policing the user content of a global social network.

""The public wants somebody to take the fall, and since Zuckerberg is the owner he's not going to do it. So they've come to the view that Sandberg is the next best thing.""

But that risks a potential new PR backlash by pushing Sandberg out without solving any of the company's data privacy and political manipulation issues.

If Sandberg departs, her brand too tarnished to be of further use to Facebook, the decision will be Zuckerberg's to make. ""As the majority voting shareholder, he calls the shots,"" Elson points out.

Richard Overton, believed to have been the oldest man in the US, has died in Texas at the age of 112.

Olverton, who was also thought to have been the oldest US veteran of second world war, had been admitted to hospital with pneumonia but was released on Christmas Eve. He died on Thursday evening, according to a family member.

Overton was in his 30s when he volunteered for the US army and was at Pearl Harbour just after the Japanese attack in 1941. He once said that one of the secrets to his long life was smoking cigars and drinking whiskey, which he often was found doing on the porch of his Austin home.

His recent birthdays drew national attention, and strangers would stop at his house to meet him. Even well into his 100s, he would drive widows in his neighbourhood to church.

""With his quick wit and kind spirit he touched the lives of so many, and I am deeply honoured to have known him,"" the governor of Texas, Greg Abbott, said in a statement. He called Overton ""an American icon and Texas legend"".

""Richard Overton made us proud to be Texans and proud to be Americans,"" Abbott said. ""We can never repay Richard Overton for his service to our nation and for his lasting impact on the lone star state.""

Overton was born near Austin in 1906 and served in the all-black 1887th Engineer Aviation Battalion.

Barack Obama honoured him at a Veterans Day ceremony at Arlington national cemetery in 2013.

""He was there at Pearl Harbour, when the battleships were still smouldering,"" Obama said. ""He was there at Okinawa. He was there at Iwo Jima, where he said, 'I only got out of there by the grace of God.'"""

Denise Gough was born in Ireland in 1980. She has worked in TV, film and theatre, and in 2012 was nominated as outstanding newcomer at the Evening Standard theatre awards for her performances in Our New Girl and Desire Under the Elms. She has won two Olivier awards: for best actress for People, Places and Things (2015) and best supporting actress in 2018 for her portrayal of Harper in Angels in America. She stars alongside Keira Knightley in Colette, in cinemas now.

1. Film

The Favourite

So, so good. It's a film where the three main characters are women - Olivia Colman as Queen Anne, her lady-in-waiting Rachel Weisz, and social climber Emma Stone - and the men are the ones worried about their makeup and hair. Colman is just gloriously vile through the whole thing, and it made me think about the conversation we're having with #MeToo. The film really stuck in my head because it's about the nature of power and what it does to a human being, male or female - women are capable of being just as gross when given power.

2. Documentary

The American Meme

It's on Netflix and it's a terrifying look into the birth of reality TV and Instagram stars. It begins with Paris Hilton, who started that whole thing of becoming famous just being herself. There's this misogynistic guy who's an internet sensation, and underneath all that he just seems really unhappy. It made me think of how corrosive fame can be, particularly if it comes only as a result of something vacuous. I'm not on social media because the whole thing terrifies me. It makes me sad that we live in a world now where that's what we idealise.

3. Book

Normal People by Sally Rooney

This is the story of a relationship over the course of many years, and it's incredible. Sally Rooney is 27, and writes about an Ireland I didn't grow up in but wish I had: much more free-thinking, not as repressed. It makes me hopeful for the future of the country, especially for young women. Her books are so completely believable, but it's more the way she looks at relationships that is interesting to me. I'm just not used to reading that from Irish writers. Voices like hers doing so well makes me feel like we're moving in the right direction.

4. Gig

Florence + the Machine in New York

This was one of the best things I've ever seen. I was completely floored by her. Florence Welch is like a warrior: she kept throwing herself around, running off the stage and into the audience. It was like a spiritual experience, seeing her own her power like that. I love her new album [High As Hope]: it's much more intimate, much more stripped back. It's like you're being invited into her room with her and she's telling you secrets. She is a true artist.

5. Podcast

Oprah's SuperSoul Conversations

It's brilliant. In it, Oprah interviews all sorts of people, like Malala Yousafzai, and her latest one is with Michelle Obama. But her best, I think, is with Maya Angelou, who is the kindest and most well-mannered and just beautiful human being. Angelou tells an incredible story about her and Tupac Shakur. They're all just inspiring conversations about loving yourself and being kind to yourself. I can't get enough of that sort of stuff, especially at the moment. As far as I'm concerned, Oprah is queen of the world.

The Inheritance at the Noël Coward theatre, London

It's a play-within-a-play inspired by Howards End, about a gay couple who we meet towards the end of their relationship. I really wanted to experience what people say they did when they saw Angels in America: this seven-hour epic. So I went and it was one of the most beautiful days at the theatre I've ever had: heartwarming and beautiful, and the performances were gorgeous.

270,the guardian,http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/dec/22/us-anti-isis-envoy-brett-mcgurk-quits-trump-syria-withdrawal,"The US envoy to forces fighting to defeat Islamic State has resigned over Donald Trump's decision to withdraw American troops from Syria.

Brett McGurk's resignation follows that of Trump's defense secretary, James Mattis, who announced his departure this week. The special presidential envoy for the global coalition to defeat Isis since 2015 was one of few Obama appointees to stay on under Trump.

CBS News first reported McGurk's move. Citing anonymous sources, it said he had planned to leave his post in February but had brought it forward due to a ""strong disagreement"" with the president's decision. He will now quit at the end of this month. The Associated Press said McGurk's resignation letter to the secretary of state, Mike Pompeo, had been described to its reporters.

Mattis resigned on Thursday, issuing a letter of resignation that was implicitly strongly critical of Trump, and reportedly angered the president. It was reported on Friday that the defense secretary quit after Trump made the decision to withdraw from Syria during a conversation with the Turkish president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan.

CBS said McGurk was in the region for talks with US Kurdish allies when Trump announced his decision. The Kurds fear attack by Turkey if around 2,000 US troops stationed in Syria are withdrawn.

On 11 December, McGurk told reporters at the state department he thought it was ""fair to say Americans will remain on the ground after the physical defeat of the caliphate, until we have the pieces in place to ensure that that defeat is enduring"".

He said then it would be ""reckless"" to consider Isis to have been defeated, a claim repeatedly made by Trump.

On Saturday, Trump defended his decision on Twitter, writing that US troops had meant to be in Syria ""for three months, and that was seven years ago - we never left"".

He continued: ""When I became president, Isis was going wild. Now Isis is largely defeated and other local countries, including Turkey, should be able to easily take care of whatever remains. We're coming home!"""
271,the guardian,http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/dec/22/2020-election-republican-democrat-demographics-party-loyalties,"How did race, wealth, education and class contribute to the great realignment that brought us Donald Trump?

Over the past 25 years, the Republicans have mutated into a white workers' party, one which yearns to return to the glory of yesteryear, real and imagined. The party of Abraham Lincoln is no more. By the same measure, the Democrats have become an upstairs-downstairs coalition of NPR listeners and urban Americans. Just decades ago, the party was the home of FDR, JFK and lunch-bucket voters. The election of Donald Trump is both a result and accelerant of our ongoing political realignment.

Much ink has been spilled on how the US reached this inflection point, and two books published this year deserve attention: Bill Schneider's Standoff, subtitled How America Became Ungovernable, and Alan Abramowitz's The Great Alignment, subtitled Race, Party Transformation and the Rise of Donald Trump.

Standoff exudes confidence in the capacity of the electorate to self-correct, and presents a user-friendly prism for watching politics. The Great Alignment looks to the courts and the states to put a brake on the president, while over-emphasizing the role of race in Trump's ascendance. It is implicitly pessimistic.

Schneider commented on politics for nearly two decades at CNN and is now a contributor at Al Jazeera. He contends, convincingly, that voters are buffeted by the competing forces of values and interests. In his telling, values roughly correlate with educational attainment and interests correspond to income, a shorthand borne out by recent elections.

According to a recent Brookings Institution report, America's Electoral Future Demographic Shifts and the Future of the Trump Coalition, the 2016 election ""showed a sharp divide in Republican voting between white college graduates and whites without college educations"". In the November midterms, we saw more of the same.

College graduates voted Democratic by a three-to-two margin, with white four-year degree holders going Democratic by eight points, a historic development. The last time a Republican presidential candidate lost these voters was 60 years ago. Indeed, on the income side of the ledger, the Democrats fought to a draw.

America's wealthiest districts are now overwhelmingly blue. A Fox and Associated Press exit poll showed voters with incomes north of $100,000 preferring the Democrats by 5%. The GOP is surrendering its claim as the party of upward arc. Grievance comes with a price.

Schneider also distinguishes between coalitions and movements. He explains that coalitions are generally organized around a particular outcome, and as long as a voter agrees with that single goal, such as opposition to Trump, she is welcome to enter the tent. Movements, on the other hand, are like religions. They expect believers to embrace a series of propositions as if they were creeds, with a special place in hell reserved for heretics and the theologically syncretic. Just ask Jeff Flake of Arizona and Bob Corker of Tennessee.

Still, one would be hard-pressed to find a pro-life Democrat on a national ticket or in a Democratic cabinet. Likewise, pro-lifers were unwelcome at the 2017 Women's March.

In both Schneider's and Abramowitz's narratives, Democrats were once an amalgam of white southerners, black people, Catholics, Jews and working-class urban ethnics. For the GOP, think northern rural Protestants, suburbanites and the wealthy. Among the latter grouping, chances are their ancestors fought to preserve the union during the civil war. In the aftermath of the 1960s, those alignments and allegiances gave ground in the face of the civil rights movement, Lyndon B Johnson's Great Society and the Vietnam war.

Yet as the latest elections remind us, ""class"" matters too. The moms of Southern Methodist University and Scarsdale have much in common. Metaphysically, the distance between suburban New York and high-end suburban Dallas is short. Both sets of mothers generally hold at least a BA, if not a graduate degree, and spend a significant amount of time hauling their precious cargo to and from tutors and after-school sports. Life does not begin and end with Friday night lights.

As a corollary, these households possess little patience for the cultural red meat that the incumbent president serves to his white working-class base. Trump's scatological shout-out to Adam Schiff, the incoming chair of the House intelligence committee, was a turn-off to these voters.

Where Schneider is mindful of the roles of race and immigration in how our politics stack up, Abramowitz, a professor at Emory, gives them primacy of place without sufficient nuance and context. Rather, with an array of data, he argues that racial resentments undergirded Trump's electoral college victory.

Abramowitz glides over the Great Recession and its aftermath. But on election day 2016, 700,000 fewer white Americans were employed than when the downturn kicked in. He also avoids a detailed discussion of the outsized role Obama-Trump voters played in places like rural Pennsylvania. His synoptic narrative misses too much.

During the presidential election in 2008, FiveThirtyEight reported that when one canvasser approached a home in western Pennsylvania, God and guns country, the husband yelled to his wife: ""We're votin' for the African American!"" Except he didn't say African American. Such voters stood with Hillary Clinton against Barack Obama but resisted John McCain and Sarah Palin.

Said differently, The Great Alignment treats demographics as destiny without paying needed attention to external events. Clinton centered her efforts during the 2016 primaries on upscale and minority voters and wrote off a chunk of the electorate as irredeemably deplorable. Fast-forward to the 2018 midterms: the Democrats actually captured a majority (52%) of non-evangelical whites who did not possess a BA.

In other words, backlash should not be characterized as reflexive racial resentment. Few people enjoy being kicked in the teeth, even figuratively.

For 2020, back-of-the-envelope calculations based on the midterms show the Democrats prevailing with under 300 electoral votes. The same map, however, depicts Ohio and Florida as potential Republican firewalls, and one needs to go back to Jimmy Carter and 1980 to find a president ejected from office after his party held power for a single term. Absent a recession or national catastrophe, voters are reluctant to engage in buyers' remorse after just four years.

Adding to the Democrats' challenge is that liberal policies are more popular than the Democrats themselves. The party has its own cultural baggage.

This past election day, voters in Republican Idaho, Nebraska and Utah opted to expand Medicaid coverage. The last time any of those states went Democratic in a presidential election was 1964. Meanwhile, Missouri (red), Utah (red) and Michigan (purple) approved marijuana liberalization and Florida, the ground zero of electoral battlegrounds, said ""yes"" to restoring voting rights to ex-felons.

How the Democrats proceed remains to be seen. Calling for the abolition of Immigration and Customs Enforcement (Ice) as some hopefuls have done is a surefire way to reassemble the Trump coalition. By the same measure, presidents who seek re-election usually endeavor to expand upon their base, something Trump is incapable of doing. Right now, he could win re-election without a plurality of the popular vote - another first - an outcome that would pose questions of personal and systemic legitimacy."
272,the guardian,http://www.theguardian.com/culture/2018/dec/28/barack-obama-list-best-of-2018-books-films-and-music,"The former US president is still releasing his best-of lists, and 2018's includes everyone from Lauren Groff to Nancy Wilson, via the Carters and The Death of Stalin

Barack Obama has continued his tradition of publishing end-of-year lists, compiling the books, songs and films that the former US president has most enjoyed over the passed 12 months, with Zadie Smith, Beyoncé and Jay Z's Apeshit and Armando Iannucci's political satire The Death of Stalin all included.

""As 2018 draws to a close, I'm continuing a favourite tradition of mine and sharing my year-end lists,"" Obama wrote on Facebook, adding that the list included work that he found ""thought-provoking, inspiring, or just plain loved"". The lists - which started in 2015, while he was still in office - are meant to highlight work from famous and lesser-known writers, directors and musicians.

In 2018, Obama read biographies including David W Blight's study of Frederick Douglass, the anti-slavery advocate and intellectual (Frederick Douglass: Prophet of Freedom) and tennis star Arthur Ashe: A Life by Raymond Arsenault. Max Tegmark's cautionary examination of what human life might look like in a future with superintelligent AI, Life 3.0: Being Human in the Age of Artificial Intelligence, was also included, as was fiction in the form of Florida by Lauren Groff.

Obama started the tradition in 2015 when he released a playlist of the songs he'd been listening to, including artists such as the Isley Brothers, and Coldplay. He added book recommendations later that year, including Ta-Nehisi Coates' celebrated book about race and America, Between the World and Me. In 2016, he recommended Pulitzer prize-winner Colson Whitehead's The Underground Railroad, as well as Paula Hawkins' The Girl on the Train and H Is for Hawk by Helen Macdonald.

This year's film list was no less tasteful, with Palme d'Or winner Hirokazu Kore-eda's Shoplifters, sitting alongside Barry Jenkins' James Baldwin adaptation, If Beale Street Could Talk and Alfonso Cuarón's Oscar-tipped Roma. Alex Garland's shapeshifting sci-fi Annihilation was also included, as was Ryan Coogler's Marvel superhero epic Black Panther.

Music was dominated by pop, rap and R&B. The backpacker hip-hop of J Cole, sat alongside rappers from Obama's adopted hometown of Chicago in the form of Chance the Rapper and BJ the Chicago Kid. Irish singer Hozier found a space on the list as did indie darlings Courtney Barnett and Kurt Vile. There was also a special mention of Nancy Wilson (one ""the great jazz singers of all time"", according to Obama) who died in December. There was no place for Aretha Franklin, however.

Here are the lists in full.

273,the guardian,http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/jan/11/hamilton-musical-puerto-rico-joyful-homecoming-but-complicated,"Javier Ortiz likes to look on the bright side in San Juan, the pretty and gritty capital of Puerto Rico. ""I'm an optimist,"" he says. ""I'm the owner of a bookstore, so I have to be.""

Ortiz has survived not only the onslaught of Amazon but also Hurricane Maria, which forced him to close for 10 days then manage the store without electricity - running a cash machine off a battery - for two months. Now, as the debt-ridden island finally gets an event to celebrate, the 50-year-old has one of the golden tickets.

The mega-hit musical Hamilton opens in San Juan on Friday night. Ortiz's wife, Huarali, queued for 10 hours to get $150 tickets for them and their Hamilton-mad sons: Alejandro, 12, and nine-year-old Nicolas. ""It is expensive: we're having to make a sacrifice,"" says Ortiz. ""We will keep working hard and make a better island and better country. Hamilton's a good sign but the hard work we will have to do ourselves.""

With a score mixing hip-hop, jazz, blues, rap, R&B and Broadway, the show dramatises the life of Alexander Hamilton, a Caribbean immigrant who becomes an American founding father and the first treasury secretary, only to be wounded by scandal and die in a duel. It has swept awards shows and conquered cities across the US as well as London, but its arrival in the American commonwealth of Puerto Rico was always going to be special because of its composer, lyricist and star.

Lin-Manuel Miranda is the son of Puerto Rican immigrants to New York and spent his childhood summers here. For the two-week San Juan run, which is raising money for arts communities on the island, the 38-year-old dynamo will reprise the title role for the first time since he ended on Broadway in July 2016. It will doubtless be a joyful and poignant homecoming, a moment to savour Miranda's global success and a symbol of the island's slow return to normality after the September 2017 hurricane that killed nearly 3,000 people and caused what is thought to be the biggest power blackout in American history.

And yet, this being Puerto Rico, it is also complicated, multi-layered and politically charged. There has been controversy over a last-minute change of performance venue. Some here are reluctant to regard Miranda, born and raised in New York, as one of their own. They are also unhappy about his association with Barack Obama and a debt restructuring plan that imposed harsh austerity measures on the territory of 3.3 million people.

About 20 miles west of San Juan, traces of Miranda are inescapable in Vega Alta, an unglamorous town of 39,000 people where his extended family still lives. Its theatre was torn down in the 1970s to make way for a car park, but a new, small plaza built by his father includes a bakery, bar, cafe, souvenir shop - hats, mugs, T-shirts, postcards, lifesize cardboard cutouts of Miranda - and even a small museum showing off artwork, awards, cast recordings, family photos and theatre programmes. On the walls there are colourful tile mosaics that include Miranda's face, the Hamilton logo and the Puerto Rican flag. Salsa music plays as tourists snap photos.

A short walk away, on a cul-de-sac of single-storey homes where the quiet is punctuated by squawks from tropical birds, is the grandparents' home where the young Miranda and his sister would while away summers. He would often run over to see neighbour Margo Rodriguez and enjoy her homemade limbers - a local treat like a popsicle frozen in a plastic cup. ""He spent a lot of time with me here, singing, drawing and making jokes,"" said Rodriguez, now an 85-year-old grandmother. ""I would pretend to play guitar with a broomstick and he would sing. He was a good kid. He was priceless.""

She is not alone in her pride. Elliot Knight Nater, a music director, said: ""This town loves him. When they know he's coming here, you can see 200 to 300 people waiting: people who used to see him as a kid running in the streets."" But he added: ""I hope he never gets into politics because people change as soon as they get in that position.""

And yet Miranda's family is steeped in politics. His great-uncle, Gilberto Concepción de Gracia, was the founder of the Puerto Rican Independence Party. His father, Luis Miranda, is a Democratic party consultant who left the island at 18 to chase the American dream and, despite speaking little English, found New York ""fit like a glove"", he told the Guardian. He settled in a Latino neighbourhood in Washington Heights (the inspiration for Miranda's breakthrough musical In the Heights, which he brought to Puerto Rico in 2010). Luis was a special adviser to New York mayor Ed Koch in the 1980s and helped manage Hilary Clinton, Chuck Schumer and Kirsten Gillibrand's successful campaigns for the US Senate.

His son has taken on the baton. Accepting a Tony award in 2008 for In the Heights, he waved a small Puerto Rican flag. Hamilton, which celebrates diversity by casting people of colour as America's founding fathers, was hailed by the New Yorker magazine as ""the Obama-era musical"". Its cast delivered a pointed statement to the vice-president, Mike Pence, after one performance, while Miranda has tweeted that Donald Trump will go to hell for criticising the mayor of San Juan after the hurricane. He has also gone to Washington to plead with Congress to help Puerto Rico with its economic crisis and appeared on comedian John Oliver's HBO show to rap: ""Paul Ryan, I'll come sing Hamilton at your house/ I'll dosido with Pelosi, I'll wear my Hamilton blouse/ Your citizens are suffering, stop the bleeding, stop the loss/ Help Puerto Rico, it's just a hundred miles across.""

Amid the Spanish colonial buildings, cobbled streets and ornate balconies of old San Juan, where tourists disgorged by giant cruise ships wander among cats and pigeons, many feel gratitude before Friday's big opening. Javier Santiago, 59, the director of the National Foundation for Popular Culture, has a small shrine to Miranda, including the red shirt he wore for the Broadway run of In the Heights, and invites young visitors to try on Miranda's cap. Some burst into tears. ""That's something they will never forget,"" he said.

""We feel very proud of the work he did in In the Heights. He showed the soul of our community: the getting together, the importance of family. This is a side that West Side Story never showed. Hamilton coming here is symbolic of the Puerto Rican soul that will never die. He's in the diaspora that left Puerto Rico to go to the United States; his parents brought him back every year and he never lost contact with his roots. The idiosyncrasy, the Latin way of being is in him, pumping in his heart.""

But in Puerto Rico, neither a nation nor a state, where people can vote in US primaries but not in the presidential election itself, nothing is simple or straightforward. Hamilton was due to be performed at the University of Puerto Rico, where its producers spent $1m upgrading the theatre. Then, late last month, the show was abruptly switched to the Luis A Ferré Performing Arts Center because of concerns about disruptive student protests over budget cuts enforced by Washington. The Hamilton set was taken down, shuttled across town and hastily rebuilt.

Luis, 64, a former student at the university, was disappointed by the move but endorsed it. ""There's many things that you could compromise but security is not one of them,"" he explained. ""If there is a minimum possibility that anything can happen, that should be enough for the production to move.""

But Nelson Rivera, a retired art history professor at the university, accuses the producers of losing their nerve. ""I think the government threw shade at the students: 'Oh, they're a bunch of terrorists, get out of there.' They fell for it. They should have won over the community, the university, and nothing would have happened. We're very nice people.""

Rivera, 65, is sharply critical of Obama's solution to Puerto Rico's $70bn public debt load, a law known as Promesa that established a non-elected financial oversight and management board - supported at the time by Miranda but disparaged by many as ""la junta"". He said: ""We don't really have a government of our own; we're governed by this junta and they're basically dismantling the country. One of the first things that they started to do was eliminate public education. A lot of public schools have been closed and the university has been really hit hard.

""So Hamilton has been used to strengthen the idea that the university is a difficult place that has to be eliminated or at least toned down. That's exactly what they did when they moved the play instead of keeping it at the university. What is interesting about Hamilton is the way it's been used for politics.""

Rivera, a supporter of Puerto Rican independence, continued: ""They call it the Obama-era musical. Give me a break. If Hamilton is anti-Trump, we're also anti-Obama. For Puerto Ricans, there's no difference at all between Obama and Trump. So I understand that Obama looks nicer and speaks better but his policies were as terrible to Puerto Rico as Trump's are. Obama gave us the junta and Trump sent us paper towels. What is the difference?""

Ten thousand tickets are being sold for $10 each via lottery to residents of Puerto Rico but Rivera has no intention of trying to see it. ""There's a lot of mixed feelings for us. For artists, we have a strong theatre tradition here in Puerto Rico and American musicals are not really our thing. The subtitle of Hamilton is 'An American musical' and that's as American as you can get. So for us, this is not a play that's meaningful in terms of our culture. It really has nothing to do with us.

""Lin-Manuel was raised in the United States. He identifies as an American and when he chooses to do a play it's about the American experience, not about the Puerto Rican experience. We work with Puerto Rican history and issues and things that Lin-Manuel cannot really know about because he does not live here, he was not raised here nor educated here, so I don't see how you can talk about something that you don't really know.""

Miranda's father is aware of the identity politics and does not shy away from them. ""The forever debate is who is Puerto Rican,"" Luis said in an interview in the theatre foyer, hours before the first dress rehearsal. ""You hear the debate among normal people: 'But he's not Puerto Rican, he's from New York, he's from Puerto Rican parents.' But what we do know is that there is enormous pride in him, particularly since he's so proud of being Puerto Rican. He has said many times that he is using the megaphone and the spotlight that he has gotten thanks to Hamilton to push forward things like the recovery of Puerto Rico.""

Luis also appears to embrace the complexities of his son's forays into politics, having fought many such battles himself. ""I hate Trump and anything I could do to defeat Republicans, even now my friends who are Republicans, I would do because they have allowed the party to be hijacked by this orange nut. When you do that, you know people are going to be with you and people are going to be against you. It's no different in Puerto Rico, but the important part that I hope I taught my kids is that you make decisions and you take stands and some will applaud you and some will criticise you, but you take the stand you believe is right."""
274,the guardian,http://www.theguardian.com/politics/2018/dec/25/special-relationship-how-a-century-of-us-presidential-visits-tells-the-temperature,"What warmth of British welcomes, from masses feting Wilson on the Mall to seething protests for Trump, indicates

Tens of thousands crammed central London's streets. The roar of cheers was as deafening as the flypast. ""We want Wilson,"" chanted the crowd, packed tightly beneath a ""brilliant mass of flags"" stretching from Charing Cross to Buckingham Palace, the Guardian reported at the time.

In 100 years of US presidential visits, since Woodrow Wilson became the first Oval Office incumbent to visit the UK , the so-called ""special relationship"" has waxed and waned. And the warmth of Britain's welcome has served as a telling gauge.

Wilson - carriage-borne in postwar jubilation along a Mall lined by 20,000 soldiers, their ""bayonets bright in the December sunshine"" - arrived on Boxing Day 1918 for his two-day visit and would be feted in London, Manchester and Carlisle.

One century on, and Donald Trump would also attract tens of thousand to the streets; a seething crowd united in protest beneath a huge orange baby blimp.

Tucked away - official dinner at Blenheim Palace, tea with the Queen at Windsor Castle, and a round at his Turnberry golf course in south Ayrshire - his three-day itinerary in July 2018 was designed to shield him from the protests. Not since the visit of George W Bush had an American president been so unwelcome by the British public.

""Now, compared [with] Trump, 'Dubya' seems like Lincoln. It's remarkable how perspectives change over these people,"" said Dr Martin Farr, senior lecturer in modern and contemporary British history at Newcastle University.

Twelve serving presidents have visited the UK since Wilson's 1918 visit. He arrived at the end of the first world war, ahead of the Paris peace conference, but it would take the second world war to entice another president across the Atlantic. Harry S Truman popped onboard King George VI's yacht, HMS Renown, for a hurried lunch off Portsmouth on his way back from the Potsdam conference.

The former supreme commander of the allied expeditionary forces, Dwight - later President - Eisenhower, came in August 1959 and was the first serving president to be received by the Queen. The warmth of their relationship was reflected in a handwritten note she sent afterwards. ""Seeing a picture of you in today's newspaper standing in front of a barbecue grilling quail reminded me that I had never sent you the recipe for the drop scones which I promised you at Balmoral. I now hasten to do so,"" she wrote.

For John F Kennedy's arrival in 1961, half a million people reportedly lined the route between the airport and the West End in London. He and his first lady, Jackie Kennedy, were political showbiz. Colour footage captured the couple's youth, glamour and charisma. He visited again in 1963, calling on Harold Macmillan. ""This was a time of the cold war, heightened tensions between east and west, the missile crisis, Bay of Pigs ... and the leader of the free world looks up to our prime minister,"" said Farr of Britain's response.

Sometimes it was the lack of a visit that spoke loudest. Lyndon Johnson never came, furious at Harold Wilson's refusal to send him so much as a marching band in support over Vietnam. Perhaps the warmest welcome was extended to Jimmy Carter, who endeared himself in 1977 despite rashly kissing the Queen Mother smack on the lips. ""I took a sharp step backwards, but not quite far enough,"" she later commented.

Carter, a Dylan Thomas fan, had hoped to be able to visit south Wales during his trip. Labour's Jim Callaghan, his party facing a byelection in the north-east, had other ideas and whipped his guest up to Tyneside.

""Carter was told in the car by the local MP, 'If you say Howay the lads everyone will love it,"" said Farr. On the podium outside Newcastle's Civic Centre, Carter leaned into the microphone. ""Howay the lads,"" he bellowed as crowd erupted. ""I'm grateful to be a Geordie now,"" added the peanut farmer from Georgia.

""They packed the airport. They packed the streets. They packed the area outside the Civic Centre and they opened their arms to him,"" reported the local newspaper, the Chronicle.

""Even though it's 40 years ago, it is still striking,"" said Farr. ""Our narrative now is that these were two failed leaders."" But the visit was the warmest, and perhaps happiest.

Ronald Reagan and his wife Nancy were greeted by 115,000 anti-nuclear war protesters gathered in Hyde Park. The welcome for George W Bush in 2003, in the immediate aftermath of the overthrow of the Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein, was even chillier.

With the then prime minister Tony Blair vowing to ""stand firm"" with America over Iraq, thousands of anti-war protesters assembled in cities across the UK, waving placards and wearing T-shirts with the slogans ""Stop the War"" and ""It's about the oil, George"". A well-aimed egg was lobbed at the presidential motorcade, and a Bush effigy ""toppled"" in Trafalgar Square, as 67 were arrested.

""One curiosity is that it's always Democrat presidents that are popular,"" said Farr, currently editing a book on presidents and premiers. ""There's a curious mapping of popular sentiment which is clearly supportive of more liberal presidents.""

With Barack Obama, ""everyone wanted to be part of it. He was a phenomenon, really,"" added Farr. It was difficult to get any MP to criticise his state visit, during which he addressed both Houses of Parliament.

""You have genuine charm. Obama thought the Queen and Duke of Edinburgh are wonderful, and told the world he adored them. That went down very well with the British press. So, a bit of gumption goes a long way.""

What appears to have united all of these visits was convention, Farr believes. Even when there were Anglo-American disagreements, there was at least diplomatic language and due process, he said.

That is, until Trump, who insulted Theresa May in a Sun interview, saying her Brexit policy would ""probably kill"" a US-UK trade deal, and then praised Boris Johnson as likely to ""make a great prime minister""."
275,the guardian,http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/dec/20/dick-cheney-vice-president-darth-vader,"Mary Poppins Returns will face some unlikely competition for the Golden Globe award for best musical or comedy film in January. Vice, nominated in the same category, is a darkly comical biopic of former US vice-president Dick Cheney. An alternative title might have been Darth Vader Returns.

A decade after leaving office, Cheney is widely seen as not only the most powerful VP in American history but also the most despised. He was the power behind George W Bush's throne when America tortured suspects, opened a prison at Guantánamo Bay and waged war on Iraq.

But Vice comes at a moment that, with Donald Trump in the White House, Bush has benefited by comparison and undergone a public rehabilitation. Six in 10 Americans say they now have a favourable view of the 43rd president, according to a CNN poll earlier this year, compared with three in 10 when he left the White House. Whether the nostalgic glow will extend to 77-year-old Cheney, however, remains less certain.

""The thing about W is he's an incredibly likable person - it's just that he was a very destructive president,"" said Sidney Blumenthal, a former senior adviser to President Bill Clinton who intends to see Vice when it is released on Christmas Day. ""Now he's out of the presidency, he's just likable. Cheney remains a hooded, dark, saturnine figure and I'm sure the movie can't deal with all his darkness.""

Blumenthal, a biographer of Abraham Lincoln, added: ""Bush gets a bye because he was a manipulated figure and the burden of blame falls on Cheney. There's nothing tragic about Cheney. His story is sinister.""

Written and directed by Adam McKay, Vice stars Christian Bale, who reportedly gained 40lb for the role, and transformed himself with makeup, prosthetics and wigs to look the part. It also features Sam Rockwell as Bush, Steve Carrell as the former defence secretary Donald Rumsfeld and Amy Adams as Cheney's wife, Lynne.

A positive review in the Hollywood Reporter notes: ""The first we see of Dick Cheney is as a drunken 22-year-old wastrel in 1963 Wyoming, a kid who could arguably benefit from the discipline instilled by a stint in the armed forces (he never did serve).

""Cut to 9/11, when then-Vice President Cheney assumes total power over the government in the temporary absence of the president. McKay thus poses his central question: How the hell did this two-time Yale dropout make the jump from nonentity to string-pulling power behind the throne?""

It is thought to be the first major movie about a vice-president, often a thankless role in the principal's shadow. George HW Bush, who was Ronald Reagan's deputy for eight years, once joked there was ""nothing substantive to do at all"". But Cheney changed all that, taking a central role in the ""war on terror"" after the attacks on New York and Washington on 9/11.

In 2002, for example, after the White House leaked a story to the New York Times falsely claiming that Iraq had bought aluminium tubes intended for use in centrifuges to enrich uranium, Cheney appeared on NBC's Meet the Press to cite the report as evidence as that Saddam Hussein was pursuing nuclear weapons.

He repeatedly dismissed human rights groups that raised concerns over the use of torture by the CIA. In 2011, an unrepentant Cheney continued to defend what he called ""enhanced interrogation"" techniques including waterboarding, claiming that they produced ""phenomenal"" results.

Trump has claimed that ""torture works"" but has little else in common with the former vice-president. Critics regard Trump as a vulgarian who prefers tweeting to reading briefing documents. Yet, as he nears the midway point in his presidential term, it could be argued that Trump has not yet perpetrated any single act as consequential or destructive as the Iraq war, widely seen as the biggest foreign policy blunder since Vietnam.

Jeremy Varon, a history professor at the New School for Social Research in New York and leading member of Witness Against Torture, a group seeking to close the Guantánamo Bay detention centre, said: ""Nothing about Trump should now cast Cheney in a more favourable light. In truth they represent different versions - each nearly a caricature - of the American ruling class. Trump is a vain, imbecilic Master of the Universe who has sleazed his way to the top - first of the Manhattan real estate world, and now the American state.

""Cheney is a cunning, ass-kicking oil man, expert at quietly playing a rigged system for profit and imperial power. Trump is both more loathsome as a personality and easier to laugh at. But Cheney, to this point, has proven more dangerous. Ask the weeping mother of Afghanistan and Iraq and the men shattered by their torture at Abu Ghraib and Guantánamo.""

Varon added: ""To this day Cheney defends the moral rot with which he plagued America and the world. We owe him our sustained and vigilant condemnation.""

Cheney - whose daughter, Liz Cheney, recently became the highest-ranking woman in Republican leadership in Congress - is certainly a rewarding subject for biographies and biopics. He has been close to the heart of American power for four decades, first as White House chief of staff (the youngest ever) under Gerald Ford, then as defence secretary under George HW Bush, who led the US into the Gulf war in 1991 - a military adventure also not without its critics.

Dan Kovalik, a human rights and labour lawyer and adjunct professor at the University of Pittsburgh, said: ""Incredibly, even liberal Americans are now romanticising the two Bush presidents and their longtime partner in crime, Dick Cheney. The two invasions of Iraq destroyed a nation, killed untold numbers of innocents (certainly well over a million), and destabilised the entire Middle East.

""Remember when so many of us marched in record numbers to try to prevent this war? Meanwhile, the war against Afghanistan is now in its 18th year with no end in sight. As unhinged as Trump may be, he has yet to start a new war as these other leaders did.""

Time may uncover an important difference between Bush and Cheney. The former president has been seen hugging Michelle Obama and handing her sweets; at his father's funeral, he broke down and displayed his vulnerability to the world. Cheney, meanwhile, looked on from the pews, content to remain shadowy and elusive. The one man who may not care whether Vice burnishes his legacy his Cheney himself.

Jake Bernstein, co-author of the book Vice: Dick Cheney and the Hijacking of the American Presidency, said: ""There has been some rehabilitation with George W Bush; in comparison with Donald Trump, everyone starts to look better. But Dick Cheney liked the fact everyone called him Darth Vader. I don't think there'll be an effort on his part to soften his image."""
276,the guardian,http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/dec/31/elizabeth-warren-president-democratic-nomination-contenders,"Elizabeth Warren had long been expected to announce a run for the Democratic nomination for president, from the progressive wing of the party. On Monday morning, the Massachusetts senator duly made it official.

The field of confirmed contenders is not yet crowded: the Maryland congressman John Delaney is the best known of those who have already formally pitched in, and he isn't well known at all. But as the saying goes, no US senator ever looked in the mirror and did not see a president gazing back: a positively enormous group of politicians - senators, congressmen and women, governors, mayors - waits in the wings, seasoned with a few business billionaires, all seemingly fancying their chances of taking on Donald Trump and winning the White House back.

Here are 10 of the leading names in the spotlight ... and some of those bubbling under.

Kamala Harris

The junior senator from California is building campaign machinery and has been visiting states that hold their nominating contests early. A former district attorney and state attorney general who has gained national attention for, among other things, her tough questioning of Trump supreme court pick Brett Kavanaugh, Harris is popular among young Democrats in Washington, internships in her office keenly sought and fought for. In a contest in which diversity is sure to play a key role - the party won sweeping House victories in the midterms by standing explicitly against Trumpism and attracting women and minorities - Harris's African American and Indian ancestry could well be as much of a plus as her political fire and skill.

Cory Booker

The first African American senator from New Jersey and a former mayor of the city of Newark has also been building campaign operations and speaking in early voting states. In Iowa in October, the Guardian listened as he warned against ""sedentary agitation"" and received rave reviews from his crowd. In New Hampshire in December, the Guardian watched as Booker tested out a ""moral"" message, avoiding a focus on Trump and telling his audience in Manchester: ""This is not a time to meet hate with hate. It is not a time to meet darkness with darkness. The call of our country has always been love."" In a country bitterly divided by the indignities or otherwise of the Trump presidency, how effective such inspirational speechifying can be will be a fascinating thing to consider.

Kirsten Gillibrand

The junior New York senator, a formidable fundraiser with a strong record on progressive priorities, is openly preparing a run. It has been reported that she is having surprising difficulty in attracting donations because of her role in the resignation of Al Franken, the popular Minnesota senator who faced allegations of sexual misconduct and resigned while heavyweight Republicans facing similar accusations, not least the president himself, stayed in their seats of power. Gillibrand, who arrived in the Senate when Hillary Clinton joined the Obama administration, remains a strong voice at the centre of the Democratic party.

Bernie Sanders

It pays to remember that Sanders isn't actually a Democrat: an independent, self-proclaimed democratic socialist senator from Vermont, his run for the 2016 nomination against Clinton was a genuine surprise, an insurgency that gathered momentum, perhaps damaged the favourite and, at least in hindsight, seems to have offered clear signs of what the party was missing in the post-industrial states which flipped for Trump, handing him the presidency in the electoral college despite a beating in the popular vote. Sanders is now a progressive figurehead but also a Washington veteran used to how it all works. Some think that at 77, he's too much a veteran. But Trump is 72, which suggests that these days, age is just a number.

Joe Biden

Barack Obama's vice-president was a long-term Delaware senator before he went to the White House and is a Mount Rushmore-sized figure in the Democratic party. He has openly flirted with a run and gleefully engaged Trump in rather undignified arguments about who could beat up whom, perhaps showing in doing so the popular touch that has him leading early polls in important places like Iowa. On the downside, such leads may simply be down to name recognition, his status as the embodiment of the white, male party establishment may now not be the bonus of old, and by inauguration day in 2021, Biden will be 78. He has also run twice for president before, in 1988 and 2008. Neither ended well.

Sherrod Brown

An intriguing Senate outsider, the Ohioan won re-election in November as Republicans dominated his Trump-voting state, partially as a result of openly proclaiming his ""populist"" bent. No president has won the White House without Ohio since Kennedy, a fact regularly trotted out in lists such as these, but Brown's appeal to blue-collar voters should not be taken lightly and is part of regular talk-show discussions about whether or not he'll run. He has some of the rumpled, outsiderish charm of Sanders, a factor which may or may not have informed Clinton's consideration of him for her VP pick. He's also not particularly well known nationally, which may have counted against him then and may do again this time. Similar things could be said, bar the bit about being rumpled, about the Minnesota senator Amy Klobuchar, another who shone in grilling Kavanaugh and who has admitted she's thinking about a run.

Beto O'Rourke

The soon-to-be former congressman from El Paso is leaving Congress because he relinquished his House seat to challenge liberal bogeyman Ted Cruz for his seat in the Senate. O'Rourke lost, more narrowly than might be expected in such a deep-red state as Texas, yes, but all the same a defeat, something Trump has been quick to highlight as presidential talk swirls. A former punk rocker with a common touch and a half-Spanish, half-Irish name - which he has had to defend from allegations of seeking unearned authenticity - O'Rourke is also, by current Democratic standards and not surprisingly given his coming from Texas, something of a centrist prone to voting with Republicans. On the left of the party, that is attracting rising approbation.

Julian Castro

A former mayor of San Antonio and a Housing and Urban Development secretary under Obama, the Texan twin of congressman Joaquin Castro was another touted as a possible running mate for Clinton. Like O'Rourke, he is relatively young and could conceivably enter VP territory this time around. He has said he is exploring a run and will announce either way in January. If successful, he would be the first Hispanic nominee for president. A charismatic speaker, his moves will be worth watching, though he remains an outsider for now.

Michael Bloomberg

The billionaire former New York mayor is openly considering a run, which he could obviously fund formidably, has registered as a Democrat and has been visiting early voting states. Driven by the need for the US to assemble a coherent plan to tackle climate change, he has had little difficulty ranging himself against the coal-friendly, regulation-ripping president. On Sunday, Bloomberg told NBC he will make climate change a leading issue in the 2020 race, whether or not he runs. He might not be the only billionaire to do so: Tom Steyer is funding ads demanding Trump's impeachment while he decides whether to pitch in, while even the Dallas Mavericks-owning, rugby-loving Mark Cuban has said he's considering a go. The former Starbucks chief Howard Schultz also seems to fancy his chances. Oprah Winfrey, alas, has said she is out.

Eric Garcetti

Garcetti, son of Gil, the harassed district attorney in The People vs OJ Simpson, is the man in charge of Los Angeles, the biggest city in the most populous state that is now almost all-blue, a bastion of progressive policies - not least in the face of the frightening effects of climate change - and fierce opposition to Trump. A run from such a platform could be interesting. There are other mayors and ex-mayors out there: from New York could come Bill de Blasio, a Clinton ally whose view of himself as a national figure angers some in his city, while from New Orleans may come Mitch Landrieu, his centrist reputation burnished by his sure handling of controversy over the city's Confederate past and statues. From South Bend, Indiana, meanwhile, there is Pete Buttigieg: young, gay, progressive, determined, from the Rust Belt and quite likely not a strong candidate this time around at least.

And the rest...

As mentioned, the Maryland congressman John Delaney has declared his bid for the Democratic nomination. So, as it happens, has Andrew Yang, an entrepreneur from New York state, and Richard Ojeda, a military veteran who lost a bid for Congress in West Virginia.

Everyone else is either discussing the issue with their wife/family/loved ones/pets, exploring it actively or not, considering it or archly refusing to comment. Among senators there is also Jeff Merkley of Oregon, a progressive stalwart. Eric Holder, Obama's attorney general, hasn't ruled it out; nor has John Kerry, a former Massachusetts senator, the 2004 Democratic nominee against George W Bush and Obama's second secretary of state.

The Ohio congressman Tim Ryan has said he is interested, as has the Hawaii representative Tulsi Gabbard. The media has enjoyed talking up Stacey Abrams, beaten narrowly in a controversial Georgia gubernatorial election this year, and Andrew Gillum, narrow loser in a similarly nasty fight for the governorship in Florida. Among governors and former governors, Steve Bullock, of the otherwise resolutely red state of Montana, seems to be very interested; so does John Hickenlooper of Colorado, a cross-party pal of John Kasich, the Ohio Republican who looks set to primary Trump. Former Maryland governor and 2016 candidate Martin O'Malley told the Guardian he was thinking about another run; former Virginia governor Terry McAuliffe, a pillar of the party and former Clinton fundraiser, all but told CNN he was in on Sunday.

That, believe it or not, is not everyone. But one more name seems worth a mention. Some allies and aides have said Hillary Clinton might consider a third run for the White House. No, really."
277,the guardian,http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/dec/23/james-mattis-defense-secretary-donald-trump-1-january,"Defense secretary James Mattis will step down as of 1 January, Donald Trump said on Sunday, bringing forward his departure by nearly two months.

Trump tweeted: ""I am pleased to announce that our very talented Deputy Secretary of Defense, Patrick Shanahan, will assume the title of Acting Secretary of Defense starting 1 January 2019. Patrick has a long list of accomplishments while serving as Deputy, & previously Boeing. He will be great!""

Mattis announced his resignation on Thursday, in protest at the president's decision to withdraw US troops from Syria. He said he would leave on 28 February. On Saturday it became known that the US envoy to the coalition against Islamic State, Brett McGurk, had also resigned over the Syria decision.

The New York Times reported on Sunday that Trump was enraged by media coverage of Mattis's resignation which portrayed it as a rebuke to him, and had thus determined to push him out earlier than planned.

On Saturday night, Trump wrote of the internationally respected retired Marine Corps general: ""When President Obama ingloriously fired Jim Mattis, I gave him a second chance. Some thought I shouldn't, I thought I should. Interesting relationship - but I also gave all of the resources that he never really had.""

Answering the charge in Mattis's resignation letter that he did not treat American allies correctly - Kurdish forces in Syria now threatened with being left at the mercy of Turkey - Trump wrote: ""Allies are very important - but not when they take advantage of US.""

He also tweeted dismissively about the highly regarded McGurk, calling him a ""grandstander"".

More details to follow..."
278,the guardian,http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2019/jan/03/donald-trump-withdraw-us-troops-syria,"For all his antics on the Mexican border, the US president is right to be withdrawing troops from Syria

For a Briton to spend time in the US just now is a blessed relief. Whole days pass, and no talk of Brexit. It is as if a pall has lifted from the art of conversation. But the US has its own deep divide, slashing through the populist body politic. It is Donald Trump and ""America first"".

Trump has become a phenomenon. Like Samson in the temple, he seems able to topple the entire edifice of policy. Down crashes America's government machine for the sake of a wall, world trade is devastated, stock markets plummet, alliances lie in ruins. It is astonishing what one man can do to the world, virtually alone.

However, when an entire political establishment says a decision is mad, I tend to think something in it must be right. Thus with Trump's announcement last month that he was pulling America's 2,000 troops out of Syria. ""They're all coming back, and they're coming back now,"" he tweeted emphatically. That he could do this after an amiable chat with Turkey's president, Recep Tayyip Erdoğan, and without telling his commanders, was staggering.

Trump instantly lost his defence secretary, James Mattis, and his Islamic State expert, Brett McGurk, the former effectively accusing Trump of no longer ""protecting our way of life"". Abroad, the Kurds were devastated, the Afghans unnerved, and Iran and Isis reportedly delighted. Outrage came from Democrats and Republicans alike, with the leading Republican senator Lindsey Graham pleading to reverse a decision that ""threatens the safety and security of the US"". Trump has now granted a stay of 120 days and a slower withdrawal.

Trump's argument is that getting out of America's wars was a campaign pledge. The Syrian intervention was never meant to be permanent and had already crippled Isis. ""People are going to have to start doing a lot of their own work,"" he added, ""because the United States cannot continue to be policeman to the world."" To this, Britain's foreign secretary, Jeremy Hunt, meekly retorted that the US should stay in Syria ""to make sure the streets of Britain are safe"". How or why this should be, he did not explain. Years of American lives and treasure had done little beyond killing thousands of civilians and flattening some of the oldest cities on Earth.

The morass in which the US is wallowing in Mesopotamia, as in Afghanistan, has indeed become indefinite. Retreat is always heartbreaking to friends, and pleasing to foes. It makes tearful, negative copy. Barack Obama tried to get out and lost his nerve. Trump is discovering why: it was through the vehemence and cynicism of pro-intervention lobbies, trumpeting national security.

Now comes the paradox. Trump sits in a White House war room, preaching the same ""national security"" he derides in Syria to justify his $5bn Mexican wall. Migration involves appalling suffering, on which Britain has no right to be smug. Britain has Shakespeare's ""silver sea, which serves it in the office of a wall"", where a few patrol boats will apparently suffice. But the issue is the same - how to honour populist election pledges to keep out migrants.

Trump is entitled to put ""America first"" in the Middle East, and that slogan may explain his trade barriers against Canada and China. But like the Mexican wall, such policies have nothing to do with America's national security. The US must be the safest country on the planet. Its home territory has never been so much as menaced by a foreign power, let alone invaded. Two oceans protect it east and west. 9/11 aside, terrorist incidents have been homegrown. Wars abroad, from Vietnam to Syria, have reflected some neo‑imperial hegemonic urge, similar to that which used to grip Britain. The effect has been to turn the US from policeman to random vigilante.

The politics of fear has long been the default mode of the insecure statesman. The parading of military muscle still permeates the US's public realm and has become a shop window for what President Eisenhower termed the anti-democratic ""military-industrial complex"". Its endless aggrandisement boosts military spending and upholds the cause of an American presence across the globe. It worships daily at the altar of national security.

American aid to Nato has long underpinned Europe's security, but that does not undermine Trump's challenge, that the rest of the world should start solving its own problems. The US's current entrapment in the Middle East was precisely what it warned Britain against over Suez in 1956, that it should not cloak imperial adventure in the garment of domestic security. Remarks to this effect by Mattis, Graham and Britain's Hunt are ridiculous, and they know it.

The power of armies to dictate policy and command resources by exaggerating public fear is the downside of populism. As a lifelong admirer of the US, I have always marvelled at the good its power and wealth could do for the world. That is why its enslavement to Franklin Roosevelt's bogey of ""fear itself"" is so tragic. That the quest for ""stability"" in the Middle East should be presented as remotely to do with the safety of the American or British state is a nonsense. For all his antics on the Mexican border, in this respect Trump's voice is salutary.

279,the guardian,http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/dec/16/observer-obituaries-2018-john-mccain-remembered-by-sidney-mccain,"My earliest memory of my dad was when I was six years old. He'd just been released from captivity in Vietnam and my mom had rented a beach house for the three of us to stay in. I couldn't figure out exactly who he was, because I had no memory of him - I was only nine months old when he was taken prisoner.

Being the youngest in the family, with two older brothers, I was very spoiled, but when my dad came back he was very strict and that was shocking to me. But he was also very loving. We lived in Florida and he taught me how to bodysurf, which he'd do with both hands behind his back because of his injuries from Vietnam. We'd be woken up in what felt like the middle of the night to go crabbing. My greatest memories are with my dad in the ocean.

I definitely inherited from him a wanderlust, and we bonded over music, but politically we didn't see eye to eye. I'm very liberal, very much a Democrat, although I did support him 100% when he was campaigning. He respected that I had different opinions. I think he thought I'd grow out of it, but I got even more liberal. But it didn't matter: there were more exciting things to talk about, like baseball - we were both baseball fanatics.

He always wanted to be in politics, he always wanted to serve and he did a great job as a congressman and later as a senator. I was very proud of that. But I also kept it very quiet. I didn't announce that John McCain was my dad because I was building my own life and career.

When he ran for president the first time, I was working with the White Stripes as a music publicist. Saturday Night Live booked my dad to host a show for which I'd already secured the White Stripes as the music act. I was like: ""Dad, I'm going to bring Jack and Meg over to your green room because you definitely don't want to go to theirs, because everybody's smoking and drinking."" He was like: ""No, no, I'll come to theirs"" - and he fitted into that smoky green room just as well as he'd fit into a high society dinner.

He had an incredible amount of energy. On the campaign trail, he lived on terrible food - hotdogs and doughnuts - but he'd still be charging forward to the next event. I hiked the Grand Canyon with him and when we stopped for the night I'd want to sit down for just a minute and cool off - but no, we had to get the tents up straight away. His energy left me in awe.

As a politician, he was very independent-minded. He didn't care whether you were Democrat or Republican - he cared if you were a person of quality. Partisanship in American politics really concerned him. He used to meet with Obama once a week when Obama was in office. I'm sure they didn't always get along, that some heavy discussions were had, but it was always done with respect. Which is all too rare these days.

He didn't think he was going to die. He was forever hopeful. When he was diagnosed with cancer, he told me: ""I'm not dying. I'm just not dying."" I said: ""OK, Dad, you're not dying, we all believe that you're not going to die."" But he did. He didn't have a choice in the matter. But I'm positive he made peace with himself and with everyone around him.

He was an incredible politician and one of the finest men and I really hope that we see his like again. In confusing times, he tried to be a beacon of what is right and I think he will be remembered for that. I'll miss him. I think the world is a much sadder place without him."
280,the guardian,http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/dec/30/nancy-pelosi-trumps-easy-ride-ends-with-democrat-speaker-house,"In one deft performance the top Democrat in the House owned the president, having faced down Republicans scare tactics and attacks from her own side

Nancy Pelosi was perched on the end of a sofa in the Oval Office when the balance of power in Donald Trump's Washington decisively shifted in her favour.

The event in early December began as a simple photo call with Trump - the first attempt at bipartisan dialogue after the midterm elections saw Democrats take back control of the House of Representatives.

The president was in domineering form, making demands about funding for his stalled border wall and contemplating shutting down the government if a budget was not passed giving him $5bn for his unfulfilled promise.

""I think the American people recognise that we must keep government open, that a shutdown is not worth anything,"" said Pelosi as Trump nodded. ""And that we should not have a Trump shutdown.""

The president looked up and said: ""A what? Did you say a Trump - ?""

After two years surrounded by loyalists and sycophants, Trump had got his first taste of what life will be like with Pelosi in control of one half of Congress. And as the cameras rolled, he quickly lost his cool, declaring he would be ""proud to shut down the government"", trapped on live TV by his temper and the pincer movement of Pelosi and the top Democratic senator Chuck Schumer.

Pelosi walked out of the White House into brilliant sunshine in sunglasses and a fiery red coat looking triumphant and returned to Capitol Hill to make jokes about Trump's manhood and utter the memorable description: ""It goes to show you: you get into a tickle contest with a skunk, you get tinkle all over you.""

The confrontation showed that Pelosi can outwit Trump. It also marked a turning point for her after an election season when some Democrats disowned her, apparently seeing her as a liability in races where Republicans spent millions of dollars trying to turn her into a hate figure to galvanise their voters.

According to the Wall Street Journal, there were more than 135,000 adverts during the midterms attacking Pelosi by name, and some Democratic candidates ran for election vowing not to vote for her as speaker if they won.

Wendy Schiller, chair of political science at Brown University, called the attack ad strategy ""wasted money, pure and simple"". Republicans ""mistakenly believed that voter animosity towards strong women was interchangeable, so they tried to get the voters who disliked Hillary Clinton to see Nancy Pelosi the same way and then transfer that dislike to their local Democratic congressional candidate.

""That is just way too many connections for most voters to make, and it infuriated a lot of women. It is as if the GOP did not live in the same #MeToo moment as the rest of us.""

Pelosi raised $135m for the Democratic campaign, yet when she got back to Washington celebrating a heavy victory, some in her own party said it was time to move on from her leadership.

No challenger emerged, yet a ""Never Nancy"" letter gained rebellious signatures and put her hopes of getting back the gavel as speaker of the House under threat.

The moment where she owned Trump in the Oval Office put a stop to all of that as she proved she could put him under pressure - and with the 2020 election in mind, hope to deliver him in a weakened state for whoever emerges as the Democratic presidential nominee.

To secure support for her speaker bid she agreed to serve no more than four years, but it was not much of a concession, given she would be 82 and presumably ready - at last - to retire.

So, on Thursday the 78-year-old will become the face of Democratic opposition to Trump in Congress.

Almost 12 years to the day since she made history as the first female speaker, Pelosi will be back, calling the plays against Trump and passing bills on Democratic priorities from gun control to reform of voter suppression laws.

Of course, those bills will be unlikely to get through the Republican-held Senate, but the strategy will help Democrats define Trump and the Republicans.

Cindy Simon Rosenthal, author of Speaker Nancy Pelosi and the New American Politics, published in 2007 when the California congresswoman first took the House gavel, said: ""It may not result in legislation making it all the way through, but Democrats would go into the 2020 election cycle with strong campaign issues where they would portray the Republicans as the party of gerrymandering, voter suppression and unbridled campaign ethics violations, a narrative that will be useful to Democrats.""

Pelosi will probably disappoint people hoping to see impeachment proceedings against Trump. Instead she will place the emphasis on investigations by Democratic-led committees in the House to keep the Trump administration in the crosshairs.

Policy issues including family separation at the border, the rolling back of environmental protections, and the president's handling of the aftermath of deadly hurricanes will be examined, alongside the many scandals surrounding Trump's business conflicts, Russian election interference and the president's possible obstruction of justice.

Rosenthal added: ""She will have enough issues that are common cause with progressives to keep them together.""

Do the new generation of progressive Democrats have a point? Is she too much of a pragmatist to lead their radical agenda - and too much of an easy target for Republican rage?

It is true she is a machine politician - brought up in the deal-making politics of Baltimore where her Italian-American father was in office throughout the 1940s and 50s as congressman and then mayor.

But her deal-making and strategy delivered the votes for Barack Obama's Affordable Healthcare Act in 2010 when the White House was wavering and preparing to water down the reforms.

She is not a great public speaker and often misspeaks, memorably triggering accusations of a lack of transparency over Obamacare by saying: ""We have to pass the bill so you can find out what's in it.""

Perhaps she stands somewhere in the middle of the two cartoonish characterisations: on one side, the progressive left ready to dismiss her as a symbol of the status quo; on the other, Republicans who have branded her an extremist liberal radical feminist.

Charlie Cook, editor of the Cook Political Report, said she was the best and pragmatic choice for Democrats. ""In hindsight, keeping Pelosi seems pretty obvious, but while the desire for someone new and younger was great, someone with less political skill than her would not have survived this challenge.""

What is in store for Trump? ""She is as tough as he thinks he is,"" Cook said. ""He could not have a more tenacious adversary, the combination of Pelosi and Schumer is hard to beat. They have seen it all and are both shrewd as hell.""

Their White House meeting with Trump was ""an omen of things to come"", Rosenthal said.

""There was a lot in that episode that is very familiar to women in the corporate world, women in politics - where they get talked over, minimised, and men underestimate them and frankly treat them not as equals. What she demonstrated is that she is a woman who knows all those tricks and is not gonna be defeated ... you know, the president is gonna have his hands full."""
281,the guardian,http://www.theguardian.com/news/2018/dec/20/googles-earth-how-the-tech-giant-is-helping-the-state-spy-on-us,"We knew that being connected had a price - our data. But we didn't care. Then it turned out that Google's main clients included the military and intelligence agencies. By Yasha Levine

The internet surrounds us. It mediates modern life, like a giant, unseen blob that engulfs the modern world. There is no escape, and, as Larry Page and Sergey Brin so astutely understood when they launched Google in 1998, everything that people do online leaves a trail of data. If saved and used correctly, these traces make up a goldmine of information full of insights into people on a personal level as well as a valuable read on larger cultural, economic and political trends.

Google was the first internet company to fully leverage this insight and build a business on the data that people leave behind. But it wasn't alone for long. It happened just about everywhere, from the smallest app to the most sprawling platform.

Uber, Amazon, Facebook, eBay, Tinder, Apple, Lyft, Foursquare, Airbnb, Spotify, Instagram, Twitter, Angry Birds - if you zoom out and look at the bigger picture, you can see that, taken together, these companies have turned our computers and phones into bugs that are plugged in to a vast corporate-owned surveillance net-work. Where we go, what we do, what we talk about, who we talk to, and who we see - everything is recorded and, at some point, leveraged for value. Google, Apple and Facebook know when a woman visits an abortion clinic, even if she tells no one else: the GPS coordinates on the phone don't lie. One-night stands and extramarital affairs are a cinch to figure out: two smartphones that never met before suddenly cross paths in a bar and then make their way to an apartment across town, stay together overnight, and part in the morning.

They know us intimately, even the things that we hide from those closest to us. In our modern internet ecosystem, this kind of private surveillance is the norm. It is as unnoticed and unremarkable as the air we breathe. But even in this advanced, data-hungry environment, in terms of sheer scope and ubiquity, Google reigns supreme.

As the internet expanded, Google grew along with it. No matter what service it deployed or what market it entered, surveillance and prediction were cooked into the business. The amount of data flowing through Google's systems is staggering. By the end of 2016, Google's Android was installed on 82% of all new smartphones sold around the world, and by mid-2017 there were more than 2 billion Android users globally.

Google also handles billions of searches and YouTube plays daily, and has a billion active Gmail users, meaning it had access to most of the world's emails. Some analysts estimate that 25% of all internet traffic in North America goes through Google's servers. The company isn't just connected to the internet, it is the internet.

Google has pioneered a whole new type of business transaction. Instead of paying for its services with money, people pay with their data. And the services it offers to consumers are just the lures, used to grab people's data and dominate their attention - attention that is contracted out to advertisers. Google has used data to grow its empire. By early 2018, Google's parent company, Alphabet, had85,050 employees, working out of more than 70 offices in 50 countries. The company had a market capitalisation of $727bn at the end of 2017, making it the second most valuable public company in the world, beaten only by Apple, another Silicon Valley giant. Its profits for the first quarter of 2018 were $9.4bn.

Meanwhile, other internet companies depend on Google for survival. Snapchat, Twitter, Facebook, Lyft and Uber have all built multi-billion-dollar businesses on top of Google's ubiquitous mobile operating system. As the gatekeeper, Google benefits from their success as well. The more people who use their mobile devices, the more data it gets on them.

What does Google know? What can it guess? Well, it seems just about everything. ""One of the things that eventually happens ... is that we don't need you to type at all,"" Eric Schmidt, Google's former CEO, said in a moment of candour in 2010. ""Because we know where you are. We know where you've been. We can more or less guess what you're thinking about."" He later added: ""One day we had a conversation where we figured we could just try to predict the stock market. And then we decided it was illegal. So we stopped doing that.""

It is a scary thought, considering that Google is no longer a cute startup but a powerful global corporation with its own political agenda and a mission to maximise profits for shareholders. Imagine if Philip Morris, Goldman Sachs or a military contractor like Lockheed Martin had this kind of access.

Not long after Brin and Page incorporated Google, they began to see their mission in bigger terms. They weren't just building a search engine or a targeted advertising business. They were organising the world's information to make it accessible and useful for everyone. It was a vision that also encompassed the Pentagon.

Even as Google grew to dominate the consumer internet, a second side of the company emerged, one that rarely got much notice: Google the government contractor. As it turns out, the same platforms and services that Google deploys to monitor people's lives and grab their data could be put to use running huge swaths of the US government, including the military, spy agencies, police departments and schools. The key to this transformation was a small startup now known as Google Earth.

In 2003, a San Francisco company called Keyhole Incorporated was on the ropes. With a name recalling the CIA's secret 1960s ""Keyhole"" spy satellite programme, the company had been launched two years earlier as a spinoff from a videogame outfit. Its CEO, John Hanke, told journalists that the inspiration for his company came from Neal Stephenson's Snow Crash, a cult science-fiction novel in which the hero taps into a programme created by the ""Central Intelligence Corporation"" called Planet Earth, a virtual reality construct designed, as the book describes, to ""keep track of every bit of spatial information that it owns - all the maps, weather data, architectural plans, and satellite surveillance stuff"".

Keyhole had its roots in videogame technology, but deployed it in the real world, creating a programme that stitched satellite images and aerial photographs into seamless 3D computer models of the Earth that could be explored as if they were in a virtual reality game world. It was a groundbreaking product that allowed anyone with an internet connection to virtually fly over anywhere in the world. The only problem was Keyhole's timing: it was a bit off. It launched just as the dotcom bubble blew up in Silicon Valley's face. Funding dried up, and Keyhole found itself struggling to survive. Luckily, the company was saved just in time by the very entity that inspired it: the CIA.

In 1999, at the peak of the dot-com boom, the CIA had launched In-Q-Tel, a Silicon Valley venture capital fund whose mission was to invest in start-ups that aligned with the agency's intelligence needs. Keyhole seemed a perfect fit.

The CIA poured an unknown amount of money into Keyhole. The investment was finalised in early 2003, and it was made in partnership with the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency, a major intelligence organisation with 14,500 employees and a $5bn budget, whose job was to deliver satellite-based intelligence to the CIA and the Pentagon. Known as the NGA, the spy agency's motto was: ""Know the Earth ... Show the Way ... Understand the World.""

The CIA and NGA were not just investors; they were also clients, and they involved themselves in customising Keyhole's virtual map product to meet their own needs. Months after In-Q-Tel's investment, Keyhole software was already integrated into operational service and deployed to support US troops during Operation Iraqi Freedom, the shock-and-awe campaign to overthrow Saddam Hussein. Intelligence officials were impressed with the ""videogame-like"" simplicity of its virtual maps. They also appreciated the ability to layer visual information over other intelligence. The possibilities were limited only by what contextual data could be fed and grafted on to a map: troop movements, weapons caches, real-time weather and ocean conditions, intercepted emails and phone call intel, and mobile phone locations.

Keyhole gave intelligence analysts, field commanders, air force pilots and others the kind of capabilities we take for granted today when we use digital mapping services on our computers and smartphones to look up restaurants, cafes, museums, traffic or subway routes.

Military commanders weren't the only ones who liked Keyhole. So did Sergey Brin. He liked it so much that he insisted on personally demoing the app for Google executives. According to an account published in Wired, he barged in on a company meeting, punched in the address of every person present, and used the programme to virtually fly over their homes.

In 2004, the same year Google went public, Brin and Page bought the company outright, CIA investors and all. They then absorbed the company into Google's growing internet applications platform. Keyhole was reborn as Google Earth.

The purchase of Keyhole was a milestone for Google, marking the moment the company stopped being a purely consumer-facing internet company and began integrating with the US government. When Google bought Keyhole, it also acquired an In-Q-Tel executive named Rob Painter, who came with deep connections to the world of intelligence and military contracting, including US Special Operations, the CIA and major defence firms, among them Raytheon, Northrop Grumman and Lockheed Martin. At Google, Painter was planted in a new dedicated sales and lobbying division called Google Federal, located in Reston, Virginia, a short drive from the CIA's headquarters in Langley. His job was to help Google grab a slice of the lucrative military-intelligence contracting market. Or, as Painter described in contractor-bureaucratese, ""evangelising and implementing Google Enterprise solutions for a host of users across the intelligence and defence communities"".

Google had closed a few previous deals with intelligence agencies. In 2003, it scored a $2.1m (£1.7m) contract to outfit the National Security Agency (NSA) with a customised search solution that could scan and recognise millions of documents in 24 languages, including on-call tech support in case anything went wrong. In 2004, Google landed a search contract with the CIA. The value of the deal isn't known, but the agency did ask Google's permission to customise the CIA's internal Google search page by placing the CIA's seal in one of the Google logo's Os. ""I told our sales rep to give them the OK if they promised not to tell anyone. I didn't want it spooking privacy advocates,"" wrote Douglas Edwards, Google's first director of marketing and brand management, in his 2011 book I'm Feeling Lucky: The Confessions of Google Employee Number 59. Deals such as these picked up pace and increased in scope after Google's acquisition of Keyhole.

In 2006, Google Federal went on a hiring spree, snapping up managers and salespeople from the army, air force, CIA, Raytheon and Lockheed Martin. It beefed up its lobbying muscle and assembled a team of Democratic and Republican operatives.

Even as it expanded into a transnational multi-billion-dollar corporation, Google had managed to retain its geekily innocent ""don't be evil"" image. So while Google's PR team did its best to keep the company wrapped in a false aura of altruism, company executives pursued an aggressive strategy to become the Lockheed Martin of the internet age. ""We're functionally more than tripling the team each year,"" Painter said in 2008. It was true. With insiders plying their trade, Google's expansion into the world of military and intelligence contracting took off.

In 2007, it partnered with Lockheed Martin to design a visual intelligence system for the NGA that displayed US military bases in Iraq and marked out Sunni and Shia neighbourhoods in Baghdad - important information for a region that had experienced a bloody sectarian insurgency and ethnic cleansing campaign between the two groups. In 2008, Google won a contract to run the servers and search technology that powered the CIA's Intellipedia, an intelligence database modelled after Wikipedia that was collaboratively edited by the NSA, CIA, FBI and other federal agencies. Not long after that, Google contracted with the US army to equip 50,000 soldiers with a customised suite of mobile Google services.

In 2010, as a sign of just how deeply Google had integrated with US intelligence agencies, it won an exclusive, no-bid $27m contract to provide the NGA with ""geospatial visualisation services"", effectively making the company the ""eyes"" of America's defence and intelligence apparatus. Competitors criticised the NGA for not opening the contract to the customary bidding process, but the agency defended its decision, saying it had no choice: it had spent years working with Google on secret and top-secret programmes to build Google Earth technology according to its needs, and could not go with any other company.

Google has been tight-lipped about the details and scope of its contracting business. It does not list this revenue in a separate column in quarterly earnings reports to investors, nor does it provide the sum to reporters. But an analysis of the federal contracting data-base maintained by the US government, combined with information gleaned from Freedom of Information Act requests and published reports on the company's military work, reveals that Google has been doing brisk business selling Google Search, Google Earth and Google Enterprise (now known as G Suite) products to just about every major military and intelligence agency, including the state department. Sometimes Google sells directly to the government, but it also works with established contractors like Lockheed Martin and Saic (Science Applications International Corporation), a California-based intelligence mega-contractor which has so many former NSA employees working for it that it is known in the business as ""NSA West"".

Google's entry into this market makes sense. By the time Google Federal went online in 2006, the Pentagon was spending the bulk of its budget on private contractors. That year, of the $60bn US intelligence budget, 70%, or $42bn, went to corporations. That means that, although the government pays the bill, the actual work is done by Lockheed Martin, Raytheon, Boeing, Bechtel, Booz Allen Hamilton and other powerful contractors. And this isn't just in the defence sector. By 2017, the federal government was spending $90bn a year on information technology. It's a huge market - one in which Google seeks to maintain a strong presence. And its success has been all but guaranteed. Its products are the best in the business.

Here's a sign of how vital Google has become to the US government: in 2010, following a disastrous intrusion into its system by what the company believes was a group of Chinese government hackers, Google entered into a secretive agreement with the NSA. ""According to officials who were privy to the details of Google's arrangements with the NSA, the company agreed to provide information about traffic on its networks in exchange for intelligence from the NSA about what it knew of foreign hackers,"" wrote defence reporter Shane Harris in @War, a history of warfare. ""It was a quid pro quo, information for information. And from the NSA's perspective, information in exchange for protection.""

This made perfect sense. Google servers supplied critical services to the Pentagon, the CIA and the state department, just to name a few. It was part of the military family and essential to American society. It needed to be protected, too.

Google didn't just work with intelligence and military agencies, but also sought to penetrate every level of society, including civilian federal agencies, cities, states, local police departments, emergency responders, hospitals, public schools and all sorts of companies and nonprofits. In 2011, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the federal agency that researches weather and the environment, switched over to Google. In 2014, the city of Boston deployed Google to run the information infrastructure for its 76,000 employees - from police officers to teachers - and even migrated its old emails to the Google cloud. The Forest Service and the Federal Highway Administration use Google Earth and Gmail.

In 2016, New York City tapped Google to install and run free wifi stations across the city. California, Nevada and Iowa, meanwhile, depend on Google for cloud computing platforms that predict and catch welfare fraud. Meanwhile, Google mediates the education of more than half of America's public school students.

""What we really do is allow you to aggregate, collaborate and enable,"" explained Scott Ciabattari, a Google Federal sales rep, during a 2013 government contracting conference in Wyoming. He was pitching to a room full of civil servants, telling them that Google was all about getting them - intelligence analysts, commanders, government managers and police officers - access to the right information at the right time. He ran through a few examples: tracking flu outbreaks, monitoring floods and wildfires, safely serving criminal warrants, integrating surveillance cameras and face recognition systems, and even helping police officers respond to school shootings.

""We are getting this request more and more: 'Can you help us publish all the floorplans for our school district? If there is a shooting disaster, God forbid, we want to know where things are.' Having that ability on a smartphone, being able to see that information quickly at the right time saves lives,"" he said. A few months after this presentation, Ciabattari met with officials from Oakland, California to discuss how Google could help the city build its police surveillance centre.

This mixing of military, police, government, public education, business and consumer-facing systems - all funnelled through Google - continues to raise alarms. Lawyers fret over whether Gmail violates attorney-client privilege. Parents wonder what Google does with the information it collects on their kids at school. What does Google do with the data that flows through its systems? Is all of it fed into Google's big corporate surveillance pot? What are Google's limits and restrictions? Are there any? In response to these questions, Google offers only vague and conflicting answers.

Of course, this concern isn't restricted to Google. Under the hood of most other internet companies we use every day are vast systems of private surveillance that, in one way or another, work with and empower the state. On a higher level, there is no real difference between Google's relationship with the US government and that of these other companies. It is just a matter of degree. The sheer breadth and scope of Google's technology make it a perfect stand-in for the rest of the commercial internet ecosystem.

Indeed, Google's size and ambition make it more than a simple contractor. It is frequently an equal partner that works side by side with government agencies, using its resources and commercial dominance to bring companies with heavy military funding to market. In 2008, a private spy satellite called GeoEye-1 was launched in partnership with the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency; Google's logo was on the launch rocket and the company secured exclusive use of the satellite's data for use in its online mapping. Google also bought Boston Dynamics, a robotics company that made experimental robotic pack mules for the military, only to sell it off after the Pentagon determined it would not be putting these robots into active use. It has invested $100m in CrowdStrike, a major military and intelligence cyber defence contractor that, among other things, led the investigation into the alleged 2016 Russian government hacks of the Democratic National Committee. And it also runs Jigsaw, a hybrid thinktank/technology incubator aimed at leveraging internet technology to solve thorny foreign policy problems - everything from terrorism to censorship and cyberwarfare.

Founded in 2010 by Eric Schmidt and Jared Cohen, a 29-year-old state department whizz-kid who served under both George W Bush and Barack Obama, Jigsaw has launched multiple projects with foreign policy and national security implications. It ran polling for the US government to help war-torn Somalia draft a new constitution, developed tools to track global arms sales, and worked with a startup funded by the state department to help people in Iran and China route around internet censorship.

It also built a platform to combat online terrorist recruitment and radicalisation, which worked by identifying Google users interested in Islamic extremist topics and diverting them to state department webpages and videos developed to dissuade people from taking that path. Google calls this the ""redirect method"", a part of Cohen's larger idea of using internet platforms to wage ""digital counterinsurgency"". And, in 2012, as the civil war in Syria intensified and American support for rebel forces there increased, Jigsaw brainstormed ways it could help push Bashar al-Assad from power. Among them: a tool that visually maps high-level defections from Assad's government, which Cohen wanted to beam into Syria as propaganda to give ""confidence to the opposition"".

Jigsaw seemed to blur the line between public and corporate diplomacy, and at least one former state department official accused it of fomenting regime change in the Middle East. ""Google is getting [White House] and state department support and air cover. In reality, they are doing things the CIA cannot do,"" wrote Fred Burton, an executive at global intelligence platform Stratfor and a former intelligence agent at the security branch of the state department.

But Google rejected the claims of its critics. ""We're not engaged in regime change,"" Eric Schmidt told Wired. ""We don't do that stuff. But if it turns out that empowering citizens with smartphones and information causes changes in their country ... you know, that's probably a good thing, don't you think?""

Jigsaw's work with the state department has raised eyebrows, but its function is a mere taste of the future if Google gets its way. As the company makes new deals with the NSA and continues its merger with the US security apparatus, its founders see it playing an even greater role in global society.

""The societal goal is our primary goal. We've always tried to say that with Google. Some of the most fundamental questions people are not thinking about ... how do we organise people, how do we motivate people? It's a really interesting problem - how do we organise our democracies?"" Larry Page ruminated during a rare interview in 2014 with the Financial Times. He looked a hundred years into the future and saw Google at the centre of progress. ""We could probably solve a lot of the issues we have as humans.""

282,the guardian,http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jan/15/trump-administration-10-year-challenge,"Kellyanne Conway was a calendar model, Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner were newlyweds and Mick Mulvaney was planning to open a Mexican restaurant

It's not clear who started it, or why the rather banal social media challenge has taken off , but the last two days has seen Facebook, Instagram and Twitter awash with people partaking in the #10yearchallenge, by posting photos of themselves from 2009. Everyone from Cardi B to the hosts of Fox & Friends have been getting involved.

Sadly no senior members of the Trump administration have posted their own throwback photos, so we dug them out for them.

Kellyanne Conway

In January 2009, Kellyanne Conway was on display in conservative kitchens across the country. Conway posed as Miss January, in the Clare Boothe Luce Policy Institute's annual conservative women calendar.

The theme for the calendar that year was Pretty in Mink, and Conway is featured sporting a navy sheared beaver jacket with a fox trim. That calendar also featured Ann Coulter in a brown mink coat (model's own, according to the caption). Conway participated in several further spreads until 2012, including one where she wore matching jeans and white shirts with the late Phyllis Schlafly.

By 2009 Conway was the CEO of her polling company called the Polling Company. She had also co-authored a book, What Women Really Want, in which she used polling data to divide American women into what she saw as eight key groups: ""feminist champions, suburban caretakers, multicultural mavericks, religious crusaders, waitress mom, senior survivors, alienated singles and alpha-strivers"".

Mike Pence

In January 2009 Pence, then a congressman, was elected chairman of the House Republican conference, the third most senior position in the party. In his speech accepting the nomination he said he wanted to return the Republican party ""to the ideals of Lincoln and Reagan"" and promised to ""fight for the interests of everyday Americans and offer positive substantive alternatives without unnecessary acrimony"". He spent most of the rest of the year fighting Barack Obama's healthcare reforms.

It was also the year in which Pence was repeatedly challenged on his belief in creationism, and his refusal to accept the theory of evolution. In May 2009 he had a robust conversation with MSNBC's Chris Matthews about the GOP's commitment to the scientific method.

Mick Mulvaney

Now Trump's acting chief of staff, in 2009 Mulvaney was a state senator in South Carolina. Outside of politics, he was reportedly planning to open new franchises of Salsarita's Fresh Cantina, the Mexican grill restaurant chain.

Crucially, it was around this time that he received a $1.4m loan from prominent local businessman Charles Fonville Sr in order to build an out-of-town mall near Charlotte. The mall was never built, but the loan was never returned to Fonville. The issue dogged Mulvaney during his confirmation hearings in 2017 and are now playing out in a court case in South Carolina. While he was serving as Trump's acting director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau he had to travel to Charlotte to be deposed.

Sarah Sanders

The White House press secretary earned her political stripes running campaigns for her father, Mike Huckabee. After he failed to secure the Republican nomination for president in 2008 (when this photo was taken), Sarah Sanders worked as a consultant on a bunch of Republican campaigns including John Boozman's senate run. She was also briefly the campaign manager for the One Campaign, the global development charity founded by Bono that was financed in large part by the Gates foundation.

Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner

By 2009 Ivanka Trump already had a senior role at her father's company and had launched Ivanka Trump Fine Jewelry, with a flagship store in Manhattan. She had been a guest judge on The Apprentice and Project Runway.

Kushner, then 28, was already buying up much of Manhattan as real estate mogul. His purchases included the office building at 666 Fifth Avenue in 2007, for a then-record price of $1.8bn.

Trump and Kushner married at the Trump National Golf Club in Bedminster, New Jersey on 25 October 2009. They were only able to wed once Trump had converted to Judaism, a process she completed in July of that year. Barbara Walters, Rupert Murdoch, Anna Wintour, Russell Crowe, Natalie Portman and Andrew Cuomo, now the governor of New York, were all in attendance."
283,the guardian,http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jan/15/john-delaney-2020-candidate-brexit-response,"The former Maryland congressman John Delaney has become the first presidential candidate to weigh in on Theresa May's resounding Brexit defeat in parliament on Tuesday.

In a statement to the Guardian, Delaney, a former businessman and centrist Democrat mounting a dark horse bid for the White House in 2020, said: ""The truth is Brexit was never honestly sold to voters, which is why the UK finds itself in such a difficult position right now.

""Leaving the European Union will, in fact, hurt British citizens, but staying is not an option after a referendum, unless they have a second.""

Delaney, who has focused his campaign on responding to the challenges of globalization and automation, added: ""The Brexit chaos shows that the answer to globalization isn't to turn inward or to play into the politics of fear - which happened with Trump and the Leave campaign - but to create new policies that make capitalism more just and create meaningful public and private investment in areas and communities left behind.""

Although Barack Obama urged the UK to stay in the European Union during the referendum in 2016, Senator Bernie Sanders, then a candidate for the Democratic nomination to succeed Obama, pointedly declined to weigh in the result the day afterwards, saying: ""I'll let the people of the UK make that decision.""

In March 2016, the Texas Republican Ted Cruz told the Guardian Obama's opposition to Brexit would ""make it more likely that England will pull out of the EU"".

Many Republicans have been increasingly sympathetic to the UK withdrawing from the EU. Donald Trump famously dubbed himself ""Mr Brexit"" and has voiced skepticism regarding other multinational organizations, such as Nato.

American conservatives have embraced also rightwing British politicians like Nigel Farage, who campaigned in Alabama for Roy More during the 2017 special election for US Senate."

Mueller: Manafort shared internal polling data with Russian ... Markets up amid hopes of a US-China trade ceasefire

Good morning, I'm Tim Walker with today's essential stories.

Top story: Oval Office speech condemned by Democrats

Despite his recent threats, Donald Trump did not use his first live Oval Office address to declare a national emergency over immigration, nor did he offer any further solution to the ongoing government shutdown. Instead, the president filled the broadcast with familiar and dubious claims about border security and illegal immigration in an attempt to drum up public support for his coveted border wall. Democratic leaders Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer condemned the president's speech in their televised response, with Pelosi accusing him of holding the country ""hostage"".

Who pays? Among the claims in Trump's speech was his insistence that the border wall would be paid for ""indirectly"" by Mexico via the new USMCA trade deal, an assertion roundly dismissed by fact-checkers.

Government closures start to bite for farmers and flyers

As the partial government shutdown nears the end of its third week, the effects are beginning to be felt across various areas of American life. Farmers awaiting emergency federal aid during the US-China trade war face further uncertainty thanks to the closure of the US agriculture department. A lack of safety inspectors and security officers has led to long lines and diminished safety at airports. And the furloughing of some 13,000 EPA workers is putting Americans' health at risk as potentially polluted air and water goes untested.

Joshua Tree. Officials have closed Joshua Tree national park in California after a spate of vandalism and other problems, following 18 days in which the park was kept open by volunteers during the shutdown.

Mueller: Manafort shared internal polling data with Russian

Robert Mueller believes Paul Manafort, when he was Donald Trump's presidential campaign manager, shared internal polling data on the 2016 election with the Russian consultant Konstantin Kilimnik, who is thought to have ties to Moscow's intelligence agencies. The accusations emerged in a court filing that Manafort's lawyers apparently failed to properly redact before it was made public on Tuesday. In the document, Manafort's lawyers say any false statements he made to Mueller's investigation were memory lapses, not lies.

Mystery firm. The supreme court has rejected a request from an unidentified foreign company to waive a daily $50,000 fine for defying a subpoena from Mueller's special counsel investigation.

Trump Tower meeting. Natalia Veselnitskaya, the Russian lawyer who attended a now-infamous June 2016 meeting with Trump aides at Trump Tower in New York, has been charged by federal prosecutors with obstruction of justice.

Markets up amid hopes of a US-China trade ceasefire

The US and China have concluded their trade talks in Beijing after negotiations were extended to a third day, raising hopes of an entente between the world's two largest economies. Markets were up on Wednesday as Bloomberg reported that Trump is desperate to reach a deal with China to bolster a flagging stock market. Ted McKinney, the US undersecretary of agriculture for trade and foreign agricultural affairs, who is part of the US delegation, told reporters in Beijing that the discussions had gone ""just fine"".

Possible breakthrough. It is thought the negotiators made progress on issues including increased access to China's markets.

Potential obstacles. But the two nations reportedly remain divided on Trump administration demands over Chinese structural reforms to prevent the alleged theft of US technology.

In a step forward for gun control advocates, House Democrats have unveiled a bill to significantly broaden background checks on gun sales, though the legislation is unlikely to pass the Republican-held Senate.

285,the guardian,http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/dec/21/jared-kushner-criminal-justice-reform,"There is a first time for everything. On Wednesday Jared Kushner, son-in-law of Donald Trump and bête noire of American liberals, woke up to headlines not accusing him of corruption or mocking his political naiveté. They were headlines of praise.

Kushner had helped bring about bipartisan accord almost unheard of in today's Washington to overhaul criminal justice.

The First Step Act - which passed 87-12 in the Senate and 358-36 in the House and will now go to Trump to be signed - outlaws the shackling of women during childbirth, reduces the life sentence for some drug offenders with three convictions to 25 years and will potentially free up to 4,000 prisoners by rewarding good behaviour.

There were plaudits for Kushner from both sides of the aisle. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham paid tribute to the 37-year-old's ""tenacity"", while Democratic Senator Cory Booker, noting that most beneficiaries will be people of colour, said: ""I don't think this would have happened without him.""

Some observers caution, however, that while Kushner deserves limited credit for riding a wave, his reputation is already doomed by conflicts of interest and a close relationship with Saudi Arabia's crown prince.

For Kushner, criminal justice reform was personal. When he was a law and business school student in his early 20s, his father Charles Kushner was imprisoned on charges of tax evasion, witness tampering and illegal campaign donations.

The husband of Ivanka Trump worked with groups including the ACLU and Brennan Center, the conservative Koch brothers' network, former Barack Obama special adviser Van Jones and reality TV star Kim Kardashian West. He visited senators on Capitol Hill, carefully keeping track of their views and whether he had sufficient votes. It also helped that he had the ear of the president.

Grover Norquist, a tax reform activist who has been working on criminal justice reform for 25 years, said: ""Jared was central. We had all this energy behind us for the last two years of the Obama administration but there was no White House oomph. What Jared gave us was a White House commitment: 'Start to finish, I'm not giving up, this is going to happen.'""

Kushner recruited Brooke Rollins, head of the Texas Public Policy Foundation, mindful that Texas had adopted similar reforms and that conservative, southern states were needed to win over sceptical Republicans. Norquist said: ""How does a guy from New York pick the best, toughest person in Texas? It was a series of smart moves.

""Working with Jared, you saw a guy learning over time. He was flexible as far as strategy, tactics and how much of the loaf he was going to get, but dogged and persistent in terms of what direction we're going. 'You see that mountain? That's where we're going.'""

And yet, with the mountain peak in sight, Kushner was almost thwarted. The New York Times reported last week Mitch McConnell, the Senate majority leader, came to the White House to tell Trump that he would not bring the bill to the Senate floor before the end of the year.

""Mr Kushner entered the Oval Office, Mr McConnell joked that he felt like he had heard from everyone Mr Kushner knew,"" the paper said. ""'That's not true,' Mr Kushner replied, according to administration officials. 'I have a lot more people.'""

As good as his word, Kushner asked Vice-President Mike Pence to make the case to Trump that the bill should be considered before Republicans lose their House majority, according to the New York Times, while also persuading Rupert Murdoch and his son Lachlan to release a statement endorsing the bill. He gave a rare interview on Fox News, the conservative network that Trump watches avidly.

It worked. Approved by the House on Thursday, as expected, it is the first major bipartisan legislative success of the Trump era, albeit only the beginning of criminal justice reform - as its name suggests. It was a change in fortunes for Kushner, a figure more usually mocked for a vast portfolio that includes bringing peace to the Middle East, apparently based on the qualification that he wed the president's favourite daughter.

Norquist said: ""I think among some people, if they just thought he was a pretty face and had a job because he married into the family business, this is a 'The kid knows what he's doing' moment. The left will still criticise but the 'He's a lightweight' theory isn't the way to go. And this bill certainly isn't a way to monetise being in the White House.""

Others are less effusive, however. Larry Jacobs, director of the Center for the Study of Politics and Governance at the University of Minnesota, said: ""There's been talk of some bipartisan effort on criminal justice reform for the last four or five years. There was interest in fiscal benefits, political benefits. Both parties wanted to be able to say they accomplished something.

""Kushner deserves some credit for seizing it. His role was to bring the White House in. I wouldn't hold a parade for him. He was capitalising on something that was happening anyway. Mitch McConnell is not listening to Kushner; he's listening to a number of Republicans in the Senate who insisted on it; they are his masters.""

Kushner may wish to savour the moment while he can. When Democrats take control of the House next month, they will have subpoena power. Kushner is likely to face an onslaught of investigations into his businesses, security clearance and relationship with Mohammed bin Salman, the Saudi crown prince accused of ordering the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.

Jacobs said: ""He is standing in quick sand of political corruption and atrocious policy judgments. I don't think momentary good press is going to save him from that. Those of us who've watched Washington a long time can see someone who has taken on water and is sinking."""
286,the guardian,http://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/dec/16/fire-fury-fear-wolff-woodward-stormy-daniels-books-donald-trump,"Michael Wolff told all, Stormy Daniels revealed all, Bob Woodward dug deeper. And some books weren't about Trump

""Fast away the old year passes,"" the carol says. Some years, though, come to seem longer than others.

A review of books on US politics published this year requires more than the usual blowing of intellectual dust from volumes already seeming outdated. Consider that Michael Wolff's Fire and Fury: Inside the Trump White House was a major story - broken by the Guardian - in January but is now largely forgotten, overtaken by events. A tell-all chiefly remembered for Steve Bannon's harsh view of the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting with a Russian attorney, which led to his separation from ""Trump World"", and the harsh criticism of Donald Trump it reports even from allies and friends, it now seems almost of antiquarian interest. The circus has moved on, and not happily. Too breathless in parts, Wolff's book is nevertheless a good read.

Likewise, a series of books whose authors have left the administration seem little more than a staccato display of fireworks. As befits the analogy, most were duds that failed to ignite or hit the ground with a thud: one news cycle or two, then gone. In this category belong Anthony Scaramucci's Trump: The Blue Collar President, which lasted in the public mind about as long as he did at the White House, and Sean Spicer's The Briefing, an attempt to spin many failures, such as the rollout of the travel ban, as the result of simple inexperience or the fault of opponents. The former press secretary did at least give us the memorable description of Trump as ""a unicorn, riding a unicorn over a rainbow"". Omarosa Manigault Newman's Unhinged probably took the cake with its effort to both bear witness to power and settle scores.

There is a pattern in these books: ephemeral tales of crude vulgarity, petty personal (and personnel) squabbles and breathtaking bureaucratic dysfunction, with the occasional piercing insight thrown in almost as an afterthought.

From outside the administration, Howard Kurtz delivered a robust Trump defense in Media Madness and Stormy Daniels, in Full Disclosure, pulled no punches in her portraits of Trump and his former lawyer Michael Cohen. James Comey, the FBI director fired by Trump, offered A Higher Loyalty as his attempt to set the record straight.

From Trump's own corner came Trump's Enemies, in which Corey Lewandowski and David Bossie follow the pattern of their boss and attack while defending all Trump has done, to the point of terming his former campaign manager Paul Manafort a ""rat"". The book offers a preview of what a Trump campaign might look like in 2020 and it is not elevating, offering ammunition for supporters without really addressing the many charges against him. It criticizes those who, like the White House chief of staff, John Kelly, or the National Economic Council head, Gary Cohn, have seemed the most moderate or reasonable administration figures. ""Let Trump be Trump,"" the authors opine, and all will be well.

Importantly, amid all this there was a Bob Woodward book: Fear. Under normal circumstances, such a work would be anticipated for months, with trepidation inside the administration as colleagues begin by wondering who has been talking to the hero of Watergate and then realize that most of them have. This year, even Fear seems to have left less of a mark on the popular mind than it warrants. If it changed few minds, that is because there were relatively few minds susceptible to being changed.

Fear is nevertheless an important book, clearly the best to summarize the troubles of the past two years. Woodward writes a serious, fact-based account of the Trump administration, with some key revelations - for example, the efforts of some Republicans to replace Trump as the nominee after the video of his boasts about sexual misconduct emerged. The result, as Woodward clearly intended, is sobering. Serious students of American politics should read it.

Most of these books, unsurprisingly, contain at least some references to Robert Mueller's investigation of Russian election interference and links between Trump and Moscow. For a comprehensive treatment of Russian influence on the election, Cyberwar by Kathleen Hall Jamieson links the timing and use of the leaked emails to polling data, and concludes that it did determine the outcome. It remains to be seen how closely Mueller may follow her roadmap.

On similar themes, in Russian Roulette, Michael Isikoff and David Corn detail numerous connections, personal and professional, between Trump and Russia. Seth Hettena's Trump/Russia: A Definitive History and Greg Miller's The Apprentice cover much of the same ground, Miller focusing on technology and the 2016 election.

It is equally unsurprising that the year saw a number of jeremiads, chiefly from Republicans distressed about the state of their party and leader. David Frum's Trumpocracy laments the decline of norms of governance and warns of creeping authoritarianism. In Everything Trump Touches Dies, the political consultant Rick Wilson offers a robust protest against Trump (""his nationalist hucksterism smelled like ... a knock on the door of authoritarian statism"") while ultimately concluding that ""we"" - broadly, the political class - ""fed the monster and trained it"". More analytically but perhaps equally alarmingly, Michael Lewis's The Fifth Risk is a well-written and important study of Trump's impact on the federal bureaucracy. Despite the subject matter, it's surprisingly readable.

After the bitter loss of 2016, Democrats were not immune from introspection. Ben Bradlee Jr's The Forgotten is a deep engagement with the voters of Luzerne county, Pennsylvania, in the heart of Trump country, seeking to explain the troubles of the white working class. From the right, Selena Zito and Brad Todd's The Great Revolt is a strong analysis of populism and Trump's base.

On the positive side, Senator Ben Sasse, of Nebraska, offers in Them a very different way forward for the Republican party. Drawing on a strong vision of community, Sasse seeks an America in which the two sides at least understand each other better and find instances of common purpose.

In August, America bid farewell to Senator John McCain. The Restless Wave, written as he was dying of cancer, is pure McCain: saucy and stern, with warnings about the future of democracy and external threats and a paean to the Senate as it was. McCain never lost sight of ideals, nor of hope. ""We are citizens,"" he wrote, ""of a republic made of shared ideals forged in a new world to replace the tribal enmities that tormented the old one."" His conclusion: ""I have loved my life. All of it.""

Michelle Obama has become a similar force in American life. The success of her memoir, Becoming, along with her prominent role supporting Democrats in the midterms, is a sign of her emergence as such. Spoiler alert: she has ""no intention of running for office, ever"".

In 2019, as the departures continue from a White House noted for exceptionally quick turnover, we may expect more exposes, tell-alls and page-turners. Fortunately for those tiring of the rush, 2018 also saw publication of some strong works of political history. For a good holiday read, pick up David Blight's magisterial Frederick Douglass or Nathaniel Philbrick's In the Hurricane's Eye. There will be politics enough to come."

Mitt Romney, the former Republican presidential candidate and incoming US senator, has sharply criticised Donald Trump both personally and professionally, accusing him of deserting the nation's allies and lacking the character to lead a ""divided"" nation.

In a Washington Post essay published on Tuesday evening, Romney said Trump's presidency ""made a deep descent"" in December and blamed him for the departures of defence secretary Jim Mattis and White House chief of staff John Kelly.

""The appointment of senior persons of lesser experience, the abandonment of allies who fight beside us, and the president's thoughtless claim that America has long been a 'sucker' in world affairs all defined his presidency down,"" he wrote.

""On balance, his conduct over the past two years, particularly his actions this month, is evidence that the president has not risen to the mantle of the office.""

Romney praised Trump's tax policies, stance on China and appointment of conservative judges but said they were ""mainstream"" Republican policies.

""To a great degree, a presidency shapes the public character of the nation,"" he wrote. ""A president should unite us and inspire us to follow 'our better angels'. A president should demonstrate the essential qualities of honesty and integrity, and elevate the national discourse with comity and mutual respect. As a nation, we have been blessed with presidents who have called on the greatness of the American spirit.

""With the nation so divided, resentful and angry, presidential leadership in qualities of character is indispensable. And it is in this province where the incumbent's shortfall has been most glaring.""

He added that ""Trump's words and actions have caused dismay around the world"" and cited Pew reports suggesting belief among people in Germany, Britain, France, Canada and Sweden that Trump would ""do the right thing"" had fallen from 84% in 2016 to 16% a year later.

The White House did not immediately respond to a request for comment.

Romney is staking out an independent position two days before he takes office on Thursday. It is unclear whether Trump will face a serious challenge in 2020 to securing the Republican party's presidential nomination.

In February last year, Trump endorsed Romney's run for a Senate seat in Utah.

During the 2016 presidential campaign, Romney excoriated Trump as a ""fraud"" who was ""playing the American public for suckers"". Trump responded that Romney had ""choked like a dog"" in his unsuccessful 2012 campaign against Barack Obama.

Despite Romney's prior criticism, after Trump won the presidency in November 2016, Trump briefly considered tapping Romney as secretary of state.

In his essay on Tuesday, Romney said he ""will speak out against significant statements or actions that are divisive, racist, sexist, anti-immigrant, dishonest or destructive to democratic institutions"".

Romney has strongly defended press freedom and challenged Trump's repeated attacks on some news outlets as an ""enemy of the people"".

In an essay in November, he wrote: ""The media is essential to our Republic, to our freedom, to the cause of freedom abroad, and to our national security. It is very much our friend.""

Reuters contributed to this report"
288,the guardian,http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jan/12/james-comey-fdr-tweet-donald-trump-judge-by-my-enemies,"On Friday, the New York Times released a bombshell report which said the FBI reacted to Donald Trump's firing of FBI director James Comey in May 2017 by opening an investigation into the president's ties with Russia.

On Saturday, on Twitter, Trump reacted with familiar anger and abuse. Also true to form, Comey was more arch.

""I ask you to judge me by the enemies I have made,"" he wrote, adding an attribution: ""FDR.""

According to practice firmly established in the age of government and scandal by tweet, journalists raced to check whether Franklin Delano Roosevelt actually said those words. The answer was that he did - or some of them.

According to records made available online by the Franklin D Roosevelt Presidential Library and Museum in Hyde Park, New York, Roosevelt made the remark on the campaign trail, in a speech in Portland, Oregon, on 21 September 1932.

""My friends,"" he said, ""judge me by the enemies I have made.""

The man who would become the 32nd president was referring to the owners of power utilities whose actions he deemed to be against the interests of the American people. The transcript records that his remark was greeted with: ""Cheers, prolonged applause.""

On Saturday, thanks to the miracles of Google, it also quickly became clear that Comey was by no means the first public figure to have reached for - and slightly misquoted - FDR's Portland speech.

In November 2012, back when he was merely a property mogul, reality TV star and propagator of racist conspiracy theories about Barack Obama, about whose recent re-election he was decidedly cross, Trump tweeted the line himself."
289,the guardian,http://www.theguardian.com/books/2018/dec/17/palaces-for-people-build-more-equal-society-eric-klinenberg-review,"Why libraries, parks and other endangered public spaces are essential to good city living

For the sociologist Eric Klinenberg, a vision of the good city begins in the local library. It's a place where a huge amount of knowledge is available permanently, free of charge. It's a computer centre; it's a place where everyone goes, including the marginalised young and elderly. Security is light-touch - ""you rarely see a police officer in the library"". It is adaptable in a crisis. During Hurricane Sandy, a branch library in Staten Island became the place where local people sheltered and where relief was coordinated. In north-west Bangladesh, libraries float on moored boats in flood-prone areas. All this passes almost unnoticed. Libraries are closing across the UK and the US at a scarily rapid rate (nearly 130 have closed in the past year, it was recently revealed). The public library is not, and inherently never can be, a market, and so, Klinenberg writes, ""If it didn't already exist, it's hard to imagine our society's leaders inventing it.""

Klinenberg, who comes from a similar Chicago community milieu as his friend Barack Obama, has written a paean to libraries, parks, playgrounds and other public spaces, but he is unable to keep the bleaker realities of urban (and, unusually, suburban) life out of his would-be-inspiring ""Aren't Cities great?"" narrative. What are clearly meant to be instructive just-so stories and heartwarming anecdotes are often much more grim and upsetting than he seems to think they are.

He's well aware that there is a crisis in the US - he names opioids, housing costs that are now out of control, racial politics that are more tense than ever, collapsing infrastructure and undrinkable water, and inequality that has become insulting: ""When millions lost their homes in the foreclosure crisis, the most affluent Americans locked up their spoils, buying 'safe deposit boxes in the sky' in soaring urban condominium towers. Those who could afford it went one step further, buying survivalist retreats."" Much of this could equally be said of the UK.

This is about as angry and vehement as the usually cosy world of American liberal urbanism can get. At the heart of the book is that idea of the library or park rather than the market as the real agora, the place where urban life is lived at its best, an example of the ""social infrastructure"" that could really rebuild America. Unlike in a McDonald's, a Starbucks or a chic Sourdough bakery, ""You have to try very hard to be kicked out of the library."" Klinenberg praises the charitable work of Andrew Carnegie, whose programme of branch libraries provided miniature baroque palaces in the most ordinary places. It is best put in the words of one working-class resident of Queens, New York, who tells the author that during a difficult childhood ""the library was a place where I could go and ignore people, and also know I wasn't alone"". That's what many of us most want, but can't have, in city life.

Klinenberg argues that places such as a branch library have fallen by the wayside in discussions of what makes a good city, because they're public infrastructure, and hence not anarchic or, in the current parlance, ""bottom-up"" - so their importance passes below the radar of both left and rightwing libertarian city enthusiasts. He finds similar possibilities in churches, mosques and other religious buildings and public swimming pools; he devotes some of the more speculative parts of the book to imagining what new ""social infrastructure"" might be needed to cope with climate change.

Singapore's Marina Bay and Rotterdam's Waterplein Benthemplein, which control water levels while providing valuable public spaces, are two examples. The flaws of the book come out in a discussion of another of these apparently public ""infrastructures"", New York's High Line, the remodelling of a disused freight viaduct that began as an elevated park but has become a riotously successful accelerator of gentrification. The ""Big U"", a flood barrier-cum-park proposed for Manhattan by the architect Bjarke Ingels, could be a High Line for climate change - but how can New Yorkers stop it having the same effect? This leads us to the question of ownership, and places where this book won't go - harder measures, such as nationalisation, that could keep social infrastructure social, and keep public spaces public. The book concludes with an attack on Mark Zuckerberg for claiming Facebook as ""social infrastructure"". Klinenberg argues that Facebook's need for constant expansion and profit means that it ends up spreading dubious news stories and intensifying paranoid political cliques. He asks, rightly, why no tech billionaire has ever done for ""the people"" what Carnegie did with his libraries. We need not stop there, as we don't need billionaires to give us palaces. We can build them ourselves."
290,the guardian,http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jan/12/trump-tweets-fbi-russia-new-york-times-james-comey,"Donald Trump produced a torrent of misleading tweets on Saturday to deny the stunning claim that he was secretly working on behalf of Russia.

In a front page story extraordinary even by the tumultuous standards of the Trump era, the New York Times reported that the FBI launched an investigation into whether the US president was acting as a Russian asset, against his own country's interests.

The investigation opened after Trump fired the FBI director James Comey in May 2017, the Times said, citing anonymous sources. It was part counterintelligence, to determine whether Trump was knowingly or unknowingly working for Moscow and posed a threat to national security. It was also part criminal, to ascertain whether Trump's dismissal of Comey constituted obstruction of justice.

The FBI effort was soon absorbed into the special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election and alleged collusion between Trump's campaign and Moscow, the Times reported, adding that it was unclear if the counterintelligence aspect is still being pursued.

Jesse McKinley, a New York Times journalist, wrote on Twitter: ""It sounds like spy fiction but it is not: the FBI was investigating the president of the United States to see if he was working for the Russians.""

The president tried to fight back in characteristic style, by firing off half a dozen intemperate tweets.

The first said: ""Wow, just learned in the Failing New York Times that the corrupt former leaders of the FBI, almost all fired or forced to leave the agency for some very bad reasons, opened up an investigation on me, for no reason & with no proof, after I fired Lyin' James Comey, a total sleaze!""

Trump went on make baseless claims that the FBI mishandled an investigation into his election rival, Hillary Clinton, and proclaimed: ""My firing of James Comey was a great day for America."" He suggested without evidence that Comey is being protected by Mueller, who has issued dozens of indictments and secured convictions of some of the Trump's close associates.

And he insisted: ""I have been FAR tougher on Russia than Obama, Bush or Clinton. Maybe tougher than any other President. At the same time, & as I have often said, getting along with Russia is a good thing, not a bad thing. I fully expect that someday we will have good relations with Russia again!""

Trump's warm relationship with the Russian president Vladimir Putin has long set alarm bells ringing. The day after firing Comey, he hosted Russia's foreign minister, Sergey Lavrov, in the Oval Office - and disclosed intelligence from an Israeli counterterrorism operation. At a summit in Helsinki last summer, Trump appeared to side with Putin over his own intelligence agencies on the question of election interference.

More recently, the president startled his own national security officials by suddenly announcing the withdrawal of troops from Syria, widely seen as handing a strategic victory to Russia and prompting the defense secretary James Mattis to quit. He also bizarrely endorsed the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan in the 1980s.

Holed up at the White House with no official engagements, Trump then turned his Twitter feed to the other subject dominating US politics: a partial government shutdown which, in its 22nd day, is now the longest in American history, eclipsing the previous record set during the presidency of Bill Clinton.

Trump is demanding $5.7bn towards his long-promised wall on the US-Mexico border, claiming it will solve a humanitarian and national security crisis there. Democrats, who now control the House of Representatives, have passed measures to reopen the government without funding for the wall, which they regard as an expensive, impractical and immoral response to a manufactured crisis. The result is a political stalemate that leaves a quarter of the government unfunded.

About 800,000 workers missed pay cheques on Friday, many receiving blank pay statements instead. Some posted photos of their empty earnings statements on social media and complained that they are unable to pay bills. The House and Senate voted to give federal workers back pay whenever the federal government reopens, then left Washington for the weekend.

Miami's airport will close one of its concourses most of Saturday, Sunday and Monday to make sure security checkpoints are adequately staffed as the shutdown begins to strain the aviation system. Security screeners who are not being paid are staying at home and safety inspectors are off the job.

Some national park facilities are closed while rubbish has been piling up in those that remain open. The Smithsonian museums and national zoo in Washington are shuttered, a blow to tourism revenue. Nearly everyone at Nasa is being told to stay at home.

With opinion polls showing Trump getting most of the blame for the shutdown, Trump is toying with the idea of declaring a national emergency to bypass Congress and fund the wall from existing sources of federal revenue. Republicans are divided on the move and it would be certain to face legal challenges.

The president, who claims to be a master dealmaker, rattled off half a dozen tweets about the shutdown on Saturday, including the cryptic promise: ""I do have a plan on the Shutdown. But to understand that plan you would have to understand the fact that I won the election, and I promised safety and security for the American people. Part of that promise was a Wall at the Southern Border. Elections have consequences!""

The House speaker, Nancy Pelosi, who has vowed to oppose any funding, said the president is seeking to divert attention from Mueller's investigation and other White House troubles.

""This isn't a wall between Mexico and the United States,"" the Democrat told reporters this week. ""This is a wall between his failures of his administration. This is a big diversion and he's a master of diversion."""
291,the guardian,http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jan/08/us-government-shutdown-2019-explained,"A partial shutdown of the US federal government has stretched into a third week with virtually no end in sight. It is now the second-longest shutdown in US history. The closures are having an impact on 800,000 federal workers, many of whom will not receive paychecks for the first time since the stand-off in Washington began just before Christmas.

Standing in the way of a resolution is Donald Trump's demand for a wall on the US-Mexico border - a central promise of his presidential campaign. Despite repeatedly vowing that Mexico would pay for it, the president is now demanding $5.7bn in taxpayer money to proceed with construction of the border wall. Democrats are standing firm against the proposal while Trump has threatened that the shutdown, which he already said he would be proud to take responsibility for, could last for ""months or even years"".

What is a government shutdown?

During a government shutdown, federal agencies must cease all operations and services deemed non-essential while essential functions such as airport security and law enforcement will continue to be performed. Laid-off workers are sent home without pay while other employees must work without being paid.

The shutdown lasts until new funding is approved by Congress and signed into law by the president.

On 21 December at midnight, funding expired and work ceased across nine federal departments . Many national parks are closed, immigration courts were suspended and scientific research has stalled.

How does a shutdown come about?

The sprawling federal bureaucracy that keeps many aspects of American life humming is funded by an annual budget set and approved by Congress. The president must sign - or veto - the 12 so-called appropriations bills, which lay out how federal agencies may spend their money in the next fiscal year.

Appropriations bills need 60 votes in the Senate, a requirement that often forces bipartisanship depending on the party breakdown in the chamber. When Congress fails to pass - or the president refuses to sign - budget legislation before a spending deadline, whatever portion of government lacks funding ""shuts down"".

This process has becoming increasingly political in recent years and has been used by both parties as a way to extract concessions on legislative priorities.

In October 2013, Republicans shut down the government for 16 days in an unsuccessful bid to strip funding from Barack Obama's healthcare legislation, the Affordable Care Act. In January 2018, Democrats briefly shut down the government over an impasse on immigration legislation, as a way to demand Congress enact protections for undocumented immigrants who came to the country as children.

How bad is this one?

If the shutdown continues through the weekend, it will be the longest on record.

The White House on Monday directed the Internal Revenue Service to pay tax refunds.

The impact of the shutdown will only worsen the longer it lasts. The nation's food assistance program only has funding through the end of January and it likely could not meet the demand expected in February. Meanwhile, federal workers appear to be growing frustrated. Transportation Security Administration employees have been increasingly calling out sick at airports across the country while at the Environmental Protection Agency are planning a ""national sick day"" to protest the shutdown.

Who is to blame?

An impasse between a divided Congress and the White House is to blame. Trump's demand for a wall is the key sticking point. Public polling suggests that Americans believe Republicans, and specifically the president, are to blame for the shutdown. Meanwhile, a majority of Americans oppose the wall, while a larger share say it should not be the priority. In December, Trump said he would be ""proud"" to take responsibility for shutting down the government in the face of Democratic opposition to funding his pet wall project.

How can it be resolved?

Negotiations between congressional leaders and the White House are at a virtual standstill. That's despite tense meetings and the president spending the Christmas and New Year break at the White House instead of going to his club, Mar-a-Lago in Palm Beach, Florida, alternating between threats and pleadings to Democrats via Twitter.

As the repercussions of the shutdown further ripple across the country, members of Congress - including a small but vocal group of Republicans - are demanding the Senate take up legislation to end the shutdown and allow the debate over border security to resume with the government opens.

Trump on Tuesday was set to address the nation to possibly declare a ""national emergency"" that would allow him to build a wall without congressional approval, a move fraught with legal obstacles and political peril. Alternatively, he may merely declare a ""crisis"" and continue his political arguments for an agreement."
292,the guardian,http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/dec/19/why-bernie-sanders-is-still-the-most-progressive-choice-for-president,"With less than two years until election day, no other Democratic candidate has the ability to defeat Donald Trump

Speculation over the 2020 US presidential elections has already gotten contentious. The Democratic field looks as if it's going to be crowded, and new prospects are floated the press seemingly every week, from Oprah Winfrey to Beto O'Rourke. With just under two years to go until election day, it's best not to become too consumed by presidential speculation. But for those on the left who want to defeat Donald Trump and advance egalitarian political values, it's important to start to think about who can succeed. For those of us who believe in radically transformative political change, the choice is already clear - Bernie Sanders is the only viable option.

Based on his record, Sanders should be the progressive favorite by default. In 2016, he ran an impressive insurgent campaign that came close to defeating the party elite's handpicked candidate. Savvier Democrats have already recognized that Sander's message is the one that best suits the mood of the electorate.

His ideas have set the agenda for the Democratic party for the past two years, with elected officials trying to burnish their progressive credentials by doing photo ops with Sanders and adopting his policies, from free college to Medicare for All (a plan that even the majority of Republican voters now favor). Many polls suggest he is the most popular politician in the country, and would be the clear favorite in a match-up against Trump. Attempts to portray Sanders as the candidate of white ""Bernie Bros"" ignore the facts - Sanders has higher favorability ratings among people of color than any other Democratic politician. It's obvious that he's the party's best shot. He has a formidable team of experienced organizers, national popularity and name recognition, and a clear, bold agenda that can win over working-class people of all genders and races.

What about the other frontrunners? Some current polls put Joe Biden ahead of Sanders in a potential primary. But while Biden's ""Uncle Joe"" persona has endeared him to Democrats across the country, no serious progressive can support him. For one thing, Biden has declared himself indifferent to the concerns of millennial voters, saying he has ""no empathy"" for young people who complain about student debt, precarious employment, and high rent. I don't know about other millennials, but I prefer a candidate who can empathize with me.

Biden has also spent a long career in Washington failing to take important stands at critical points. He has misrepresented his pandering to racists during the 1970s, and his handling of Anita Hill's testimony during 1991's was infamously shameful. (After decades in which Hill waited for an apology from Biden, he finally gave a partial one this year, while still declining to accept blame for what happened to Hill.) If that wasn't enough, Biden's creepy history of routinely violating women's personal space should make his candidacy a non-starter in the post-#MeToo era.

How about Beto O'Rourke, the ""Kennedyesque"" golden boy currently being floated as a potential nominee? O'Rourke turned in an impressive showing against Ted Cruz in Texas. But O'Rourke is a member of the centrist New Democrat coalition, and his commitment to progressive values is so lukewarm that he refuses to even use the word ""progressive"" to describe himself. His record as a legislator is thin, and he has been noncommittal and evasive when discussing core progressive policies like tuition-free college and single-payer healthcare. Since he hasn't taken the lead on pushing a left agenda in Congress, there's little reason to think he would be effective at doing so as president.

In fact, every candidate other than Sanders has qualities that should be deeply troubling to those on the left. Elizabeth Warren, whose calls for a more democratic economy put her closer to Sanders than any other senator, has called herself a ""capitalist to my bones"" - a sharp contrast with the democratic socialism with which the majority of millennials sympathize. (Warren's disastrous handling of the ""Native American"" controversy also does not suggest the kind of nimble political instincts crucial to taking on a master of sleaze and scandal like Donald Trump.)

Kamala Harris has a record of overseeing and then defending serious prosecutorial misconduct as California's attorney general, and racial justice advocates strongly criticized her for her failure to hold police accountable. Cory Booker, whose political rise was fueled by corporate money, has such warm feelings for Wall Street that he actually criticized Barack Obama for being too harsh on private equity firms.

Kirsten Gillibrand spent the first part of her career as a lawyer for Big Tobacco, and according to the American Conservative was originally elected by ""running to the right"", such as by staunchly opposing drivers' licenses for undocumented people. Gillibrand has recently begun to sound far more progressive, but someone who served as the paid agent for ""merchants of death"" faces a high burden to prove they've changed.

A candidate should be judged on their record. Based on how recently most of the 2020 prospects have embraced the progressive agenda, it's reasonable to suspect some opportunism. Sanders, on the other hand, has a lifelong history as a thorn in the side of the establishment. Even as a teenager, Sanders was getting himself arrested in civil rights demonstrations.

As mayor of Burlington, he pioneered an innovative community land trust approach to affordable housing. He has been an efficient legislator, even earning the title ""amendment king"" for his success in getting measures through Congress. And he has shown a willingness to take principled stands, including his early opposition to the Iraq war plus his votes against the Defense of Marriage Act and the Patriot Act.

There are only a few serious criticisms of Sanders, the main one being ""he's too old.' But while age might be a more serious factor if the current president were far younger, Trump is a septuagenarian like Sanders. Sanders still shoots hoops, he criss-crosses the country giving speeches, and he has more energy than many of us who are less than half his age. If Trump tries to make an issue of Sanders' superior age, experience, and wisdom, Sanders can just challenge him to settle it on the basketball court.

There are a few other criticisms that can be made of Sanders, including his unfair criticism of leftist ""open borders"" advocates. He has cast bad votes (the 1994 Clinton crime bill comes to mind) and sometimes makes frustrating gaffes. I do not think Sanders is the ideal candidate, the one I would make in a laboratory. It would indeed be nice to have someone younger, ideally a woman of color (if only the constitution didn't bar Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez!) But the question isn't ""Is Sanders flawless?"" Rather, it's ""Is Sanders the best candidate we have available?"" To that, the answer is clear. No other 2020 prospect comes close.

'David Beckham Temple'

You'd be forgiven for thinking that Bangkok shrines all look alike after you've visited your fifth one. However, you'll be hard-pressed to find anything like Wat Pariwat, a temple complex in the city's south-eastern corner. At first sight, it may look like your typical run-of-the-mill wat - but look closer and you'll discover ornate depictions of emoji pandas, Wonder Woman, Pikachu, Disney figures and an angelic bare-chested Obama (to name a few) all blending in with the traditional intricate mosaics covering the walls and ceiling. It's a visual feast and worth spending some time at as you hunt for pop culture references, including David Beckham, after whom it is nicknamed.

Street food central

In the thick of Rattanakosin, one of Bangkok's oldest districts, the area around Phraeng Bhuthorn Road is home to some of the city's most legendary street food institutions. If you're an adventurous eater, start at Samong Moo Thai Tham, famous for its bowls of pork broth loaded with crispy fish skin, innards and melt-in-the-mouth ... pig brain. A few doors down, a meal at Udom Pochana requires less courage. The stars on the menu of this decades-old restaurant are creamy Chinese-style curry, made with stewed beef and served over rice, and fresh spring rolls drizzled with spicy gravy and flecked with succulent crab meat. Cool down with a bowl of corn-topped coconut ice-cream at Nuttaporn, arguably the best place in town for this classic Thai dessert.

Vintage design studio

There are few better places to rummage through vintage goods than Papaya Studio, a furniture depot in the far-flung Lat Phrao suburb. You name it, they probably have it - in multiple shapes and sizes: lifelike Star Wars figures, pompous rococo mirrors, chinoiserie vases, classic Eames chairs - organised by era and function in one of the many warehouses or mock living rooms. The collection is brought together by Mr Tong, a long-time antique dealer and respected figure in the city's design scene. While all items are technically for sale, the hefty price tags discourage potential buyers; instead, they're often rented out for films or photo shoots. Admission is free but those toting professional camera equipment are asked to make a small donation.

Fab 40s restaurant

Stepping inside Muslim Restaurant feels like stepping back in time. The interior of this Islamic-Thai eatery in the multicultural Bang Rak district hasn't changed a bit since it opened in the 1940s. With its wooden booths, sky-blue walls and faded family portraits, it's as charming as it is photogenic. People don't just come here for the old world atmosphere, though - the food is fantastic. My personal favourites include roti mataba, a flaky pocket of beef and spices; and sup hang wua, spicy oxtail soup with a nice tang to it. Drop by on a Monday or Friday for their signature khao mok phae, a fragrant mutton biryani with falling-off-the-bone goat meat hidden under a pile of bright yellow rice. Best of all, a full meal with multiple curries, snacks, and drinks will only set you back a couple of pounds.

Bangkok's green lung

A short rickety boat ride from Bangkok's business district, Ban Krachao - also known as ""the green lung"" - is a welcome respite from the busy streets. This small peninsula in a horseshoe bend of the Chao Phraya river is home to a patchwork of banana plantations, dense jungle, and small villages. Only the occasional sight of the city's skyline shimmering through the dense foliage reminds you that you're still in the middle of one of Asia's most sprawling metropolises. It's best discovered by bicycle (available at the arrival jetty, £2.30 for a full day or £1.20 an hour), which allows you to pedal the stilted pathways meandering through mangrove forests and local backyards. While simply getting lost here is an adventure in itself, it's worth plotting the Sri Nakhon Khuean Khan Park and the Bang Namphueng floating market on your map.

Unique Chinese mansion

Hidden in a maze of alleyways in Talad Noi (a workers' district bordering Chinatown), stately Sol Heng Tai Mansion is one of the last remaining traditional Chinese houses in the city. Built by a notable Hokkien family some 200 years ago, the structure consists of four wings surrounding a courtyard, all in traditional Hokkien style. Passed down through eight generations, it still functions as a family residence. The current residents operate a diving school (including a four-metre deep pool) and a beagle breeding kennel on the premises. Parts of the house have seen better days. (Sadly, its owners don't receive financial support from the government to help restore it - the city is notoriously indifferent about preserving heritage buildings). Visitors are encouraged to order something from the makeshift coffee shop as a way of contributing.

A taste of the north

In a district dominated by glitzy restaurants and mall food courts, Gedhawa stands out for its quirky decor and unfussy atmosphere. In a quiet alley off Sukhumvit Road (the area's main thoroughfare), this small eatery is packed with northern Thai prayer flags, Lanna-style wood carvings, and retro knick knacks against a backdrop of shocking pink walls. The handwritten menu focuses mostly on northern Thai fare - a rarity in Bangkok - such as the classic khao soi (curry noodle soup) and the nam prik num, a northern Thai chilli dip served with boiled vegetables. Despite its ""hidden gem"" appearance, it's popular with the area's large Japanese community, so call ahead (+66 2 662 0501) to secure a table.

Classic neighbourhood cafe

Recent years have seen hipster cafes pop up like mushrooms in Bangkok. And while exposed-brick walls, bare light bulbs and letter-board menus are all the rage, few cafes can drum up to the atmosphere that Kope Hya Tai Kee, opened in 1953, exudes. There's no hipster-chic here; instead, the place is littered with marble-top tables, old-school tea boxes and black-and-white photos of the original owners. It's usually packed with uncles chatting the day away in Teochew dialect. They're friendly, and you're more than welcome to join them over a cup of kafe boran, a robust brew served with generous helpings of sugar and sweetened milk. Simple ""American style"" breakfasts are served here, too. Try the signature kai kata, with fried eggs, sweet Chinese sausage, ground pork and peas alongside a slice of buttered toast.

Riverside drinking den

A ramshackle drinking den in the shadow of the Shangri-La Hotel, Jack's Bar is a favourite with local chefs, in-the-know tourists and expats. And for good reason: the combination of prime river views, cheap drinks and an unpretentious atmosphere is hard to beat. Perched on a stilted platform over the water, it's a perfect spot to watch the river with a cold beer (drink it the Thai way, poured over ice, as there is no air-conditioning to cool you down). And come hungry if you're a fan of no-frills, authentic Thai food. The seafood-centric menu covers the usual classics and harder-to-find southern dishes that pack a spicy punch. Chef's recommendations are the stir-fried stink beans with shrimp, and the khua kling, a peppery dry curry with minced pork and lemongrass.

Old-style B&B

This pastel colonial villa in the Surasak district was once surrounded by fruit orchards and canals. Fast-forward 70 years and it's now sandwiched between buzzing expressways - but hasn't lost a pinch of charm. It now houses Baan Pra Nond, a homey B&B operated by the granddaughter of the villa's original owner (whose portrait is the centrepiece of the living room). It's a far cry from the luxury digs around the corner, but what it misses in amenities, it makes up with heaps of old-world charm and genuinely friendly service.

Best time to go

Bangkok is busy year-round but especially so at Songran (Thai New Year), in mid-April. January and February are good times to visit, when the sun shines but the hottest weather hasn't yet set in. September and October are the rainiest months.

294,the guardian,http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/dec/19/central-america-migrants-us-foreign-policy,"Jakelin Caal Maquín, the seven-year-old Guatemalan girl who died this month in US custody, is the latest victim of a long, dysfunctional relationship between the US and its southern neighbours that has cost countless lives over the past half century.

The forces driving ordinary people to leave their homes and put their lives at risk crossing deserts with smugglers to get to the US border are deeply rooted in Central America's history of inequality and violence, in which the US has long played a defining role.

The flow of migrants trying to cross the border illegally is not all blowback from US foreign policy. Much of the poverty, injustice and murder in El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras is homegrown, harking back to the age of Spanish conquest. Small criminal elites have long prospered at the expenses of the populations.

Experts on the region argue, however, that when politicians or activists have come forward on behalf of its dispossessed, the US has consistently intervened on the side of the powerful and wealthy to help crush them, or looked the other way when they have been slaughtered.

The families in the migrant caravans trudging towards the US border are trying to escape a hell that the US has helped to create.

Sometimes it has been a matter of unintended consequences. Enforcement measures targeting migrants have multiplied the cost of smugglers' services. Desperate customers take out big loans at high interest in order to pay. The only hope of paying off those loans is to reach the US, so even if they fail at their quest, they have no choice but to try again, and again.

""Where it used to cost around $1,000 to make the journey from Central America, it now costs up to $12,000, making shuttle migration impossible,"" said Elizabeth Oglesby, an associate professor at the centre for Latin American studies at the University of Arizona in Tucson. ""The only way for families to stay together is for women and children to migrate.""

More often US intervention in the affairs of these small and weak states has been deliberate, motivated by profit or ideology or both.

""The destabilisation in the 1980's - which was very much part of the US Cold War effort - was incredibly important in creating the kind of political and economic conditions that exist in those countries today,"" said Christy Thornton, a sociologist focused on Latin America at Johns Hopkins University.

Guatemala

Jakelin Amei Rosmery Caal Maquín, who died of septic shock and cardiac arrest in US border patrol custody, came from Alta Verapaz, in the northern Guatemala highlands, where small-scale farmers are being driven off their land to make way for agro-industry producing sugar and biofuels.

It is an example of why it is often hard to distinguish between security and economic reasons for migration. The men behind the land grabs are often active or retired military officers, who are deeply involved in organised crime.

""When communities fight back against land-grabbing, their leaders can be killed. We've seen just in the past year almost two dozen community leaders assassinated,"" Oglesby said. ""There is a legacy of impunity.""

Guatemala's long civil war can in turn be traced back to a 1954 coup against a democratically-elected president, Jacobo Árbenz, which was backed by the US. Washington backed the Guatemalan military, which was responsible for genocide against the native population. An estimated 200,000 people were killed between 1960 and 1996.

""The point was to root out anything that looked like communist subversion, but it was really a scorched earth policy against the indigenous people,"" Thornton said.

The issue of impunity for violence remains central to Guatemala's chronic problems. Jimmy Morales, a former comedian and the country's president since 2016, has announced he is going to close down the UN-backed International Committee against Impunity in Guatemala (Cicig). Cicig has investigated corruption cases against Morales, his family and his political patrons, and links between organised crime and politicians like himself.

In September Cicig headquarters were surrounded by US-donated military jeeps, but there was no complaint from the Trump White House. On Tuesday, the government announced it was withdrawing diplomatic immunity from 11 Cicig workers.

El Salvador

El Salvador is also trapped in a cycle of violence that can be traced back to a civil conflict in which the US was a protagonist, training and funding rightwing death squads in the name of fighting communism.

""The civil war really destroyed the economic base of the country and any sense of a functioning democracy,"" said Thornton. ""It left a massively militarised society.""

Gangs have filled much of the space occupied by civil society in healthier societies, but they too are largely a US import. The MS-13 gang, frequently referred to by Donald Trump in justification of his hardline immigration policies, was formed in Los Angeles, and introduced into El Salvador when its members were deported - often to a country they barely knew: another instance of unintended consequences which have rubbed salt in the Central America's wounds.

Honduras

When Manuel Zelaya, Honduras reformist president, was seized by the country's military in 2009, and flown out of the country to Costa Rica, still in his pajamas, the Obama administration refused to call it a coup.

Hillary Clinton, the secretary of state at the time, argued that to do so would have meant cutting aid at the expense of the Honduran poor. In the first edition of her memoir, Hard Choices, she admitted working with other Latin American governments to ensure Zelaya would not return to power. The references to her role were removed in later editions.

Zelaya had been trying to resolve conflicts over land, pitting local campesinos against agro-industry. After the coup, that conflict was militarised and over a hundred campesinos were murdered. Organised crime spread through the country's institutions and the murder rate soared. Within a year, Honduras was the most violent country in the world not actually at war.

The current president, Juan Orlando Hernández, has further militarised the police force. When he looked in danger of losing his re-election bid last year, he unleashed a wave of violence against the opposition and extinguished the challenge. The Trump administration congratulated him on his victory.

""These societies were poor and violent irrespective of when the United States became involved in a major way,"" Cynthia Arnson, the director of the Latin American Programme at the Wilson Centre thinktank, said. But she added: ""The US since the very early stages of the Cold War has played a defining role in the evolution of state violence."""
295,the guardian,http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/dec/21/us-immigration-policy-2018-travel-ban-migrant-caravan,"Trump administration sought to redefine legal immigration from the 'travel ban' to family separations, leaving some with 'no hope'

Children torn from parents, refugees turned away and a relentless stream of changes to immigration regulation and enforcement.

To those who champion Donald Trump and believe cracking down on immigration translates to better lives for Americans, 2018's breathless headlines were a fulfillment of campaign promises. To many others, they are inhumane, counterproductive and harken back to dark moments in US history.

""This is our generation's sort of existential moment,"" said Frank Sharry, head of pro-immigration group America's Voice. ""Are we going to continue to be a nation that practices 'e pluribus unum' [the US motto that means 'out of many, one'] and welcomes people from around the world to make this country better? Or are we going to shut the door?""

Throughout 2018, the answer has largely been the latter.

Even as those living in the US unlawfully remain targets, the administration has sought to redefine what legal immigration looks like, too, slowing or halting those seeking to come to the country for a job offer, through their relationship to a citizen, or to find a home as a refugee or asylee.

""There has been this constant chip, chip, chipping away at the legal immigration system using every tool of the executive branch,"" said Doug Rand, who worked in the Obama administration before helping found Boundless Immigration, which helps people navigate the immigration system.

Trump's so-called ""travel ban"", the first iteration of which was unveiled in the president's first week in office, was upheld in June by the US supreme court, stopping most visas for residents of Libya, Iran, Somalia, Syria, Yemen, North Korea and Venezuela.

It's had very real consequences for people such as Soolmaz Dadgari, an Iranian who came to the US in 2017 so her four-year-old daughter, Arina, could take part in an experimental study to treat a rare genetic disorder. Dadgari's husband has been unable to get a visa to join them, and sanctions make it hard for him to send money. She alone cares for a child who can't walk or talk and requires 24-hour help, as well as another 11-year-old daughter.

""I have no hope,"" said Dadgari.

Though global wars, persecution and famine have persisted, the US capped refugee admissions at 45,000 for the fiscal year that ended 30 September, the lowest ceiling since the state department began tracking the figure in 1980. Far fewer were actually admitted in that time frame about 21,000 refugees and the number is likely to fall further, with the cap for the current fiscal year set at 30,000.

Meantime, tens of thousands fleeing violence in Central America sought asylum in the US this year. The Trump administration responded by narrowing who is eligible, declaring that neither those escaping gang violence or domestic abuse nor those who cross the border illegally qualify. Both changes have been blocked by federal courts.

""I don't know what to do,"" said Ivis Munoz, a 26-year-old coffee farmer from Altima, Honduras, who joined a caravan heading to the US in October after a gang member shot him and threatened to kill him. He planned to seek asylum but learned along his journey he was unlikely to be accepted. For now, he remains in Mexico. ""I want to go to the United States, though I'm scared they'll send me back. I'm afraid to be in Honduras, but I don't feel safe here either.""

More than any other shift in policy, the Trump administration's move to separate apprehended migrant children and parents shook people around the world. Though Trump eventually ended widespread use of the practice, scars remain.

Evelin Roxana Meyer and her family have struggled financially, so her husband set off for the US in hopes of finding work, bringing their son along. They were picked up by border patrol agents and separated, with the father deported and the son spending four months in detention. He turned 12 alone at a Texas facility, and the once-affectionate boy returned home angry in September. He rarely goes out, spending most of his time in his room watching TV. He's refused to go to school and will have to repeat the sixth grade. He talks back to his parents and hits his little sister.

""This was the toughest year of all,"" said 38-year-old Meyer.

Many who support Trump, though, see hope in the president's actions.

Neil Gouveia came to the US from Guyana as a seven-year-old and considered himself a ""liberal New Yorker"" until 2016, when he was drawn to Trump for what he believed was his strength on national security. He thinks the year's action on immigration will ultimately lead to greater dialogue and better policies, and he still believes America stands as a beacon for much of the world.

""People will say what they want to say about America, but there's hardly anyone who still wouldn't want to come here,"" said Gouveia, 39, a collegiate fundraiser. ""They still know it's like winning the lottery.""

Daniel Stein, who heads the Federation for American Immigration Reform, which supports restrictive immigration measures, believes the year's imagery has moved more people to his side of the debate. To those who see an extended assault on a cornerstone American value, he's unmoved.

""They have a vivid imagination,"" Stein said. ""We have one of the world's most generous immigration programs."""
296,the guardian,http://www.theguardian.com/science/2019/jan/12/psychology-of-group-reasoning-versus-individual,"We all cling to beliefs despite the evidence. Immersive theatre experience The Justice Syndicate aims to show why

""It's her word against his,"" says a middle-aged male juror in thick-rimmed glasses. ""Someone of his experience wouldn't do something so risky."" A woman to my right says the defendant is probably guilty, but maybe not beyond reasonable doubt. ""But why would she lie?"" asks another female juror.

Eleven strangers and I are discussing whether renowned children's surgeon Simon Huxtable tried to rape Sally Hodges, the mother of a former patient. She says he tried to kiss her and then force himself on her. Huxtable says Hodges made up the allegation after he spurned her advances. Mobile phone records show he was at her home for 26 minutes but he told police he was there for only 10. His browsing history reveals he has an interest in rape porn.

I fiddle with a yellow label that says I'm juror number 11. Except I'm not really. The witnesses are actors, and we've been watching their testimonies on tablets at the Herbert Art Gallery and Museum in Coventry. The case is fictional, but shared pretence is engaging and our deliberations become heated.

The Justice Syndicate is part interactive play, part psychology experiment developed by audience-centric Newcastle theatre group FanSHEN and Kris De Meyer, a neuroscientist at King's College London. It explores how we form and change opinions, our tendency to stick to initial instincts and how groups influence our views. De Meyer hopes that data gathered during the shows and their immersive nature will generate new insights into human decision-making.

It's a subject we surely need to understand better. On Monday, protesters jostled and yelled at Tory MP Anna Soubry in Westminster, calling her a ""fascist"" and ""scum"" because of her pro-Remain stance. Across the Atlantic, divisions appeared to deepen still further as Donald Trump and leading Democrats traded insults over his demands for a wall on the Mexican border. The increasingly polarised and hostile nature of public discourse raises important questions. If humans have the capacity for reason, why do we make so many bad decisions? How come people cling to extreme or irrational views in the face of facts? And can psychological insights lead to better, more rational decisions?

The starting point for many who grapple with these questions, including those behind The Justice Syndicate, is the work in the 1950s of American social psychologist Leon Festinger. Based on a basic human desire to be consistent, Festinger said we compare ourselves to others to evaluate our own opinions and abilities, and that those in groups with diverging opinions will either seek to move towards consensus, ostracise individuals with opposing views or form entrenched factions.

He also outlined how, when humans hold contradictory ideas, or their actions conflict with their beliefs, they suffer a form of mental discomfort called cognitive dissonance. His PhD student Elliot Aronson fleshed this concept out, showing how this is especially likely to lead to poor decision-making when it concerns something that is important to our self-image. ""If I see myself as someone who is smart, competent and kind, and you give me some information that I have done something foolish, immoral or hurtful, I have a choice,"" says US social psychologist Carol Tavris, co-author with Aronson of Mistakes Were Made (But Not By Me). ""I can revise my view of myself, or I can dismiss the evidence. Most people take the least painful path and dismiss the evidence.""

These pressures can lead to confirmation bias - the tendency to pay attention only to information that confirms our existing beliefs. It is perhaps the best known of human biases. During the 1970s, Nobel prizewinning psychologist Daniel Kahneman outlined a series of other mental shortcuts that can lead us astray. The ""availability heuristic"", for example, may mistakenly convince us that car travel is safer than flying. A £100 pair of jeans might seem like a bargain if reduced from £200, even if they cost £2 to make, thanks to the ""anchoring effect"". And the ""representativeness heuristic"" can mislead gamblers into thinking they are due a win following a string of statistically unrelated losses. Kahneman went on to outline how the brain uses rapid, intuitive processes to make some decisions and slow, more conscious and deliberative processes for others.

Some argue our cognitive biases only look strange if we see human reasoning individualistically. French cognitive psychologists Hugo Mercier and Dan Sperber argue in their 2017 book The Enigma of Reason that as highly social animals, we are deeply concerned with appearing to be wise, competent and trustworthy to others. Our reasoning capabilities therefore evolved not to reach the most logical solutions to problems but to help us argue our case and justify our positions. ""We are constantly justifying ourselves and seeking to persuade others that we are the kind of person they want to cooperate with,"" says Mercier, of the Jean Nicod Institute in Paris. ""From this perspective, it makes no sense to hold on to arguments that contradict your point of view, but it does make sense to have a confirmation bias.""

In a 2015 study, Mercier asked participants to tackle a series of reasoning tasks, and provide justifications for their choices. When later asked to evaluate their own statements disguised as those of others, more than half disagreed with themselves.

Political polarisation has been a hot topic since 2016, the year Britain voted to leave the EU and Donald Trump moved into the White House. De Meyer, however, has been tracking the phenomenon since George W Bush's narrow victory in the 2000 presidential election, through the rise of the Tea Party movement, anti-Barack Obama sentiment and the rumbling acrimony over climate change.

Aware of the insights psychology had to offer, he and film-maker Sheila Marshall produced the 2016 documentary Right Between Your Ears, which featured American Christian radio host Harold Camping and his followers, who believed that God would gather up his chosen few and then destroy the Earth with huge earthquakes on 21 October, 2011. It captures the intensity of the cognitive dissonance suffered by believers, who had left their jobs and sold their homes, on realising the end had not in fact been nigh.

There have been some 20 Justice Syndicate shows since early 2017. The software on which it runs also gathers research data, tracking how consistent participants are when asked three times during the piece which way they are leaning, and how long they view pieces of evidence for. An initial analysis of recent shows found that almost half of participants failed to change their initial leanings at all, despite the introduction of new evidence.

""Individuals take very different views on what bits of information are important,"" says Joe McAlister, the computational artist who developed the software. ""It's taught me that people have a lot of different and unusual biases, which is fascinating but also quite terrifying."" The allegations of sexual assault made against Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein and US judge Brett Kavanaugh both affected Justice Syndicate debates and verdicts. McAlister says younger participants have focused more strongly on issues of consent.

Recent failures to repeat experiments that support important concepts in psychology have led to a loss of confidence in the discipline. Some blamed the use of highly artificial decision-making tasks for this ""reproducibility crisis"". De Meyer believes interactive theatre can produce more realistic results. ""It allows us to recreate something with a certain level of realism, and opens up doors to do psychological research in a new way that we couldn't do 20 years ago.""

Others seem to agree. In December, De Meyer and FanSHEN produced a new piece, commissioned by the Cabinet Office, to probe people's reactions to a national power grid failure. Work on a scenario about someone dying due to medical negligence will begin next month. De Meyer wants to use the format to study why people are more likely to blame those of different ethnic groups to themselves for errors.

He also hopes his work can help explain rising political polarisation. Research by US thinktank the Pew Research Centre shows a growing gulf in the views of Republicans and Democrats on key topics such as race, the environment and the role of government. Another study shows Americans increasingly dislike or even loathe those who support the party they themselves oppose.

Many blame social media for fanning the flames of division. ""The way people use social media and select their own online news sources keeps them in their own little confirmation bias bubbles,"" says Tavris. ""Tweets go viral when they really resonate with a group or really anger a group,"" says De Meyer. ""Social media seems to be amplifying existing divisions and probably making them worse.""

Psychology offers insights, both to individuals who want to make better decisions by learning about their own reasoning powers, and those seeking the secrets of persuading others. In a 2014 study, Mercier and colleagues found only 22% of participants could solve a reasoning task on their own, but when small groups discussed their thinking, this rose to 63%. ""If people are reasoning on their own or only with people they agree with, nine times out of 10 they will stick to biased positions and you are going to get polarisation,"" he says. ""But if you take a group of people with some kind of common incentive but who disagree about something, then reason can help them get a better answer.""

Back in our mock jury room, and an initial show of hands reveals that, after hearing the evidence, we see Simon Huxtable as guilty by a slim majority or 7-5. ""She was drunk and upset,"" argues juror number four, a young male. ""But what would she have to do for people to believe her?"" asks a female jury member, who adds a not guilty verdict would send out the wrong message to other victims. ""His sexual fantasies, however extreme, are irrelevant,"" says a male juror. ""We need to focus on the facts of the case.""

Another vote shows that 10 minutes of discussion has shifted opinion to 7-5 for not guilty.

At this point, I notice a matriarchal juror across the table is speaking both frequently and sensibly and that many participants are looking in her direction when they speak. She is arguing with increasing conviction that the evidence against Simon Huxtable is merely circumstantial. A short while later, we vote again, reaching a not guilty verdict by 10-2. During a debriefing session, Dan Barnard of FanSHEN describes some or the psychological concepts underpinning the show and encourages us to consider how they affected our decisions.

The show's creators believe greater understanding of the mental triggers that affect our own decisions and those of others could help us all become a little more open-minded, tolerant and rational. ""The most powerful form of learning is experiential,"" says De Meyer. ""My hope is that by making people aware of how they are thinking and behaving, it helps them to deal with real situations in which emotions and instincts might otherwise take over.""

The Justice Syndicate is running on 9 February at the National Justice Museum, Nottingham; 11-23 February at the Battersea Arts Centre, London; and 14 April at the Pleasance theatre, Edinburgh as part of the Edinburgh international science festival

Good morning, I'm Tim Walker, signing off for 2018 with today's essential stories. The briefing will be back with all of next year's most important and interesting news and features from 7 January. In the meantime, have a very happy holiday season.

Top story: has the last proverbial adult left the White House?

The US defense secretary, James Mattis, has said he will step down a day after Donald Trump announced the withdrawal of US forces from Syria, and amid reports he has also ordered the return of half of the American troops in Afghanistan. Trump described Mattis's exit as a ""retirement"", but the general's resignation letter suggested his decision came as a result of irreconcilable policy differences. Observers fear Mattis was the last of Trump's top officials with the heft to restrain his more dangerous tendencies.

'A second 9/11'. The Republican senator Lindsey Graham has said if Trump goes ahead with plans to withdraw more than 5,000 of the 14,000 US troops in Afghanistan, he will be ""paving the way toward a second 9/11"".

Wrong man, right move? While Trump's Syria decision has angered many Republicans, pundits and foreign allies, Trevor Timm says it's right to end an indefinite, under-reported and counter-productive US occupation.

Shutdown back on as Trump reiterates border demands

Having backed down on Wednesday from his demand that Congress fund his passion project, the US-Mexico border wall, Trump on Thursday vowed not to sign the Senate's stopgap funding bill after all, sending the government lurching back towards a shutdown. The house scrambled to pass a remade spending bill that includes $5.7bn for border security, but it is unclear whether the Senate can review and pass the legislation and get it to the president's desk before the deadline of midnight on Friday.

Media manipulation. Trump's change of heart came after stinging criticism from conservative commentators including Ann Coulter and Rush Limbaugh, both supporters of the wall.

Shutdown breakdown. What exactly would the partial government shutdown entail? Erin Durkin explains.

Flights resume at London Gatwick after drone disruption

A small number of flights started taking off from London Gatwick, the UK's second-largest airport, on Friday morning, after 36 hours of unprecedented disruption caused by one or more drones being flown close to the runway. 110,000 passengers had their flights grounded on Thursday, and at least 100 of Friday's 753 scheduled flights are also expected to be cancelled. Police have yet to identify the drone or its operator, but the UK transport secretary said the perpetrator will face a substantial jail sentence if caught.

Environmental protest? The airport closure was welcomed by local campaigners against aircraft noise, and police said it was possible the drone attack could be an environmental protest.

Can criminal justice reform rehabilitate Kushner?

The president's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, has become accustomed to negative headlines about his conflicts of interest, his close relationship with the controversial Saudi regime and his naive approach to forging peace in the Middle East. But he has earned praise on all sides for his work on the First Step Act, a meaningful overhaul of criminal justice and a personal issue for the son of a convicted felon. Is it enough to salvage his reputation? David Smith reports.

Bipartisan effort. Kushner, Ivanka Trump's husband, enlisted the help of the ACLU, the Koch brothers' network, former Obama adviser Van Jones and Kim Kardashian West in garnering support for the criminal justice bill.

Many scientists have concluded that the best way for individuals to combat climate change is by eating less meat, given the vast impact of the livestock industry on the natural environment. Our writers explain how to go meat-free without alienating friends and family, and offer a selection of satisfying vegetarian and vegan recipes.

How the UAE is profiting from civil war in Yemen

Saudi Arabia may be taking the blame for the bloodiness of Yemen's civil war, but the most aggressive member of their coalition against the Houthi rebels is the UAE. Ghaith Abdul-Ahad reports on how a small, ambitious nation is using the world's worst humanitarian crisis to project its power on the region.

The hi-vis vest becomes a symbol of protest beyond France

Since the gilets jaunes protests began in France in October, the hi-vis yellow vest has become a symbol of protest from Canada to Iraq. Jon Henley explains how the cheap garments have given their wearers' grievances higher visibility around the world.

Robert Morrison has spent more than three decades working at a Siemens-owned turbine plant in Burlington, Iowa, which will close its doors forever on Friday at the cost of 125 jobs. When he visited the town in 2015, Trump vowed to bring jobs back. That, writes Morrison, was ""another damned lie"".

Trump promised to save our jobs and fight for workers. But he's done nothing to stop the layoffs. In fact, he's made the problem worse.

Sport

For his first game in charge of Manchester United, caretaker manager Ole Gunnar Solskjær will return to Cardiff City, the club that sacked him in 2014. That's one of 10 things to watch out for amid this weekend's Premier League action.

Until recently, the Cleveland Browns were an NFL punchline. But now, thanks in large part to their quarterback, Baker Mayfield, the Browns are back in the game, writes Oliver Connolly.

298,the guardian,http://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/dec/20/ladies-and-gentlemen-we-got-him-the-evolution-of-one-of-2018s-best-memes,"Fifteen years ago, the American head of the post-invasion Iraqi government, Paul Bremer, made the biggest announcement of his life.

A day earlier, US forces had captured Saddam Hussein. On 14 December 2003, Bremer called the cameras in, stood before the world and said: ""Ladies and gentlemen, we got him.""

The footage, nearly 15 years to the day, is now part of the internet's newest meme. But it has little to do with the 2003 invasion, the fallout or Bremer himself.

""Ladies and gentlemen we got him"" (or ""Ladies and gentlemen we got 'em"") has become a video format which rolls in whenever someone gets pranked or owned online; it's soundtracked by the song Baby I'm Yours, a 2010 minor hit by French musician Breakbot.

And like all good memes, it manages to be both beautifully simple and terribly complex.

On one hand, it's comedy 101. The opening images or video are the set-up; Bremer's announcement - that we have indeed ""got him"" - is the punchline. It's elementary. Viscerally funny. Isn't all humour, since time immemorial, really just ""we got him""?

But there's more confusing layers that do need explaining. The next thing that happens is a distorted, overly loud mix of the song - a staple of post-ironic meme humour. It's funny because it's bizarre.

Many, but not all, versions then add footage of Swat teams knocking down doors and swarming a house, to underline just how thoroughly the person has been rinsed.

According to website Know Your Meme, the idea was seeded in April, when a YouTube user used the Bremer clip - but with no music and no video editing - to make a joke about the song Despacito.

Once combined with Breakbot, the meme began to take off in the middle of the year.

In one example from July, someone tricked the popular video game streamer Ninja by referencing ""ligma"" - a mysterious but fictional disease in the ""updog"" mould.

Another roasted Jordan Peterson for failing to name any - any - female author.

And in a beautiful coincidence, the meme picked up steam as it neared the 15th anniversary of the original 2003 clip.

Bremer told the Daily Beast in October his granddaughter noticed he had become a meme, and showed him.

""I'm not a meme guy,"" he said. ""So I was watching them with great curiosity ... Many times I couldn't figure out what the connection was with the announcement. How are the words fitting into the memes?""

But nevertheless its popularity grew.

It became especially popular in Australia at the end of the year, meshing perfectly with the political madness of 2018.

Examples included Victorian MP Tim Wilson's fight on Twitter about whether or not he was a member of ""the government"":

Dave Sharma's Wentworth byelection loss:

And the 15th anniversary of Mark Latham's election as Labor leader:

As we move further away from its origins and the cultural memory of the Iraq war, what happens next is up for debate.

Younger meme-makers may find it increasingly less funny. Or a major political party will undoubtedly use it and it will die. But there's reason to believe it will stick around, at least in some form.

""We got him"" seems to be, at least in America, deeply embedded in the collective psyche.

Barack Obama said it when navy seals shot Osama bin Laden in 2011 (""Looks like we got him""), and the mayor of Boston uttered it when they captured Boston marathon bomber Dzhokhar Tsarnaev in 2013.

Either of these could have easily been used instead of Bremer's remarks - and perhaps they will be used in some future iteration - but the randomness of his appearance in the original meme is part of its beautiful humour. It doesn't matter who Bremer is, or if people remember why he said it. All we know, and all that matters, is that we got him."
299,the guardian,http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jan/06/star-spangled-shutdown-nationalism-nationalization-us-politics,"Three new books help us understand how Trump's spat with Democrats over 1,000th of one percent of the federal budget came to be so weighted with meaning

As I write, the federal government sits in partial shutdown, ostensibly over a measly $3.7bn difference in funding, less than one 1,000th of one percent of the 2019 federal budget, for construction of a wall along the US-Mexico border.

Three books can help us understand how nationalist passions and the nationalization of campaign communications and media coverage led to this point. Nationalism and nationalization warp the practice of American politics. World history is replete with examples of how nationalism has debased democratic preferences, corrupted republican values such as liberty and the rule of law, and provoked violence and war. The shutdown - the third in one year and the second over immigration - is an ill omen for the ""exceptional"" nation.

In The Nationalist Revival: Trade, Immigration, and the Revolt Against Globalization, John Judis, a respected Washington analyst, defines nationalism as a social psychology instead of an ideological ""ism"". Unlike those who prefer to restrict the word to its negative connotations and use ""patriotism"" for positive references to love of country, Judis writes that nationalism underwrites both xenophobia and helping fellow citizens in need. He quotes psychologist Joshua Searle-White: ""Nationalism provides us with a way ... [sic] to feel moral, right, and just. It gives us a way to join with others in a heroic struggle. It gives a sense of purpose and meaning to our lives, and even our deaths.""

Judis contends that we are all paying a price for the failure of recent political leaders, Bill Clinton above all, to take the depths of nationalist passion into sufficient account while promoting globalization, which he deftly summarizes as being for free trade, mobile capital, floating exchange rates and unskilled immigration. Judis shows how policy errors and economic pressures combined to elicit reactionary movements in western democracies; he is particularly good on nationalist surges in Germany, Hungary and Poland. In those countries and the US, nationalist leaders have fanned popular feelings of economic abandonment, cultural degradation and abject terror through rhetoric that also stresses love of and pride in country.

Daniel Hopkins is a rising-star political scientist at the University of Pennsylvania. In The Increasingly United States: How and Why American Political Behavior Nationalized, he shows how and why the politics of the US has been nationalized in two ways. First, the electoral relevance of state and local issues has receded in voters' minds. Second, voter (and, crucially, donor) participation has been spurred mainly through the promulgation of nationwide party agendas. American voters have told pollsters they believe more gets done that affects their lives at the sub-national levels of government - yet they remain fixated on who the president is and what he says and does with respect to Congress and the supreme court.

This is a political science text, but Hopkins keeps the jargon to a minimum and has a knack for literary quotations. He shows how votes for president and governor have become more aligned since the 1970s, and how local contexts have minimal impact on voters and poll respondents on issue after issue. For example, people living near nuclear power plants have not voted all that differently on funding new ones from those who live far away. The same goes for military spending and living near military bases. The book does not look at immigration, although the author has done so in a previous article and found that ""native-born white and black Americans adopt more anti-immigration views in response to an influx of immigrants only when immigration is a nationally salient issue"" - ie, when the president and media are talking about it.

The Hopkins and Judis books share a shortcoming: each underplays the inflammatory ingredient of racism. Judis notes how the election of Barack Obama challenged the ""Euro-American prototype"" at the core of many Americans' conception of their personal-partisan-national identity. Yet he limited his interviews to six white working-class men in Ohio who voted for Donald Trump. Hopkins treats race, ethnicity and religion as variables without paying special attention to them.

To judge from their bibliographies as well as their arguments, neither Hopkins nor Judis consulted Gary Gerstle's American Crucible: Race and Nation in the Twentieth Century, which was first published in 2001 and had a second edition 16 years later. It is a superb interpretation of American cultural and political history. Gerstle, who teaches at Princeton, depicts a central tension between two traditional conceptions of the US as a nation. ""Civic nationalists"" have seen America as unified by an aspirational and foundational creed that people from around the world should embrace and, once melted into the pot, uphold in their politics. ""Racial nationalists"" have regarded the founders as Wasps, and strive to preserve a code and ethos to which immigrants must pledge allegiance.

As Gerstle tells it, Clinton and George W Bush professed a hybrid ""soft multiculturalism"" that Obama embodied in his lineage. These three presidents faced a growing reaction to decades of non-white immigration as permitted by the 1965 and 1986 immigration laws. Birthers began assailing Obama's foreignness in 2008 and Trump picked up the charge in 2011. The ""madrassa/secret Muslim"" attacks on Obama imported post-9/11 emotions. By 2015, nearly a third of Americans and almost half of Republicans believed their president was Muslim. This became nationalist kindling wood for Trump's Muslim ban proposal after the San Bernardino shooting at the end of that year.

Coded attacks on his origins and ""political correctness"" put Obama on the defensive. Stymied by Congress, he turned to executive orders (notably Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals), which elicited cries of ""tyrant"". What kind of civic nationalist skirted the law like this, asked racial nationalists, rhetorically.

""It is possible to discern in [Trump],"" Gerstle concluded, ""a belief that America's Christian white majority ought to resume its role as the country's gatekeeper, and to set the terms by which nonwhites and non-Christians would be accepted into American life.""

This nationalist duality has intensified the battle over the border wall. The conflict is not really about the barrier's physical composition, length or cost. Rather, it is about which conception of the nation will prevail. To civic nationalists, locking out migrants betrays the creed they hold dear. Racial nationalists are convinced that people of color and Muslim faith are invaders bent on subverting their America, abetted by cosmopolitan elitists. These attitudes have been rolled into already polarized party identities. And because American voters are fixated on the national narrative, candidates, officials and mediated voices in every state must attend to the issue.

Since border concerns have exploded out of proportion, a compromise such as that sketched by Judis seems beyond attainment. He prescribes a path to citizenship for those undocumented migrants already in the country, stiff penalties on those who employ them and lowered admission quotas for legals while shifting the criteria away from family reunification toward needed skills. As Judis admits, that's a long shot. Just this month Trump (who may have employed undocumented migrants at his New Jersey golf club) threatened to close the entire border while blaming Democrats for the deaths of two children apprehended there.

The British political philosopher Bernard Crick, writing in 1962 in another book uncited by Hopkins and Judis, In Defense of Politics, argues that the best known antidote to the ill effects of nationalism rests ""not [in] how best and most elegantly to deplore it, but how to work with it so that it can be politicized"". In other words, national leaders should drain their invocations of American Dreams of racial and religious connotations, and perhaps of talk about the border altogether for a while.

We should watch for this as candidates for 2020 take the stage. What kind of America will they dream out loud, in what words and images? In her ""pre-announcement"" video, Senator Elizabeth Warren focused on economic fairness. As reactions to her formation of an exploratory committee wash across the nationalized communications grid, we will be able to discern how high the nationalist tide is running."
300,the guardian,http://www.theguardian.com/world/2019/jan/08/guatemalan-president-condemned-after-ejecting-un-anti-corruption-group,"Guatemala's president Jimmy Morales is facing international condemnation after announcing the expulsion of a United Nations-backed anti-corruption mission in what critics suspect is a calculated bid to shield the country's ruling elite - and himself - from investigation.

Addressing journalists in Guatemala City on Monday afternoon, Morales claimed the decision to eject members of the corruption-busting Commission Against Impunity in Guatemala (Cicig) group was a result of its ""severe violation"" of national and international laws.

""Cicig has put at risk the security of the nation, public order, governance, respect for human rights and above all the sovereignty of the state of Guatemala,"" the former television comic - who was elected partly thanks to a populist pledge to root out corruption - told reporters.

However, regional specialists believe Morales' move - which follows a long-running effort to neuter the anti-crime initiative - is in fact intended to help corrupt members of Guatemala's ruling economic and political elite escape scrutiny.

""What's driving this is the fact that the person sitting in the president's office is himself corrupt and is surrounded by a series of other corrupt individuals for whom the Cicig represents an existential threat,"" said Jo-Marie Burt, a Guatemala expert from the Washington Office on Latin America advocacy group.

Burt added: ""The president has been investigated and accused by Cicig of illicit campaign contributions ... he is backed by a corrupt business elite - and I think they are willing to go to any lengths to protect their interests and prevent themselves from being investigated and possibly going to jail.""

Mike Allison, a Central America specialist from the University of Scranton, agreed the move looked like an attempt ""to stop Cicig investigating the political and economic elite in the country, including Morales"".

There was no immediate evidence the commission was ""about to drop some bombshell against the president"". But it was clear Morales had grown uneasy that his political party, family members and he himself were now in the group's cross hairs, Allison added.

There was criticism too from Democratic party politicians in the United States, which helped create the commission just over a decade ago and had, until recently, been a crucial supporter of its work against organized crime and corruption.

Senator Patrick Leahy accused Morales of seeking to ""cripple"" the group's work with what he called a ""flagrant abuse of power"". ""It is a choice of self-interest over the public interest. Of impunity over justice. Of lies over truth. And it squarely contradicts the will of the Guatemalan people,"" Leahy said in a statement.

Congresswoman Norma Torres said Morales had spurned a historic opportunity to promote clean governance choosing instead ""to destroy the rule of law in order to save himself"".

Torres called the decision a victory for powerful criminals and corrupt politicians and attacked the Trump administration for failing to challenge Morales' attack on the anti-corruption body. ""[The US] has abandoned the Guatemalan people at the moment when they needed us most.""

Morales rode to power just over three years ago promising to battle corruption after a multi-million dollar corruption scandal that the UN-backed panel had itself helped uncover.

That scandal toppled former president General Otto Pérez Molina and paved the way for Morales' landslide victory in October 2015. His campaign slogan was ""ni corrupto ni ladrón"" - neither corrupt, nor a crook.

Allison said that during Barack Obama's presidency, Cicig - founded in 2006 to root out shadowy organized crime groups embedded within the Guatemalan state - had flourished.

""Cicig grew into one of the most effective arsenals in the fight against corruption and impunity in the region ... It was often talked about as a model that could perhaps be exported to Honduras or El Salvador.""

But under Donald Trump its work had been allowed to wither. ""The Trump administration I don't think had any interest in the effort that it needed to defend Cicig ... and at the same time are taking their signals from important Republicans"" who saw the group as part of a ""tool of the left"".

Burt said she was shocked at the White House's failure to challenge Morales over this week's move which she feared pushed the Central American country one step closer to becoming ""a full-on autocracy"".

""The reaction of the White House has been abysmal ... for the US to go from being a major support of Cicig to having no opinion about this latest arbitrary move by the state of Guatemala is astonishing ... Ideology is trumping pragmatic politics."""
301,the guardian,http://www.theguardian.com/news/2019/jan/10/we-the-people-the-battle-to-define-populism,"The noisy dispute over the meaning of populism is more than just an academic squabble - it's a crucial argument about what we expect from democracy. By Peter C Baker

More from this series: The new populism

When populism appears in the media, which it does more and more often now, it is typically presented without explanation, as if everyone can already define it. And everyone can, sort of - at least as long as they're allowed to simply cite the very developments that populism is supposed to explain: Brexit, Trump, Viktor Orbán's takeover of Hungary, the rise of Jair Bolsonaro in Brazil. The word evokes the long-simmering resentments of the everyman, brought to a boil by charismatic politicians hawking impossible promises. Often as not, populism sounds like something from a horror film: an alien bacteria that has somehow slipped through democracy's defences - aided, perhaps, by Steve Bannon or some other wily agent of mass manipulation - and is now poisoning political life, creating new ranks of populist voters among ""us"". (Tellingly, most writing about populism presumes an audience unsympathetic to populism.)

There is no shortage of prominent voices warning how dangerous populism is, and that we must take immediate steps to fight it. Tony Blair spends his days running the Institute for Global Change (IGC), an organisation founded, per its website, ""to push back against the destructive approach of populism"". In its 2018 world report, Human Rights Watch warned democracies of the world against ""capitulation"" to the ""populist challenge"". The rise of ""populist movements"", Barack Obama said in a speech last summer, had helped spark a global boom for the ""politics of fear and resentment and retrenchment"" that pave a path to authoritarianism. ""I am not being alarmist. I am just stating facts,"" Obama said.

When populism is framed this way, the implication is clear. All responsible citizens have a responsibility to do their part in the battle - to know populism when they see it, understand its appeal (but not fall for it), and support politics that stop populism in its tracks, thereby saving democracy as we know it. ""By fighting off the current infection,"" writes Yascha Mounk, until recently executive director of Blair's IGC and a prominent anti-populist writer, ""we might just build up the necessary antibodies to remain immune against new bouts of the populist disease for decades to come.""

But as breathless op-eds and thinktank reports about the populist menace keep piling up, they have provoked a sceptical backlash from critics who wonder aloud if populism even exists. It is now relatively common to encounter the idea that, just as there were no real witches in Salem, there are no real populists in politics - just people, attitudes and movements that the political centre misunderstands and fears, and wants you, reader, to fear too, although without the burden of having to explain exactly why. Populism, in this framing, is a bogeyman: a nonentity invoked for the purpose of stirring up fear. This argument has even made its way to the centrist mainstream. ""Let's do away with the word 'populist,'"" wrote the New York Times columnist Roger Cohen in July. ""It's become sloppy to the point of meaninglessness, an overused epithet for multiple manifestations of political anger. Worse, it's freighted with contempt, applied to all voters who have decided that mainstream political parties have done nothing for their static incomes or disappearing jobs or sense of national decline these past two decades.""

It is hard to deny that much talk of populism obscures more than it illuminates, and tells us more about anti-populist crusaders than any real live populist parties or voters. But long before populism became an object of transatlantic media fascination - before it became a zeitgeisty one-word explanation for everything - a small group of academics was studying it, trying to figure out exactly what it is and what lessons it holds for democratic politics. The debate they have produced is, like many academic debates, knotty and self-referential - and will always live in the shadow of the muddled media and political discourse. But it helps us see that the idea of populism is something more than just a centrist fairytale.

Thanks in large part to the persistent failure of governments across the west to enact anything resembling a credible vision of shared prosperity and security in the post-manufacturing era, we are now living through a time when familiar webs connecting citizens, ideologies and political parties are, if not falling apart, at least beginning to loosen and shift. As a result, the question of populism is not going away. The coming years are likely to include all of the following: more movements being labelled as populist, more movements calling themselves populist, more movements defensively insisting that they are not populist, and more conversations about the extent to which populism represents the problem or the solution.

The academic debate on populism shows us that making sense of this landscape requires more than just a usable definition of the P-word. In short, it shows us that we can't really talk about populism without talking about our conflicting conceptions of democracy - and the question of what it truly means for citizens to be sovereign.

It may be telling that very little of the public discussion of the alleged populist threat to democracy has been devoted to the workings of democracy itself. Perhaps we assume, without much thought, that democracy is such a self-explanatory idea that we already know all there is to know about the subject. Or perhaps we have come to regard democracy in its existing western form - basically liberal democracy - as the only possible endpoint for the evolution of politics. Populism, though it comes in many forms, always reminds us that nothing could be further from the truth.

In 2004 a young Dutch political scientist named Cas Mudde published The Populist Zeitgeist, a paper that proposed a new and concise definition of populism - one that would become the backbone of academic populism studies, a field that hardly existed at the time. Mudde was convinced that populism was a useful concept, which meant something more specific than ""democracy, but practised in a way that I find distasteful"". He was especially keen to challenge two common intuitions about populism: that it is uniquely defined by ""highly emotional and simplistic"" rhetoric, and that it primarily consists of ""opportunistic policies"" that aim to ""buy"" the support of voters.

Populism, Mudde argued, is more than just demagogy or opportunism. But it is not a fully formed political ideology like socialism or liberalism - it is instead a ""thin"" ideology, made up of just a few core beliefs. First: the most important division in society is an antagonistic one between ""the people"", understood to be fundamentally good, and ""the elite"", understood to be fundamentally corrupt and out of touch with everyday life. Second: all populists believe that politics should be an expression of the ""general will"" - a set of desires presumed to be shared as common sense by all ""ordinary people"". (Implicit in this belief is another: that such a thing as this ""general will"" exists.)

A populist movement, then, is one that consistently promises to channel the unified will of the people, and by doing so undercut the self-serving schemes of the elite establishment. As the National Front founder Jean-Marie Le Pen put it in 2007: ""I will give voice to the people. Because in democracy only the people can be right, and none can be right against them."" (Note how, in this formulation, there is no disagreement among ""the people"".) Or, in the more recent words of Donald Trump, speaking at his inauguration: ""We are transferring power from Washington DC and giving it back to you, the people ... The establishment protected itself, but not the citizens of our country."" (Note how members of ""the establishment"" are implicitly excluded from ""the citizens"".)

For decades, attempts at clear-headed conversations about populism had been stymied by the question of how it could be attributed to parties and politicians that were so obviously different: how can Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump, for example, both be called populist? In what way are Occupy Wall Street and Brexit both possible examples of populist phenomena? Mudde's simple definition caught on because it has no trouble answering this type of question. If populism is truly ideologically ""thin"", then it has to attach itself to a more substantial host ideology in order to survive. But this ideology can lie anywhere along the left-right spectrum. Because, in Mudde's definition, populism is always piggybacking on other ideologies, the wide variety of populisms isn't a problem. It's exactly what you would expect.

""The people"" and ""the elite"", Mudde wrote, are groupings with no static definition from one populist movement to another. These categories are, first and foremost, moral: people good, elites bad. The question of exactly who belongs in which group, though, depends on the character of the populist movement, and which ""thick"" ideology the populism ends up attached to. A populist ""people"" can define itself by an ethnic identity it feels is under threat, but just as easily by a shared sense of being victims of economic exploitation. What matters is that it blames a perceived class of corrupt elites; in the case of rightwing populisms, it may also heap scorn on some underclass, whether immigrants or racial minorities, whom the elites are accused of favouring with special treatment as part of their plot to keep power away from ""real people"".

When The Populist Zeitgeist was published, populism wasn't a hot topic: in all of 2005, Mudde's paper was cited only nine times. But as the field of populism studies has ballooned alongside mainstream interest in the subject, the paper has become widely recognised as a classic. By a wide margin, Mudde is now the populism scholar most likely to be cited or interviewed by journalists - as often as not, for articles in which his definition intermingles with the same old sloppy generalisations he set out to overturn.

Today, no academic disputes the dominance of Mudde's definition, especially among the growing number of scholars hoping to be part of the conversation about populism as a global phenomenon. One major factor in its success, in fact, is the way that it anticipated events in world politics. The market crashes of 2008 led to the emergence of anti-austerity movements - such as Podemos in Spain, Syriza in Greece, and Occupy worldwide - motivated by rage at financial institutions and the small class of people who benefited from their profits. These movements were obviously animated by a sense of opposition between ""the people"" and ""the elite"" - but old theories of populism that defined it specifically as rightwing, racist or anti-immigrant were insufficiently capacious to describe these new developments in populist politics.

The thin-ideology definition is also extremely congenial to the landscape of contemporary academic political science, which places a considerable premium on broad frameworks that enable young scholars to do empirical, quantitative work. Many new scholars of populism no longer feel the need to argue over definitions. Instead, they perform textual analyses designed to detect how often populism's core ideas, as laid out in Mudde's 2004 article, pop up in party platforms, political speeches, manifestos and tweets. Or they administer surveys designed to track the prevalence of the core tenets of populism in different populations, searching for profiles of archetypal populist voters.

Every time another paper relying on the ideological framework is published, it becomes a little more entrenched - a matter of some frustration to the minority of academics who still think it misses the point.

The rise of the thin-ideology definition, and its increasing influence in the still-ballooning public conversation about populism, has consistently provoked the objections of a small but persistent camp of dissenters within populism studies. These academics think defining populism in terms of core beliefs is a deep methodological error: many of them also think defining populism as an ideology runs the risk of making effective and worthwhile political strategies seem irresponsible, even dangerous.

These academics are likely to stress the extent to which mainstream political parties in the US and Europe have converged in recent decades, narrowing the range of opinions that find real purchase in national decision-making. They take as a given that this has swelled the ranks of people who feel that what gets called democracy responds to their concerns much less than it caters to the whims of a small, wealthy, self-dealing class of elites - elites who vigorously deny their own complicity in this state of affairs, often by insisting that there is no alternative.

As you might expect, these scholars tend to be most interested in challenges to the status quo that come from the left - from ""the 99%"" of Occupy Wall Street and the Sanders campaign, to the ""many not the few"" of Jeremy Corbyn's Labour party - and foreground an insistence that politics is not yet serving the correct constituency. They are also instinctively alert to the possibility that the self-preserving centre will try to defang outsider challenges by making anyone who endorses them appear unreasonable, frightening and constitutionally unequipped for the sober task of governance.

This makes them suspicious of any suggestion that there is an identifiable ideology called populism that has fundamental similarities no matter where on the political spectrum it appears. For this crowd, talk of an essence of populism - however thin - shades too easily into a charge of guilt by association, which inevitably has the effect of saddling leftwing populist movements (or even populist-looking movements) with the baggage of their xenophobic and racist rightwing counterparts. More specifically, they are likely to worry that the emphasis on exaggerated moralism as a defining feature of populism makes it too easy to depict legitimate opposition to elite power as irrational mobs.

Most objections to the thin-ideology definition owe a substantial debt to a duo of leftist political theorists: Chantal Mouffe, a Belgian who teaches at the University of Westminster, and her late husband, the Argentine Ernesto Laclau. Both thinkers have directly informed the new European left populist movements, including Syriza, Podemos and Jean-Luc Mélenchon's La France Insoumise.

Mouffe and Laclau's writings on Marxism and populism - some of which they produced together, and some separately - are famously dense and sometimes resistant to summary. But at their core is the idea that conflict is an inescapable and defining feature of political life. In other words, the realm of politics is one where antagonism is natural and unavoidable, in which consensus cannot ever be permanent, and there is always a ""we"" and a ""they"".

""Political questions are not mere technical issues to be solved by experts,"" Mouffe insists. ""Properly political questions always involve decisions which require us to make a choice between conflicting alternatives."" This emphasis on conflict produces a vision of democratic life that looks more radical than typical mainstream accounts of liberal democracy - but, Laclau and Mouffe would argue, one that more accurately describes the actual logic of politics.

In this view, any existing socio-political order (or ""hegemony"" in Mouffe and Laclau's preferred formation, borrowed from the Italian Marxist philosopher and politician Antonio Gramsci) is subject to challenge. Every status quo - however sturdy - is only temporary, and can always be challenged by a movement that seeks to replace it with something new. Political change, in other words, is the result of demands against the existing order, which must be fused together in a movement to change it - a movement that may look a lot like populism.

When my demands and your demands and our neighbours' demands are brought together in such a movement, they can become the basis for a new political ""we"": a ""people"" insisting that the current arrangement of power be altered in their name. To the extent that such a movement succeeds, it creates a new hegemony - a new baseline - which itself becomes open to challenge over time.

From this perspective, populism is just another word for real politics: for people (""us"") creating together, live on the ground, a sense of how our dissatisfactions relate, who is to blame (""them""), and how to force a change.

But those who benefit from the status quo don't want it to change; to this end, they might champion toothless approaches to collective decision-making: bipartisan consensus as an end in itself; the elevation of ""rational"" experts over hot-headed partisans; ""Third Way"" centrism that shuns ideological conflict in favour of ""what works"" or mediation by liberal institutions. These approaches (Mouffe calls them ""non-politics"") may for a time become dominant, as they did in the Anglo-American 1990s and early 2000s. But nothing lasts for ever, especially when the number of people who feel politicians are making their lives more precarious is rising. And then politics - real politics, which is to say populist politics - make a return.

According to Mouffe and Laclau, the only inherent connection between rightwing and leftwing populist movements is that both embrace the same fundamental truth about democracy: that it is an ever-shifting contest over how the default ""we"" of politics is defined and redefined, in which no one definition can be guaranteed to last. The goal, they argue, should not be placid consensus but ""agonistic pluralism"": a state in which opposition and disagreement are accepted as the norm, and in which people maintain the capacity to disagree intensely without demonising each other, or descending into war.

Mouffe, in particular, has in recent years argued that the political question of the immediate future is not how to fight populism, but rather which type of populist you want to be. It's about who you're with (who belongs in your ""chain of equivalence""), who you're against (who is causing the problem, and how), and where to take your stand. Populism isn't the problem: instead, leftwing populism is the solution.

Not all the academics who take inspiration from Mouffe and Laclau go quite this far, especially in the sober pages of peer-reviewed political science journals. But their work is palpably motivated by a sense that the real threat of ""populism"" is that our panic over the word will foreclose the possibility of new kinds of politics and new challenges to the status quo - and that fear of populism on the left could enable the victory of populism of the right.

These scholars' preference is for definitions in which it has no ideological essence - not even the ""thin"" one posited by Cas Mudde. For them, even though the thin definition readily recognises populism's ideological portability, it is still irrevocably tainted by pejorative overtones that push participants in debates about populism to take a position ""for"" or ""against"" all populisms. With no internal essence, populism is harder to categorise as inherently good or bad. Paris Aslanidis, a Yale political scientist, calls populism a ""discourse"" - a mode of talking about politics, rather than a set of beliefs - one that frames politics in terms of the ""supremacy of popular sovereignty"".

Benjamin Moffitt, a senior lecturer in politics at the Australian Catholic University, refers to populism as a ""political style"", the presence of which ""tells us very little about the substantive democratic content of any political project"". Under definitions of this type, the central question is not whether a given political actor or group is or isn't populist. It is instead whether, from moment to moment, they are ""doing populism"", and how, and with what impact.

Of course, these disputes aren't really about the difference between a ""thin ideology"" and a ""discourse."" They are about whether ""populist"" is always an insult, and if the project of defining populism can ever be disentangled from the concept's pejorative baggage. Ultimately, they are disputes about which types of politics make us suspicious, and why.

The current discussion of populism in the west is strongly coloured by the populist far-right parties that emerged in Europe in the late 1980s and early 90s, such as the Austrian Freedom party, the Danish People's party and the French National Front. What most people knew about these parties, at first, was that they were openly nativist and racist. They talked about ""real"" citizens of their countries, and fixated on the issue of national and ethnic ""purity,"" demonising immigrants and minorities. Many of their party leaders flirted winkingly with antisemitism, and their electoral victories coincided with a resurgence of extreme right-wing violence in Europe, such as the 1991 attack on immigrant workers and asylum seekers in the east German town of Hoyerswerda.

When journalists and politicians started calling these parties and their supporters populist, the term was an expression of alarm at a problem and, simultaneously, a euphemism that made it possible to gloss over that problem's exact qualities. This was especially useful for journalists who feared being viewed as anything less than politically neutral. Populist was obviously not a compliment, but it sounded less alarming than ""extreme right"" or ""radical right"". What the term seemed to communicate more than anything else was backwardness: a juvenile incapacity to bring your preferences to the political arena and engage in the complex give-and-take of rational compromise. The populist combination of immaturity, emotional resentment and intolerance was widely held to constitute a threat to postwar European democracy.

In one respect, the thin-ideology definition popularised by Cas Mudde dismantled this view of things, freeing populism from its exclusively far-right connotations, and cautioning against the conflation of populism with the other -isms it was often paired to.

Mudde and many other scholars who use the ideological definition have in fact repeatedly argued that neither Trump nor Brexit should be regarded primarily as populist phenomena. Of course both Trump and Brexiters used ample populist rhetoric; but in both cases, they argue, the majority of support was motivated not by passion for populism's core ideas, but by other ideological factors. After the Cambridge Dictionary declared populism 2017's ""word of the year"", Mudde wrote a Guardian column criticising the decision. (""It has become the buzzword of the year,"" he noted acidly, ""mostly because it is very often poorly defined and wrongly used."") For the radical-right parties whose electoral campaigns in the Netherlands, France, Germany and Austria raised alarms across Europe, ""populism comes secondary to nativism, and within contemporary European and US politics, populism functions at best as a fuzzy blanket to camouflage the nastier nativism"", Mudde concluded.

And yet, despite these caveats, the thin definition nonetheless positions populism as always posing at least something of a majoritarian threat to liberal democracy. It is this judgment, more than any other, that keeps the fight going between scholars who adopt the ideological definition, on one hand, and their Mouffe- and Laclau-inspired critics, on the other.

Liberal democracy, in this context, has almost nothing to do with contemporary distinctions between left and right. It refers, instead, to the idea that government should facilitate pluralistic coexistence by balancing the never fully attainable ideal of popular sovereignty with institutions that enshrine the rule of law and civil rights, which cannot easily be overturned by a political majority. (In this regard, as Mudde writes in his original paper, liberal democracy is ""therefore only partly democratic"".) Today, liberal democracy is what most people mean when they talk about democracy - and therefore, to be deemed a threat to liberal democracy is, in the context of most political discussions, a devastatingly negative judgment.

Because populism, as described by the ideological definition, involves a moralised conception of an absolutely sovereign ""people"" - whose verdicts are regarded as practically unanimous - it is inevitable that populist movements will come into conflict with the liberal aspects of liberal democracy.

If all ""real"" people think the same way about the things that matter most in politics, then the idea of institutional protections for a dissenting minority are are at best superfluous and at worst nefarious. For the populists, they are just another wall that the corrupt elite has built to keep real power away from the people. The same is true for the independence of judges or regulators, or checks and balances between branches of government - especially when they appear to stymie the plans of a populist leader. In this account, the most basic elements of liberal democracy become both kindling and fuel for the populist fire.

No one who studies populism seriously - and not even the most opportunistic participants in the cottage industry of anti-populist alarmism - denies that populist movements can raise valid critiques of the status quo, and of the very real anti-democratic power of elites. Many take a viewpoint similar to that of the Mexican political theorist Benjamin Arditi, who described populism as a drunken guest at democracy's dinner party, one who disrespects the rules of sociability and, along the way, brings up the failure and hypocrisies that everyone else in the room has agreed to ignore. In Populism: A Very Short Introduction, Mudde and his frequent co-author, the Chilean political scientist Cristóbal Kaltwasser, describe contemporary populism as an ""illiberal democratic response to an undemocratic liberalism"" - one that ""asks the right questions but provides the wrong answers"".

Reading critics from the left, however, one often gets the sense that for them this adds up to so much lipstick on a pig: a sprinkling of nuance and restraint that still leaves populism, no matter its ideological stripe, with an undeserved taint of inherent danger. The unhappiness of these critics is magnified by the fact that populism rarely appears in mainstream discussion as anything but an insult - often in the mouth of pundits and politicians who regard the left and the right as an equal threat.

The fear in these circles is that saying anything negative about ""populism"" - however qualified and analytical - simply hands more ammunition to the very people who helped make politics such a hollow, undemocratic mess in the first place. Positioning any populism as fundamentally antithetical to liberal democracy, in this view, simply reinforces the association between populism and mob psychology, and stokes fears that individual rights will always be trampled by group identities.

Some scholars in this camp now argue that we should be talking less about populism and more about the centrist ""anti-populism"" that fears and demonises it. ""Just as the adulterous spouse is always the one most suspicious of their own partner,"" wrote the Italian sociologist Marco d'Eramo in New Left Review in 2013, ""so those who eviscerate democracy are the most inclined to see threats to it everywhere. Hence all the to-do about populism betrays a sense of uneasiness, smacks of overkill.""

For each side in this debate, the obvious temptation is to simply dismiss the other - or to insist that what the other side calls ""populism"" isn't really populism at all, but just something populist-ish. But to conclude that the two camps are simply talking past each other would be to miss the extent to which they are in agreement -and what, taken together, they tell us about the current political moment.

In 1967, when political theorists from around the world gathered at the London School of Economics for the first ever academic conference on populism, they had a hard time figuring out exactly what they were supposed to be talking about. The word came from the ""prairie populists"", an 1890s movement of US farmers who supported more robust regulation of capitalism. But in the intervening decades it had been used for a wide and varied grab bag of phenomena from around the world, from McCarthyite anti-communist witch-hunts in the US to charismatic Latin American leaders.

In the end, the conference proceedings failed to clarify the matter at hand. ""There can at present be no doubt about the importance of populism,"" read a summary report. ""But no one is clear what it is.""

Over half a century later, there has been some progress. Populism, specialists now agree, is an ideologically portable way of looking at politics as a forum for opposition between ""people"" and ""elites"". This definition creates more questions: is the conceptual ""people"" of populism inherently defined in a way that spells danger to pluralistic coexistence? Or, less menacingly, is the idea of ""the people"" a necessary but always malleable concept - simply part of what it means to do politics?

But populism, whatever it is, is not a chemical: no scientist will ever come along and reveal its exact, objective composition. Populism is a lens for looking at our politics, including - down a long hall of mirrors - the politics of what gets called populist, and with what implications.

The questions of populism would have little urgency were it not for the widespread agreement about the shortcomings of the political status quo: about the abyss between the shining ideals of equality and responsive government implied by our talk about democracy and the tarnished reality of life on the ground. The notion that ""the people"" are being poorly served by politics has vast resonance across the political spectrum, and for good reason.

But what is the remedy? Among the proponents of the ideological definition, some decline to provide an answer, claiming that they are looking only to define and measure populism, not take a stance on it. Others admit that, in the case of populism, the options for producing a description without forming a judgment are basically nonexistent. The order of the day, in their view, is to convince citizens to recommit to liberal democracy and its institutions.

There is, however, widespread recognition in this camp - more than they are credited with by their critics on the left - that it will no longer suffice to insist that there is no acceptable alternative to existing liberal democracy. Writing in the Guardian in 2017, Mudde argued that responding to populism required more than ""purely anti-populist campaigns""; it would take, he claimed, ""a return to ideological politics"". Even liberals who want some issues to be ""depoliticised"" - to be removed from the realm of democracy and handed over to experts - will have to, at a minimum, remake the case for those decisions. Nothing can stay depoliticised for ever; that's politics.

If you squint just a little, this looks more than a bit like what you would expect from Ernesto Laclau and Chantal Mouffe, with their insistence that there is no space ""beyond left and right"" and no way to put political decisions - decisions about our collective fate - outside the reach of politics. Arguably, you might say that the defenders of liberal democracy are being suddenly reacquainted with the need to construct a democratic ""we"" - a people - around their demand to protect liberal institutions and procedures, in opposition to radical rightwing parties who are happy to see them discarded.

The corresponding challenge for anyone further on the left is to figure out the relationship between their long-term goals and the ideals of liberal democracy. There have always been critics for whom liberal democracy is sham democracy: a nice-sounding set of universal principles that, in practice, end up functioning as smokescreens that normalise the exploitations and inequities of capitalism.

Other theorists, Mouffe included, view something like the European social democracy of the 60s and 70s as the precondition for whatever comes next - for ""radical democracy"" that forces liberal democracy to make good on its promises of equality. But even Mouffe is no longer optimistic about our ability to revive our democratic prospects. Two years ago she wrote: ""In 1985 we said 'we need to radicalise democracy'; now we first need to restore democracy, so we can then radicalise it; the task is far more difficult."" What that task will look like on the ground is an open question.

The media framing of populism almost always sounds like a discussion about the margins: about forces from outside ""normal"" or ""rational"" politics threatening to throw off the balance of the status quo. But the scholarly discourse makes clear that this is backward: that populism is inherent to democracy, and especially to democracy as we know it in the contemporary west. It finds life in the cracks - or more lately, the chasms - between democracy's promises and the impossibility of their full, permanent realisation.

The question of populism, then, is always the question of what kind of democracy we want, and the fact that we will never stop arguing about this. Anxiety about populism can be a smokescreen for people who don't want the world as they know it to be disturbed. But it also flows from the core insight that we can never know exactly where democracy is going to take us - not this time, nor the next, nor the time after that.

302,the guardian,http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jan/12/julian-castro-president-democrat-san-antonio-texas-speech,"Julián Castro, the federal housing secretary under Barack Obama, is expected to announce his presidential bid on Saturday with an address in his home city of San Antonio, Texas, where he served for five years as mayor.

The 44-year-old, who rose to national prominence with an electrifying keynote speech at the 2012 Democratic convention, seems set to become the second high-profile Democrat to announce their candidacy for 2020 following Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren's campaign launch at the end of last year.

Castro, whose grandmother came to the US from Mexico in the 1920s, would be vying to become the party's first Hispanic-American nominee amid a field of that could swell to more than 20 candidates. The Hawaii congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard declared a bid on Friday.

In an interview with NBC News on Friday, Castro said: ""Mine is an immigrant story. It's an American dream story. It's a testament that everybody counts in this country.""

Castro was vetted as a potential vice-presidential running mate to Hillary Clinton in 2016, but was overlooked as Virginia senator Tim Kaine was given the role.

Since his time in Obama's cabinet Castro has slipped away from the public limelight as a new crop of young Democrats, including California senator Kamala Harris and former Texan congressman Beto O'Rourke, have gained national notoriety. Harris and O'Rourke are also seriously considering presidential runs.

The Texan Democrat appeared to acknowledge his status as an outsider in his interview with NBC. ""Well, I'm not the frontrunner,"" he said. ""But, you know, I don't think I can think of one time in my life where I was the frontrunner. If you go to the neighborhood that I grew up in, nobody that was growing up there was the frontrunner.""

A lawyer by training, Castro was born into a noted family of political activists. His mother, Rosie Castro, is a prominent civil rights activist in San Antonio, a city of 1.7m people in south central Texas. His twin brother, Joaquín Castro, is the Democratic congressman for Texas's 20th district.

The father of two married elementary school teacher Erica Lira Castro in 2007. He is expected to be flanked by his wife, their two children and his brother during his address on Saturday morning.

Hispanic activists were already celebrating Castro's potential run for the White House, arguing his politics and life story served as an antidote to the Trump presidency, which has long been characterized by anti-immigrant rhetoric.

""In this environment where Latinos in particular have been in the crosshairs, where we have a president who started his campaign on the first day attacking us, to have someone like Julián to step up for our community to defend us and to defeat this monster in the White House gives us great pride, or orgullo as we say in Spanish,"" said Cristóbal Alex, president of the Latino Victory Fund, which helps elect Hispanic politicians.

""His story is really the American story,"" Alex said.

303,the guardian,http://www.theguardian.com/stage/2019/jan/08/chair-boy-review-broadway-tarell-alvin-mccraney,"""Tighten up."" That's what the headmaster of a preparatory school for African American adolescents tells Pharus Jonathan Young, a rising senior and a choir soloist. But what the headmaster really means is straighten out. Pharus, the protagonist of Tarell Alvin McCraney's sensitive and lightly anguished Choir Boy, is loud and vivacious, his wrists are not exactly rigid. He knows that everyone thinks of him as a ""lil Sweet Boy""; he declines to be made sour.

Like Moonlight, the Oscar-winning film McCraney, co-wrote, Manhattan Theater Club's Choir Boy is concerned with what it means to be young, queer and black. The play, with sympathetic direction from Trip Cullman, works best as a jewel-faceted character study with Jeremy Pope, who originated the role of Pharus off-Broadway in 2013, tenderly inhabiting a young man hungry for love and respect, but unwilling or maybe unable to deny or disguise who he is - a teenager with a seraphic voice and pictures of Michelle Obama ringed above his bed, who desires and is desired by other men.

In the opening scene, he stands in front of the school singing the hymn Trust and Obey only to have one of his fellow singers hiss ""sissy"" and other slurs until the song catches in his throat. Pharus refuses to inform on the classmate and over the course of the senior year, he tries to let his not so little light shine, to the amusement, bemusement and disapproval of peers and teachers. McCraney has added a few new lines to bring the script up to date, bitter jokes about Kanye press conferences and locker-room talk that remind the audience the country has become no kinder to those who aren't rich, white and straight.

But a play needs a plot and this one is only lightly sketched, with nods, probably deliberate, to prep school classics like Tea and Sympathy and shades of some of the more somber episodes of Glee. Will Pharus be allowed to sing at commencement? Will he earn the acceptance of his friends? There's also a subplot involving a retired teacher, Mr Pendleton (played with shaggy verve by Austin Pendleton), who hopes to unlock the boys' minds Dead Poets-style (and also improbably assumes command of the choir), scenes that mostly go nowhere, however fleetly.

Because McCraney has an honest and wide-flung empathy, his reach extends outward past Pharus to his antagonists and sometime friends, treating each man and boy with warmth. There are strong roles not only for Pope, but also for John Clay III as AJ, Pharus's jock roommate AJ; J Quinton Johnson, as Billy, a bully nursing his own wounds; Nicholas L Ashe as Junior, Billy's sometime sidekick; and Caleb Eberhardt as David, a young man with a calling for the priesthood. The tension between the richness of the characters and the thinness of the story isn't always held with grace.

There are other tensions operating here, too. McCraney typically layers his stories with myth and archetype. But here he's abandoned most of his poetic and thematic flourishes (barring an on-the-nose speech in which Pharus discusses the beauty of spirituals), working instead in a more naturalistic style that while friendly to Broadway can sometimes feel a little pat. The short scenes tumble on speedily, but it's really only in the clefts between scenes, when the young men step forward, not necessarily in character, and deliver forceful, emotive versions of Rockin' in Jerusalem or Rainbow Round My Shoulder, that the play takes on a real intensity. In these moments Choir Boy ascends and its choirboys achieve, as long as the notes hold, what feels like freedom."
304,the guardian,http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jan/10/dreamer-who-won-rhodes-scholarship-fears-he-wont-be-allowed-back-in-the-us,"Jin Park, a recent Harvard graduate, risks not being allowed to return to the US after studying at the University of Oxford

The first Dreamer to win the Rhodes scholarship is facing fears he won't be allowed back into the country after completing the prestigious program.

Jin Park, 22, is a recent Harvard University graduate whose family came to the US from South Korea when he was seven.

He won the Rhodes Scholarship last year - but now risks not being allowed to return to the United States after studying at the University of Oxford in the UK under the grant.

""If I leave, there's a very real possibility that I won't be able to come back. That's the biggest fear for sure,"" Park told the Associated Press. ""I haven't really thought about what that's going to mean if I'm not allowed back.""

Park was the first immigrant enrolled in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which shields young people who were brought to the country illegally as children from deportation, to win the famed scholarship. The group are often called ""Dreamers"", after the never-passed legislation known as the Dream Act which would have given them permanent protection.

Under President Barack Obama, who created Daca, participants were allowed to travel abroad under limited circumstances - including academic study - and return to the United States.

But Donald Trump ordered an end to the Daca protections. Federal courts have ruled against him, ordering the program - which protects some 700,000 people - to stay in place for now.

Park and his supporters say that should mean travel abroad is still allowed - but it's unclear if the federal government will agree.

""The government should enforce the law as it currently stands, to allow Jin to fulfil his scholarly work,"" said Kristian Ramos of Define American, an immigrant advocacy group that supported Park's bid for the scholarship.

Park, a resident of Queens in New York who founded the advocacy group Higher Dreams, first applied for the Rhodes scholarship last year and was rejected because Daca recipients did not qualify. But the organization changed its policy, and he reapplied and won the award.

After graduating from Harvard last month, he plans to enroll at Oxford in the fall in spite of the uncertainty, and hopes to study migration and political theory.

He said he's had trouble bringing up the potential perils with his parents, who cried when he won the scholarship.

""This was especially meaningful for them. It was like a validation of the sacrifices they've made for me,"" he told the AP.

Regardless of what happens next, he considers Queens his home.

""Whatever happens, I'm always going to know that fact. Even if I have to spend the rest of my life convincing the administration, or whoever comes next,"" he said."

Good morning, I'm Tim Walker with today's essential stories.

Top story: Poll puts 'untested' Texan third in Democrat field

One of the biggest questions of 2019 will be which Democrat should face Donald Trump in 2020. And if early polls are anything to go by, then the failed US Senate candidate from Texas, Beto O'Rourke, must be considered among the contenders. A CNN survey has put the 46-year-old El Paso congressman third in a list of Democratic hopefuls, behind Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders. And a November meeting between O'Rourke and Barack Obama has only intensified the speculation over his ambitions.

Close call. O'Rourke amassed a record-breaking $38m in the third quarter of his midterm senate race against Ted Cruz, and eventually came within three points of the Republican.

Lone star? Deep red Texas could produce two leading Democratic presidential candidates in 2020, with the former Obama administration housing secretary Julián Castro also considering a White House run.

Saudis hit back at US senate over Yemen resolution

Saudi Arabia has issued an unusually strong statement criticising the US senate, after it passed bipartisan measures calling for an end to US military support for the Saudi-led coalition in Yemen and blaming the Saudi crown prince for the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. The statement said the resolution was based on ""unsubstantiated claims and allegations"", adding: ""The kingdom categorically rejects any interference in its internal affairs, any and all accusations, in any manner, that disrespect its leadership.""

Trump ally. Trump has continued to defend the Saudi crown prince, Mohammed bin Salman, despite the CIA and others concluding that he ordered Khashoggi's death.

Wisconsin activists battle threat to African American vote

Scott Walker, Wisconsin's lame duck Republican governor, signed a series of bills on Friday designed to curb the powers of the state's incoming Democrat lawmakers - including his own successor, Tony Evers. Among the bills Walker signed, which were characterised by politicians from both parties as a ""power grab"", is a bill to limit early voting in Wisconsin that closely resembles a measure ruled unconstitutional and discriminatory in 2016. Activists are mobilising to oppose it, as Eric Lutz reports from Milwaukee.

Early voting. The new restrictions, which may not make it through the courts, would limit early voting to two weeks prior to the Friday before election day, making it harder for many voters to get to the polls. Campaigners say the measure would disproportionately affect African American and other minority voters.

Stephen Miller repeats Trump's shutdown threat

The senior Trump adviser Stephen Miller has said the White House remains willing to shut down the government over its demand to fund a US-Mexico border wall. Miller, one of the architects of the administration's hardline immigration policies, told CBS's Face the Nation on Sunday that the president would ""absolutely"" force a shutdown over the issue. Speaking to NBC's Meet the Press, however, the Democrats' senate minority leader Chuck Schumer insisted Trump is ""not going to get the wall in any form"".

Hair today... Many viewers on Twitter were distracted from Miller's threats by the spectacle of his rapidly advancing hairline.

306,the guardian,http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2019/jan/14/christian-nationalists-bills-religious-freedom-project-blitz,"The package of new bills are part of Project Blitz, a political playbook that aims to support and promote Christian beliefs

Christian hardliners on the religious right have introduced new bills to impose their values in at least six American states in the opening days of 2019.

The early legal moves have been tracked from Alaska to Florida as mostly Republican legislators make use of off-the-shelf 'model bills' generated by Christian nationalists in a playbook called Project Blitz.

So-called ""In God We Trust"" bills have already been introduced this year in Alaska, Kentucky, Missouri and South Carolina, which, if they became law, would see the phrase emblazoned on public buildings, hung in schools and displayed on public vehicles including police cars.

A bill requiring Florida public high schools to offer Christian Bible-study classes has just been introduced by a Democratic representative Kimberly Davies - a former 'exorcist' who called herself the Demonbuster. Similar bills have been introduced in North Dakota and Missouri.

In Texas, a bill allowing teachers to display the Ten Commandments in classrooms will be considered in this state legislature session.

Georgia is expected to try to pass a 'religious freedom' act which would give cover to people who run businesses, or agencies which provide adoption or foster care services, if they refuse to serve LGBTQ people on religious grounds.

And in South Carolina, Republican governor Henry McMaster is appealing to the Trump administration to allow Miracle Hill Ministries to keep its federal funding even though it refuses to allow non-Christians to use its foster-care service, a breach of Obama-era regulations.

However, civil rights activists are preparing to use Religious Freedom Day on January 16 as a moment to mount an attack against Project Blitz.

Frederick Clarkson, senior research analyst at Political Research Associates, a think-tank which studies the political right, was the first to draw attention to the Project Blitz playbook last year.

He first revealed that the 140-page playbook had been shared by a group called the Congressional Prayer Caucus Foundation (CPCF) set up by a former Republican congressman with the stated aim to ""protect religious freedom, preserve America's Judeo-Christian heritage and promote prayer"".

Now civil rights, human rights and atheist groups are coming together to organise against the emboldened Christian hardliners.

Clarkson said: ""It has taken time, but organized opposition is mounting.""

A law passed in 1992 gives the president the duty to proclaim January 16 as Religious Freedom Day. It is supposed to be a moment to celebrate all faiths (or none) in the US, recognizing the freedoms first written by Thomas Jefferson, and enshrined in the Constitution and the First Amendment.

But last year, Donald Trump, heavily influenced by Christian Evangelicals used his proclamation to advance a Christian nationalist message that religious freedom was under threat from courts and legislatures ""forcing people to comply with laws that violate their core religious beliefs"".

Trump claimed: ""no American - whether a nun, nurse, baker or business owner - should be forced to choose between the tenets of faith or adherence to the law.""

He was providing explicit support for those who would refuse to serve LGBTQ customers, deny reproductive rights to women, or block gay couples from adopting children or becoming foster parents.

Americans United for Separation of Church and State is making opposition to Project Blitz a priority in 2019. It has been tracking bills and working with other activist groups to track new laws and organise opposition against them.

Rachel Laser, president and CEO of Americans United said: ""Project Blitz is one of the foremost organised efforts to infiltrate state legislatures with religion.""

By shining a light on the Project Blitz playbook, Americans United wants to clearly ""hallmark"" In God We Trust bills as the creation of the CPCF.

Laser said the aim was ""to demonstrate to state legislatures that they are very much part of a Christian nationalism plan to codify a far right Evangelical Christian America and allow religious liberty to be used as a sword to harm others, instead of as a shield to protect people.""

Opponents have tracked at least 75 bills brought forward in more than 20 states since Trump became president which stem from the Project Blitz playbook.

Clarkson's work last year revealed one of the steering team behind Project Blitz as David Barton, the Texas-based founder of an organisation called WallBuilders, which takes its inspiration from the Old Testament in describing a mission of ""rebuilding our nation's foundations"".

In a recording of a call with state legislators, he described in detail the strategy behind Project Blitz, which he said packages together about two dozen bills in separate categories based on the type of opposition they are likely to receive.

The first category of ""In God We Trust"" bills are likely to trigger opposition by saying the bills are a waste of time, or the sponsor of the bill ""just wants to fight culture wars and divide people"".

Category two include bills for a range of proclamations or resolutions - declaring a religious freedom day or Christian heritage week that can then be used to get religious teaching into schools.

Category three bills will have the greatest impact but will be ""the most hotly contested"" the playbook says - they include resolutions in favour of ""biblical values concerning marriage and sexuality"", such as ""establishing public policy favoring adoption by intact heterosexual, marriage-based families"" and ""establishing public policy favoring intimate sexual relations only between married, heterosexual couples"".

Laser said: ""When a lot of state legislators see 'In God We Trust' they think that is harmless patriotism, but it is part of an intentional plan to build momentum for establishing a Christian America.""

Laser said there are real concerns about a momentum behind Christian nationalism, which she said Trump has bolstered with the appointment of pro-life Supreme Court judges Brett Kavanaugh and Neil Gorsuch. The only religious advisory board Trump has is an all Evangelical Christian advisory board.

Last year the administration announced a religious liberty task force at a religious liberty summit event attended entirely by social conservatives.

As Trump prepares to release his Religious Freedom Day proclamation next Wednesday (16 January) some legislatures are preparing their own inclusive resolutions. In Washington DC, David Grosso a Democratic member of the Council of the District of Columbia sponsored a Religious Freedom Day resolution which recognizes all faiths and none and says ""the government may not favor one religion over another, or over nonreligion, without fatally undermining religious freedom"".

He said: ""We are built on the principles of freedom of and freedom from religion in the United States and we shouldn't let the far-right activists that are pushing these efforts like Project Blitz undermine that reality."""
307,the guardian,http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2018/dec/14/clean-water-casualty-trump-attack-environment,"The cruelty and the idiocy of Donald Trump's presidency does not chiefly lie in his tweets or even his words. Trump the performer is ridiculous, but that's the clown show that keeps many of us either terrified or entertained - the real harm is elsewhere, away from the blaring headlines.

Trump has been most destructive in his willingness to carry out an unabashedly rightwing policy agenda. Most Republicans competing for the nomination in 2016 embraced their party's total capitulation to the fossil fuel industry, denying the existence of climate change and promising to shred Environmental Protection Agency regulations. This is a central threat to America's future: a major, powerful political party rejecting science itself.

This week, the Trump administration said it would weaken federal clean water rules designed to protect millions of acres of wetlands and thousands of miles of streams from pesticide runoff and other pollutants. This proposal would not just undo Obama-era regulations but chip away at protections instituted under the late George HW Bush, perhaps the last major Republican to pay even lip service to the environment.

The Obama era rule was designed to limit pollution in about 60% of the nation's bodies of water, protecting sources of drinking water for about a third of the United States. Federal authority was extended to limit pollution in large bodies of waters and smaller bodies that drain into them, like streams and wetlands. Rural landowners complained about the government regulating how much pollution from chemical fertilizers and pesticides could seep into water on their property.

Real estate developers and owners of golf courses attacked the water regulations too, and cheered the news that Trump, a fan of both real estate development and golf, was delivering on a campaign promise. The protection of our water, they figure, shouldn't interfere with business.

Not only will it soon be easier for pollution to seep into our waterways, if a developer finds a wetland is in the way of a money-making opportunity, the habitat can be paved over altogether. Wetlands adjacent to a major body of water will warrant federal protection. The rest are fair game.

Environmentalists are rightfully horrified and fearful of what's to come. It's not just clean drinking water the Trump White House has disregarded. Proposals have circulated to weaken regulations on planet-warming emissions from power plants, oil rigs, and cars. Trump is trying to speed new drilling at the Arctic National Wildlife refuge. As climate change accelerates and the planet hurdles ever closer to an existential crisis, Trump went to a United Nations conference to tout the benefits of fossil fuels.

The current administrator of the EPA, Andrew Wheeler, used to spend his time lobbying against environmental regulations on behalf of coal magnate Robert E Murray. He was chief counsel to Senator James Inhofe of Oklahoma, a proud denier of climate change.

Democrats hoping Trump is impeached, indicted, or somehow toppled before 2020 should understand even such farfetched scenarios won't change the status quo. Trump has surrounded himself with people who care far more about the sanctity of fossil fuel profits than the safety of the American people. They worship at the altar of nihilistic capitalism. Mike Pence won't save you.

For 2020 and beyond, climate justice will have to become the most animating issue for Democrats - not because it's a ""winning"" argument, though it is, but because the future of the planet depends on it. This is why Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez occupied Nancy Pelosi's office to force support for a ""Green New Deal"". We are left with no other alternatives.

The job of the next president will be to undo the damage Trump has wrought. There will be much handwringing about the shattering of democratic norms, but the real work will be in doing whatever we can, in the little time we have, to avert a true climate catastrophe."
308,the guardian,http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/dec/15/ruth-bader-ginsburg-film-supreme-court,"Many Americans might struggle to identify a single supreme court justice. But Ruth Bader Ginsburg's face adorns T-shirts, pins and memorabilia found at gift shops across the country. She is the subject of children's books and a viral Tumblr account, and even boasts of her own pop culture moniker.

The ""Notorious RBG"", one of nine justices on America's highest court, has emerged as one of the country's most unlikely celebrities. Although she is 85 years old, a generation of young women have heralded Ginsburg as a leader of the so-called ""Resistance"", deeming her a symbolic foil to Donald Trump and his administration.

This month will also see the release of the highly anticipated biopic, On The Basis of Sex, in which the British actor Felicity Jones will portray Ginsburg in the early stages of her career. It is the second film to focus on Ginsburg's life this year alone. In May, the documentary RBG offered an intimate retrospective of Ginsburg's upbringing in Brooklyn, New York, and charted her rise to one of the most celebrated public figures in the US.

Some who have followed Ginsburg's decades-long career find her late-life stardom to be surprising. Though revered by her followers as a liberal firebrand, the justice herself is known to be shy and soft-spoken.

""For Ruth Bader Ginsburg to become a bona fide celebrity, much less in her 80s, is quite extraordinary,"" said Jeffrey Toobin, author of The Nine: Inside the Secret World of the Supreme Court.

""I think there's a recognition, especially on the part of younger women, that there were generations ahead of them that paved the way for their rights. At the same time, they see those rights in peril.""

Ginsburg was born in 1933, at the height of the Depression, to Jewish parents whose families had immigrated from Europe. Her father, Nathan Bader, was a furrier, and her mother, Celia Bader, died when Ginsburg was a teenager. The justice has said neither of her parents had the means to attend college.

In On the Basis of Sex, Ginsburg is first depicted as one of a handful of female students at Harvard law school in the late 1950s. The film follows the trajectory of her career from law professor to the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), where she co-founded the Women's Rights Project in 1972 and went on to challenge six gender discrimination laws before the same supreme court on which she would serve three decades later.

The film's juxtaposition with the Trump presidency may reinforce Ginsburg's status as one of the prevailing standard-bearers for equal rights.

When the court ruled this year in favor of a Christian baker who refused to make a cake for a same-sex wedding, Ginsburg condemned the 7-2 decision, writing: ""When a couple contacts a bakery for a wedding cake, the product they are seeking is a cake celebrating their wedding - not a cake celebrating heterosexual weddings or same-sex weddings - and that is the service [they] were denied.""

Her tone was even sharper when the court narrowly upheld Trump's travel ban on several Muslim-majority countries. Ginsburg joined her fellow liberal justice Sonia Sotomayor in a scathing dissent that directly invoked Trump's vow as a candidate to ban Muslims from entering the US.

""The United States of America is a Nation built upon the promise of religious liberty,"" they wrote. ""The Court's decision today fails to safeguard that fundamental principle.""

Ginsburg's fiery words were not necessarily new: she declared in 2013 that the law barring same-sex couples from being able to marry had created ""full marriage and the skim-milk marriage"". But some observers said Ginsburg's impassioned defense of civil rights had taken on new meaning amid a sense that some of those rights were slowly slipping away.

""For a younger generation, it was really speaking truth to power,"" said Jane Sherron De Hart, author of Ruth Bader Ginsburg: A Life.

Ginsburg, she added, appeared to have embraced her notoriety to cement her legacy as an advocate for progressive values.

""She's really used this kind of platform in ways that are obvious and in ways that are more subtle.""

In April, Ginsburg voluntarily presided over a naturalization ceremony in New York in another unmistakable rebuke of Trump. As she stood before people from 59 countries preparting to take the oath of US citizenship, Ginsburg told the crowd: ""We are a nation made strong by people like you.""

Although she did not mention the president by name, her remarks came against the backdrop of the Trump administration's crackdown on immigration.

Some critics argue that Ginsburg's words are insufficient given her refusal to retire from the bench under Barack Obama.

Since taking office, Trump has appointed two justices to the court: Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh. The latter's confirmation, which came despite allegations of sexual misconduct, cemented a conservative majority on the bench that will affect decisions for generations to come.

Last month, news that Ginsburg broke three ribs after suffering a fall set off alarm bells in progressive circles that Trump might be handed yet another replacement.

""That is a clear part of her legacy that can't be ignored,"" said Toobin. ""It may be that she outlasts Donald Trump ... but 85 is not the new anything. She can't be there forever.

""A third Trump appointment would cement a conservative majority in a way we haven't seen since the 1930s. And that's on her.""

Ginsburg defended her decision not to retire under Obama by suggesting at the time that a liberal nominee would be blocked by Republicans in the Senate. Earlier this year, she expressed confidence in her future on the court, stating her intention to remain ""at least five more years"".

Bryant Johnson, Ginsburg's longtime personal trainer, said it would take more than a fall to count the justice out.

Johnson downplayed her injuries, pointing out she had twice battled cancer and broken other bones. Her commitment to fitness was so steadfast, he noted, that she once cut short dinner with Obama so as not to miss her exercise.

""This is new to everybody else, it's not new to us,"" Johnson said. ""For Justice Ginsburg, it's just business as usual."""
309,the guardian,http://www.theguardian.com/sport/2018/dec/14/dina-asher-smith-harry-kane-geraint-thomas-lewis-hamilton-bbc-sports-personality-of-the-year,"The athlete who won three European gold medals is likely to be up against Harry Kane, Geraint Thomas and Lewis Hamilton

A hugely successful and exhilarating year for British sport will be acknowledged in time-worn fashion on Sunday night when the country's leading athletes - along with 12,000 paying spectators - gather at the Genting Arena in Birmingham for the 65th running of the BBC Sports Personality of the Year Award. Yet, in a break from recent tradition, a woman has a genuine shot at the main prize.

Not since 2006, when Zara Phillips was rewarded for winning the equestrian world title, has the award gone to a woman - and since then the only women to make even the podium are the athletes Jessica Ennis-Hill and Jo Pavey, and the swimmer Rebecca Adlington. Yet the bookmakers rate Dina Asher-Smith as a genuine contender after a dizzying few months, during which she became the first British track and field star to claim a treble of gold medals at a major championships.

Millions watched her performances on the BBC, turning her into a bona fide star and role model, although the eloquent 23-year-old does not necessarily see it that way. ""I still find it strange that people see me as a role model,"" she says. ""I think: 'Why me?' I'm just normal. I look up to people like Michelle Obama. You have to admire her, being in the White House for eight years but coming out with her head held high and a strong sense of whom she is. That's really admirable.

""I also talk to fantastic women such as Jess Ennis and Chrissy Ohuruogu who tell me how to handle myself, how to remain cool and not get stressed. I take inspiration and advice from people who have done it already. There's no point in trying to find your own way.""

For the first time, the contenders nominated for Sports Personality of the Year will be announced on the night of the show with fewer names in the running. However it would be a major surprise if the England footballer Harry Kane is not on the shortlist having scored six goals at the World Cup to claim the golden boot. The bookmakers make Kane a narrow favourite, with the Tour de France winning cyclist Geraint Thomas close behind and the Formula One champion Lewis Hamilton in third. After that comes Asher-Smith, with the top five in the betting made up by the heavyweight boxer Tyson Fury. As always, the public will vote to decide the winner. Last year the form book was shredded, with the 28-1 outsider Mo Farah picked as the winner and the motorcyclist Jonathan Rea a shock second. However it would be a major surprise if a left-field candidate won this time.

Elsewhere England's netballers, who toppled Australia in a thrilling Commonwealth Games final, will go head-to-head with Gareth Southgate's England football side, who reached the World Cup semi-finals, for team of the year. While the American gymnast Simone Biles faces three other candidates for the World Star of the Year gong, including the Open-winning golfer Francesco Molinari.

But when it comes to the main prize Asher-Smith would be a highly popular winner after a season for the ages. Between 2014 to 2017 she combined being an elite sprinter with studying for a history degree at King's College, London. This year, though, she recovered from a broken foot to make history of her own by storming to three European gold medals over 100m, 200m and the 4x100m relay in Berlin in August, in the same Olympic Stadium where Jesse Owens defied Hitler in 1936. For good measure Asher-Smith also smashed the national 100m and 200m records, after having a bet with her mum beforehand that she could run 10.85sec for 100m.

""I didn't think I'd get it because 10.85 is such a ridiculous time,"" admits Asher-Smith, smiling. ""Afterwards my mum bought me a bag. I also had a bet with my physio that he'd take me out for a very nice meal. We'll have to find a time when I'm not on my training diet. Maybe next year!""

Another sign of her growing popularity came when Asher-Smith became a catwalk star for the day at Paris Fashion Week in September, while last month she also had a high-speed train named after her by Southeastern railway. But she insists that she is not interested in the joys or trappings of fame. ""If anything clashes with training, I am like: 'Sorry, I can't go.' I get invited to nice things and get awards simply because I run fast. But I run fast by training. I certainly know which side my bread is buttered, so that means I have to be at the track or in the gym and fully rested when my coach says so.""

She will make an exception to attend Sunday's ceremony in Birmingham but she insists she is happy mostly training, relaxing and reading books. ""I just bought Becoming, by Michelle Obama, after reading a great book on the NHS. Generally I am a bit boring but I think you have to be if you want to run faster and keep improving."""
310,the guardian,http://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2019/jan/09/kehinde-wiley-st-louis-when-i-first-started-painting-black-women-it-was-a-return-home,"The artist, who painted the official presidential portrait of Barack Obama, talks about his new project and his mission to bring diversity to museum walls

When the American artist Kehinde Wiley - known by many for his presidential portrait of Barack Obama - walked into a Little Caesars restaurant in St Louis, he didn't know he'd walk out with models for his next painting.

He saw a group of African American women sitting at a table and was inspired to paint them for Three Girls in A Wood, a painting on view at the St Louis Art Museum. It's part of Wiley's exhibition Saint Louis, which runs until 10 February, where 11 paintings of St Louis locals are painted in the style of Old Masters aristocrats, a comment on the absence of black portraits in museums.

""The great heroic often white male hero dominates the picture plane and becomes larger than life, historic and significant,"" said Wiley over the phone from his Brooklyn studio. ""That great historic storytelling of myth-making or propaganda is something we inherit as artists and I wanted to be able to weaponize and translate it into a means of celebrating female presence.""

It all started last year when the museum invited Wiley to create an exhibition, which prompted the artist to visit the museum's sprawling collection. Noticing the lack of people of color on the walls, he ventured out into the suburbs for subjects to paint, including Ferguson, a hub of the Black Lives Matter movement since the police shooting of Mike Brown (""There's a very strong dissonance between this gilded museum on a hill and the communities in Ferguson,"" Wiley recently said). He put out a public call and personally invited locals for a casting inside the museum.

""From the beginning, it was about a response to the museum as it sits in the city as a strange metaphorical divide between the culture, not only in St Louis, but in America at large,"" he said. ""The kind of inside outside nature of museum culture can be alienating and St Louis has one of the best American collections of classical works, so I wanted to use the poses from these paintings for potential sitters from the community.""

Wiley has painted St Louis natives as stately figures, wearing their day-to-day garb, even showing women in traditionally male poses. For one, Shontay Hanes from Wellston is painted in the pose of Francesco Salviati's Portrait of a Florentine Nobleman, while her sister Ashley Cooper's pose is similar to that of Charles I in the portrait by Dutch artist Daniel Martensz Mytens the Elder.

As the models posed for him, Wiley took hundreds of photos, which he took back to his New York studio. He picked the photos that had the strongest presence and painted them. ""My process is less about the original sitter, nor is it entirely about the individual,"" he said. ""It's a strange middle space that is marked by a kind of anonymity, standing in for a history that is not your own. A pose that is not your own. There is a kind of complexity there that is not reducible to traditional painting.""

There is also a painting in the exhibit which mimics the Dutch painter Gerard ter Borch's portrait of Jacob de Graeff, which inspired Wiley's portrait of Brincel Kape'li Wiggins Jr, who is wearing a Ferguson hat as a way of showing the city in a positive light.

Wiley, who grew up in South Central Los Angeles in the 1980s, had an aha moment when he first saw the works of Kerry James Marshall in a museum when he was young - it proved to him that African American figures belonged on museum walls, too. He studied painting in Russia at the tender age of 12, chased down his long-lost Nigerian father at 20, graduated from Yale in 2001 and has been painting African Americans - including a commissioned portrait of Michael Jackson - as Old Masters icons, since the early 2000s.

""When you think of America itself and its own narratives, there are inspiring narratives and the notion of American exceptionalism,"" said Wiley. ""It's the place where the world looks to for the best of human aspirations. That narrative is highly under question at this moment.""

Despite becoming royalty in his own respect, as Wiley's star-studded lifestyle has him posing for selfies alongside Naomi Campbell and Prince Charles on Instagram, he sees his country differently now, compared with when he started painting professionally. ""By virtue of our strength, we're at this point of weakness and inability to see a lot of the folly that is set in the country,"" he said. ""I think there is an overbuilt privilege that starts to come into play and inability to feel empathy for perceived outsiders.""

Since his leafy Obama portrait was unveiled last year, his life has drastically changed. ""I don't have to explain what I do any more,"" he said. ""It makes it a lot easier, 'He's the guy who did that.' It's going to be on my headstone.""

As for his painting of three women he found at a pizza parlor, it's a departure from where he first began - which was classically trained painting of white women. ""So much of my upbringing as an artist was painting white women often displayed nude,"" he said. ""When I first started painting black women, it was a return home.""

While Wiley is known for choosing models that stand out to him, he can never predict what will work in the studio. But he does know one thing. ""I think the starting point of my work is decidedly empathy,"" he said. ""All of it is a self-portrait. I never paint myself but, in the end, why am I going out of my way to choose these types of stories and narratives?

""It's about seeing yourself in other people,"" he said. ""People forget America itself is a stand-in for a sense of aspiration the world holds on to. It's a really sad day when the source of light criticizes light itself."""

According to the National Iranian technicians are experiencing delays in repairing the new jet while they wait for parts.

A passenger told the National that an hour after leaving Dubai their plane was grounded in Shiraz because of low oil pressure in one of the turbines.

He told the magazine: 'Emotions were high at the hotel when the promised evening flight didn't materialise and we were told we would spend the night in Iran.

Another user said: 'I guess that means the Norwegian plane is being held hostage in Iran - by US sanctions.'

Donald Trump is locked in a diplomatic struggle with the hostile state after he hammered President Barack Obama's nuclear deal as being 'the worst deal ever' and withdrew from The Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) in May 2018.

Iranian President Hassan Rouhani responded by escalating his violent rhetoric, saying he faced a 'war situation' and ordering fighter jets to perform drills after Trump's announcement.

Rouhani said last month: 'I warn those who impose sanctions that if Iran's ability to fight drugs and terrorism are affected ... you will not be safe from a deluge of drugs, asylum seekers, bombs and terrorism.'"
312,daily mail online,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6525051/Defense-Secretary-James-Mattis-January-1-angry-Trump-orders-gone.html,"President Donald Trump will push Defense Secretary James Mattis out of his administration on January 1 amid anger at how Mattis' resignation letter was seen as a rebuke of his presidency.

Mattis was supposed to remain on the job until Feb. 28.

Deputy Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan will be named as acting secretary.

'I am pleased to announce that our very talented Deputy Secretary of Defense, Patrick Shanahan, will assume the title of Acting Secretary of Defense starting January 1, 2019. Patrick has a long list of accomplishments while serving as Deputy, & previously Boeing. He will be great!,' Trump tweeted on Sunday afternoon.

Trump announced Mattis' departure on Sunday

Mattis named late February as his exit in his resignation letter, calling it 'a date that should allow sufficient time for a successor to be nominated and confirmed as well as to make sure the Department's interests are properly articulated and protected at upcoming events.'

This will be the third acting Cabinet member in Trump's administration: Matthew Whitaker is acting attorney general; David Bernhardt will take over as acting Secretary of Interior with Ryan Zinke exit at end of the year; and now Shanahan at Pentagon.

Mick Mulvaney has been named acting chief of staff, which the Trump White House classifies as Cabinet level position.

Mulvaney said on Sunday the relationship between Trump and Mattis had been 'fraying.'

'Look, let's be honest with each other. I think the relationship between these two men have been fraying. I think the president no longer relied on Mattis to be able to deliver the president's vision,' he said on 'Fox News Sunday.'

He noted on ABC's 'This Week' that the two men 'didn't have the same world view. You heard the president say a couple weeks ago, I think, in an interview that he recognized that Mr. Mattis - he called him a Democrat.'

He added: 'So no, I don't think it was a surprise.'

Tensions have long said to be thick between the two men. Mattis' departure brought groans from Trump critics, who claimed one of the few 'grownups' in the Trump administration was leaving.

Democrats also used Mattis' fiery resignation letter, which he told aides to distribute, as their new cause celebrity.

But lawmakers and the defense industry were also rattled by the departure.

When Mattis announced his exit on Thursday, the onetime Marine Corps general did it on his own terms - listing the ways he's incompatible with his commander-in-chief.

Chief among them is that Mattis believes Trump hasn't tended the diplomatic garden of international alliances, leaving the United States unable to defend its interests overseas.

Deputy Secretary of Defense Patrick M. Shanahan will be named acting Pentagon chief

And the timing of his announcement was unmistakably linked to the president's announcement Thursday of a troop pullout from Syria that the two men disagreed about.

'Because you have the right to a Secretary of Defense whose views are better aligned with yours on these and other subjects,' Mattis wrote after his litany, 'I believe it is right for me to step down from my position.'

'One core belief I have always held is that our strength as a nation is inextricably linked to the strength of our unique and comprehensive system of alliances and partnerships,' he wrote.

'While the US remains the indispensable nation in the free world, we cannot protect our interests or serve that role effectively without maintaining strong alliances and showing respect to those allies.'

Mattis also declared that America 'must be resolute and unambiguous in our approach to those countries whose strategic interests are increasingly in tension with ours.'

Trump has swiped at critics of his decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria by saying if anyone else brought soldiers home they would be branded a 'hero'.

In a series of fiery tweets Saturday night, the president also dismissed the top U.S. envoy in the fight against ISIS as an 'Obama appointee' who he claimed he did not know.

Trump said he had an 'interesting relationship with Mattis and he had given him resources

Trump launched a tirade on Twitter (pictured) against top US officials who resigned within days of each other after they disagreed with his decision to pull troops out of Syria

Earlier Saturday, Special Presidential Envoy for the Global Coalition to Counter ISIL Brett McGurk announced his resignation in the wake of Trump's decision to pull troops out of Syria and just days after Mattis's announced departure.

McGurk was to leave the role in February but moved up his departure date by two months to December 31 after very publicly stating that the move to pull American forces at this time could result in a 'possibly catastrophic outcome'.

Responding to the news , Trump tweeted: 'Brett McGurk, who I do not know, was appointed by President Obama in 2015.

'Was supposed to leave in February but he just resigned prior to leaving. Grandstander? The Fake News is making such a big deal about this nothing event!.

'If anybody but your favorite President, Donald J. Trump, announced that, after decimating ISIS in Syria, we were going to bring our troops back home (happy & healthy), that person would be the most popular hero in America. With me, hit hard instead by the Fake News Media. Crazy!

The veteran diplomat, who got his start in the administration of George W. Bush and was appointed to his current post by Barack Obama, now joins Mattis in an administration exodus of experienced national security officials.

Trump also fired a parting shot at Mattis, the most respected foreign policy official in the administration who will leave by the end of February.

He tweeted: 'When President Obama ingloriously fired Jim Mattis, I gave him a second chance.

'Some thought I shouldn't, I thought I should. Interesting relationship-but I also gave all of the resources that he never really had. Allies are very important-but not when they take advantage of U.S'.

The former United States Marine Corps general commanded the 1st Marine Division during the 2003 invasion of Iraq.

He later served as the Commander of United States Central Command under Obama.

Trump made waves Wednesday at the Pentagon by announcing his withdrawal of America's mid-size military contingent stationed in Syria.

The decision, reached Tuesday in a small group meeting at the White House, didn't include consultation with Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

Mattis and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo were in the room. Both objected.

Trump declared this week that his administration has won the war against the ISIS terror army, even though the Pentagon has said the group still has 30,000 soldiers in Iraq and Syria.

Mattis has long been rumored to be on the way out - talk that Trump declined to shoot down.

Asked in October during a '60 Minutes' interview whether his Pentagon chief might be on his way out, President Trump responded: 'Well, I don't know. He hasn't told me that.'

'I have a very good relationship with him. It could be that he is. I think he's sort of a Democrat, if you want to know the truth,' he said.

'But General Mattis is a good guy. We get along very well. He may leave. I mean, at some point, everybody leaves. Everybody. People leave. That's Washington.'

Secretary of Defense James Mattis's letter of resignation

December 20, 2018

Dear Mr. President:

I have been privileged to serve as our country's 26th Secretary of Defense which has allowed me to serve alongside our men and women of the Department in defense of our citizens and our ideals.

I am proud of the progress that has been made over the past two years on some of the key goals articulated in our National Defense Strategy: putting the Department on a more sound budgetary footing, improving readiness and lethality in our forces, and reforming the Department's business practices for greater performance. Our troops continue to provide the capabilities needed to prevail in con?ict and sustain strong U.S. global influence.

One core belief I have always held is that our strength as a nation is inextricably linked to the strength of our unique and comprehensive system of alliances and partnerships. While the US remains the indispensable nation in the free world, we cannot protect our interests or serve that role effectively without maintaining strong alliances and showing respect to those allies. Like you, I have said from the beginning that the armed forces of the United States should not be the policeman of the world. Instead, we must use all tools of American power to provide for the common defense, including providing effective leadership to our alliances. NATO's 29 democracies demonstrated that strength in their commitment to fighting alongside us following the 9-11 attack on America. The Defeat-ISIS coalition of 74 nations is further proof.

Similarly, I believe we must be resolute and unambiguous in our approach to those countries whose strategic interests are increasingly in tension with ours. It is clear that China and Russia, for example, want to shape a world consistent with their authoritarian model gaining veto authority over other nations? economic, diplomatic, and security decisions to promote their own interests at the expense of their neighbors, America and our allies. That is why we must use all the tools of American power to provide for the common defense.

My views on treating allies with respect and also being clear-eyed about both malign actors and strategic competitors are strongly held and informed by over four decades of immersion in these issues. We must do everything possible to advance an international order that is most conducive to our security, prosperity and values, and we are strengthened in this effort by the solidarity of our alliances.

Because you have the right to have a Secretary of Defense whose views are better aligned with yours on these and other subjects, I believe it is right for me to step down from my position. The end date for my tenure is February 28, 2019, a date that should allow sufficient time for a successor to be nominated and confimed as well as to make sure the Department's interests are properly articulated and protected at upcoming events to include Congressional posture hearings and the NATO Defense Ministerial meeting in February. Further, that a full transition to a new Secretary of Defense occurs well in advance of the transition of Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in September in order to ensure stability Within the Department.

I pledge my full effort to a smooth transition that ensures the needs and interests of the 2.15 million Service Members and 732,079 civilians receive undistracted attention of the Department at all times so that they can fulfill their critical, round-the-clock mission to protect the American people.

I very much appreciate this opportunity to serve the nation and our men and women in uniform.

James N. Mattis"

President Trump and Melania made their second unannounced visit to US troops abroad around 8pm ET as they visited troops on the German base of Ramstein.

The First Couple were on their way back from meeting troops in Iraq when Air Force One stopped to refuel and meet service members carrying MAGA hats who had waited up until around 4am local time.

Trump and Melania landed safely back in the US in the early hours of Thursday morning as they waved to the crowds following their visit.

Upon his return, the President tweeted: 'Just returned from visiting our troops in Iraq and Germany. One thing is certain, we have incredible people representing our Country - people that know how to win!'

It came hours after President Trump's first visit to a war zone with his three-hour trip to the Al Asad airbase, west of Baghdad.

The president delivered a speech to the rank and file, took selfies with the troops and met with military leaders in Iraq. He did not meet with the country's prime minister but spoke to him over the phone.

Melania Trump was giving us some serious outerwear envy when she wore this emerald coat by Prada as she returned from visiting our troops in Iraq.

Melania previously wore this coat last December, and it is still as stylish as it was back then.

She layered it over a pair of tan leather leggings and a pair of red soled ballet flats from Louboutin. It was an elegant but casual look that we could see blending in perfectly on a military base or the Upper East Side.

You can't go wrong with a classic wool coat for winter and this one is infusing us with the holiday spirit with its spruce hue, belted details and shiny buttons.

Trump took to Twitter after returning to the White House calling the troops he met on his surprise visit 'incredible people'

Abdul-Mahdi's office said in a statement that 'differences in points of view over the arrangements' prevented the two from meeting face-to-face, but they discussed security issues and Trump's order to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria.

The White House said security concerns and the short notice of the trip prevented them from meeting.

Iraqi lawmakers told Reuters that the pair had disagreed over where their planned meeting should take place: Trump had asked to meet at the Ain al-Asad military base, an offer which Abdul-Mahdi declined.

The President offered the Iraqi leader to meet in D.C. at a later date.

'I want to come and pay my respects most importantly to the great soldiers,' Trump said on the visit. 'Great troopers we have here.'

Trump announced last week that he's pulling American troops out of neighboring Syria, because the U.S. had 'defeated ISIS' in the nation that's also mired in a civil war.

'We've knocked them out. We've knocked them silly,' he said of the U.S. assault on ISIS in Syria on Wednesday.

He claimed that in Iraq that the terror group had been 'very nearly defeated' altogether and Turkey and other regional powers will finish the job.

'We're no longer the suckers, folks,' the president said of the decision to start packing up. 'We're respected again as a nation.'

Trump's Press Secretary, Sarah Sanders, tweeted a photo of the President meeting with senior military brass aboard Air Force One on Wednesday

President Trump said he does not plan to withdraw troops from Iraq, however, and could use the site as the home base for future operations in the region, according to Bloomberg News.

'If we see something happening with ISIS that we don't like, we can hit them so fast and so hard they really won't know what the hell happened,' he proclaimed.

Al Asad is roughly 185 kilometers outside of Syria, where the president last week initiated a withdrawal of 2,000 U.S. troops. It is west of Baghdad, the capital of Iraq, which is approximately 220 kilometers to the base's east.

Trump never served in the military, having received a medical diagnosis that he had bone spurs. It helped him receive an exemption from mandatory service during the Vietnam War.

The daughters of the doctor who provided the medical excuse came forward before the president was known to be in Iraq on Wednesday to claim that their father offered the diagnosis as a favor to the Trumps.

Never before had President Trump been to a war zone before his secret trip at Christmas that followed announcements that his secretary of defense and ISIS point man were leaving the administration.

Both General James Mattis and Brett McGurk tendered their resignations after Trump's realignment of the United States' military posture in the country that's closely aligned with Iran and Russia.

Trump said Wednesday that his 'generals' had received multiple six-month 'extensions' to get out of Syria.

'They said again, recently, can we have more time? I said, ""Nope. You can't have any more time. You've had enough time. We've knocked them out. We've knocked them silly,"" ' he said of ISIS' operations in Syria. 'I will tell you that I've had some very good talks with President Erdogan who wants to knock them out also and he'll do it. And others will do it to. Because we are in their region. They should be sharing the burden of costs and they're not.'

The president had spoken to Turkey's Recep Erdogan prior to his Iraq trip and was invited on the call to visit Ankara. He did not appear to have taken the leader who has begun amassing tanks on his border with Syria up on the offer before leaving the Middle East for a second undisclosed destination.

In Iraq, the president described an odd-couple coalition of Turkey and Saudi Arabia that he says will finish ISIS off and rebuild Syria.

'The United States cannot continue to be the policeman of the world,' he said. 'It's not fair when the burden is all on us, the United States.'

Trump said he didn't want the U.S. to be 'taken advantage of any more by countries that use us and use our incredible military to protect them' as he complained that 'they don't pay for it, and they're going to have to.'

'In Syria, Erdogan said he wants to knock out ISIS, whatever's left, the remnants of ISIS. And Saudi Arabia just came out and said they are going to pay for some economic development. Which is great, that means we don't have to pay,' he rejoiced. 'We are spread out all over the world. We are in countries most people haven't even heard about. Frankly, it's ridiculous.'

Lawmakers on Capitol Hill had been highly critical of Trump's sudden withdrawal from Syria and have promised vigorous oversight of the policy he elected to share with the world before alerting them. They worry that he's making a mistake yanking U.S. forces at a time that generals like Mattis and people close to the situation like McGurk say is too early.

Still, Trump confidently told reporters Wednesday, 'It's time for us to start using our head. We don't want to be taken advantage of anymore.'

Legislators wouldn't have been alerted that Trump was traveling to Iraq this week, either, as the trip demands absolute secrecy to keep the president and his entourage safe. The president told reporters that he had actually planned previous trips to the region that had to be canceled 'because people were finding out' and it created a dangerous situation for the instiution.

'Pretty sad when you spend 7 trillion dollars in the Middle East and going in has to be under this massive cover with planes all over and all of the greatest equipment in the world and you do everything to get in safely. Pretty sad when you spend 7 trillion dollars and you have to come in through military escorts and all of the other incredible things that they did,' he griped.

Trump had reportedly avoided a trip to the region out of fear that he could be killed, but he said Wednesday that he was afraid for his wife and not himself.

'I had concerns about the institution of the presidency. Not for myself personally. I had concerns for the first lady, I will tell you,' he said. 'But if you would have seen what we had to go through in the darkened plane with all window closed with no light anywhere. Pitch black. I've been on many airplanes. All types and shapes and sizes.'

The president and first lady posed for selfies with the troops before President Trump delivered a speech to U.S. forces stationed there. President Trump said one of the young men told him in the dining hall that he'd left the military and reenlisted because of the current commander in chief.

'He came back into the military because of me,' Trump repeated. The president turned back to the soldier to tell him, 'And I am here because of you.'

Before the president addressed the troops in a hangar rally, the first lady greeted soldiers, telling them, 'I am proud of you.'

Her husband told the United States will defeat the terrorists. 'If anything should happen at all, nobody will ever have suffered the consequences they had suffered,' he asserted.

President Trump had said a month ago that he would visit Afghanistan at some point but visited Iraq first.

'It's a place I have been talking about for many years, many many years,' he told journalists on Wednesday in a reference to his past claims that the U.S. shouldn't have waged war in Iraq after 9/11 and that it should have taken the oil as restitution. 'I was talking about it as a civilian,' he reminded.

The secret trip came amid speculation that President Trump was not at the White House, because he had not tweeted for more than 12 hours and the marine that stands guard when he's in the Oval Office was not outside the West Wing.

In a statement posted on Twitter, Sanders confirmed the visit in a tweet shortly after the wire service Reuters published photos of the president.

'President Trump and the First Lady traveled to Iraq late on Christmas night to visit with our troops and Senior Military leadership to thank them for their service, their success, and their sacrifice and to wish them a Merry Christmas,' she said.

President Trump suggested last month that he could visit a 'war zone' soon after a report claimed that he was avoiding Afghanistan out concern for his personal safety.

'No, I'm going to a war zone,' the president told reporters as he left the White House over his Thanksgiving break.

He didn't say whether he intended to visit troops in Iraq or Afghanistan, or when he might do so. He said in an interview that he hadn't taken the trip yet because he'd been so busy his first 22 months in office.

'I've been very busy with everything that's taking place here,' he explained.

Previous presidents have scheduled closely-held surprise trips to war zones to visit with U.S. troops stationed overseas, sometimes timed to the holidays, including George W. Bush. The former Republican president made history when he visited the country in 2003 at Thanksgiving.

Former President Barack Obama made his first and only trip to Iraq three months after taking office in 2009. He made also surprise visits to Afghanistan in 2010, 2012, and 2014.

Obama's first Afghanistan visit came over Memorial Day weekend under the cover of darkness roughly 15 months into office. His White House claimed that he was spending the holiday at Camp David, only to gather reporters in secret at Andrews Air Force Base for the covert trip.

President Trump also left overnight from Andrews under a cloud of secrecy. Reporters traveling with him were barred from sharing their whereabouts until he had left the conflict zone. Credible reports on social media that Air Force One had been spotted in foreign air space, though, tipped off some that a secret trip was afoot.

The president's national security adviser, John Bolton, and Sanders were traveling with President Trump.

Senior White House policy adviser Stephen Miller, social media director Dan Scavino, spokeswoman Lindsay Walters and Melania Trump's chief of staff Lindsay Reynolds and spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham were also aboard Air Force One.

Outgoing White House Chief of Staff John Kelly, a retired marine general whose final day working for Trump is next week, did not join his boss on the unannounced trip abroad. Incoming chief Mick Mulvaney, who wears two hats now as Office of Management and Budget head and head of the West Wing, did not make the trip, either.

Mulvaey's office oversees the shutdown that affects a quarter of the federal government.

Meanwhile some of Iraqi political and militia leaders condemned Trump's surprise visit as a violation of Iraq's sovereignty.

Sabah al Saadi, the leader of the Islah parliamentary bloc, called for an emergency session of parliament 'to discuss this blatant violation of Iraq's sovereignty and to stop these aggressive actions by Trump who should know his limits: The U.S. occupation of Iraq is over.'

The Bina bloc, Islah's rival in parliament and led by Iran-backed militia leader Hadi al-Amiri, also objected to Trump's trip to Iraq.

'Trump's visit is a flagrant and clear violation of diplomatic norms and shows his disdain and hostility in his dealings with the Iraqi government,' said a statement from Bina.

Trump speaks to U.S. troops after making surprise visit to Iraq

President Donald Trump and his aides may have accidentally revealed classified information on social media by showing the faces of an elite team of Navy SEALs that has been deployed to Iraq.

Trump, First Lady Melania Trump, and other senior White House aides made a surprise visit to soldiers at Al Asad Air Base in Iraq on Wednesday.

The President and First Lady met with troops, posed for selfies, and signed autographs after news media headlines blasted Trump for not traveling to combat zones during the first two years of his presidency.

After the brief visit, when Air Force One had left Iraqi airspace, Trump posted a video on his Twitter feed.

It was set to Lee Greenwood's God Bless the USA, a song that the President frequently plays at his campaign rallies.

The video shows the President and First Lady posing for pictures with a number of soldiers that appear to be from SEAL Team Five, an elite special forces unit based out of Coronado, California.

The President is seen shaking hands with members of the group, who were wearing full battle gear and special night vision goggles.

During Trump's visit to the base, he paused to take a selfie with U.S. Navy Lieutenant Commander Kyu Lee.

Lee told the President that he was the chaplain for SEAL Team Five, according to Newsweek.

'Hey, in that case, let's take a picture,' Lee said the President told him.

Current and former Pentagon officials told Newsweek that information about which units are deployed and where is almost always classified.

Revealing such information, particularly when those soldiers are deployed to an active combat zone, is a violation of operational security.

Any videos uploaded to social media showing special forces soldiers almost always have their faces blurred so as not to reveal their identities, according to Newsweek.

'Operational security is the most important aspect of personnel deployments,' Malcolm Nance, a former U.S. Navy intelligence specialist who has experience in Iraq, told Newsweek.

'The real names, faces, and identities, of personnel involved in special operations or activities, are usually a closely held secret in a combat zone.

'Revealing them casually, through an unusual media exposure even if it's the commander in chief, would prove a propaganda boom if any of this personnel are detained by a hostile government or captured by a terrorist group.

'There would be no denying who you are and what you do.'

A Defense Department official told Newsweek: 'Even during special operation demonstrations for congressional delegations or for the president or vice president, personnel either have their faces covered or their face is digitally blurred prior to a release to the general public.'

'I don't recall another time where special operation forces had to pose with their faces visible while serving in a war zone,' the official said.

The White House, the Pentagon, and Naval Special Warfare Command have yet to comment."
314,the huffington post,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/donald-trump-fact-check_us_5c3589a5e4b0f5aba7d95c23,"President Donald Trump addressed the nation live from the Oval Office on Tuesday night in an attempt to drum up support for his border wall. But the 10-minute address, carried on every major television network in America, was rife with double-speak, cherry-picked statistics and outright falsehoods.

Take a look at some of the biggest lies from the president's speech below.

""The wall will always be paid for indirectly by the great new trade deal we have made with Mexico.""

After abandoning his campaign pledge that Mexico would directly pay for a barrier along the southern border, Trump has instead insisted in recent months that the country would do so indirectly through a revised North American Free Trade Agreement.

However, both economists and trade experts have said that won't be the case. First, the revised trade deal hasn't been approved by Congress yet, and any economic benefits would simply come from lower tariffs or increased wages for Americans. Those benefits will be dwarfed by the actual cost of the wall, many outside experts say, and it'll be American taxpayers who will ultimately pay for the massive structure if it goes forward.

""Our southern border is a pipeline for vast quantities of illegal drugs, including meth, heroin, cocaine and fentanyl.""

More than 90 percent of heroin sold in the United States does come from Mexico, but almost all of it is transported through legal ports of entry. Only a ""small percentage of all heroin seized by CBP along the land border was between Ports of Entry,"" the Drug Enforcement Administration said in a report last year.

Fentanyl, a major narcotic that has led to a spate of drug overdoses, mainly comes into the United States through packages mailed from China and has been difficult for border agents to detect, according to The New York Times.

Trump also said illicit drugs cost the U.S. some $500 billion annually, but a surgeon general report in 2015 estimated that toll at around a third of the president's figure, or $193 billion.

""Last month, 20,000 migrant children were illegally brought into the United States, a dramatic increase. These children are used as human pawns by vicious coyotes and ruthless gangs.""

Customs and Border Protection reported in November that a little more than 20,000 ""family units"" were captured at the southern border. But only a small percentage of these family units have been determined to be a ploy in an attempt to sneak over the border, according to an analysis by The Washington Post.

The majority of migrant children are accompanied by their parents or other relatives.

""Democrats in Congress have refused to acknowledge the crisis. And they have refused to provide our brave border agents with the tools they desperately need to protect our families and our nation.""

""The federal government remains shut down for one reason and one reason only: because Democrats will not fund border security.""

Trump accused Democrats in Congress of holding up the government shutdown by stonewalling negotiations on border security. In fact, Democrats offered to allocate $1.3 billion in the budget for border security, which included building and refurbishing barriers at the border.

During a meeting with Trump in December, Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) and Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) agreed with the president that the country needed border security. They also asked Trump if he would be willing to budge from his $5.7 billion request.

In that same meeting, Trump maintained that he would keep the government shutdown going if he didn't get what he wanted, contradicting Tuesday night's address where he solely blamed Democrats for the shutdown.

""Yes, if we don't get what we want, one way or the other -- whether it's through you, through a military, through anything you want to call -- I will shut down the government. Absolutely,"" Trump said in December.

He added: ""I am proud to shut down the government for border security.""

""Sen. Chuck Schumer, who you will be hearing from later tonight, has repeatedly supported a physical barrier in the past along with many other Democrats,"" Trump said. ""They changed their mind only after I was elected president.""

Schumer did previously support a bill that allowed for the construction of a fence along the U.S.-Mexico border, but that fence pales in comparison to the ""big, beautiful"" 30-foot concrete wall that Trump promised his supporters.

In 2006, Schumer, along with then-Sens. Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, Joe Biden and 22 other Democrats, voted for the Secure Fence Act, which authorized a fence to be built along 700 miles of the border and included short vehicle barriers and additional surveillance.

Trump's plans for his border wall vary over time and are vague, but here's what we do know: According to a 2017 executive order, it would be an ""impassable physical barrier,"" which Trump first proclaimed would be made of concrete before switching to ""steel slats."" He's also said the wall had to be 30 feet or higher.

As Trump pointed out himself while campaigning for president in 2015, his border wall would be nothing like a fence.

""It's not a fence,"" Trump said in a tweet addressed to Jeb Bush. ""It's a WALL, and there's a BIG difference!""

""In the last two years, ICE officers made 266,000 arrests of aliens with criminal records, including those charged or convicted of 100,000 assaults, 30,000 sex crimes, and 4,000 violent killings. Over the years, thousands of Americans have been brutally killed by those who illegally entered our country, and thousands more lives will be lost if we don't act right now.""

The statistics that Trump uses are mostly accurate, though he frames it in a way to make immigrants crossing the border more dangerous than they actually are.

According to ICE's year-end report, the agency arrested 210,876 people with previous criminal convictions and 55,233 people with pending charges -- but the criminal convictions include such non-violent offenses as DUIs and other traffic violations.

The second set of numbers he provides are based on specific charges and convictions. As the Washington Post's Salvador Rizzo pointed out, ""In many cases, the people arrested face multiple counts, so that switch [to focusing on charges and convictions] gives a confusing picture.""

""At the request of Democrats it will be a steel barrier rather than a concrete wall.""

The reality: Democrats don't want a wall. Period. They do, however, want an end to the shutdown.

""The fact is: We all agree that we need to secure our borders, while honoring our values,"" Pelosi said in the Democrats' rebuttal speech. ""We can build the infrastructure and roads at our ports of entry; we can install new technology to scan cars and trucks for drugs coming into our nation; we can hire the personnel we need to facilitate trade and immigration at the border; and we can fund more innovation to detect unauthorized crossings.""

""Make no mistake: Democrats and the president both want stronger border security,"" Schumer added. ""However, we sharply disagree with the president about the most effective way to do it."""
315,bbc news,https://www.bbc.com/news/business-46787840,"World Bank President, Jim Yong Kim has made the surprise announcement that he is stepping down after six years in the post.

His resignation will take effect from 1 February.

Mr Kim, 59, was not due to leave until 2022, after he was re-elected for a second five-year term in 2017.

He will ""join a firm and focus on increasing infrastructure investments in developing countries"", the World Bank said.

In a statement, Mr Kim said: ""It has been a great honour to serve as President of this remarkable institution, full of passionate individuals dedicated to the mission of ending extreme poverty in our lifetime"".

No reason was given for his unexpected resignation.

Kristalina Georgieva, the World Bank's chief executive officer, will assume the role of interim president.

So he hasn't actually gone yet, but we can still start thinking about who will take over. I am not going to speculate about particular candidates so much as about one big international political sore that will probably flare up again. Will it once again be a United States nominee that gets the job as it always has been?

It goes back to an understanding when the Bank was created in the 1940s, after the Second World War: an American would run the World Bank; a European would be in charge of the International Monetary Fund. That's the way it has always been. It's an arrangement that many regard as anachronistic. The two institutions now have more formalised selection procedures, and the recent preferred European and US candidates have faced challenges. Jim Yong Kim - a Korean American nominated by the Obama Administration - was up against a Colombian and a Nigerian when he was first appointed.

So far, the post-war understanding has prevailed. Will the US under President Trump be open to the idea of ending that arrangement? It would be quite a surprise.

Mr Kim has avoided public clashes with President Trump, but his policy approach was sometimes at odds with the president's approach to climate change.

Under Mr Kim, the World Bank has ended its support of coal power projects - in contrast to Mr Trump's promise to revive the US coal industry.

In April, Mr Kim bowed to pressure from the Trump administration over loan payments to China. The World Bank agreed to change its lending structure in order to secure a $13bn capital increase.

The World Bank has a remit to finance international development projects. Formed in 1947 to help rebuild European countries devastated by World War II, it supports infrastructure projects with traditional loans, interest-free credits, and grants.

Mr Kim, who was born in Seoul, South Korea, trained as a medical doctor before rising through the ranks at the Bank.

He was nominated by former president Barack Obama for both his first and second term at the head of the World Bank.

The World Bank said it would ""immediately start the process"" of appointing a replacement.

Traditionally, the president of the World Bank has been nominated by the US, while the head of its sister institution, the International Monetary Fund has been picked by European countries. However, when Mr Kim was first appointed in 2012, there was growing pressure from countries in the southern hemisphere for a candidate from an emerging market country to be chosen.

Positioned at 41 in Forbes' Power People 2018 list, Mr Kim has presided over the dispersal of billions of dollars of World Bank funding. In 2018, the multilateral institution made financial commitments worth $67bn."
316,daily mail online,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6566013/Trump-head-border-Thursday-amid-shutdown-standoff.html,"President Donald Trump will address the nation Tuesday night in a prime time speech to address the ongoing government shutdown and his demands for a $5.7 billion border wall.

But the four broadcast networks were debating whether to give what amounts to free air time to the president, who on Monday unleashed another one of his attacks on the 'fake news' media.

CBS announced Monday night it would air the remarks and revealed the address would only be 8 minutes long. Cable networks CNN, Fox News and Fox Business Network also confirmed they will air the president's speech.

It was not immediately clear whether the other broadcast networks would comply with the White House request to have them air the speech - which would provide some of the dramatic flair Trump is looking for with the event.

The president has thus far struggled to break through with in-house video presentations from the South Lawn of the White House where he speaks directly to the camera.

The four major broadcast networks were deliberating on whether to carry the speech live, CNN reported earlier Monday. Another consideration was whether to allow Democrats equal time to respond.

Trump confirmed the news of his prime time speech on Twitter, shortly after the White House announced Trump will be traveling to the southern border in another high-profile effort to brake through the budget stalemate.

'I am pleased to inform you that I will Address the Nation on the Humanitarian and National Security crisis on our Southern Border. Tuesday night at 9:00 P.M. Eastern,' the president tweeted.

CNN and Fox News said they would carry the event, while it was under discussion at MSNBC was still deliberating Monday late afternoon.

President Donald Trump is heading back to the U.S.-Mexico border with no end in sight to the partial government shutdown

Presidents traditionally on occasion make formal requests for time from the networks' carefully planned schedules, and networks - who operate under federal license - sometimes comply.

Before the president confirmed the speech, the New York Times reported that Trump 'wants to address the nation' about the government shutdown, where Trump's demand for a border wall is the primary sticking point.

The White House didn't respond to a request for information about when it put in the request to the networks.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's office didn't respond to a request for comment about whether Democrats would seek time to respond and whether she would offer it.

Earlier Monday, Trump tore into the 'fake news' media, accusing the press of making up stories and ignoring positive statistics about job growth. He lashed out at members of the press as 'crazed lunatics.'

Although a president can give a speech whenever he wants, it only has maximum impact if carried live, and networks are usually loathe to interrupt their prime-time lineups unless they believe the speech is a legitimate news event, not just talking points.

Trump will speak from the Oval Office, Axios, adding to the visual drama - although the president has held so many impromptu events there that it could blunt the effect.

The president announced the speech on Twitter

Last Thursday, the network decided to cut away from Trump at what was billed as a 'press briefing' but where Trump, backed by border patrol officials, did not ultimately take questions and stressed his main talking points.

Airtime isn't something the president can simply demand. The task of feeling out the networks would likely fall to Bill Shine, deputy White House chief of staff for communications, to urge network executives to carry the speech.

In doing so, the former Fox News exec would have to vouch for the newsworthiness of the speech.

Tuesday night's prime time lineup includes a 'Lethal Weapon' reboot on Fox, 'black-ish' on ABC, Ellen's 'Game of Games' on NBC, and 'FBI' on CBS. Networks face giving up ad-revenue for programs that don't air.

The networks decided not to air an immigration address by President Barack Obama in 2014 on the grounds that it looked to be more partisan than newsworthy, though they did air a prime-time address by President George W. Bush in 2006.

Trump's pitch about what the administration says is a crisis on the border would preempt prime time programming, including Ellen's 'Game of Games' on NBC

CNN media correspondent Brian Stelter tweeted about an executive's take on the decision in light of Trump's attacks. 'TV exec texts: 'He calls us fake news all the time, but needs access to airwaves... If we give him the time, he'll deliver a fact-free screed without rebuttal. And if we don't give him the time, he'll call every network partisan. So we are damned if we do and damned if we don't.'

To that, former Obama speechwriter Jon Favreau responded: 'Except they didn't give Obama time in 2014 because they believed his speech about immigration would be ""overtly partisan."" So this should be a relatively easy decision.'

Trump's double-barreled plan to break through the politics of the shutdown comes as the White House revealed he is heading back to the U.S.-Mexico border as he doubles down on his demand for a wall amid the ongoing government shutdown.

The president 'will travel to the Southern border on Thursday to meet with those on the frontlines of the national security and humanitarian crisis,' White House press secretary Sarah Sanders tweeted Monday.

'More details will be announced soon.'

White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders confirmed the trip on Thursday as the partial government shutdown was on its third week

The move is immediately taken as a signal that Trump intends to dig in on his demand that Democrats provide $5.6 billion for construction of a border wall - a 2016 campaign pledge that is at the center of the partial government shutdown.

He has stuck by that financial demand - even after he said he would show flexibility on the wall being constructed out of steel instead of out of concrete. He said a steel wall would actually be more expensive.

'The barrier or the wall can be steel instead of concrete if that helps people. It may be better,' Trump said Sunday.

He also said he would call major steel companies asking them to design a wall - which would be a long way from core missions of smelting, procuring materials, and running a factory.

'I intend the call the heads of United States Steel and a couple of other of our great steel companies. I will have them come up with a template or design of a beautiful steel product, which we now may use and use that as our barrier,' he said.

Trump also has said Mexico will pay for the wall, something he says will be accomplished by a new U.S.-Mexico trade deal that has yet to go through Congress.

The trip to the border comes after Trump tasked top aides along with Vice President Mike Pence and son-in-law Jared Kushner to try to negotiated an end go the standoff that has kept 800,000 workers from either going to work or getting paid.

Even as he demands Congress fund the wall, Trump said on Sunday he's looking at his options to get the wall built,including declaring a national emergency.

'I may declare national emergency dependent on what going to happen in the next few days,' Trump said.

'Congressman Adam Smith, the new Chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, just stated, 'Yes, there is a provision in law that says a president can declare an emergency. It's been done a number of times.' No doubt, but let's get our deal done in Congress!,' the president tweeted Monday.

But Smith also warned Trump 'would be wide open to a court challenge' if he made such a move."
317,the huffington post,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/brett-mcgurk-anti-isis-coalition-quits-trump-syria_us_5c1e6fdae4b05c88b6f932d2,"WASHINGTON (AP) -- Brett McGurk, the U.S. envoy to the global coalition fighting the Islamic State group, has resigned in protest to President Donald Trump's abrupt decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria, joining Defense Secretary Jim Mattis in an administration exodus of experienced national security officials.

Only 11 days ago, McGurk had said it would be ""reckless"" to consider IS defeated and therefore would be unwise to bring American forces home. He decided to speed up his plan to leave in mid-February.

McGurk, appointed to the post by President Barack Obama in 2015 and retained by Trump, said in his resignation letter that the militants were on the run, but not yet defeated, and that the premature pullout of American forces from Syria would create the conditions that gave rise to IS. McGurk also cited gains in accelerating the campaign against IS, but that the work was not yet done.

His letter, submitted Friday to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, was described to The Associated Press on Saturday by an official familiar with its contents. The official was not authorized to publicly discuss the matter before the letter was released and spoke on condition of anonymity.

McGurk, whose resignation is effective Dec. 31, was planning to leave the job in mid-February after a U.S.-hosted meeting of foreign ministers from the coalition countries, but he felt he could continue no longer after Trump's decision to withdraw from Syria and Mattis' resignation, according to the official.

Trump is acting to pull all 2,000 U.S. troops from Syria and has now declared victory over IS, contradicting his own experts' assessments. Many lawmakers have called his action rash and dangerous.

Mattis, perhaps the most respected foreign policy official in the administration, announced on Thursday that he will leave by the end of February. He told Trump in a letter that he was departing because ""you have a right to have a Secretary of Defense whose views are better aligned with yours.""

The U.S. began airstrikes in Syria in 2014, and ground troops moved in the following year to battle IS and train Syrian rebels in a country torn apart by civil war. Trump, in a tweet this past week, abruptly declared their mission accomplished.

The decision will fulfill Trump's goal of bringing troops home from Syria, but military leaders have pushed back for months, arguing that the IS group remains a threat and could regroup in Syria's long-running civil war. U.S. policy has been to keep troops in place until the extremists are eradicated.

McGurk said at a State Department briefing on Dec. 11 that ""it would be reckless if we were just to say, 'Well, the physical caliphate is defeated, so we can just leave now.' I think anyone who's looked at a conflict like this would agree with that.""

A week before that, Gen. Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the U.S. had a long way to go in training local Syrian forces to prevent a resurgence of IS and stabilize Syria. He said it would take 35,000 to 40,000 local troops in northeastern Syria to maintain security over the long term, but only about 20 percent of that number had been trained.

McGurk, 45, previously served as a deputy assistant secretary of state for Iraq and Iran, and during the negotiations for the landmark Iran nuclear deal by the Obama administration, led secret side talks with Tehran on the release of Americans imprisoned there.

McGurk, was briefly considered for the post of ambassador to Iraq after having served as a senior official covering Iraq and Afghanistan during President George W. Bush's administration.

A former Supreme Court law clerk to the late Chief Justice William Rehnquist, McGurk worked as a lawyer for the Coalition Provisional Authority in Iraq after the 2003 U.S.-led invasion and joined Bush's National Security Council staff, where in 2007 and 2008, he was the lead U.S. negotiator on security agreements with Iraq.

Taking over for now for McGurk will be his deputy, retired Lt. Gen. Terry Wolff, who served three tours of active duty in Iraq.

Jim Jeffrey, a veteran diplomat who was appointed special representative for Syria engagement in August, is expected to stay in his position, officials said.

IS militants still hold a string of villages and towns along the Euphrates River in eastern Syria, where they have resisted weeks of attacks by the U.S.-supported Syrian Democratic Forces to drive them out. The pocket is home to about 15,000 people, among them 2,000 IS fighters, according to U.S. military estimates.

But that figure could be as high as 8,000 militants, if fighters hiding out in the deserts south of the Euphrates River are also counted, according to according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which monitors the conflict through networks of local informants.

The SDF, a Kurdish-led force that is America's only military partner in Syria, said Thursday: ""The war against Islamic State has not ended and the group has not been defeated."" The group is at the front lines of the battle against IS along the Euphrates River.

It said a U.S. withdrawal would leave Syrians ""between the claws of enemy forces.""

At their height in 2014, Islamic State militants controlled approximately a third of territory in Syria and Iraq, including major cities in both countries. The group flourished in the political vacuum of Syria's civil war, in which President Bashar Assad has violently put down a 2011 uprising against his family's 40-year rule."

Barack Obama wished his followers a very happy holiday Tuesday in a sweet post on Instagram.

""Enjoy the holiday season with the ones you love. Michelle and I wish you a very Merry Christmas!"" he captioned the picture.

The photo showed the former president kissing a smiling Michelle Obama under the mistletoe.

Just a few days ago, Obama dressed up as the big man himself -- donning a red Santa hat and carrying a big bag of toys for a visit to the Children's National Hospital in Washington, D.C., on behalf of the Obama Foundation.

""There's no better time than the holiday season to give back to your community and spread some holiday cheer,"" he wrote. ""As we celebrate the season and look forward to the New Year, let's recommit to doing our part to build a world that is a little more generous, tolerant, and kind.""

He also addressed the hospital staff during his visit -- and spoke from the perspective of a parent, not a president.

""As a dad of two girls, I can only imagine in that situation -- to have nurses and staff and doctors and people who are caring for them and looking after them and listening to them and just there for them and holding their hand -- that's the most important thing there is,"" he said. ""What a great reminder of what the holiday spirit is supposed to be all about.""

Last week, former White House photographer Pete Souza also shared sweet photos -- with snappy captions -- of the Obamas celebrating the holiday season during their tenure in the White House.

""Back when our President was sane, and it was okay if he tried to dance with Santa Claus,"" Souza wrote.

Souza also poked fun at a tweet from President Donald Trump on Monday in which Trump said he was in the White House ""all alone.""

""Back when our President was not alone,"" Souza wrote.

On Christmas Eve, Trump and his wife, Melania, spent the evening speaking with children who called in to the North American Aerospace Defense Command in an attempt to track Santa.

""Are you still a believer in Santa Claus?"" the president asked one child. ""Cause at seven, it's marginal, right?""

On Christmas Day, Trump tweeted out a simple message."
319,daily mail online,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6539219/Nebraska-center-monitors-person-possible-Ebola-exposure.html,"The Ebola virus virus can be transmitted between humans through blood, secretions and other bodily fluids of people - and surfaces - that have been infected

An American who was providing medical assistance in Congo may have been exposed to the deadly Ebola virus and is being monitored at a Nebraska medical center.

The unnamed physician, 39, showed no symptoms of the deadly disease and was transported to the University of Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha, according to Politico.

The hospital confirmed Saturday that it was housing the person in a secure area that is not accessible to other patients or the public. Spokesman Taylor Wilson says the person arrived Saturday afternoon.

'This person may have been exposed to the virus but is not ill and is not contagious,' said Ted Cieslak, M.D., an infectious diseases specialist. 'Should any symptoms develop, the Nebraska Medicine/UNMC team is among the most qualified in the world to deal with them.'

The medical center is not providing any details to honor the person's request for privacy. The facility also is not identifying the person as a patient or when the person was in Africa.

The University of Nebraska Medical Center in Omaha has treated Ebola patients in the past and maintains a dedicated biocontainment unit

Officials say the person is not ill and has no Ebola symptoms but will be monitored for up to two weeks.

The virus can be transmitted between humans through blood, secretions and other bodily fluids of people - and surfaces - that have been infected, but the medical center has a dedicated biocontainment unit and treated three Ebola patients in 2014.

Working at a missionary hospital in the Democratic Republic of Congo, the doctor treated a patient who would test positive for the Ebola virus, Politico reported.

The experimental Ebola vaccine was administered to the doctor as a post-exposure preventive precaution.

Last month, the World Health Organization declared Congo's deadly Ebola outbreak the second largest in history, behind the devastating West Africa outbreak that killed thousands a few years ago.

Congolese participate in a mock voting in the Eastern Congolese town of Beni on Sunday. The delay of the election until March for Beni and Butembo city is blamed on a deadly Ebola outbreak

In November the WHO declared the Congo's ebola outbreak the second largest in history. Even so, the residents in afflicted areas were determined to take part in a presidential election

Last week, the Congo presidential electoral commission made the surprise decision to bar some 1 million voters in Beni and Butembo, cities in eastern Congo affected by a deadly Ebola outbreak.

Protests followed the decision as people demanded to vote with the rest of the country, and Ebola facilities were attacked. Health teams suspended work for days.

The World Health Organization chief warned that 'prolonged insecurity' could bring a spike in Ebola cases. Congo was dangerously politicizing the outbreak, the International Rescue Committee said.

In 2014, the West African Ebola outbreak spread rapidly drawing international concerns.

In the United States, 11 people were treated for the deadly illness.

The CDC confirmed the first travel-associated case of Ebola diagnosed in the U.S. on September 30, 2014, a man traveling from West Africa to Dallas, Texas who died on October 4. Two healthcare workers who treated him also tested positive for EVD. Both recovered.

A medical aid volunteer in New York City who had worked in Guinea was hospitalized on on October 23 and diagnosed with EVD the next day. The patient recovered.

Seven people were treated for in the U.S. after exposure and illness were originally in West Africa, the majority of whom were medical workers. They were transported to hospitals in the United States. Six patients recovered, while one died.

The public alarm led to politicians to intervene in health policy, such as when then New Jersey Governor Chris Christie's administration supported the quarantining of Nurse Kaci Hickox for three days after doing aid work in Sierra Leone.

Donald Trump, then a private citizen, heavily criticized efforts to treat Ebola patients in America during the 2014 outbreak, echoing concerns of a fearful populace.

In May of this year, President Trump tried to cut $252 million in Ebola funding but backed down after opposition from public health groups and Democrats, according to Politico.

'As a critic of the Trump administration, I have to give them credit for bringing a health worker who may have Ebola to the United States for care,' said Ron Klain, the Ebola response coordinator under the Obama administration. 'Trump recklessly criticized Obama in 2014 for doing the same, but it is good that he is now abandoning that cruel prior view.'

EBOLA IN 2018

The largest Ebola epidemic killed more than 11,000 in the space of two years, centered in West Africa, beginning in 2014.

That outbreak was officially declared over back in January 2016, when Liberia was announced to be Ebola-free by the WHO.

After the brief Équateur province Ebola outbreak in the Democratic Republic of Congo between May and July of 2018, a second outbreak in the DRC erupted in August.

While there were 11 patients with EVD in total treated in the United States, only four patients became ill after they arrived in the United States, either after exposure in West Africa or in a healthcare setting.

Figures show nearly 29,000 people were infected from Ebola - meaning the virus killed around 40 per cent of those it struck.

Cases and deaths were also reported in Nigeria, Mali and the US - but on a much smaller scale, with 15 fatalities between the three nations.

Health officials in Guinea reported a mysterious bug in the south-eastern regions of the country before the WHO confirmed it was Ebola.

Ebola was first identified by scientists in 1976, but the most recent outbreak dwarfed all other ones recorded in history, figures show.

SECOND LARGEST OUTBREAK IN HISTORY

As of December 26, the World Health Organization reports that there are 543 confirmed and 48 probable cases of infection in this latest outbreak, with 357 deaths, making it the largest since the West African outbreak two years ago, and the second largest in history.

The WHO also notes that efforts to manage this latest outbreak are jeopardized by the fact it is taking place in an insecure 'active conflict zone'

Approximately 1,000 civilians have been killed by armed groups and government soldiers around the afflicted city of Beni since 2014, and the wider region of North Kivu holds over 1 million displaced people.

A dispute over a long-delayed democratic presidential election in the region is adding an additional layer of uncertainty to containing and treating the epidemic.

WORLD HEALTH ORGANIZATION - KEY FACTS

Ebola virus disease (EVD), formerly known as Ebola haemorrhagic fever, is a severe, often fatal illness in humans.The virus is transmitted to people from wild animals and spreads in the human population through human-to-human transmission.The average EVD case fatality rate is around 50%. Case fatality rates have varied from 25% to 90% in past outbreaks.The first EVD outbreaks occurred in remote villages in Central Africa, near tropical rainforests. The 2014-2016 outbreak in West Africa involved major urban areas as well as rural ones.Community engagement is key to successfully controlling outbreaks. Good outbreak control relies on applying a package of interventions, namely case management, infection prevention and control practices, surveillance and contact tracing, a good laboratory service, safe and dignified burials and social mobilization.Early supportive care with re-hydration, symptomatic treatment improves survival. There is as yet no licensed treatment proven to neutralize the virus but a range of blood, immunological and drug therapies are under development."
320,the huffington post,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ryan-zinke-interior-department-legacy_us_5c262b14e4b08aaf7a8fd047,"The interior secretary vowed to leave a conservation legacy that would rival Theodore Roosevelt's. Instead, he drank America's milkshake.

The question was about climate change -- the man-made global crisis that Ryan Zinke, as a Montana state senator, once urged President Barack Obama to take action on, but in recent years has become willfully blasé about.

""It appears that the world is laughing at the United States' stance as it relates to climate change,"" CNN correspondent René Marsh told the secretary of the interior, along with acting Environmental Protection Agency Administrator Andrew Wheeler, at a Dec. 11 briefing on EPA's proposal to gut an Obama-era clean water rule. ""What is your response?""

Marsh was referring specifically to protesters disrupting and laughing derisively during a U.S. panel promoting coal, oil and natural gas at the United Nations climate talks in Poland.

Zinke, the muscle of President Donald Trump's ""energy dominance"" agenda, wasn't about to be forced into a discussion of global warming -- not in a room full of like-minded, fossil fuel-friendly Republicans. Instead, he stepped to the microphone and pounded his oil drum. ""I don't think OPEC is laughing,"" he said.

The former Montana congressman and Navy SEAL then reached for his bag of well-aged energy talking points. It was a speech he'd rolled out dozens of times and fine-tuned over his 21 scandal-plagued months as chief steward of America's public lands. He said it's ""better to produce energy in this country under reasonable regulation than to watch it get produced overseas with none."" He invited any doubters in the room to join him on a tour of ""environmental disasters"" that he'd seen in the Middle East and Africa. And he told people he never wanted their children to have to fight overseas for a commodity available right here at home.

In closing, Zinke said he was ""proud"" the United States is now the largest oil and gas producer in the world -- and ""proud of the fact that we're going to get even better.""

The full-throated endorsement of big oil, Zinke's second in as many weeks, would prove to be one of his last public addresses as the agency's chief. It was met with uproarious applause. It was also a fitting coda for a man who, by virtually every measure, failed to ""create a conservation stewardship legacy, second only to Teddy Roosevelt,"" which topped his list of priorities.

Days after the EPA press conference, Trump announced Zinke would step down at the end of the year. Zinke maintains it was a personal decision. In his resignation letter to Trump, he blamed his departure on ""vicious and politically motivated attacks."" But reporting by The Washington Post and others indicates that the embattled secretary, who's faced nearly 20 federal investigations into his conduct and policy decisions, had known for weeks that he was being forced out.

In many ways, Zinke's final month highlights the real legacy he's likely to leave behind: not of stewardship but of cozying up to the industries he was tasked with regulating, rolling back safeguards for the environment and endangered species, and opening millions of acres of public land to drilling and mining.

Sen. Tom Udall (N.M.) was one of 15 Democratic senators who voted to confirm Zinke to the post. That decision, he said, was based on Zinke's assurances that he understood the agency's central mission, and his pledge to lead in the spirit of Roosevelt.

""It is abundantly clear from his time as Interior Secretary that those promises were empty, meaningless, and untrue,"" Udall told HuffPost in an email. ""His tenure was deeply destructive and I would not vote to confirm him again knowing what we know now -- that he always intended to carry the torch for the Trump administration's campaign of relentless attacks on our public lands, waters, Tribal sovereignty, and the environment.""

Zinke has pitched himself as a public land champion in the mold of the 26th president since at least 2009, when he served as a state senator in Montana. Somewhat bizarrely, his top spokeswoman, Heather Swift, who didn't start working for Zinke until he ran for Congress in 2014, takes credit on her resume for developing this Roosevelt-style ""brand,"" writing that it earned her boss ""praise from the energy sector, sportsmen's groups, natural resources trade associations, and traditionally left-leaning conservation organizations alike.""

This image is part of what Trump liked about the fifth-generation Montanan. And it no doubt helped Zinke sail through Senate confirmation. Upon being sworn in, Zinke pledged to ""faithfully uphold Teddy Roosevelt's belief that our treasured public lands are 'for the benefit and enjoyment of the people.'"" A day later, he arrived at the agency's headquarters wearing a 10-gallon cowboy hat and riding a horse -- an apparent tribute to his hero. In his first speech to Interior staff, he talked about the importance of stewardship and plans of a ""bold"" Roosevelt-style reorganization to address future challenges. He promised to ""fight"" Trump on the budget proposal, which at the time called for a 10 percent cut in agency funding.

Instead, Zinke went to bat for industry, prioritizing ending a supposed ""war"" that the Trump administration says the Obama administration waged on fossil fuels. He embraced budget proposals that called for slashing funding for land acquisition and conservation programs, while promoting increased drilling and extraction on public lands. And he quickly proved frustrating for sporting and conservation groups that had high hopes for him.

Collin O'Mara, president of the nonprofit National Wildlife Federation, initially saw Zinke's nomination as a signal that Trump ""intends to keep his promises to America's hunters, anglers and outdoor enthusiasts."" When others turned on Zinke, O'Mara continued to give him a chance to follow through on his stewardship promises and responsibility.

Ultimately, though, Zinke lost O'Mara's support. One day after the resignation announcement, O'Mara published a blistering opinion piece in The Washington Post, writing that ""Zinke's dogged pursuit of unfettered fossil-fuel extraction makes James Watt's disastrous tenure look timid."" Watt, President Ronald Reagan's interior chief, is widely considered among the most anti-environment Cabinet appointees in American history.

O'Mara told HuffPost that the National Wildlife Federation was committed to trying to make progress with Zinke on certain issues, but there was ""a growing realization that conservation was always going to be an afterthought"" to energy production.

""The divide between the rhetoric and the reality just got wider and wider,"" said O'Mara, adding that the potential he saw in Zinke never manifested on the sixth floor of Interior headquarters.

The Interior Department employs more than 70,000 people and manages 500 million acres of federal land -- roughly one-fifth of the U.S. -- including the 59 national parks. The agency can at times seem to be at odds with itself. It has the bifurcated task of preserving and protecting public lands for future generations while also setting policies that govern the exploitation of their natural resources.

The job of any secretary is to find a happy medium. Less than a year in, Zinke declared that he and his team had succeeded in ""striking the right balance."" But a roundtable that he hosted six months later suggested the opposite was true -- and that Zinke knew it. At that May meeting to get input on his sweeping proposal to reorganize the agency, Zinke promised representatives of more than two dozen outdoor sporting and conservation organizations that he would make a ""grand pivot"" away from energy development and toward species and habitat conservation, as E&E News reported.

Some in the room took Zinke at his word, while others were skeptical. O'Mara and Land Tawney, president of the Montana-based nonprofit Backcountry Hunters & Anglers, said there were a few positive conservation initiatives in 2018, such as an order aimed at protecting habitat for big game species and a proposal to tackle the national park system's estimated $12 billion maintenance backlog. But those efforts, they say, pale in comparison to the steady drumbeat of pro-industry actions.

In other words, the grand pivot never arrived.

Theodore Roosevelt IV, a great-grandson of the late president who has blasted the interior secretary for invoking his ancestor, said Zinke's ""bad angels won out.""

""He was marching lockstep with what the president wanted him to do,"" Roosevelt said. ""It's unfortunate.""

Zinke ""disrespected Interior's stewardship mission & its dedicated career staff,"" David Hayes, Interior's deputy secretary under Obama, said on Twitter.

The Interior Department did not respond to HuffPost's request for an interview with the secretary.

The lengths to which Zinke went to ensure a better future for coal, oil, gas and mining interests are impressive. He overturned an Obama-era moratorium on new coal leases on federal land and scrapped a hydraulic fracturing rule meant to protect public health. He rolled back an Obama-era rule limiting the amount of methane, a powerful greenhouse gas, that can be released from oil and gas operations on federal and tribal lands. He proposed opening nearly all U.S. waters to offshore drilling, and moved to weaken key offshore safety regulations adopted in the aftermath of the devastating Deepwater Horizon oil spill. In fiscal 2018, Interior offered more than 12.8 million federal acres for oil and gas leasing, ""triple the average offered during President Barack Obama's second term,"" The New York Times reported. That's an area more than twice the size of Maryland. Some of those leases sold for as little as $1.50 per acre, according to a Times investigation.

The oil and gas industry, a top donor to Zinke's congressional campaigns, applauded the secretary at nearly every turn. Thomas Pyle, president of the American Energy Alliance, said Zinke ""served the country in a way we haven't seen from the federal government's land use agency since the days of President Ronald Reagan.""

""Most importantly, Zinke has unleashed American energy potential by tapping into the vast resource reserves on federal lands and opening up previously unexplored areas to development,"" Pyle said in a statement.

Perhaps just as controversial as Zinke's fossil fuel push were his actions targeting already protected lands. Whereas Roosevelt protected more than 230 million acres of federal land by establishing five national parks, 18 national monuments and dozens of national forests, wildlife refuges and bird reserves, Zinke led the largest reduction of national monuments in American history. Last December, on Zinke's recommendation, Trump cut a collective 2 million acres from a pair of Utah national monuments, Bears Ears and Grand Staircase-Escalante. The move opened the door for oil, mining and other development. Zinke maintained that the rollbacks were not about energy or mineral extraction, but reporting by The Washington Post, The New York Times and other outlets paints a different picture. A Canadian firm has since unveiled plans to mine copper on land stripped from Grand Staircase-Escalante. And despite Zinke's repeated assurances that the administration would not sell or transfer federal lands, the Bureau of Land Management proposed pawning off more than 1,600 acres of former Grand Staircase-Escalante land, as HuffPost first reported. The agency ultimately scrapped that proposal.

Along the way, Zinke peddled industry talking points, misinformation and climate change denial. In a May 2017 op-ed he argued that natural areas can benefit from resource extraction. He claimed California's catastrophic wildfires have ""nothing to do with climate change"" -- then later said ""of course"" it was a factor, without acknowledging the role humans play. And he repeatedly cast doubt on the latest federal climate assessment, which found that greenhouse gas emissions have put the planet on a trajectory toward catastrophic climate change.

He also became a pincushion of ethics probes and unfavorable headlines. He insisted a special flag fly above the agency's headquarters each time he walked through the door, which his team claimed was ""a major sign of transparency."" He accused 30 percent of Interior employees of not being ""loyal to the flag,"" and told an oil and gas industry association that ""our government should work for you."" And he called a top Democratic lawmaker a drunk after he called for Zinke's resignation.

In the end, Zinke's exit was much like his entrance. He said little about protecting America's natural heritage, but he spoke glowingly of oil. His final acts as secretary included pushing the administration one step closer to opening Alaska's fragile Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil and gas drilling, which he said ""stands out among the most impactful"" Interior accomplishments in terms of ""bolstering America's economic strength and security."" (That claim about the economy is highly debatable.) He unveiled a plan to dismantle Obama-era protections for the greater sage grouse, a move that would open up millions of acres of the declining game bird's habitat to energy and mineral development. When a U.S. Geological Survey assessment identified an ocean of previously undiscovered oil and gas reserves in the Permian Basin under Texas and New Mexico, Zinke rejoiced. ""Christmas came a few weeks early,"" he said.

There were moments in his final month in office when Zinke sounded like a modern-day Daniel Plainview, the fictional oilman played by Daniel Day-Lewis in the film ""There Will Be Blood."" ""We've gotten a lot better as industry,"" Zinke told the National Petroleum Council at its Dec. 4 meeting, quickly correcting himself: ""You've gotten a lot better."" He told the room he was ""bullish"" on energy, saying he expected that within two years the U.S. would be ""marching real close to"" producing 14 million barrels of oil per day. He stressed that Interior needs to ""be better at emphasizing"" why domestic energy production is ""environmentally, morally, economically"" the ""right path.""

It was as if he were interviewing for his next gig. And that very well may have been the case. Politico reported in November that Zinke had reached out to various parties about potential jobs, including with Fox News and in the energy industry. Zinke's team dismissed the report as fake news.

O'Mara, the National Wildlife Federation president, expects Zinke will end up working in the fossil fuel sector.

""He decided that it was in his interest to focus on fulfilling industry's desires over the mission of the department,"" O'Mara said.

In a parting interview with Fox News' Bret Baier, Zinke was asked about the perceived one-sidedness of his agenda. Zinke dismissed such claims as ""bunk"" and attempted to do some damage control, highlighting achievements he said the media refuses to talk about. His list was largely the same one from a year before.

""We've opened up millions of acres for public access, hunting and fishing. We've opened up 39 wildlife refuges,"" he told Fox. Doing so is not unique to this administration. In its final two years alone, the Obama administration expanded hunting and fishing opportunities on at least 34 refuges.

""We expanded wilderness,"" Zinke said. But only one wilderness area -- Sabinoso Wilderness in New Mexico -- expanded as a result of Zinke's actions. And that deal was first announced in 2016, well before his tenure, and made possible thanks to a private donation of 3,595 acres. Zinke simply accepted the land donation.

""We've initiated wildlife corridors, first ever,"" Zinke said. In February he signed an order to identify and protect big game migration corridors. That initiative has been widely celebrated, but the BLM has continued to offer oil and gas leases in key habitat.

""I've withdrawn minerals in sensitive areas,"" Zinke said. In October, he extended a mining ban on 30,000 acres in Montana's Paradise Valley, just north of Yellowstone National Park. It is one of several cases of Zinke protecting public lands in his home state as he's worked to open up land elsewhere. (There is wide speculation that Zinke has future political aspirations, perhaps for Montana governor.) Last year, for example, Interior reversed an Obama-era decision and renewed leases for a Chilean firm to mine nickel and copper just outside Minnesota's Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness.

""What they don't say,"" Zinke said of his critics, ""is, actually, we are one of the leading conservationists.""

It's a bold claim for any administration, let alone one that in the midst of global biodiversity and climate crises has prioritized fossil fuel development and worked to chip away at bedrock conservation laws, namely the Endangered Species Act and the Migratory Bird Treaty Act.

In recent months, as the cloud of ethical troubles darkened and rumors swirled that his future was in peril, Zinke took to accusing critics on the left of being ""angry,"" ""intolerant,"" ""uninformed"" and unwilling to ""look at the actual facts."" He echoed that sentiment in his resignation letter to Trump, saying that ""to some, truth no longer matters.""

But the truth about Zinke is that he isn't the Rooseveltian conservationist he sold himself as. Donning a cowboy hat doesn't make a person a cowboy any more than flying a special flag over an office makes someone transparent.

""He talked a really good game going in and then just was a good soldier,"" Tawney, the president of Backcountry Hunters & Anglers, said. ""You can't go in there and talk about how you're a Theodore Roosevelt Republican, a student of Theodore Roosevelt, and do the things that he did."""
321,the huffington post,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/nation-s-oldest-world-war-ii-vet-dies-in-texas-at-age-112_us_5c25ca28e4b08aaf7a8f09d0,"AUSTIN, Texas (AP) -- Richard Overton, the nation's oldest World War II veteran who was also believed to be the oldest living man in the U.S., died Thursday in Texas, a family member said. He was 112.

The Army veteran had been hospitalized with pneumonia but was released on Christmas Eve, said Shirley Overton, whose husband was Richard's cousin and his longtime caretaker.

""They had done all they could,"" she said.

He died Thursday evening at a rehab facility in Austin, Texas, she said.

Richard Overton was in his 30s when he volunteered for the Army and was at Pearl Harbor just after the Japanese attack in 1941. He once said that one secret to his long life was smoking cigars and drinking whiskey, which he often was found doing on the porch of his Austin home.

His recent birthdays drew national attention and strangers would stop by his house to meet him. Even well into his 100s, he would drive widows in his neighborhood to church.

""With his quick wit and kind spirit he touched the lives of so many, and I am deeply honored to have known him,"" Texas Gov. Greg Abbott said in a statement Thursday, calling Overton ""an American icon and Texas legend.""

""Richard Overton made us proud to be Texans and proud to be Americans,"" the governor added. ""We can never repay Richard Overton for his service to our nation and for his lasting impact on the Lone Star State.""

Overton was born in 1906 near Austin and served in the all-black 1887th Engineer Aviation Battalion.

In 2013, former President Barack Obama honored Overton at a Veterans Day ceremony at Arlington National Cemetery.

""He was there at Pearl Harbor, when the battleships were still smoldering,"" Obama said of Overton. ""He was there at Okinawa. He was there at Iwo Jima, where he said, 'I only got out of there by the grace of God.'"""

Looks like retired Army Gen. Stanley McChrystal won't be joining the ever-evolving roster of Trump administration officials anytime soon.

The former top commander of U.S. and international forces in Afghanistan said during an interview that aired Sunday on ABC's ""This Week"" that he would reject an offer to work for President Donald Trump if asked.

""It's important for me to work for people who I think are basically honest, who tell the truth as best they know it,"" McChrystal said. He suggested that the president has been, at times, ""openly disingenuous on things.""

""The military talks about ... if you're put into a difficult military situation would that leader sacrifice himself, put himself and others at risk to come for you,"" he continued. ""I have to believe that the people I'm working for would do that, whether we disagree on a lot of other things. I'm not convinced from the behavior that I've seen that that's the case here.""

Asked if he believes Trump is ""immoral,"" McChrystal said yes.

""I don't think he tells the truth,"" he told ABC. ""What I would ask every American to do is ... stand in front of that mirror and say, 'What are we about? Am I really willing to throw away or ignore some of the things that people do that are pretty unacceptable normally just because they accomplish certain other things that we might like?'""

""If we want to be governed by someone we wouldn't do a business deal with because ... their background is so shady, if we're willing to do that, then that's in conflict with who I think we are,"" he added. ""And so I think it's necessary at those times to take a stand.""

McChrystal led the Joint Special Operations Command in the mid-2000s under President George W. Bush. He served as commander of the International Security Assistance force for just over a year under President Barack Obama before resigning in June 2010, a day after Rolling Stone published an article online in which McChrystal and his staff mocked Vice President Joe Biden and criticized Obama's leadership."
323,daily mail online,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6523029/US-envoy-anti-IS-coalition-quits-Trumps-Syria-move.html,"Quit: Brett McGurk, the top U.S. envoy to the global coalition fighting ISIS has announced he is resigning, effective December 31

The top US envoy to the global coalition fighting ISIS announced that he is resigning on Saturday in the wake of President Trump's decision to withdraw troops from Syria.

Brett McGurk was set to step down in February but moved up his departure date by two months to December 31 after very publicly stating the possibly catastrophic outcome that could result should President Trump elect to pull American forces at this time.

The veteran diplomat, who got his start in the administration of George W. Bush and was appointed to his current post by Barack Obama, now joins Defense Secretary Jim Mattis in an administration exodus of experienced national security officials.

Mattis, who is the most respected foreign policy official in the administration, announced on Thursday that he will leave by the end of February.

The former United States Marine Corps general who commanded the 1st Marine Division during the 2003 invasion of Iraq and later served as the Commander of United States Central Command under Obama told Trump that he was departing because 'you have a right to have a Secretary of Defense whose views are better aligned with yours.'

Jim 'Mad Dog' Mattis, who is the most respected foreign policy official in the administration, announced on Thursday that he will leave his role as Secretary of Defense on February 28

Only 11 days ago, McGurk urged those who believed ISIS had been defeated to reexamine that notion while explaining why he believed it would be unwise to bring American forces home.

He reiterated those points in his resignation letter. stating that the militants were on the run, but not yet defeated.

McGurk also noted that the premature pullout of American forces from Syria would create the conditions that initially gave rise to ISIS and other terror groups in the past.

He also cited gains in accelerating the campaign against IS, but that the work was not yet done.

McGurk said at a State Department briefing on December 11 that 'it would be reckless if we were just to say, ""Well, the physical caliphate is defeated, so we can just leave now."" I think anyone who's looked at a conflict like this would agree with that.'

A week before that, Gen. Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the U.S. had a long way to go in training local Syrian forces to prevent a resurgence of IS and stabilize Syria.

He said it would take 35,000 to 40,000 local troops in northeastern Syria to maintain security over the long term, but only about 20 percent of that number had been trained.

McGurk, whose resignation is effective December 31, was planning to leave the job in mid-February after a US-hosted meeting of foreign ministers from the coalition countries, but he felt he could continue no longer after Trump's decision to withdraw from Syria and Mattis' resignation.

Trump is acting to pull all 2,000 U.S. troops from Syria and has now declared victory over ISIS, contradicting his own experts' assessments.

On Saturday, Trump tweeted:

'On Syria, we were originally going to be there for three months, and that was seven years ago - we never left. When I became President, ISIS was going wild. Now ISIS is largely defeated and other local countries, including Turkey, should be able to easily take care of whatever remains. We're coming home!'

Many lawmakers have called his action rash and dangerous.

The U.S. began airstrikes in Syria in 2014, and ground troops moved in the following year to battle IS and train Syrian rebels in a country torn apart by civil war. Trump, in a tweet this past week, abruptly declared their mission accomplished.

The decision will fulfill Trump's goal of bringing troops home from Syria, but military leaders have pushed back for months, arguing that the IS group remains a threat and could regroup in Syria's long-running civil war. U.S. policy has been to keep troops in place until the extremists are eradicated.

McGurk, 45, previously served as a deputy assistant secretary of state for Iraq and Iran, and during the negotiations for the landmark Iran nuclear deal by the Obama administration, led secret side talks with Tehran on the release of Americans imprisoned there.

McGurk, was briefly considered for the post of ambassador to Iraq after having served as a senior official covering Iraq and Afghanistan during President George W. Bush's administration.

A former Supreme Court law clerk to the late Chief Justice William Rehnquist, McGurk worked as a lawyer for the Coalition Provisional Authority in Iraq after the 2003 U.S.-led invasion and joined Bush's National Security Council staff, where in 2007 and 2008, he was the lead U.S. negotiator on security agreements with Iraq.

Taking over for now for McGurk will be his deputy, retired Lt. Gen. Terry Wolff, who served three tours of active duty in Iraq.

Jim Jeffrey, a veteran diplomat who was appointed special representative for Syria engagement in August, is expected to stay in his position, officials said.

IS militants still hold a string of villages and towns along the Euphrates River in eastern Syria, where they have resisted weeks of attacks by the U.S.-supported Syrian Democratic Forces to drive them out. The pocket is home to about 15,000 people, among them 2,000 IS fighters, according to U.S. military estimates.

But that figure could be as high as 8,000 militants, if fighters hiding out in the deserts south of the Euphrates River are also counted, according to according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which monitors the conflict through networks of local informants.

The SDF, a Kurdish-led force that is America's only military partner in Syria, said Thursday: ""The war against Islamic State has not ended and the group has not been defeated."" The group is at the front lines of the battle against IS along the Euphrates River.

It said a U.S. withdrawal would leave Syrians ""between the claws of enemy forces.""

At their height in 2014, Islamic State militants controlled approximately a third of territory in Syria and Iraq, including major cities in both countries. The group flourished in the political vacuum of Syria's civil war, in which President Bashar Assad has violently put down a 2011 uprising against his family's 40-year rule.

Secretary of Defense James Mattis's letter of resignation

December 20, 2018

Dear Mr. President:

I have been privileged to serve as our country's 26th Secretary of Defense which has allowed me to serve alongside our men and women of the Department in defense of our citizens and our ideals.

I am proud of the progress that has been made over the past two years on some of the key goals articulated in our National Defense Strategy: putting the Department on a more sound budgetary footing, improving readiness and lethality in our forces, and reforming the Department's business practices for greater performance. Our troops continue to provide the capabilities needed to prevail in con?ict and sustain strong U.S. global influence.

One core belief I have always held is that our strength as a nation is inextricably linked to the strength of our unique and comprehensive system of alliances and partnerships. While the US remains the indispensable nation in the free world, we cannot protect our interests or serve that role effectively without maintaining strong alliances and showing respect to those allies. Like you, I have said from the beginning that the armed forces of the United States should not be the policeman of the world. Instead, we must use all tools of American power to provide for the common defense, including providing effective leadership to our alliances. NATO's 29 democracies demonstrated that strength in their commitment to fighting alongside us following the 9-11 attack on America. The Defeat-ISIS coalition of 74 nations is further proof.

Similarly, I believe we must be resolute and unambiguous in our approach to those countries whose strategic interests are increasingly in tension with ours. It is clear that China and Russia, for example, want to shape a world consistent with their authoritarian model gaining veto authority over other nations? economic, diplomatic, and security decisions to promote their own interests at the expense of their neighbors, America and our allies. That is why we must use all the tools of American power to provide for the common defense.

My views on treating allies with respect and also being clear-eyed about both malign actors and strategic competitors are strongly held and informed by over four decades of immersion in these issues. We must do everything possible to advance an international order that is most conducive to our security, prosperity and values, and we are strengthened in this effort by the solidarity of our alliances.

Because you have the right to have a Secretary of Defense whose views are better aligned with yours on these and other subjects, I believe it is right for me to step down from my position. The end date for my tenure is February 28, 2019, a date that should allow sufficient time for a successor to be nominated and confimed as well as to make sure the Department's interests are properly articulated and protected at upcoming events to include Congressional posture hearings and the NATO Defense Ministerial meeting in February. Further, that a full transition to a new Secretary of Defense occurs well in advance of the transition of Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in September in order to ensure stability Within the Department.

I pledge my full effort to a smooth transition that ensures the needs and interests of the 2.15 million Service Members and 732,079 civilians receive undistracted attention of the Department at all times so that they can fulfill their critical, round-the-clock mission to protect the American people.

I very much appreciate this opportunity to serve the nation and our men and women in uniform.

James N. Mattis"

Called the Dream Chaser, its maker Sierra Nevada Corp hopes it could begin to deliver cargo to the International Space Station beginning in 'late 2020'.

Now, NASA has given the go-ahead for full production of the craft to begin following a series of tests.

Called the Dream Chaser, its maker Sierra Nevada Corp hopes it could begin to deliver cargo to the International Space Station beginning in 'late 2020'.

The Dream Chaser will perform at least six missions to provide cargo resupply, disposal and return services to the International Space Station under NASA's CRS-2 contract.

'NASA's acknowledgement that SNC has completed this critical milestone and its approval of full production of the first Dream Chaser spacecraft is a major indication we are on the right path toward increasing vital science return for the industry,' John Curry, the program director for CRS-2 at SNC, said.

'We are one step closer to the Dream Chaser spacecraft's first orbital flight.'

The Dream Chaser will perform at least six missions to provide cargo resupply, disposal and return services to the International Space Station under NASA's CRS-2 contract.

It will blast into orbit on top of a United Launch Alliance's Atlas 5 rocket from Cape Canaveral, Florida, and will land at Kennedy Space Center on a standard runway.

'This comprehensive review approved moving the Dream Chaser program into the production phase so we can get Dream Chaser to market as a critical space station resupply spacecraft as soon as possible,' said Fatih Ozmen, co-owner and CEO of SNC.

Many critical parts of the orbital vehicle are already complete, built and being tested, including major structural components, thermal protection system tiles and avionics hardware, the firm says,

With the success of IR4, these components are now being integrated into the orbital vehicle assembly at SNC's Space Systems facilities in Louisville, CO.

It will blast into orbit on top of a United Launch Alliance's Atlas 5 rocket from Cape Canaveral, Florida, and will land at Kennedy Space Center on a standard runway.

The spacecraft delivers up to 5,500kg (~12,100lbs) of pressurized and unpressurized cargo and returns over 1,850 kg (~4,000lbs) of cargo with a gentle runway landing.

The spacecraft also provides approximately 3,400kg (~7,400 lbs) of disposal capability each mission via the cargo module, which burns up in the atmosphere after separation from the Dream Chaser winged vehicle.

Last year a test version of a 'mini space shuttle' has soared over the Mojave Desert in a major step forward for the mini shuttle.

Sierra Nevada Corp.'s Dream Chaser was carried to an altitude of 10,000 feet by the civilian version of the Army's CH-47 Chinook, and then dropped to glide to the ground and land on a runway at Edwards Air Force Base in a test of its autonomous landing systems.

The uncrewed Dream Chaser made a smooth landing at Edwards Air Force Base during the free-flight test at NASA's Armstrong Flight Research Center in Edwards, California, NASA officials said in a statement

The mini shuttle made a perfect lading at NASA's Armstrong Flight Research Center in Edwards, California.

The Dream Chaser is preparing to deliver cargo to the International Space Station beginning in 2020.

The data that SNC gathered from this test campaign will help influence and inform the final design of the cargo Dream Chaser, which will fly at least six cargo delivery missions to and from the space station by 2024.

The testing is designed to validate the aerodynamic properties, flight software and control system performance of the Dream Chaser.

'The Dream Chaser had a beautiful flight and landing!' Sierra Nevada representatives said.

Sierra Nevada Corp.'s Dream Chaser craft was lifted off the ground at 7:21 a.m., at NASA's Armstrong Flight Research Center on Edwards Air Force Base, California

The Dream Chaser is being developed to carry cargo to and from the International Space Station without a crew aboard.

Earlier this year it was lifted by a helicopter in a precursor to a free flight in which it will be released to autonomously land on a runway as it would in a return from orbit.

With the addition of life-support equipment, a Dream Chaser could transport a crew of seven.

'Fans disconsolate after retirement of NASA's shuttle fleet can take heart: The next generation in reusable space vehicles is set to debut,' NASA has said.

THE SPACE SHUTTLE: AMERICA'S LONGEST RUNNING SPACE EXPLORATION PROGRAMME

The Space Shuttle Discovery is launched on Mission STS-29, March 13,1989

Born with Columbia, it was NASA's longest-running space exploration programme.

Atlantis was launched in 1985.

The next-to-youngest in Nasa's fleet remains at Kennedy Space Center as a museum display.

This grand finale came 50 years to the day that Gus Grissom became the second American in space, just half a year ahead of Glenn.

Atlantis - the last of Nasa's three surviving shuttles to retire - performed as admirably during descent as it did throughout the 13-day flight.

A full year's worth of food and other supplies were dropped off at the space station, just in case the upcoming commercial deliveries get delayed.

The international partners - Russia, Europe, Japan - will carry the load in the meantime.

Not all 1,333 days in space have been a success, however.

Two of the shuttles - Challenger and Columbia - were destroyed, one at launch, the other during the ride home.

Fourteen lives were lost.

Yet each time, the shuttle programme persevered.

The decision to cease shuttle flight was made seven years ago, barely a year after the Columbia tragedy.

President Barack Obama put paid to President George W. Bush's lunar goals, however, opting instead for astronaut expeditions to an asteroid and Mars.

The space shuttle was sold to America as cheap, safe and reliable. It was none of those.

It cost $196billion over 40 years, ended the lives of 14 astronauts and managed to make less than half the flights promised.

Nasa's first space shuttle flight was in April 1981.

Now Atlantis has landed, it and the other two remaining shuttles are officially museum pieces - more expensive than any paintings.

The total price tag for the programme was more than twice the $90billion Nasa originally calculated.

Atlantis undocked from the International Space Station in September 2006.

But as a mistake it is one that paid off in wildly unexpected ways that weren't about money and reliability.

Former president George Bush Sr said: 'The discoveries it enabled, the international co-operation it fostered and the knowledge it gained - often at great human cost - has also contributed in countless, important ways to humanity and our common progress.'

Mr Bush oversaw the programme's early days as vice-president, a job that has traditionally included supervising Nasa.

University of Colorado science policy professor Roger Pielke Jr., who studies shuttle costs and policies, said there are probably other ways the U.S. could have spent several billion dollars a year on a human space programme and gained more.

When the shuttle succeeded, it did so in a spectacular way.

But its failures were also large and tragic.

Seven astronauts died when Challenger exploded about a minute after launch in 1986 and seven more died when Columbia burned up as it returned to Earth in 2003.

Last-ditch appeals to keep shuttles flying by such Nasa legends as Apollo 11's Neil Armstrong and Mission Control founder Christopher Kraft landed flat.

In January 2016 SNC was one of three companies awarded contracts to ferry cargo from 2019 through 2024 to the International Space Station (ISS).

The company also touts the spacecraft's flexibility in remote sensing, satellite servicing, and even 'active debris removal,' otherwise known as space-trash cleanup.

A second round of Dream Chaser flight tests at NASA's Armstrong Research Center is slated to continue through the end of the 2017 calendar year.

The test campaign will help SNC validate the aerodynamic properties, flight software and control system performance of the Dream Chaser.

The data that SNC gathers from this test campaign will help influence and inform the final design of the cargo Dream Chaser, which will fly at least six cargo delivery missions to and from the space station by 2024.

How the Dreamchaser Will work: Each craft can be reused 15 times.

Last year NASA announced Sierra Nevada Corp. will join SpaceX and Orbital ATK in launching cargo to the International Space Station.

These flights, yet to be finalized, will run through 2024, and marks a second chance for the Nevada-based company, which is developing a mini shuttle called Dream Chaser.

Sierra Nevada competed for NASA's commercial crew contract, but lost out in 2014 to SpaceX and Boeing.

Like SpaceX, Sierra Nevada plans to launch from Cape Canaveral, Florida.

The spacecraft will be able to land back on Earth, like the shuttle, and bring back science experiments and other items from the station.

Sierra Nevada Corporation has delivered its Dream Chaser spacecraft to Edwards Air Force Base ahead of its 2019 missions to supply cargo to the International Space Station.

It is being prepared to deliver cargo to the International Space Station under NASA's Commercial Resupply Services 2 (CRS2) contract beginning in 2019.

Recent launch accidents by SpaceX and Orbital prompted Nasa to pick a third vendor, for increased flexibility.

325,daily mail online,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-6538477/AP-FACT-CHECK-Trumps-false-statements-cheering-troops.html,"WASHINGTON (AP) - President Donald Trump made false statements to U.S. troops in his first visit to service members in a conflict zone, misrepresenting what he's done for them on pay. Also over the past week, the commander in chief offered a bewildering assertion about progress with his proposed border wall at the heart of the partial government shutdown and twisted facts surrounding the Iran nuclear deal.

A look at some of his statements and the reality behind them:

MILITARY PAY

TRUMP: ""You just got one of the biggest pay raises you ever received. Unless you don't want it. Does anybody here? Is anybody here willing to give up the big pay raise you just got? I don't see too many hands. Ah, OK. Don't give it up. It's great. You know what? Nobody deserves it more. You haven't gotten one in more than 10 years. More than 10 years. And we got you a big one. I got you a big one."" - remarks prompting cheers from troops Wednesday at al-Asad Air Base in Iraq.

THE FACTS: He's wrong about there being no pay increase for service members in more than 10 years and about their raise being especially large. U.S. military members have gotten a pay raise every year for decades. As well, several in the last 10 years have been larger than service members are getting now - 2.4 percent this year and 2.6 percent in 2019. Raises in 2008, 2009 and 2010, for example, were all 3.4 percent or more.

Trump has repeatedly told service members that they're getting the biggest or only pay raise that they have received in 10 years or more. In May, for example, he told graduates of the United States Naval Academy: ""We just got you a big pay raise. First time in 10 years.""

TRUMP: ""You had plenty of people, they came up, they said, you know we could make it smaller. We could make it 3 percent, we could make it 2 percent, we could make it 4 percent. I said, 'no, make it 10 percent - make it more than 10 percent.'"" - remarks Wednesday at al-Asad base.

THE FACTS: Whatever he might have said at the time, the 2.6 percent for 2019 obviously falls far short of the 10 percent or more that he implied was achieved.

BORDER WALL

TRUMP: ""I am in the Oval Office & just gave out a 115 mile long contract for another large section of the Wall in Texas."" -tweet Monday.

TRUMP: ""Yesterday, I gave out 115 miles' worth of wall, 115 miles in Texas. It's going to be built, hopefully rapidly. I'm going there at the end of January for the start of construction."" - remarks to reporters Tuesday.

THE FACTS: He appears to be representing work financed months ago, as new construction. A president cannot simply give out a construction contract. U.S. Customs and Border Protection and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers award contracts for border wall construction after Congress approves the money and months have gone into planning.

In March, Congress approved money for 33 miles (53 kilometers) of construction in South Texas' Rio Grande Valley, the busiest corridor for illegal border crossings. The government said in November that construction in the Rio Grande Valley would begin in February. Targeted areas include the nonprofit National Butterfly Center, a state park and privately owned ranches and farmland. Trump's statement that he plans to visit the site in late January suggests he may be referring to this previously announced construction.

It's a mystery how he comes up with 115 miles (185 km), and neither the White House nor the Homeland Security Department explained that when asked.

Homeland Security has said the money approved by Congress in March will pay for 84 miles (135 km) altogether along the southern border, including the Texas stretch. If the Trump administration got the entire $5 billion it's requested from Congress, the administration says that would be enough to build 215 miles (346 km) of barrier.

What's not a mystery is that Trump has repeatedly exaggerated what's been accomplished on his campaign promise to build a wall sealing the border with Mexico.

IRAN

TRUMP: ""For all of the sympathizers out there of Brett McGurk remember, he was the Obama appointee who was responsible for loading up airplanes with 1.8 Billion Dollars in CASH & sending it to Iran as part of the horrific Iran Nuclear Deal (now terminated) approved by Little Bob Corker."" - tweet Monday.

THE FACTS: There are three or more things wrong with this short tweet as he takes a slap at a retiring Republican senator who criticized him, Bob Corker of Tennessee, and a U.S. official who resigned in protest against Trump's plan to pull troops from Syria, Brett McGurk.

First, Corker was no architect of the 2015 deal between world powers and Iran. He was a leading critic of it in Congress.

He argued at the time that President Barack Obama should have made the pact a treaty subject to approval by the Senate. When Obama didn't do that, Corker helped fellow senators write legislation that subjected the accord to periodic congressional review. The legislation would have blocked the deal if that effort got enough votes. It didn't. Obama brought the deal into effect, not Congress.

Corker has sharply criticized Trump, calling him ""utterly untruthful"" and responsible for ""the debasing of our nation.""

Second, branding McGurk an ""Obama appointee"" is misleading. The veteran diplomat bridges administrations. Republican President George W. Bush appointed him as a senior aide for Iraq and Afghanistan. During the negotiations for the Iran nuclear deal by the Obama administration, McGurk led secret side talks with Tehran on the release of Americans imprisoned there. He is Trump's envoy to the coalition fighting the Islamic State group in Syria, but quitting in protest of the troop withdrawal.

As for cash flown to Iran, that's true, though Trump is off on the amount and leaves out important context: The money was a debt owed to Tehran, which bought military equipment from the U.S. that it never received because relations ruptured when the shah was overthrown in 1979. A cargo plane took $400 million, representing the principal, to the Iranians. The remaining $1.3 billion, representing interest accrued over nearly 40 years, was transferred separately.

The diplomatic break meant that a variety of debts between the two countries went uncollected and became the subject of international arbitration. As part of that process, Iran paid settlements of more than $2.5 billion to U.S. citizens and businesses over the years.

326,bbc news,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-46766271,"Apparently, among President Trump's favourite movies is the Second World War epic Patton: Lust for Glory.

General George Patton was a charismatic, no nonsense and hard-fighting kind of officer. He got results but he was also self-absorbed and controversial - he once struck a soldier suffering from combat stress.

Is Patton perhaps, in the president's mind, the archetypal general? If so, then he will have been deeply disappointed by the raft of generals whom he appointed to his administration.

Indeed, we know that he was because he has said so, most recently castigating General James Mattis - his defence secretary - as a failure, who he had ""effectively fired"". General Mattis, of course, actually resigned.

Let's set aside Mr Trump's first national security adviser, General Michael Flynn, who did indeed have to fall on his sword. He was forced to resign in February 2017 after lying to Vice-President Mike Pence over his contacts with the Russians.

The most noteworthy aspects of Mr Trump's initial picks for his administration were his heavy reliance upon high-profile military men.

Retired Marine Corps General John Kelly was appointed as Secretary of Homeland Security, before subsequently becoming the White House chief-of-staff.

Another senior Marine General, James Mattis, became defence secretary, and the errant Michael Flynn was replaced as national security adviser by the widely respected and innovative military thinker, Army General HR McMaster.

Fast forward to the end of December 2018 - all three men, first Gen McMaster in March, then Gen Kelly and finally Gen Mattis, have all gone. This is no surprise. It was seen as being almost inevitable when I spoke to a raft of experts a year or so into the Trump administration's tenure.

Their argument was that the president would prove impossible to brief and ignorant of detail.

Ultimately the military men would be forced to choose between the code of values that they had followed during their professional careers rather than adopting those of the property magnate and reality TV show star who now sat in the White House. And so it has proved.

Why then was Mr Trump so enamoured by the military in the first place?

It should be remembered that it was the context that made the generals' roles so significant in this administration, not that they came from the military as such.

It is often forgotten that President Obama too had his raft of former military appointees, among them his first national security adviser and secretary of veterans affairs, both of whom were ex-generals.

But what made the Trump team so different was the fact that many Republican-leaning foreign policy experts refused at the outset to have anything to do with it.

Mr Trump had to cast his net wider and given his own peculiar view of the sort of gutsy leadership provided by generals like Patton, then why not draw on America's contemporary warrior caste?

Mr Trump himself of course has never served in the military. The closest he came to the armed forces was during part of his education at a military-style academy.

He received five draft deferments (four for education and one on medical grounds) that meant he did not have to serve in Vietnam. But his fascination with military men is almost palpable.

In his recent televised cabinet session he spoke admiringly of the military's upper echelons.

""When I became president,"" he noted, ""I had a meeting at the Pentagon with lots of generals. They were like from a movie. Better looking than Tom Cruise, and stronger."" No wonder then he sought to fill out key posts with military men.

The trio of Mattis, Kelly and McMaster were part of a small group dubbed by some as ""the adults in the room"". They were supposed to speak truth to power; to curb the president's excesses; reassure allies and so on. And for a period they did.

The president for example may have castigated his Nato allies in public while Defence Secretary Mattis tried, as far as he was able, to reassure them that at a practical level it was pretty much business as usual.

The generals went into this knowing that it was almost mission impossible and one by one they have fallen by the wayside. Serving Donald Trump could be explained away for a time as serving the nation. But as his behaviour remained erratic and his policy decisions mercurial, for each of these men there came a moment when they could no longer remain in their posts.

For James Mattis, for example, it was the decision to unilaterally pull US ground troops out of Syria that was the last straw.

President Trump's Syria decision has been widely criticised by the experts. Some say it is too rapid; others that it lacks any guiding strategy. But - and this is a crucial ""but"" - it may be popular among ordinary voters.

America's military campaigns in places like Iraq, Syria and Afghanistan have merged in the general imagination into what some call ""the Forever Wars"" and many Americans are sick and tired of it.

On this issue, as on one or two others, Mr Trump's rationalisation of policy may be adrift but his gut instincts may not.

In choosing military men for such high profile positions, President Trump did not then get what he expected.

As the leading expert on US civil-military relations, Professor Eliot Cohen of Johns Hopkins University, told me, ""the most interesting thing in all of this is the fact that the military so deeply embodies the post-World War II American foreign policy consensus.""

This means, he explained, that ""they believe in our alliance system, in global engagement, in persistent policies (including the Forever Wars), and in preserving the social values of the last half century (note their stand on transgender service personnel). This was not in tune with the president's own outlook.""

Eliot Cohen is no fan of Mr Trump. But his expertise is such that he gave evidence before the Senate Armed Services Committee when it met to decide if long-standing restrictions might be waived to allow the relatively recently retired James Mattis to take up the post of defence secretary.

""Mr Trump"", he says, ""has an adolescent view of the military as a bunch of tough guys who, moreover, would be personally loyal to him. Again and again, he has found out that they really aren't that way."""
327,daily mail online,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/sciencetech/article-6570437/U-S-carbon-emissions-spike-2018-industry-fuel-demand.html,"Carbon dioxide (CO²) emissions spiked last year in the US after three years of decline, new research has found.

Emissions rose 3.4 per cent in 2018, the largest increase in the United States since 2010 when the economy began to grow after a long period recession.

Energy-related CO² emissions increased as demand on industry and fuel grew, an estimate by independent research group Rhodium claims.

Under President Trump's administration, the government has put an end to many existing environmental protections and is set to leave the Paris Agreement in 2020.

The international pledge aims to limit the increase in the global average temperature to below 2°C (3.6°F) - or 1.5°C (2.7°F) if possible.

Carbon dioxide emissions spiked last year in the US after three years of decline, according to a study. Emissions rose 3.4 per cent in 2018, the largest increase in the United States since 2010. Pictured here, gas-powered generating station in California (file photo)

The United States is the world's second largest emitter of greenhouse gases behind China.

'The US was already off track in meeting its Paris Agreement targets. The gap is even wider headed into 2019,' the report said.

The report noted that though the factors behind the rise in US emissions in 2018 are mostly economic, some are natural.

Cold spells in winter in a number of regions led to a rise in energy while a hot summer led to more air conditioning use.

The Trump administration, which announced its intent to leave the 2015 Paris Agreement, is relaxing Obama-era rules on emissions from power plants and vehicles as it seeks to boost production of oil, gas and coal.

The spike occurred even though 2018 saw a record amount of shutdowns of power plants fired by coal, the fuel richest in carbon output when burned.

Natural gas, which emits about half of the carbon of coal, replaced most of the lost coal generation, but also served the vast majority of load growth for electricity last year, the report said.

Trump administration officials have said that emissions can waiver from year to year depending on the economy, but that the country can both cut emissions and enjoy a strong economy at the same time.

An environmentalist said the Trump administration needs to speed up the transition from natural gas to renewables such as wind and solar power and energy storage.

'Coal's sharp-dressed cousin is continuing us on a path to irreparable and costly climate damage,' said Greg Cunningham, who works on clean energy and climate at the Conservation Law Foundation.

'It is imperative that we shift our clean energy transition into high gear and accelerate our clean car standards to reverse this trend.'

The American Petroleum Institute, the top lobbying organisation for the U.S. oil and gas industry, says it does not take a position on forming a carbon tax.

Some environmentalists, politicians in both parties, and petroleum companies say this would harness the power of capitalism to reduce emissions.

The API says however that it backs voluntary efforts to reduce emissions.

Mike Sommers, the head of API, told reporters in a conference call that the United States can boost oil and gas and cut emissions at the same time.

WHAT IS THE PARIS AGREEMENT?

The Paris Agreement, which was first signed in 2015, is an international agreement to control and limit climate change.

It hopes to hold the increase in the global average temperature to below 2°C (3.6ºF) 'and to pursue efforts to limit the temperature increase to 1.5°C (2.7°F)'.

It seems the more ambitious goal of restricting global warming to 1.5°C (2.7°F) may be more important than ever, according to previous research which claims 25 per cent of the world could see a significant increase in drier conditions.

In June 2017, President Trump announced his intention for the US, the second largest producer of greenhouse gases in the world, to withdraw from the agreement.

The Paris Agreement on Climate Change has four main goals with regards to reducing emissions:

1) A long-term goal of keeping the increase in global average temperature to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels

2) To aim to limit the increase to 1.5°C, since this would significantly reduce risks and the impacts of climate change

3) Goverments agreed on the need for global emissions to peak as soon as possible, recognising that this will take longer for developing countries

4) To undertake rapid reductions thereafter in accordance with the best available science

328,daily mail online,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6573279/Chuck-Nancy-head-White-House-shutdown-wall-talks.html,"The top two Democrats in Congress will take the 16-block limousine ride from the U.S. Capitol to the White House on Wednesday to engage in a new round of sparring over an 18-day-old government shutdown, a day after President Donald Trump used an Oval Office address to move the debate over border security back where it started.

The president will huddle with both parties' leaders from both houses of Congress, including his arch-nemeses, House speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. But that will come four hours after the pair hold a joint press conference to double down on their refusal to give Trump what he wants.

The 3:00 p.m. meeting at 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue is not expected to result in a deal restoring the 25 per cent of government funding that has been in limbo since a few days before Christmas, although Trump said Tuesday night that 'a 45-minute meeting' could resolve the stalemate.

Trump will spend his lunch hour on Schumer's turf, speaking with Senate Republicans during their weekly policy luncheon, briefing them on how he plans to end up with a fully funded border wall between the U.S. and Mexico despite his discomfort with declaring a national emergency and seizing the power to go around Congress.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (right) and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, pictured posing after Tuesday's response to President Donald Trump's Oval Office address, will be at the White House on Wednesday to kick-start negotiations over Trump's border wall and an extended government shutdown

Trump spoke for nine minutes from the Oval Office of the White House on Tuesday, shaming congressional Democrats as he blamed them for bloodshed caused by illegal immigrants

Schumer and Pelosi aren't likely go give any ground, despite Trump's assurance on Tuesday that the stalemate over border security could be solved in a 45-minute meeting

He stopped short of declaring that emergency on Tuesday night, but reiterated his demand that congressional Democrats fund a border wall that he has promised for nearly four years.

But he played the shame card with a vengeance, blaming them for playing politics with innocent American lives and allowing 'a crisis of the heart and a crisis of the soul' to fester.

'How much more American blood must we shed before Congress does its job?' Trump asked in a 9-minute speech from the Oval Office.

Citing a string of murders committed by illegal immigrants who have been previously deported form the United States, he demanded of lawmakers: 'For those who refuse to compromise in the name of border security, I would ask: Imagine if it was your child, your husband or your wife whose life was so cruelly shattered and totally broken.'

'To every member of Congress: Pass a bill that ends this crisis.'

Trump is demanding $5.7 billion in new congressional spending for his long-promised border wall

Pelosi and Schumer delivered the Democrats' response after Trump spoke, framing the conflict as Trump's personal, uninformed crusade as they insisted they won't bend and agree to his terms

The President tweeted after his address to acknowledge 'soooo many nice comments' about his speech amid the ongoing battle with congressional Democrats

Trump said Tuesday that child trafficking and sexual violence against women who try to migrate into the U.S. illegally is a 'cycle of human suffering' that he's determined to end.

He implored Americans to call their members of Congress 'and tell them to finally, after all of these decades, secure our border. This is a choice between right and wrong, justice and injustice.'

The White House has requested $5.7 billion in new funding to continue the wall's construction. The president passed up the option to declare an emergency on Tuesday and spend existing Defense Department dollars to build it without Congress.

A U.S. Marine stood outside the doors to the West Wing of the White House on Tuesday night ahead of Trump's address, signifying that the president was working and not in the presidential residence quarters

Instead he returned to his previous lines of argument, claiming a border security crisis has resulted in a flood of narcotics and human trafficking, and endangering Americans' lives.

Trump plans to host congressional leaders from both parties at the White House for negotiations on Wednesday, followed by a Capitol Hill visit to brief Republicans

He will visit the southern border on Thursday to highlight his demand for a wall.

After his address Tuesday night, Trump tweeted: 'Thank you for soooo many nice comments regarding my Oval Office speech. A very interesting experience!'

The New York Times reported that Trump told a lunchtime meeting of news executives and anchors on Tuesday that he was inclined to skip the border trip - and the Tuesday night speech - but his advisers persuaded him to follow through.

'It's not going to change a damn thing, but I'm still doing it,' Trump told them, pointing to senior communications aides Bill Shine, Sarah Huckabee Sanders and Kellyanne Conway and observing that 'these people behind you say it's worth it.'

The conflict between Trump and congressional Democrats led to a partial shutdown of the federal government a few days before Christmas. Without an agreement on how to fund about one-quarter of the government, the affected agencies can't reopen.

About 780,000 federal workers are either on unpaid furlough or being forced to work without pay. All will receive back pay when the shutdown ends, but they are likely to miss regularly scheduled paychecks on Friday.

Responding on Capitol Hill, Pelosi and Schumer framed the conflict as Trump's personal, uninformed crusade as they insisted they won't bend and agree to his terms.

'Sadly, much of what we have heard from President Trump throughout this senseless shutdown has been full of misinformation and even malice,' they said.

'The president has chosen fear.'

Trump passed on the chance to declare a national emergency on the southern border, a move that would have empowered him to freely spend the Pentagon's existing budget to build his wall without getting new funding from Congress

Their rebuttal criticized Trump for saying a flood of migrants at the border represents 'a security threat,' instead calling it 'a humanitarian challenge.'

Trump noted Schumer's past approval of a wall on America's southern border. The White House has promoted the historical fact of Schumer and former senators Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama all voting for it during the George W. Bush presidency.

Schumer 'has repeatedly supported a physical barrier in the past, along with many other Democrats,' he said. 'They changed their mind only after I was elected president. Democrats in Congress have refused to recognize the crisis.'

Trump cited statistics in his brief presentation, saying that in the past two years immigration officers 'made 266,000 arrests of aliens with criminal records,' including '100,000 assaults, 30,000 sex crimes and 4,000 violent killings.'

'Thousands more lives will be lost if we don't act right now,' he urged.

READ TRUMP'S BORDER SECURITY ADDRESS TO THE NATION

My fellow Americans: Tonight I'm speaking to you because there is a growing humanitarian and security crisis at our southern border. Every day, Customs and Border Patrol agents encounter thousands of illegal immigrants trying to enter our country. We are out of space to hold them, and we have no way to promptly return them back home to their country.

'America proudly welcomes millions of lawful immigrants who enrich our society and contribute to our nation, but all Americans are hurt by uncontrolled illegal migration. It strains public resources and drives down jobs and wages. Among those hardest hit are African-Americans and Hispanic Americans.

'Our southern border is a pipeline for vast quantities of illegal drugs including meth, heroin, cocaine, and fentanyl. Every week 300 of our citizens are killed by heroin alone, 90 per cent of which floods across from our southern border. More Americans will die from drugs this year than were killed in the entire Vietnam War.

'In the last two years, ICE officers made 266,000 arrests of aliens with criminal records, including those charged or convicted of 100,000 assaults, 30,000 sex crimes and 4,000 violent killings. Over the years thousands of Americans have been brutally killed by those who illegally entered our country and thousands more lives will be lost if we don't act right now.

'This is a humanitarian crisis, a crisis of the heart, and a crisis of the soul.

'Last month 20,000 migrant children were illegally brought into the United States, a dramatic increase. These children are used as human pawns by vicious coyotes and ruthless gangs. One in three women are sexually assaulted on the dangerous trek up through Mexico. Women and children are the biggest victims, by far, of our broken system.

'This is the tragic reality of illegal immigration on our southern border. This is the cycle of human suffering that I am determined to end. My administration has presented Congress with a detailed proposal to secure the border and stop the criminal gangs, drug smugglers and human traffickers. It's a tremendous problem.

'Our proposal was developed by law enforcement professionals and border agents at the department of homeland security. These are the resources they have requested to properly perform their mission and keep America safe - in fact, safer than ever before.

'The proposal from Homeland Security includes cutting-edge technology for detecting drugs, weapons, illegal contraband and many other things. We have requested more agents, immigration judges and bed space to process the sharp rise in unlawful migration fueled by our very strong economy. Our plan also contains an urgent request for humanitarian assistance and medical support. Furthermore, we have asked congress to close border security loopholes so that illegal immigrant children can be safely and humanely returned back home.

'Finally, as part of an overall approach to border security, law enforcement professionals have requested $5.7 billion for a physical barrier. At the request of Democrats, it will be a steel barrier rather than a concrete wall. This barrier is absolutely critical to border security. It's also what our professionals at the border want and need. This is just common sense.

'The border wall would very quickly pay for itself. The cost of illegal drugs exceeds $500 billion a year, vastly more than the $5.7 billion we have requested from Congress. The wall will also be paid for indirectly by the great new trade deal we have made with Mexico.

'Senator Chuck Schumer, who you will be hearing from later tonight, has repeatedly supported a physical barrier in the past, along with many other Democrats. They changed their mind only after I was elected president.

'Democrats in Congress have refused to acknowledge the crisis, and they have refused to provide our brave border agents with the tools they desperately need to protect our families and our nation. The federal government remains shut down for one reason, and one reason only: because Democrats will not fund border security. My administration is doing everything in our power to help those impacted by the situation, but the only solution is for Democrats to pass a spending bill that defends our borders and reopens the government.

'This situation could be solved in a 45-minute meeting. I have invited congressional leadership to the white house tomorrow to get this done. Hopefully we can rise above partisan politics in order to support national security.

'Some have suggested a barrier is immoral. Then why do wealthy politicians build walls, fences and gates around their homes? They don't build walls because they hate the people on the outside, but because they love the people on the inside. The only thing that is immoral is [for] the politicians to do nothing and continue to allow more innocent people to be so horribly victimized.

'America's heart broke the day after Christmas when a young police officer was savagely murdered in cold blood by an illegal alien who just came across the border. The life of an American hero was stolen by someone who had no right to be in our country. Day after day, precious lives are cut short by those who have violated our borders. In California an Air Force veteran was raped, murdered, and beaten to death with a hammer by an illegal alien with a long criminal history. In Georgia an illegal alien was recently charged with murder for killing, beheading and dismembering his neighbor. In Maryland, MS-13 gang members who arrived in the United States as unaccompanied minors were arrested and charged last year after viciously stabbing and beating a 16-year-old girl.

'Over the last several years I've met with dozens of families whose loved ones were stolen by illegal immigrations. I have held the hands of the mothers and embraced the grief stricken fathers. So sad, so terrible. I will never forget the pain in their eyes, the tremble in their voices and the sadness gripping their souls.

'How much more American blood must we shed before Congress does its job?

'To those that refuse to compromise in the name of border security, I would ask: imagine if it was your child, your husband, or your wife whose life was so cruelly shattered and totally broken. To every member of Congress, pass a bill that ends this crisis. To every citizen: call congress, and tell them to finally, after all of these decades, secure our border.

'This is a choice between right and wrong, justice and injustice. This is about whether we fulfill our sacred duty to the American citizens we serve.

'When I took the oath of office, i swore to protect our country, and that is what I will always do, so help me god. Thank you and good night.'

Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez slammed Trump in a statement after Tuesday night's speech, which he characterized as '[l]ies, fearmongering, finger-pointing, and a manufactured excuse for shutting down the government.'

'Using the Oval Office to deceive the American people and spout offensive, anti-immigrant rhetoric proves, once again, that Donald Trump is unfit to serve as president,' he said.

New Mexico Democratic Sen. Tom Udall said in a statement that Trump 'needs to end his shutdown now, before his reckless tantrum hurts more New Mexico families. New Mexicans didn't hear anything new tonight from the president. Instead, they just heard more fear-mongering about immigrants, and dishonest and out-of-touch talk about the border from a president who doesn't know the first thing about border communities.'

Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel praised Trump for 'fighting for a solution to fund our government while protecting American citizens, versus the approach of Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer which is to resist, resist, resist at all costs. It wasn't always this way.'

But Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California claimed Trump 'knows that illegal border crossings are at record lows, down 75 percent from 2000.'

She said her party won't support 'spending billions and billions of dollars on a wall that won't help protect our country. It's not realistic. It's not necessary. And it's not where we should focus our attention or resources.'

Vice President Mike Pence signaled on Monday that Trump's approach would be softer than expected.

'There is a humanitarian and national security crisis,' Pence told reporters Monday amid concerns Trump would declare a national emergency. Pence would only say that the White House counsel's office was considering the idea."

Senator Chuck Schumer and Speaker Nancy Pelosi led the fury that knows no bounds. The Democrat message was clear: Trump's plan for a wall is a disgusting assault on humanity and must be stopped at all costs

(Rising liberal star Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez even went so far as to tell MSNBC that illegal immigrants 'with nothing but shirts on their backs' trying to enter the US were 'acting more American than any person who seeks to keep them out ever will be.')

The Democrat message was clear: President Trump's plan for a wall along the border is a disgusting assault on humanity and must be stopped at all costs.

But wait....

Is my memory deceiving me?

I thought the Democrats themselves have always been very, VERY tough about illegal immigration across the southern border?

And that they too concluded a large barrier was the solution?

No, my memory was entirely correct.

In 2006, the Secure Fence Act was passed into law that called for 700 miles of secure fencing to be built along the border, and for enhanced surveillance technology including new satellites, drones, cameras and sensors.

It was a Republican president George W. Bush who signed off on it, but

Sen. Schumer voted in favour of it, as did then Sen. Barack Obama and Sen. Clinton, who later proudly boasted: 'I voted numerous times when I was a senator to spend money to build a barrier to try to prevent illegal immigrants from coming in. And I do think you have to control your borders.'

In 2013, now President Barack Obama signed off the Senate Immigration Overhaul bill that called for even tougher border security including extra fencing and 'boots on the ground on the southern border.'

Sen. Schumer supported that, too, as did Sen. Clinton.

In a speech to the Georgetown Law School, Schumer made his feelings on the issue crystal clear: 'Illegal immigration is wrong, plain and simple. When we use phrases like 'undocumented workers', we convey a message to the American people that their government is not serious about combating illegal immigration, which the American people overwhelmingly oppose. If you don't think it's illegal, you're not going to say it. I do think it's illegal and we have to change it.'

Obama has always been just as strident about illegal immigration.

As a Senator in 2005, he said: 'We simply cannot allow people to pour into the United States undetected, undocumented, unchecked and circumnavigating the line of people who are waiting patiently, diligently and lawfully to become immigrants into this country.'

In 2006, the Secure Fence Act was passed into law. President George W. Bush signed off on it, but Sen. Schumer voted in favour of it, as did then Sen. Barack Obama and Sen. Clinton. In fact, Obama was always strident about illegal immigration. The only difference between now and then is that it's Trump calling for the border security

President Bill Clinton presided over the draconian Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996, which represented a dramatic increase in immigration enforcement. The Border Patrol was substantially enlarged, numerous minor immigration violations were newly criminalised and deportations thus significantly increased.

He boasted: 'Our administration has moved aggressively to secure our borders more by hiring a record number of new border guards, by deporting twice as many criminal aliens as ever before, by cracking down on illegal hiring, by barring welfare benefits to illegal aliens.'

So, on balance, you might think that Democrats would be supportive of President Donald Trump's wall, wouldn't you?

After all, they seem to agree with him that the answer to the Southern border illegal immigration problem is a gigantic barrier and extra security.

Call it a fence, call it a wall - it all does exactly the same thing.

Results of all the enhanced protection along the border have been significant: the number of people caught trying to enter the US illegally along the border has dropped from over a million a year in 2006 to just 400,000 in 2016, according to U.S. Customs and Border Protection.

So it would appear that the new fencing and security worked, right?

Call it a fence, call it a wall - it all does exactly the same thing. Results have been significant: the number of people caught trying to enter the US illegally along the border has dropped significantly. So it would appear that the new fencing and security worked, right?

And if it's worked, then what could be the rational objection to extending the barrier and making the current barrier even more secure?

That, after all, is what Trump's wall plan would do.

As things stands, nearly 700 miles of the border is already fortified.

Trump's plan is to have three phases of construction of fences and walls covering 1,250 miles by the end of 2020.

The cost of all this, a few billion dollars, is comparative chicken feed for the world's wealthiest superpower.

The President, who made this a key campaign pledge, even conceded that it doesn't have to actually be a concrete wall - it can made of steel or much of the same 'fencing' that's already there.

Of course, the big difference between then and now is that the person calling for more barriers and security is Donald Trump.

And Democrats hate him so much they are now pretending to also hate his plan even though it bares a very striking resemblance to what they themselves have so eagerly voted for and supported for 12 years.

Of course, Trump, as so often, has done himself no favours by over-egging the soufflé.

His repeated demand for Mexico to pay for the wall is both ridiculous and needlessly inflammatory. If America wants to protect its border, then it's certainly rich enough to do so without getting its poorer neighbour to foot the bill.

And Trump's exaggerated, often wildly inaccurate, rhetoric about the number of criminals and terrorists coming illegally over the border devalues his argument.

Trump does himself no favours. His repeated demand for Mexico to pay for the wall is both ridiculous and needlessly inflammatory and his exaggerated, often wildly inaccurate, rhetoric devalues his argument

As does his failure to properly distinguish between legal immigrants and illegal immigrants. The former are a hugely valuable part of America's society and economy, and should be celebrated as such. Many law-abiding Hispanics whose votes Trump desperately needs actually feel as angry as he does about those who cheat the immigration system.

But the fact remains that hundreds of thousands of people still try to enter the US illegally across the border every year, and criminals and drug cartels use the border to smuggle in huge amounts of drugs like Fentanyl to devastatingly deadly effect on American lives.

It is indisputably an ongoing humanitarian and security 'crisis', whichever way you look at it.

And at its core, Trump's wall is little different in its intention to what his howling Democrat rivals have themselves so enthusiastically endorsed in the past.

Nor is much different to what most of us do with our own homes.

I am fortunate enough to own three houses, one in America and two in Britain.

All of them are protected by security barriers; two have stone walls, one has a barbed wire fence.

The purpose of those barriers is to stop unauthorised people coming inside.

I'm not alone in using walls or fencing for that purpose; hundreds of millions of people in the US do exactly the same thing, as do hundreds of millions of other people around the world.

Even the Pope, as Trump reminded us in the election campaign, has a gigantic wall around his home at the Vatican.

For this reason, I've never really understood the rage over Donald Trump's demand for a wall.

There's nothing ideologically or morally wrong with building a large barrier to stop people illegally entering a place - be it a home or country.

Indeed, that's why many of the same Democrats currently attacking Trump over his wall plan have previously voted for something very similar themselves.

So cut the hypocrisy, liberals. It stinks."
330,the huffington post,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/opinion-james-comey-house-republicans_us_5c1ac995e4b0407e9076ce8b,"If that first session exposed the delusional levels to which congressional Republicans are willing to sink in order to protect the president, this second session may have proved how much they have bought into their own phony narratives.

After reviewing the 173-page transcript of Comey's appearance Monday, here are some of the most revealing exchanges:

1. At one point, in focusing on the process Comey followed to have the FBI interview national security adviser Michael Flynn, Oversight Committee Chairman Trey Gowdy (R-S.C.) asked Comey if he had ""followed the protocol with Presidents Bush and President Obama."" Comey responded, ""I don't remember having occasion like this with either of those presidents.""

Republicans still won't accept the fact that what is happening right now with President Trump is unprecedented -- in their minds, for every accusation against Trump, there must be an equivalent or greater crime by a Democrat.

2. Trump would have the American people believe that Flynn was tricked into lying to the FBI. Gowdy did his best to bolster this narrative with his questioning, asking Comey head-on, ""Why not advise General Flynn of the consequences of making false statements to the FBI?""

Comey's response: ""Two reasons, really. First, the Deputy Director called him, told him what the subject matter was, told him he was welcome to have a representative from White House counsel there. So, he knew what he was going to be asked about. He was an extraordinarily experienced person and so reasonably should be assumed to understand you can't lie to the FBI. Second, it's not protocol. The FBI does not do that in noncustodial interviews. And, third, you want to find out what the witness will say to you before you heat up an interview by raising the prospect that the witness might be lying to you.""

For anyone questioning why Comey could not, as Trump asked him to, let the Flynn matter go, Comey clarified what was really at stake: ""Our focus was it appeared that the National Security Advisor was lying to the Vice President about his communications with the Russians, and that made no sense to us, and we wanted to understand what is happening here."" It says a lot that neither Trump nor congressional Republicans seem to care at all about finding the truth.

3. Just as they did during the first day of testimony, Republicans spent a lot of their time trying to get Comey to answer hypothetical questions. A very annoyed Gowdy asked Comey directly why he wouldn't answer hypothetical questions. Comey's response: ""Because I'm not. It is irresponsible to answer hypotheticals. I tried to do a lot of it last time. I will answer factual questions, but the what-ifs and what-abouts, I'm just not going the answer those.""

I spent five years working at the House Oversight Committee and, while reading this exchange, I thought to myself, ""This is getting really embarrassing for the GOP.""

4. Rep. Elijah Cummings (D-Md.), who is poised to become the Oversight panel's chairman in a few weeks, asked Comey about something he tweeted the day before. ""Why do you believe that President Trump was, quote, 'lying about the lawful execution of a search warrant in the case of Michael Cohen'?""

Comey pointedly stated that ""I believe he was lying because he knows that the office was searched pursuant to a Federal judge's issuance of a search warrant... and the notion that the President of the United States, who has taken an oath to faithfully execute the laws of the United States, is going to say that kind of thing about his own Department of Justice offended me...""

It's nothing revelatory, but it raises the question of why House Republicans decided to once again give Comey, a highly credible witness, a platform to call the president a liar.

Cummings continued, allowing Comey to lay out what's really at stake in the president's criticisms of law enforcement: ""What is the harm and the concern to national security when the President makes these kinds of statements, like the tweets that I just read you?""

Comey's response: ""Millions of people believe what the President says... And that is a situation that puts us at risk in the short term, that the FBI and the Justice Department will not be trusted or believed. At a doorway trying to recruit a source, in a courtroom where they say, ""I found this in the left dresser drawer of this gang member,"" and they won't be believed because the President of the United States has convinced millions of people that they're corrupt, when that's a lie.""

This exchange is one more reason why I think Cummings is going to be a very effective chairman.

5. Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte (R-Va.), meanwhile, joined Gowdy in using his time to amplify one of the president's favorite conspiracy theories. ""Did the FBI or any government agency ever record President Trump or surreptitiously obtain recordings or transcripts of recordings, whether audio or video, of President Trump?""

Comey's straightforward response, ""Not to my knowledge,"" will surely do nothing to keep the president or his defenders from continuing to cast Trump as the victim of a ""deep state"" plot.

6. Perhaps the most striking moment of the hearing was when Cummings teed Comey up for a blistering critique of the president and the Republican Party as a whole:

You probably know this, but for most of my adult life I considered myself a Republican. And Republicans used to believe, I think, that a president's words matter, that institutions matter, that the rule of law matters, and that the truth matters. ... Shame on those who, because they're afraid of the base or their job or being tweeted about, don't speak up. I don't know what they're going to tell their grandchildren, because that silence is complicity. That worries me deeply.

On Monday night, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders tweeted, ""Republicans should stand up to Comey and his tremendous corruption.... The president did the country a service by firing him and exposing him for the shameless fraud he is."""

President Donald Trump vowed Wednesday to let the shutdown continue for 'whatever it takes' as he stormed Capitol Hill to convince Republicans to stick with him on day 19 of the government closure.

Trump walked up the steps of the U.S. Capitol building to have lunch with Senate Republicans, who have been showing signs of impatience with his demand for full funding of his border wall in order to reopen the government.

""How long are you willing to let this shutdown last, Mr. President?"" a reporter asked him as he strode down the ornate hallway outside the Senate chamber.

""Whatever it takes,"" Trump replied.

Trump's latest offensive comes after his first Oval Office address to the nation

Trump's latest offensive comes the morning after his first Oval Office address to the nation, where he sought to turn the tide of lawmaker and public support his way.

His visit comes as more Republicans are getting vocal about their concerns the shutdown has gone on too long with some saying it's time to reopen the government even without a guarantee of full funding for Trump's border wall.

The president played down what's happening in his party when asked about it during his visit to Capitol Hill.

'There is tremendous Republican support. Unwavering,' he said.

The president also dropped new hints on Wednesday that he's prepared to go around lawmakers and build his border wall without a deal for new congressional spending.

'I really believe the Democrats and the Republicans are working together,' Trump said during an afternoon bill-signing event.

But 'otherwise,' he warned, 'we'll go about it in a different manner.'

'I don't think we'll have to do that,' Trump chided unseen Democrats through a press pool that included TV cameras.

'I think we might work a deal,' he said. 'And if we don't, we might go that route.' Trump said he has the 'absolute right' to declare an emergency, declaring that the only meaningful 'threshold' for making that decision would be the failure of his team and negotiators in Congress to cut a deal.

'My threshold will be if I can't make a deal with people who are unreasonable,' he said.

Following his soft-pedal approach to making his case for renewed border security spending during a Tuesday night Oval Office address, Trump's shift back to baring his fangs instead of begging for cooperation left his own aides confused.

'We honestly don't know what he's doing,' one White House official told DailyMail.com after the bill-signing.

Another said fellow aides were 'playing wait-and-see just like the rest of you [reporters], but if it keeps the Democrats as off-balance as we are, maybe that's good.'

Trump spoke for nine minutes from the Oval Office of the White House on Tuesday, shaming congressional Democrats as he blamed them for bloodshed caused by illegal immigrants

Trump's preference for a border wall over other security measures hasn't changed.

'We can all play games but a wall is a necessity. ... If you don't have the wall it doesn't matter,' the president said Wednesday. 'A drone isn't stopping a thousand people running through.'

'They say it's a medieval solution,' he complained. 'It's true. It's medieval because it worked then.'

Trump headed to Capitol Hill after his bill-signing to speak with Senate Republicans. He expects to see House and Senate leaders from both parties at the White House later in the afternoon.

Half of that retinue will be his arch-nemeses, House speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer.

The Democratic duo will take the 16-block limousine ride from the U.S. Capitol to the White House for a new round of sparring over an 18-day-old government shutdown, a day after President Donald Trump used an Oval Office address to move the debate over border security back where it started.

But the president's suggestion that he's still willing to turn them into spectators will change the dynamic in the room.

Pelosi and Schumer held a joint press conference Wednesday morning to double down on their refusal to give Trump what he wants - $5.7 billion for new border wall construction in exchange for restoring the operations of about one-quarter of the government.

More than half Trump's Cabinet agencies have been in limbo since a few days before Christmas; he said Tuesday night that 'a 45-minute meeting' could resolve the stalemate.

Schumer and Pelosi aren't likely go give any ground, despite Trump's assurance on Tuesday that the stalemate over border security could be solved in a 45-minute meeting

Trump suggested Wednesday morning that border security is a weak spot in America's otherwise strong carapace

He stopped short of declaring that emergency on Tuesday night while reiterating his demand that congressional Democrats fund a border wall that he has promised for nearly four years.

But he played the shame card with a vengeance, blaming them for playing politics with innocent American lives and allowing 'a crisis of the heart and a crisis of the soul' to fester.

'How much more American blood must we shed before Congress does its job?' Trump asked in a 9-minute speech from the Oval Office.

Citing a string of murders committed by illegal immigrants who have been previously deported form the United States, he demanded of lawmakers: 'For those who refuse to compromise in the name of border security, I would ask: Imagine if it was your child, your husband or your wife whose life was so cruelly shattered and totally broken.'

'To every member of Congress: Pass a bill that ends this crisis.'

On Wednesday morning the presidnet suggested that border security is a rare bleak spot in America's outlook, tweeting that the nation 'is doing so well in so many ways. Great jobs numbers, with a record setting December. We are rebuilding our military. Vets finally have Choice & Accountability. Economy & GDP are strong. Tax & Reg cuts historic. Trade deals great.'

'But we MUST fix our Southern Border!'

Trump is demanding $5.7 billion in new congressional spending for his long-promised border wall

Pelosi and Schumer delivered the Democrats' response after Trump spoke, framing the conflict as Trump's personal, uninformed crusade as they insisted they won't bend and agree to his terms

The President tweeted after his address to acknowledge 'soooo many nice comments' about his speech amid the ongoing battle with congressional Democrats

Trump said Tuesday that child trafficking and sexual violence against women who try to migrate into the U.S. illegally is a 'cycle of human suffering' that he's determined to end.

He implored Americans to call their members of Congress 'and tell them to finally, after all of these decades, secure our border. This is a choice between right and wrong, justice and injustice.'

The White House has requested $5.7 billion in new funding to continue the wall's construction. The president passed up the option to declare an emergency on Tuesday and spend existing Defense Department dollars to build it without Congress.

Instead he returned to his previous lines of argument, claiming a border security crisis has resulted in a flood of narcotics and human trafficking, and endangering Americans' lives.

Trump plans to host congressional leaders from both parties at the White House for negotiations on Wednesday, followed by a Capitol Hill visit to brief Republicans

He will visit the southern border on Thursday to highlight his demand for a wall.

After his address Tuesday night, Trump tweeted: 'Thank you for soooo many nice comments regarding my Oval Office speech. A very interesting experience!'

The New York Times reported that Trump told a lunchtime meeting of news executives and anchors on Tuesday that he was inclined to skip the border trip - and the Tuesday night speech - but his advisers persuaded him to follow through.

'It's not going to change a damn thing, but I'm still doing it,' Trump told them, pointing to senior communications aides Bill Shine, Sarah Huckabee Sanders and Kellyanne Conway and observing that 'these people behind you say it's worth it.'

The conflict between Trump and congressional Democrats led to a partial shutdown of the federal government a few days before Christmas. Without an agreement on how to fund about one-quarter of the government, the affected agencies can't reopen.

About 780,000 federal workers are either on unpaid furlough or being forced to work without pay. All will receive back pay when the shutdown ends, but they are likely to miss regularly scheduled paychecks on Friday.

Responding on Capitol Hill, Pelosi and Schumer framed the conflict as Trump's personal, uninformed crusade as they insisted they won't bend and agree to his terms.

'Sadly, much of what we have heard from President Trump throughout this senseless shutdown has been full of misinformation and even malice,' Pelosi said.

'The president has chosen fear.'

Trump passed on the chance to declare a national emergency on the southern border, a move that would have empowered him to freely spend the Pentagon's existing budget to build his wall without getting new funding from Congress

'The fact is: the women and children at the border are not a security threat, they are a humanitarian challenge - a challenge that President Trump's own cruel and counterproductive policies have only deepened,' Pelosi added.

Schumer was equally slashing.

'Having failed to get Mexico to pay for his ineffective, unnecessary border wall, and unable to convince the Congress or the American people to foot the bill [Trump] has shut down the government,' the New York Democrat said.

'American democracy doesn't work that way. We don't govern by temper tantrum. No president should pound the table and demand he gets his way or else the government shuts down, hurting millions of Americans who are treated as leverage.'

In his own speech, Trump noted Schumer's past approval of a wall on America's southern border. The White House has promoted the historical fact of Schumer and former senators Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama all voting for it during the George W. Bush presidency.

Schumer 'has repeatedly supported a physical barrier in the past, along with many other Democrats,' he said. 'They changed their mind only after I was elected president. Democrats in Congress have refused to recognize the crisis.'

Trump cited statistics in his brief presentation, saying that in the past two years immigration officers 'made 266,000 arrests of aliens with criminal records,' including '100,000 assaults, 30,000 sex crimes and 4,000 violent killings.'

'Thousands more lives will be lost if we don't act right now,' he urged.

READ TRUMP'S BORDER SECURITY ADDRESS TO THE NATION

My fellow Americans: Tonight I'm speaking to you because there is a growing humanitarian and security crisis at our southern border. Every day, Customs and Border Patrol agents encounter thousands of illegal immigrants trying to enter our country. We are out of space to hold them, and we have no way to promptly return them back home to their country.

'America proudly welcomes millions of lawful immigrants who enrich our society and contribute to our nation, but all Americans are hurt by uncontrolled illegal migration. It strains public resources and drives down jobs and wages. Among those hardest hit are African-Americans and Hispanic Americans.

'Our southern border is a pipeline for vast quantities of illegal drugs including meth, heroin, cocaine, and fentanyl. Every week 300 of our citizens are killed by heroin alone, 90 per cent of which floods across from our southern border. More Americans will die from drugs this year than were killed in the entire Vietnam War.

'In the last two years, ICE officers made 266,000 arrests of aliens with criminal records, including those charged or convicted of 100,000 assaults, 30,000 sex crimes and 4,000 violent killings. Over the years thousands of Americans have been brutally killed by those who illegally entered our country and thousands more lives will be lost if we don't act right now.

'This is a humanitarian crisis, a crisis of the heart, and a crisis of the soul.

'Last month 20,000 migrant children were illegally brought into the United States, a dramatic increase. These children are used as human pawns by vicious coyotes and ruthless gangs. One in three women are sexually assaulted on the dangerous trek up through Mexico. Women and children are the biggest victims, by far, of our broken system.

'This is the tragic reality of illegal immigration on our southern border. This is the cycle of human suffering that I am determined to end. My administration has presented Congress with a detailed proposal to secure the border and stop the criminal gangs, drug smugglers and human traffickers. It's a tremendous problem.

'Our proposal was developed by law enforcement professionals and border agents at the department of homeland security. These are the resources they have requested to properly perform their mission and keep America safe - in fact, safer than ever before.

'The proposal from Homeland Security includes cutting-edge technology for detecting drugs, weapons, illegal contraband and many other things. We have requested more agents, immigration judges and bed space to process the sharp rise in unlawful migration fueled by our very strong economy. Our plan also contains an urgent request for humanitarian assistance and medical support. Furthermore, we have asked congress to close border security loopholes so that illegal immigrant children can be safely and humanely returned back home.

'Finally, as part of an overall approach to border security, law enforcement professionals have requested $5.7 billion for a physical barrier. At the request of Democrats, it will be a steel barrier rather than a concrete wall. This barrier is absolutely critical to border security. It's also what our professionals at the border want and need. This is just common sense.

'The border wall would very quickly pay for itself. The cost of illegal drugs exceeds $500 billion a year, vastly more than the $5.7 billion we have requested from Congress. The wall will also be paid for indirectly by the great new trade deal we have made with Mexico.

'Senator Chuck Schumer, who you will be hearing from later tonight, has repeatedly supported a physical barrier in the past, along with many other Democrats. They changed their mind only after I was elected president.

'Democrats in Congress have refused to acknowledge the crisis, and they have refused to provide our brave border agents with the tools they desperately need to protect our families and our nation. The federal government remains shut down for one reason, and one reason only: because Democrats will not fund border security. My administration is doing everything in our power to help those impacted by the situation, but the only solution is for Democrats to pass a spending bill that defends our borders and reopens the government.

'This situation could be solved in a 45-minute meeting. I have invited congressional leadership to the white house tomorrow to get this done. Hopefully we can rise above partisan politics in order to support national security.

'Some have suggested a barrier is immoral. Then why do wealthy politicians build walls, fences and gates around their homes? They don't build walls because they hate the people on the outside, but because they love the people on the inside. The only thing that is immoral is [for] the politicians to do nothing and continue to allow more innocent people to be so horribly victimized.

'America's heart broke the day after Christmas when a young police officer was savagely murdered in cold blood by an illegal alien who just came across the border. The life of an American hero was stolen by someone who had no right to be in our country. Day after day, precious lives are cut short by those who have violated our borders. In California an Air Force veteran was raped, murdered, and beaten to death with a hammer by an illegal alien with a long criminal history. In Georgia an illegal alien was recently charged with murder for killing, beheading and dismembering his neighbor. In Maryland, MS-13 gang members who arrived in the United States as unaccompanied minors were arrested and charged last year after viciously stabbing and beating a 16-year-old girl.

'Over the last several years I've met with dozens of families whose loved ones were stolen by illegal immigrations. I have held the hands of the mothers and embraced the grief stricken fathers. So sad, so terrible. I will never forget the pain in their eyes, the tremble in their voices and the sadness gripping their souls.

'How much more American blood must we shed before Congress does its job?

'To those that refuse to compromise in the name of border security, I would ask: imagine if it was your child, your husband, or your wife whose life was so cruelly shattered and totally broken. To every member of Congress, pass a bill that ends this crisis. To every citizen: call congress, and tell them to finally, after all of these decades, secure our border.

'This is a choice between right and wrong, justice and injustice. This is about whether we fulfill our sacred duty to the American citizens we serve.

'When I took the oath of office, i swore to protect our country, and that is what I will always do, so help me god. Thank you and good night.'

Democratic National Committee Chairman Tom Perez slammed Trump in a statement after Tuesday night's speech, which he characterized as '[l]ies, fearmongering, finger-pointing, and a manufactured excuse for shutting down the government.'

'Using the Oval Office to deceive the American people and spout offensive, anti-immigrant rhetoric proves, once again, that Donald Trump is unfit to serve as president,' he said.

New Mexico Democratic Sen. Tom Udall said in a statement that Trump 'needs to end his shutdown now, before his reckless tantrum hurts more New Mexico families. New Mexicans didn't hear anything new tonight from the president. Instead, they just heard more fear-mongering about immigrants, and dishonest and out-of-touch talk about the border from a president who doesn't know the first thing about border communities.'

Republican National Committee Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel praised Trump for 'fighting for a solution to fund our government while protecting American citizens, versus the approach of Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer which is to resist, resist, resist at all costs. It wasn't always this way.'

But Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California claimed Trump 'knows that illegal border crossings are at record lows, down 75 percent from 2000.'

She said her party won't support 'spending billions and billions of dollars on a wall that won't help protect our country. It's not realistic. It's not necessary. And it's not where we should focus our attention or resources.'

Vice President Mike Pence signaled on Monday that Trump's approach would be softer than expected.

'There is a humanitarian and national security crisis,' Pence told reporters Monday amid concerns Trump would declare a national emergency. Pence would only say that the White House counsel's office was considering the idea."

Russian trolls launched a plan to blacken Robert Mueller's reputation with thousands of social media posts after he began investigating Donald Trump, a new report reveals.

They targeted him with posts on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram to falsely convince voters he was corrupt.

One post even claimed he had worked alongside 'radical Islamic' groups, according to the report for the Senate Intelligence Committee.

Russian trolls launched a plan to blacken Robert Mueller's reputation with thousands of social media posts after he began investigating Donald Trump, a new report reveals

Russia used every social media platform to drum up support for Donald Trump in the 2016 election, a new report has found, and put an emphasis on going after African American voters, who mostly backed Hillary Clinton

The Kremlin-linked Internet Research Agency, which has been charged with interfering in the elections, relied on Facebook, Google and Twitter and other platforms for targeted messaging, according to the report.

It used words, videos and images to persuade voters to back Trump, according to the report by Oxford University's Computational Propaganda Project and network analysis company Graphika.

The report also said Russians made efforts to stir up sentiment among African American voters in the 2016 election campaign.

The Russian Internet Research Agency purchased a total of 1,087 ads targeting African American politic and culture and black identity and nationalism during the campaign, according to a bombshell analysis of the Russian influence operation that investigators have yet to fully examine.

Facebook's ad program allowed purchasers to select users with certain interests, like Malcolm X - a capability the St. Petersburg-based outfit relied on to slice up the American electorate.

It outlines repeated Russian efforts to divide and target black voters - and even a program to set up hotlines to get people to confess problems that could be potential fodder for blackmail.

The tactics reached tens of millions of Americans during the multi-year durations, and targeted key interest groups known to impact U.S. elections.

Online activity focused on police violence against blacks

Russians tried ginning up support online using multiple campaigns, including Blacktivist

U.S. intelligence assessed and prosecutors have charged that the outfit was financed by a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin. Many of the ad purchases were in rubles. Early posts before 2014 were in Russian, but English language social media activity jumped that year, and continued even into 2017.

The Russians set up 30 Facebook pages on black Americans, while another 10 YouTube channels focused on police violence against blacks and put out 571 videos on the subject.

The efforts to target African Americans and suppress the black vote came during a 2016 election where Hillary Clinton won an overwhelming share of support among African American vote.

According to the report: 'Messaging to African Americans sought to divert their political energy away from established political institutions by preying on anger with structural inequalities faced by African Americans, including police violence, poverty, and disproportionate levels of incarceration.'

It continued: 'These campaigns pushed a message that the best way to advance the cause of the African American community was to boycott the election and focus on other issues instead. This often happened through the use of repetitive slogans. This accounts for the majority of content in the dataset that targeted this group.'

The Russians also went after other demographic slices: Muslims, southerners, Texans, and more.

Other ads targeted conservatives and particular regions

The campaign didn't stop after the trolls got caught, and in fact peaked in 2017, according to the report.

In one notably callous tactics, Russians set up hotlines to get people to call in and talk about their sex problems and other personal issues - a source for possible blackmail material, NBC reported.

Other trickery enticed Americans to take political actions.

On Twitter, English-language posts from Russia shot up in late 2015.

After a Russian 'Black Matters' Facebook page got shut down, the IRA simply created new renamed campaigns to push its message. 'Cops kill black kids. Are you sure that your son won't be the next?' went one aimed at African Americans.

Activity spiked around major political debates between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton.

Broken down by state, a leading 265 ads targeted Missouri.

Researchers even found that racial geography, more than the the Electoral College, was a driver in ad purchases.

'We believe the targeting had more to do with race than a state's role in the Electoral College or status as a swing state. For example, African Americans in Ferguson, MO were targeted for the 'Black Matters' campaign. African Americans in Baltimore, MD and Oakland, CA were targeted for the 'Blacktivist' campaign. Texan cities were targeted for campaigns focusing on patriotism and pro-gun politics,' according to the report.

Russia used nearly every social media platform to drum up support for Donald Trump in the 2016 election, the report also found.

'What is clear is that all of the messaging clearly sought to benefit the Republican Party - and specifically Donald Trump,' the report says.

'Trump is mentioned most in campaigns targeting conservatives and right-wing voters, where the messaging encouraged these groups to support his campaign. The main groups that could challenge Trump were then provided messaging that sought to confuse, distract and ultimately discourage members from voting.'

The report was presented to the Senate Intelligence Committee. The bipartisan panel released it publicly on Monday morning.

It tracks observations like an increase in activity on election day in 2016 and during general election debates between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. Activity by the group spiked the most at the end of the year when Barack Obama announced that he was opening up probes into Russia's attempt to hack the election.

Among its findings were that conservative users 'were actively encouraged to get behind Trump's campaign' while other users were 'encouraged to boycott the election, abstain from voting for Clinton, or to spread cynicism about participating in the election in general.'

Committee chairman Richard Burr, a North Carolina Republican, said the data 'demonstrates how aggressively Russia sought to divide Americans by race, religion and ideology, and how the IRA actively worked to erode trust in our democratic institutions.'

'Most troublingly, it shows that these activities have not stopped,' he assessed. 'As we work to address these threats, these reports are proof positive that one of the most important things we can do is increase information sharing between the social media companies who can identify disinformation campaigns and the third-party experts who can analyze them.'

The Russians sought to boost Trump and drive down turnout among potential Hillary Clinton supporters

The committee's vice chair, Mark Warner, a Virginia Democrat, likewise said the report revealed that Russian election meddling was worse than previously revealed.

'This should stand as a wake up call to us all that none of us are immune from this threat, and it is time to get serious in addressing this challenge,' he said. 'That is going to require some much-needed and long-overdue guardrails when it comes to social media. I hope these reports will spur legislative action in the Congress and provide additional clarity to the American public about Russia's assault on our democracy.'

Researchers also noted that the data includes evidence of sloppiness by the Russians that could have led to earlier detection, including the use of Russia's currency, the ruble, to buy ads.

House Intelligence ranking member Adam Schiff, a California Democrat, said in a statement after the release of the report that social media companies share in the blame and must be held accountable.

'Their reluctance to conduct and publish such deep analysis themselves, to actively and meaningfully collaborate with one another to compare and publicize data and information to build out the extent of the IRA's efforts, and to otherwise make available to outside research groups comprehensive, uniform access to the data, have made our task far more difficult than it should have been,' he scolded.

Schiff said the companies, which he did not call out by name, should be doing more to keep their users and the public aware of disinformation operations."

'It has definitely ruined my last three days,' Nikki Giles, 21, told USA Today. 'I have cried daily and called my family crying because the first 12 to 24 hours or so I was getting a lot of hate.'

Giles said she reported the attacks to the team, via Facebook, and she's flagged several of the 27-year-old Bauer's tweets.

Nikki Giles was responding to a criticism of her favorite player, Alex Bregman, when Bauer took offense. He spent the next few days peppering her with negative tweets

The bizarre social media skirmish began when Bauer Tweeted criticism of Giles's favorite player, Houston Astros third baseman Alex Bregman.

Giles told Bauer that he was her 'least favorite' baseball player, and Bauer responded over the next few days by tagging her in at least 80 tweets, according to USA Today.

'Maybe you shouldn't have trolled me then,' he wrote at one point.

After she questioned his professionalism, Bauer responded by digging up old tweets of hers and sending her an instructional video about Twitter.

'The classic troll, get absolutely destroyed, claim harassment narrative,' he tweeted.

'He blamed me for 'continuously tweeting him,' said Giles, who majors in finance. '[That] makes zero sense because he had tagged me in over 40 tweets, which is over 10x as many tweets I mentioned him in.'

Giles tried blocking him, but eventually unblocked him in order to respond to his criticism.

'I eventually unblocked him when someone brought to my attention that he had tagged me in 30 more tweets in responses,' she said. 'And when I said I felt harassed, he continued to tweet things like this claiming that I was responding to him because 'I like him.'

Bauer continued defending himself on Tuesday and Wednesday while Giles claims she been sexually harassed on Twitter in addition to the hateful tweets she's received.

'You're so dumb dude literally once you lose an argument you block someone,' read a screengrab of a direct message Giles claimes she received since Bauer's tirade. 'Maybe this Trevor thing taught you something.'

Both the team and Bauer's agent declined to comment to USA Today.

Bauer is known as an active Twitter user. He's previously engaged in several conspiracy theories, like the false claim that former President Barack Obama was born outside the United States. He also frequently criticizes the media for its coverage of President Donald Trump.

Bauer has also been discussing Giles at length with other Twitter users.

334,daily mail online,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6595957/IRS-recalling-46-000-workers-handle-taxes.html,"The Internal Revenue Service is recalling about 46,000 of its employees furloughed by the government shutdown to handle tax returns and pay out refunds, but won't be paying IRS workers while the federal freeze due to a dispute between Congress and the president over funding for a border wall continues.

With the official start of the tax filing season coming on January 28, President Donald Trump's administration has promised that taxpayers owed refunds will be paid on time, despite the disruption in government services caused by the partial shutdown now in its fourth week.

There had been growing concern that the shutdown would delay refunds worth hundreds of billions of dollars because the money wouldn't be available for them from Congress.

But last week, the administration said customary shutdown policies will be reversed to make the money available to pay refunds on time.

But at least for now, it's going to take unpaid labor from 60 percent of the IRS's work force to get that ball rolling.

The shutdown is now in its 25th day, surpassing the previous record for the longest shutdown by four days, which lasted for three weeks at the end of 1995 and beginning of 1996 under President Bill Clinton.

The IRS is recalling about 46,000 of its employees furloughed by the government shutdown to handle tax returns and pay out refunds, but won't be paying the additional workers while the federal freeze due to a dispute between Congress and President Donald Trump over funding for a border wall continues. Trump is pictured addressing the annual American Farm Bureau Federation convention in the Ernest N. Morial Convention Center in New Orleans, Louisiana on Monday

About three-quarters of US taxpayers receive annual refunds, giving them an incentive to file their returns early.

Many lower-income people count on refunds as their biggest cash infusion of the year. Overall, refunds average $2,800.

An IRS document detailing its new shutdown plan shows that 46,052 agency employees will be called back to work, of the total workforce of 80,265, to help ensure people don't have to wait longer than expected for those checks.

It says the plan will take effect as soon as the Treasury Department issues an official notice.On Tuesday, a federal judge rejected a legal challenge brought by the union representing IRS objecting to the agency recalling workers without pay

Some experts question whether the administration has the legal authority to reverse earlier policies to allow the government to issue tax refunds during a shutdown. In this file photo from April 8, 2005, Mary Kersey transcribes data from tax returns at the Cincinnati Internal Revenue Service Center in Covington, Kentucky

Only about 10,000 IRS employees had previously been deemed essential and have been working.

Angered over employees having to work without pay, the union representing IRS staff sued in federal court last week to challenge any such agency action on constitutional grounds.

The Constitution doesn't allow the government to obligate funds that haven't been provided by Congress, and the executive branch 'can't continue to force more and more employees to show up in exchange only for an IOU,' the National Treasury Employees Union said.

On Tuesday, a federal judge rejected the union's challenge, declining to force the government to pay the recalled employees.

Some 800,000 federal employees have been furloughed or have been working without pay since the government shutdown began.

Trump didn't budge on Tuesday from his demand to have Congress provide $5.7 billion to build his promised border wall with Mexico, which is the impetus for the freeze.

Democrats say they will discuss border security once the government has reopened, but House Speaker Nancy Pelosi is refusing money for the wall that Democrats view as ineffective and immoral.

The financial issues at hand are politically sensitive in more ways than one.

The massive tax law enacted by Republicans in Congress in late 2017, which is Trump's signature legislative achievement, gave generous tax cuts to corporations and the wealthiest Americans and more modest reductions to middle- and low-income households.

The law is expected to bring lower taxes for 2018 for the great majority of Americans, and the refunds are a big tangible part of that.

Trump told supporters on a conference call on Tuesday that his administration has been working to minimize the painful impacts of the shutdown.

'People are actually amazed that, with this many people, that government is really working so well. So we're very proud of that,' he said.

Some experts question whether the administration has the legal authority to reverse earlier policies to allow the government to issue tax refunds during a shutdown.

In 2011, the chief counsel at the IRS concluded that such payments were legally allowed during a shutdown.

At the time, the White House Office of Management and Budget, under President Barack Obama, rejected that position and directed the IRS not to pay refunds during a shutdown.

But the IRS said last week that OMB had reviewed the issue at the Treasury's Department's request and now agrees with the IRS counsel's position that refunds can legally be paid.

335,daily mail online,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6544883/Trump-blasts-Stan-McChrystal-retired-general-slammed-President-immoral.html,"By Keith Griffith and Emily Goodin, U.s. Political Reporter For Dailymail.com

President Donald Trump has clapped back at Stanley McChrystal, days after the retired four-star Army general insulted the President as shady and immoral.

''General' McChrystal got fired like a dog by Obama. Last assignment a total bust. Known for big, dumb mouth. Hillary lover!' Trump wrote in a tweet on the morning of New Year's Day.

McChrystal was in command of U.S. forces in Afghanistan when he was forced to resign in 2010, after he and his staff were quoted in a Rolling Stone article mocking civilian officials in the Obama administration.

The former general appeared in an interview on Sunday with ABC's This Week, in which he heaped scorn upon the President.

'I think it's important for me to work for people who I think are basically honest, who tell the truth as best they know it,' he said of why he would not join Trump's administration.

'You think he's a liar?,' asked ABC's Martha Raddatz.

'I don't think he tells the truth,' McChrystal replied.

'Is Trump immoral, in your view?,' she asked.

'I think he is,' he responded.

'If we want to be governed by someone we wouldn't do a business deal with because their background is so shady, if we're willing to do that, then that's in conflict with who I think we are,' McChrystal continued.

Trump's tweet blasting McChrystal also quoted a link shared by Fox News host Laura Ingraham, to an analysis piece in Lifezette titled 'Media Didn't Like McChrystal Until He Started Bashing Trump.'

Michele Blood wrote in the piece: 'Though the sacked general received considerable blowback from the public and the press following his sharp criticism of Obama and his administration back in 2010, many on the Left have welcomed McChrystal's putdowns of the current commander-in-chief with open arms.'

In the ABC interview, McChrystal said that the resignation letter from Defense Secretary James Mattis was 'valuable' and should cause all Americans to think about their commander-in-chief.

'I would guess that Secretary Mattis took a long time agonizing over writing a letter that was as direct about his feelings as that particular letter was. He knew it would be very public and it would make a very strong statement that was much broader than the Syria issue. It was about America's role in the world,' he said.

He added: 'I personally think it was valuable. I think maybe it causes the American people to take pause and say, wait a minute, if we have someone who is as selfless and as committed as Jim Mattis resigns his position, walking away from all the responsibility he feels for every service member in our forces, and he does so in a public way like that, we ought to stop and say, OK, why did he do it? We ought to ask what kind of commander in chief he had that Jim Mattis that, you know, the good Marine, felt he had to walk away.'

Mattis' resignation came in protest after Trump announced he was pulling out U.S. troops from Syria, which the two men disagreed about.

McChrystal cautioned anyone who would join the president's administration to think carefully if they could be fully loyal to Trump.

'I would ask them to look in the mirror and ask them if they can get comfortable enough with President Trump's approach to governance, how he conducts himself, with his values and with his world view, to be truly loyal to him as a commander in chief and going forward,' he said.

'And we're all instinctively loyal. But the reality is, if there's too much of a disconnect, then I would tell him, I think it's - it would be a bad foundation upon which to try to build a successful partnership with that job,' he added.

He said of Trump supporters: ' I would ask every American to do is, again, stand in front of that mirror and say, what are we about? Am I really willing to throw away or ignore some of the things that people do that are pretty unacceptable, normally, just because they accomplish certain other things that we might like?'"

There always is when the Queen welcomes the entire Royal Family to a pre-Christmas lunch at Buckingham Palace.

But for the first time in recent years this week's gathering is being held against an uneasy backdrop of reported rifts and family splits.

No one is more sensitive to domestic discord than the Queen, who throughout the Diana years found herself having to hold the ring amid the turmoil that raged around her.

She is determined, say courtiers, to never again allow such conflicts to destabilise family unity.

This picture of the Duchess of Sussex, Clare Waight Keller (who designed Meghan's wedding dress for Givenchy) and Rosamund Pike at the British Fashion Awards was shared on Instagram but quickly deleted before being replaced with another image of Meghan at the event

And it is why aides yesterday were playing down the significance of claims that Prince Harry will miss the traditional Boxing Day shoot at Sandringham, apparently to avoid upsetting his anti-bloodsports wife Meghan.

We have been here before, of course. Last year Harry also missed the pheasant shoot -- but then he and Meghan were not yet married and his decision seemed loving and considerate.

Scarcely a week goes by without the Duke and Duchess of Sussex kicking over the royal traces, from announcing plans to abandon their palace home and moving to Windsor Great Park, to sending out their highly unusual Christmas card.

Prince Harry lights up a cigarette whilst on a shoot on the Sandringham estate. It was claimed he will miss the traditional Boxing Day shoot to avoid upsetting Meghan

But then step by elegant step the former Meghan Markle is ripping up the royal rules.

Nothing illustrates that more than what happened a few days ago -- two royal events, two duchesses and two very different outcomes. At the Guards Chapel in Central London, a beaming Duchess of Cornwall posed for the cameras between a miniature Shetland pony and a donkey.

She was attending a carol concert to support the work of an animal welfare charity. Unfussy and unglamorous -- but in its simplicity the very essence of royal duty.

Then, in a different part of London, the pregnant Duchess of Sussex was being greeted by whoops, cheers, even screams, as she walked onto a spotlit stage at the Royal Albert Hall to present a fashion award.

She, too, posed for a picture. And in her daring Givenchy gown, exposing one bare shoulder and cradling her baby bump with black-painted finger nails, what a picture it was.

Hers was a 'photo booth'-style image taken backstage alongside Clare Waight Keller, her wedding dress designer, and actress Rosamund Pike.

This picture of a radiant duchess oozed glamour and was as far removed from the down-to-earth shot of her stepmother-in-law Camilla as could be possible.

What's more, the nature of traditional and mundane official visits by other members of the Royal Family in recent days underscores how flashy Meghan's seem to be in comparison.

Princess Anne visited the International Maritime Organisation's Safety Committee; the Queen was hosted by a 600-year-old association of barristers; Prince Andrew addressed a meeting of young entrepreneurs; and the Countess of Wessex attended the Truro Christmas Primestock and Produce Show.

Of course, the royals have always embraced the ritz and glitz of fashion -- one has only to think of those countless pictures of the late Princess Diana.

Just when we thought the 2018 Fashion Awards couldn't contain any more famous faces, out stepped the Duchess of Sussex!

Speaking to a sea of the greatest designers, stylists and models, she presented the Womenswear Designer of the Year award to Claire Waight Keller. It was a lovely gesture, seeing as Claire created her iconic wedding gown earlier this year.

For the event, the Duchess opted for a bespoke one-shoulder dress by the French fashion house, teamed with gold jewellery from Pippa Small and Tamara Mellon heels.

Two days later the Duchess of Cornwall was pictured outside the Guards Chapel in central London ahead of a carol concert in aid of an animal welfare charity

But what is so curious about the arty black-and- white picture of Meghan is that no sooner was it posted on the British Fashion Council's Instagram account than it was abruptly deleted.

Some at the palace were not impressed by her posing for such an image.

'There was something ostentatious in the way she posed holding her bump, plus she was wearing dark nail varnish that the Queen hates,' says a source.

'It wouldn't be surprising if, aware of that, the duchess herself asked for it to be taken down.'

In its place was posted a more conventional shot of the duchess addressing the gathering from the stage. Significantly it was identical to the shot posted on the official Kensington Palace Twitter feed recording the visit.

An experienced hand at Hollywood, Meghan is a complete novice at the much more complicated business of British Royal Family public relations.

Coming at a time when rumours have surfaced that all is not well between Meghan and her sister-in-law and Kensington Palace neighbour the Duchess of Cambridge, together with reports of tensions with staff, the removal of the fashion awards picture has stoked up suggestions that these are unsettling times for the former actress.

Meghan and Harry released an image from their wedding reception at Frogmore House for this year's Christmas card

But then no one said marrying into the Royal Family was easy.

Diana was too young; the former Sarah Ferguson too headstrong and even Kate found the transition from middle-class girl to princess tricky.

Kate, however, met the challenge by getting help.

In the early days, the worldly Camilla took her under her wing and Kate, of course, throughout, had the sensible and practical support of her family, especially her mother Carole Middleton. Kate's introduction to full-time royal life was gradual, cautious even, and to start with mostly as a support act to Prince William.

However, Meghan has adopted a rather different approach.

This was inevitable for she is surely the most extraordinary addition ever welcomed in to the Royal Family.

She is three years older than Prince Harry, as well as being a divorcee and of mixed-race heritage whose ancestors were slaves in America's Deep South.

She is also articulate and sophisticated -- a woman, who, before meeting Harry, was a human rights activist, clean water campaigner, a women's advocate to the United Nations and a champion for gender equality.

Before her and Harry's wedding, she laid out her feminist credentials with confident support for the #MeToo campaign, urging women to 'use their voice' while promising to 'hit the ground running' as a working royal after marrying the Queen's grandson. The way she is going about it, though, is beginning to raise eyebrows.

It has generated headlines of 'Duchess Difficult'. But is it simply more a case of Duchess Different?

Last week, it emerged that the Duke and Duchess's capable and highly-respected private secretary, Samantha Cohen would be leaving after Meghan's baby is born next spring.

The Queen Elizabeth II, pictured with Prince Andrew to her right, visited the Honourable Society of Lincoln's Inn, a 600-year-old association of barristers, this week

Prince Andrew addressed a meeting of young entrepreneurs, a much more traditional and mundane royal engagement compared to Meghan's recent appearances

Australian-born Ms Cohen, 50, always insisted that she would not take the job on a permanent basis, but some insiders hoped she would stay longer. She has spent 17 years working for the Royal Household and was one of the Queen's most trusted aides.

She resigned from her previous post last year after the ousting of Sir Christopher -- now Lord -- Geidt, the Queen's private secretary. It followed acrimony between courtiers at Buckingham Palace and Clarence House, where Prince Charles has his office.

Ms Cohen quit out of loyalty to Geidt, but was asked by the Queen to stay on to guide Harry and teach his new duchess the royal ropes following the resignation of the Prince's former private secretary, ex-Cavalry officer Edward Lane Fox.

Intriguingly, Lord Geidt, who left his post more than a year ago, was seen visiting Kensington Palace last week.

'If Christopher is giving them advice, they would be as well to listen and to take it,' says a royal aide. 'He knows that the best-loved princesses in history are the selfless ones.' Meanwhile, Ms Cohen's departure will do little to quell speculation that Meghan is difficult to work for.

Last month, it emerged that she sometimes sends emails to staff at 5am. Insiders say she likes to communicate using emojis in her missives.

Friends point out that she rises early because of the eight-hour time difference with California where her mother lives, making it easier to reach friends and family on the phone.

They also suggest that rising early might be connected to her pregnancy.

Inside Buckingham Palace, waspish below-stairs staff jokily refer to Meghan and Harry as 'Monica and Chandler' after two of the characters in the long-running American sitcom Friends.

In the series, control freak Monica is played by Courteney Cox and amiable but weak Chandler by Matthew Perry.

A typical Monica quote was: 'Remember: if I am harsh with you, it's only because you're doing it wrong.'

But while the nicknames are affectionate, questions are being asked in palace circles about Meghan's unconventional approach, making private visits and carrying out engagements under the radar.

In recent days, she watched Michelle Obama, the former U.S. First Lady, address 2,700 people at a sold-out Southbank Centre in London and then spent time with her alone later and had an unannounced meeting with academics. Then there was her surprising appearance at the British Fashion Awards.

It is possible that security concerns may be behind some of the decisions to go privately or, again, her pregnancy may be an issue.

'Not scheduling these engagements means that if she didn't feel like going no one would be any the wiser, plus also it means she is spared the attention of the paparazzi,' says a courtier.

Adjusting to her new life has been harder by her fractured relationship with her unconventional father, Thomas Markle, and other embittered relatives.

Her father's latest salvo included the claim that at her first wedding to Hollywood producer Trevor Engelson, guests were provided with party bags of cannabis.

Gossiping about the use of Class B drugs at Prince Harry's wife's first wedding on a beach in Jamaica is hardly likely to endear him to his daughter -- or to the Royal Family. Mr Markle also unnecessarily said he was dreading his first Christmas without contact from his daughter after the rift opened up before May's wedding when he was exposed staging photographs.

'I have been frozen out and I can't stay silent,' he said.

Alas, every time he speaks out the deeper the rift becomes.

It may be that her unborn baby represents the last best hope of this desperately unhappy family split being resolved.

The arrival of a new child can often spark forgiveness and re-establish bonds of affection.

As for Meghan's relationship with Kate, her and Harry's decision to move to Windsor from Kensington may help repair it. 'Putting some distance between them might be just the solution,' says a friend.

Both couples will be under the Queen's roof at Sandringham for Christmas. Though Harry and Meghan will not stay long, as it is thought they intend to spend time with the duchess's mother Doria Ragland at their rented retreat in Oxfordshire.

Ms Ragland is not due to visit Sandringham.

Should she wish to go, I understand, room will be made available for yoga-loving Doria. The Queen is determined that the lessons of the past must be learned.

'She simply will not allow Meghan to feel unwelcome,' a courtier tells me. 'Even at her great age she is putting a lot of effort in to ensure there is family harmony.'

First things first, however, and Wednesday's palace lunch. It is the one private occasion of the year when all the royals gather en famille and is held by the Queen because there is not enough room at Sandringham to invite the entire family.

Behind the scenes there will be some discreet clock-watching. Flunkeys will be checking to see how long the Sussexes spend at the festivities. Last year, they were among the last to arrive and the first to leave.

For her part, the Queen is very understanding and Meghan is certainly not the first young royal to make a public misjudgment.

But she would be well advised to steer more towards being Duchess Different than Duchess Difficult."
337,bbc news,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-46577152,"A federal judge in the US state of Texas has ruled that a key part of the Affordable Care Act (ACA), better known as Obamacare, is unconstitutional.

A coalition of 20 states argued the entire law had been invalidated by a change in tax rules last year which eliminated a penalty for not having health insurance.

President Donald Trump said the ruling was great news for America.

The case is now likely to go to the US Supreme Court.

President Donald Trump promised to dismantle Barack Obama's landmark 2010 healthcare law, which was designed to make medical cover affordable for the many Americans who had been priced out of the market.

But despite his Republicans having majorities in both the House of Representatives and the Senate, the ACA is still operating.

However, in 2017 Congress did repeal the requirement - the so-called individual mandate - that people buy health insurance or pay a tax penalty.

The Texas court ruling came a day before the deadline for Obamacare enrolment for the coming year.

Two Republicans - Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton and his Wisconsin counterpart Brad Schimel led the legal challenge.

Sitting in Fort Worth, US District Judge Reed O'Connor noted that a $1.5tn tax bill passed by Congress in 2017 eliminated the tax penalties which anyone who failed to obtain health insurance had to pay.

He ruled that the individual mandate was now unconstitutional.

As the individual mandate was an ""essential"" element of the ACA, the whole of Obamacare was therefore unconstitutional, Judge O'Connor said.

He said his ruling was concerned with the intentions of the 2010 and 2017 Congresses.

""The former enacted the ACA. The latter sawed off the last leg it stood on.""

The decision is almost certain to be challenged in the US Supreme Court.

White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said that the law would remain in place for the time being, pending further legal developments.

Meanwhile, the White House called on Congress to replace Obamacare with an affordable healthcare system which protects people with pre-existing conditions.

Two ex-business associates of President Donald Trump's former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn were indicted on Monday by special counsel Robert Mueller as a result of his Russia investigation.

Bijan Kian, who was the Number 2 at Flynn's lobbying firm, and Turkish businessman Ekim Alptekin were charged with a conspiracy to violate federal lobbying rules.

The charges come out of Mueller's look into Turkey's secret lobbying campaign to pressure the United States to expel a rival of President Recep Tayyip Erdogan.

Additionally, Flynn is believed to have played a role in this probe. The special counsel has praised the former Trump administration official for his 'substantial help' in several investigations. It is believed this is one of them.

Kian was in federal court Monday morning and was released on bond

On Monday, Kian also was indicted on charges of failing to register as a foreign agent. He appeared in federal court and is out on bond.

Alptekin stands accused of directing and funding Kian and Flynn's work, and then lying in U.S. filings about his role. He faces additional charges of making false statements to the FBI.

He remains in Turkey but there is a warrant for his arrest.

The indictments are part of Mueller's broader crackdown on foreign lobbying and outside attempts to influence U.S. policy abroad. Former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort was indicted for his work for the Ukraine.

The investigation into the Turkish lobbying began in 2016 after Flynn, who was advising Trump's presidential campaign at the time but had his own lobbying shop The Flynn Intel Group, wrote an op-ed for The Hill newspaper attacking Fethullah Gulen, a cleric living in Pennsylvania.

Investigators were said to wonder why Flynn, who was pushing to be Trump's national security adviser, was promoting talking points from the Turkish government.

The op-ed blamed Gulen for the July 15, 2016 coup that attempted oust the Turkish president and 'urged the U.S. government to deny the Turkish citizen refuge in the United States.'

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has accused Gulen of directing the failed coup, which Gulen has denied.

Turkey has been trying to extradite Gulen since 2016 but the Justice Department has denied the request, saying it did not meet the 'legal standards' for extradition.

The indictment also shows how Flynn was texting and emailing frequently about the project throughout the final weeks of the presidential campaign, when he was advising Trump on foreign relations.

His op-ed in The Hill appeared on Election Day.

Last month, President Trump said he was not considering Turkey's extradition request.

'No, it's not under consideration,' he said of Gulen. 'We are looking, always looking, and whatever we can do for Turkey and, frankly, countries that we can get along with very well. We're having a very good moment with Turkey.'

Relations have been a bit of a roller coaster between President Trump (left) and Turkish President Erdogan (right)

Trump said he gets along 'very, very well' with Erdogan and called him a 'friend of mine.'

'Whatever we can do, we'll do,' Trump added. 'But that is something that we're always looking at. But at this point, no.'

U.S.-Turkish relations have been on a bit of a roller coaster under Trump.

They were on an upswing in the wake of American cleric Andrew Brunson's release from a Turkish prison in October.

And Trump reportedly fist-bumped Erdogan when they met in Brussels this past summer at a NATO meeting and praised the Turkish president - who is known for his authoritarian style - a leader who 'does things the right way.'

But things went back downhill after Trump's refusal to lay the blame for the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi at the feet of Saudi Prince Mohammed bin Salman, whom Turkish intelligence blamed and U.S. intelligence agencies suggested he was involved.

Tensions between the two have also flared around Syria.

Trump called his Turkish counterpart on Friday and asked him to call off Turkey's military strike against the U.S.'s Kurdish partners in Syria.

It's unclear if the two leaders reached a deal but they agreed 'on the need for more effective coordination' in Syria, an official told The Wall Street Journal.

The indictments are part of special counsel Robert Mueller's broader crackdown on foreign lobbying

Two ex-business associates of President Donald Trump's former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn have been indicated

Prosecutors charge the two men 'conspired covertly and unlawfully to influence U.S. politicians and public opinion' regarding Fethullah Gulen (above), a cleric living in Pennsylvania that Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan has accused of directing a failed coup

Prosecutors charge that Kian and Alptekin 'conspired covertly and unlawfully to influence U.S. politicians and public opinion' regarding Gulen to try and 'ultimately' secure Gulen's extradition.

The two men 'knowingly acted and caused others to act in the United States as an agent of a foreign government, that is, the government of Turkey, without prior notification to the Attorney General, as required by law,' the indictment reads.

The 21-page indictment lays out how the two men established their work against Gulen, what work was performed, how they covered up the fact the Turkish government was involved and their payment for the project.

The Flynn Intel Group received $600,000 for their efforts to discredit Gulen.

Kian, also known was Bijan Rafiekian, is referred to in the indictment of being a co-founder of the Flynn Intel Group, which 'offered various services' to it clients based on Flynn's 'national security expertise.'

Alptekin is identified as a 'dual Turkish-Dutch citizen residing in Istanbul' with 'close ties to the highest levels of the Government in Turkey.'

He owned a company based in the Netherlands that paid the Flynn Intel Group for its work.

The Flynn Intel Group wired $40,000 to Alptekin's company in the Netherlands in what it called a ""consultancy"" fee, the indictment revealed. But it was actually payment to Alptekin's for pretending he was Flynn's client when the Flynn Intel Group knew that its client was really the Turkish government.

The 'Government of Turkey directed the work through Alptekin' but the 'defendants sought to conceal Turkey's involvement in the efforts to discredit,' the indictment notes.

Prosecutors also accuse the two men of 'knowingly provided false information' to the company's attorneys 'in an effort to hide' the 'involvement of Turkish government officials in the project.'

Ekim Alptekin remains in Turkey

Flynn is referred to in the indictment only as 'Person A.'

The Flynn Intel Group is now defunct.

When he pleaded guilty last December to lying to FBI gents working on the Russia investigation, Flynn also admitted to repeated violations of laws requiring firms to register their work on behalf of foreign clients.

Flynn is scheduled to be sentenced on Tuesday in that case, the first former White House official to face the judge.

Last week Mueller's office said that Flynn's cooperation - including 19 meetings with investigators - was so extensive that he was entitled to avoid prison when he is sentenced.

ROBERT MUELLER'S PROBE SO FAR: EIGHT CONVICTIONS - INCLUDING THREE TOP TRUMP AIDES, A JAILED ATTORNEY AND 25 RUSSIANS ACCUSED

GUILTY: MICHAEL FLYNN

Pleaded guilty to making false statements in December 2017. Awaiting sentence

Flynn was President Trump's former National Security Advisor and Robert Mueller's most senior scalp to date. He previously served when he was a three star general as President Obama's director of the Defense Intelligence Agency but was fired.

He admitted to lying to special counsel investigators about his conversations with a Russian ambassador in December 2016. He has agreed to cooperate with the special counsel investigation.

GUILTY: MICHAEL COHEN

Pleaded guilty to eight counts including fraud and two campaign finance violations in August 2018. Pleaded guilty to further count of lying to Congress in November 2018. Sentenced to three years in prison and $2 million in fines and forfeitures in December 2018

Cohen was Trump's longtime personal attorney, starting working for him and the Trump Organization in 2007. He is the longest-serving member of Trump's inner circle to be implicated by Mueller. Cohen professed unswerving devotion to Trump - and organized payments to silence two women who alleged they had sex with the-then candidate: porn star Stormy Daniels and Playboy model Karen McDougal. He admitted that payments to both women were felony campaign finance violations - and admitted that he acted at the 'direction' of 'Candidate-1': Donald Trump.

He also admitted tax fraud by lying about his income from loans he made, money from taxi medallions he owned, and other sources of income, at a cost to the Treasury of $1.3 million.

And he admitted lying to Congress in a rare use of the offense. The judge in his case let him report for prison on March 6 and recommended he serve it in a medium-security facility close to New York City.

GUILTY: PAUL MANAFORT

Found guilty of eight charges of bank and tax fraud in August 2018. Pleaded guilty to two further charges. Awaiting sentence

Manafort worked for Trump's campaign from March 2016 and chaired it from June to August 2016, overseeing Trump being adopted as Republican candidate at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland. He is the most senior campaign official to be implicated by Mueller. Manafort was one of Washington D.C.'s longest-term and most influential lobbyists but in 2015, his money dried up and the next year he turned to Trump for help, offering to be his campaign chairman for free - in the hope of making more money afterwards. But Mueller unwound his previous finances and discovered years of tax and bank fraud as he coined in cash from pro-Russia political parties and oligarchs in Ukraine.

Manafort pleaded not guilty to 18 charges of tax and bank fraud but was convicted of eight counts. The jury was deadlocked on the other 10 charges. A second trial on charges of failing to register as a foreign agent is due in September.

GUILTY: RICK GATES

Pleaded guilty to conspiracy against the United States and making false statements in February 2018. Awaiting sentence

Gates was Manafort's former deputy at political consulting firm DMP International. He admitted to conspiring to defraud the U.S. government on financial activity, and to lying to investigators about a meeting Manafort had with a member of congress in 2013. As a result of his guilty plea and promise of cooperation, prosecutors vacated charges against Gates on bank fraud, bank fraud conspiracy, failure to disclose foreign bank accounts, filing false tax returns, helping prepare false tax filings, and falsely amending tax returns.

GUILTY AND JAILED: GEORGE PAPADOPOLOUS

Pleaded guilty to making false statements in October 2017. Sentenced to 14 days in September 2018, and reported to prison in November. Served 12 days and released on December 7, 2018

Papadopoulos was a member of Donald Trump's campaign foreign policy advisory committee. He admitted to lying to special counsel investigators about his contacts with London professor Josef Mifsud and Ivan Timofeev, the director of a Russian government-funded think tank.

He has agreed to cooperate with the special counsel investigation.

GUILTY AND JAILED: RICHARD PINEDO

Pleaded guilty to identity fraud in February 2018. Sentenced to a year in prison

Pinedo is a 28-year-old computer specialist from Santa Paula, California. He admitted to selling bank account numbers to Russian nationals over the internet that he had obtained using stolen identities.

He has agreed to cooperate with the special counsel investigation.

GUILTY AND JAILED: ALEX VAN DER ZWAAN

Pleaded guilty to making false statements in February 2018. He served a 30-day prison sentence earlier this year and was deported to the Netherlands on his release

Van der Zwaan is a Dutch attorney for Skadden Arps who worked on a Ukrainian political analysis report for Paul Manafort in 2012.

He admitted to lying to special counsel investigators about when he last spoke with Rick Gates and Konstantin Kilimnik.

GUILTY: W. SAMUEL PATTEN

Pleaded guilty in August 2018 to failing to register as a lobbyist while doing work for a Ukrainian political party. Awaiting sentence

Patten, a long-time D.C. lobbyist was a business partner of Paul Manafort. He pleaded guilty to admitting to arranging an illegal $50,000 donation to Trump's inauguration.

He arranged for an American 'straw donor' to pay $50,000 to the inaugural committee, knowing that it was actually for a Ukrainian businessman.

Neither the American or the Ukrainian have been named.

CHARGED: KONSTANTIN KILIMNIK

Indicted for obstruction of justice and conspiracy to obstruct justice. At large, probably in Russia

Kilimnik is a former employee of Manafort's political consulting firm and helped him with lobbying work in Ukraine. He is accused of witness tampering, after he allegedly contacted individuals who had worked with Manafort to remind them that Manafort only performed lobbying work for them outside of the U.S.

He has been linked to Russian intelligence and is currently thought to be in Russia - effectively beyond the reach of extradition by Mueller's team.

INDICTED: THE RUSSIANS

Twenty-five Russian nationals and three Russian entities have been indicted for conspiracy to defraud the United States. They remain at large in Russia

Two of these Russian nationals were also indicted for conspiracy to commit wire fraud and 11 were indicted for conspiracy to launder money. Fifteen of them were also indicted for identity fraud.

Vladimir Putin has ridiculed the charges. Russia effectively bars extradition of its nationals. The only prospect Mueller has of bringing any in front of a U.S. jury is if Interpol has their names on an international stop list - which is not made public - and they set foot in a territory which extradites to the U.S.

INDICTED: MICHAEL FLYNN'S BUSINESS PARTNERS

Bijan Kian (left), number two in now disgraced former national security adviser Mike Flynn's lobbying company, and the two's business partner Ekim Alptekin (right) were indicted for conspiracy to lobby illegally. Kian is awaiting trial, Alptekin is still to appear in court

Kian, an Iranian-American was arrested and appeared in court charged with a conspiracy to illegally lobby the U.S government without registering as a foreign agent. Their co-conspirator was Flynn, who is called 'Person A' in the indictment and is not charged, offering some insight into what charges he escaped with his plea deal.

Kian, vice-president of Flynn's former lobbying firm, is alleged to have plotted with Alptekin to try to change U.S. policy on an exiled Turkish cleric, Fethullah Gulen, who lives in Pennsylvania and who is accused by Turkey's strongman president Recep Tayyip Erdogan, of trying to depose him.

Erdogan's government wanted him extradited from the U.S. and paid Flynn's firm through Alptekin for lobbying, including an op-ed in The Hill calling for Gulen to be ejected. Flynn and Kian both lied that the op-ed was not paid for by the Turkish government.

The indictment is a sign of how Mueller is taking an interest in more than just Russian involvement in the 2016 election."

Facts: The American Idol winner urged her fans to stay positive

Carrie has produced Sunday Night Football's theme song and an accompanying music video since 2013.

The song has been tweaked periodically, with a more dramatic makeover this year.

The Sunday Night Football song has been a perennial target for mockery. From 2007 to 2013, country singer Faith Hill was responsible for the theme song, which resulted in parodies from SNL, 30 Rock and South Park.

Controversy around football themes songs isn't even relegated to NBC's broadcast. Singer Hank Williams Jr. was removed as the singer for ABC's Monday Night Football after comparing President Barack Obama to Adolf Hitler. He later claimed the former President was a Muslim, though ABC invited him back in 2017.

The reaction to Carrie's new song is another blow after her most recent album was shut out of the Grammy Awards nominations.

340,daily mail online,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6504095/No-plan-place-avert-government-shutdown-Christmas-days-go.html,"President Donald Trump blasted Democrats opposing his border security policies Monday as company men and women who won't write him a giant check for his border wall out of loyalty to the Democratic Party.

Trump needled the other side as the calendar moved one day closer to a fissure that would see parts of the government closed down and an expected 380,000 federal workers furloughed over the Christmas holiday.

He said in a tweet: 'Anytime you hear a Democrat saying that you can have good Boarder Security without a Wall, write them off as just another politician following the party line. Time for us to save billions of dollars a year and have, at the same time, far greater safety and control!'

The president apparently meant to write 'border security,' and corrected the spelling error, as he sometimes does, sending out a revised version of his message hours later.

President Donald Trump blasted Democrats opposing his border security policies Monday as company men and women who won't write him a giant check for his border wall out of loyalty to the Democratic Party

The president apparently meant to write 'border security,' although he did not immediately correct the spelling error, as he sometimes does by deleting and then sending out revised versions of his messages

REDO: The president sent out a corrected version of the tweet hours later

The president's Monday morning push for his wall followed a warning by his top policy adviser that Trump could follow through on his threat to let the government close at the end of the day on Dec. 21 if Democrats continue to reject his demands for a $5 billion appropriation for border barriers of his own design.

Sen. Democratic leader Chuck Schumer meanwhile pledged on Sunday that Trump would not get the money under any circumstances and he should take one of two deals in front of him that would allow the federal government to continue operating through the rest of the fiscal year that provide money for fencing.

Democrats and the president were firmly planted in opposing camps on Monday on the issue of border wall spending with fewer than five full days to come up with a plan.

A partial government shutdown will kick in at the end of the week unless Congress passes legislation that Trump agrees to sign or with enough votes to override a potential veto.

The White House has not promised a veto or explicitly said that Trump is going to shut the government down.

Most areas of the federal government have already been funded through other appropriations bills. Roughly 25 percent of agencies are operating off of a Continuing Resolution that will technically expire early Saturday morning.

Roughly 420,000 federal workers, including most law enforcement, would be deemed essential in the course of a shutdown and required to remain on the job. They would receive back pay in the event of a partial government closure, CNN reports.

All other workers would be considered non-essential and sent home on an unpaid leave of absence. Congress typically gives them back pay for days missed, costing the government time and money for work that wasn't actually done.

It can take weeks for the money to arrive, especially if the shutdown lasts until Democrats take control of the House the first few days in January, putting a financial squeeze on families over the Christmas holiday.

The Departments of Homeland Security, Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, State, Interior, Agriculture, Treasury, Commerce and Justice would be affected.

Despite a funding lapse for DOJ, a shutdown wouldn't stop the special counsel probe, however, because of the way that Robert Mueller's probe is funded.

Congress is out of session until Wednesday and will have merely three working days to figure out how to get out of the hole when they come back to Washington.

A plan to defer the conversation until next year had been making the rounds but it didn't appear to be picking up any traction on Monday.

White House senior adviser Stephen Miller on Sunday said 'if it comes to it' the administration would 'absolutely' shut down the government to fund a border. His hair was the talk of Twitter, though, as users pointed out that it had apparently been sprayed on

President Trump took to Twitter to defend his actions on immigration policy and to advocate for tougher measures

Schumer accused Trump of throwing a 'temper tantrum' on Sunday and reminded the president that he promised to own a shut down if one occurs.

'President Trump should understand. There are not the votes for the wall. In the House or the Senate, he is not going to get the wall in any form. Even the House which is a majority Republican, they don't have the votes for his $5 billion wall plan,' the Democratic leader said.

The Democrat from New York claimed that House Speaker Paul Ryan, who is on his final days in office, is 'afraid of what's going to happen' and so he 'sent all the House home until Wednesday night, a day and a half, two days before the shutdown.'

'He shouldn't use innocent workers as hostage for his temper tantrum to sort of throw a bone to his base,' Schumer charged on 'Meet the Press' on NBC News.

White House senior policy adviser Stephen Miller on Sunday said 'if it comes to it' the administration would 'absolutely' shut down the government to fund a border wall as President Trump defended his immigration policies on Twitter.

We're going to do whatever is necessary to build the border wall to stop this ongoing crisis of illegal immigration,' Miller said on CBS' 'Face the Nation.'

Asked if that meant a shutdown when the government runs out of funding on Friday, he replied: 'If it comes to it, absolutely.'

As Miller talked tough on TV, Trump did some messaging of his own on Twitter.

'The Democrats policy of Child Seperation on the Border during the Obama Administration was far worse than the way we handle it now. Remember the 2014 picture of children in cages - the Obama years. However, if you don't separate, FAR more people will come. Smugglers use the kids!' he wrote.

Trump was heavily criticized for his policy of separating migrant kids from their parents.

During that time, photos went viral of kids behind bars, but they were later revealed to be from 2014, when President Barack Obama was in office.

The Obama administration did not enforce the separation policy the way the Trump administration has done.

Schumer was also appearing on television at the time, saying on NBC that Trump doesn't have the votes for the wall in either chamber. He said that Republicans privately, as some have even said publicly, say they prefer a continuing resolution that mirrors the previous year's language for the Department of Homeland Security and continues through September to a shutdown over Trump's border wall.

'They just have to have the guts to tell President Trump he's off on the deep end here. And all he's going to get, with his temper tantrum, is a shutdown. He will not get a wall,' Schumer said.

Miller said a border wall was necessary for U.S. national security.

'This is a very fundamental issue. At stake is the question of whether or not the United States remains a sovereign country. Whether or not we can establish and enforce rules for entrance into our country. The Democrat Party has a simple choice, they can either choose to fight for America's working class or to promote illegal immigration. You can't do both,' he said.

Democrats are willing to cough up $1.3 billion and want additional protections for immigrants like the Dreamers, illegals who were brought to the country by their parents as children.

A temporary detente could furlough federal workers over the Christmas holiday into early next year. But Trump will have lost much of his leverage by then, as Democrats take the majority in the House.

He suggested in a Thursday tweet he now sees the value of avoiding an expensive and potentially toxic government closure, even though Miller said Sunday that he has no problem presiding over a government shut down.

'Let's not do a shutdown, Democrats - do what's right for the American people!' Trump had tweeted.

This could be the president's last chance to fully fund his wall. Democrats take control of the House of Representatives on Jan. 3 and they are not likely to give Trump the money he needs to make his wall a reality.

Trump, in an extraordinary Oval Office shouting match Schumer and House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi last week said he would shut down the government if he didn't get his funding - and take responsibility for it.

'I will shut down the government. Absolutely,' he said.

For twenty minutes, Pelosi and Schumer sparred with Trump on camera, emphasizing their long-stated position that he cannot have his border wall funding.

Furious, the president said that he would shut down the government if they don't give it to him.

'You want to put that on [me], I'll take it,' he rebutted as Schumer told him that the last government closure was his fault, too. 'You know what I'll say: Yes, if we don't get what we want, one way or the other -- whether it's through you, through a military, through anything you want to call -- I will shut down the government. Absolutely.'

Trump told Chuck Schumer he would take responsibility for a government shut down

Schumer was willing to let the argument rest there, but Trump dug in, saying repeatedly that he'd shut the government down and happily take the blame in comment that could could back to haunt his administration.

'I am proud to shut down the government for border security, Chuck, because the people of this country don't want criminals and people that have lots of problems and drugs pouring into our country. So I will take the mantle,' he asserted. 'I will be the one to shut it down. I'm not going to blame you for it. The last time you shut it down, it didn't work. I will take the mantle of shutting down.'"

WASHINGTON (AP) - Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke, facing federal investigations into his travel, political activity and potential conflicts of interest, will be leaving the administration at year's end, President Donald Trump said Saturday. In his resignation letter, obtained by The Associated Press, Zinke said ""vicious and politically motivated attacks"" against him had ""created an unfortunate distraction"" in fulfilling the agency's mission.

Trump, in tweeting Zinke's departure, said the former Montana congressman ""accomplished much during his tenure"" and that a replacement would be announced next week. The Cabinet post requires Senate confirmation.

Zinke is leaving weeks before Democrats take control of the House, a shift in power that promises to sharpen the probes into his conduct. His departure comes amid a staff shake-up as Trump heads into his third year in office facing increased legal exposure due to intensifying investigations into his campaign, business, foundation and administration.

Zinke's resignation letter, obtained from a Zinke aide on Saturday, cites what he calls ""meritless and false claims"" and says that ""to some, truth no longer matters.""

The letter, dated Saturday, said Zinke's last day would be Jan. 2. It was not clear whether Zinke had already submitted the letter when Trump tweeted.

Loyalty, rapport: Why Trump chose Mulvaney as chief of staff

WASHINGTON (AP) - Demonstrated loyalty. Political savvy. Personal rapport.

And, as a bonus, a decent golf game.

President Donald Trump had long made clear the qualities he was looking for in his next chief of staff. And when his first pick turned him down, sparking a frantic search, the president turned to the man he'd already tapped for two previous jobs in his administration: Mick Mulvaney, a blunt, fast-talking former South Carolina congressman turned budget chief who had told Trump months ago he wanted the job.

It was an obvious choice to many outside the administration that reflects the challenges ahead: Trump will soon be fighting for re-election as he contends with a House controlled by Democrats eager to use their new subpoena power to investigate his administration and business dealings. And the Russia investigation continues, with the drip-drip of new allegations mounting daily.

But for Trump, a notoriously mercurial president who has already cycled through two chiefs of staffs in as many years, the decision was as much about current appearances as future negotiations: Spurned by several front-runners and angry over the growing narrative that he couldn't find someone to take the job, Trump made the offer Friday afternoon at a meeting that had originally been scheduled to discuss the ongoing budget showdown that threatens a holiday shutdown. Mulvaney accepted - and even kept his current position as director of the Office of Management and Budget.

Nations at UN climate talks back universal emissions rules

KATOWICE, Poland (AP) - After two weeks of bruising negotiations, officials from almost 200 countries agreed Saturday on universal, transparent rules that will govern efforts to cut emissions and curb global warming.

The deal agreed upon at U.N. climate talks in Poland enables countries to put into action the principles in the 2015 Paris climate accord.

But to the frustration of environmental activists and some countries who were urging more ambitious climate goals, negotiators delayed decisions on two key issues until next year in an effort to get a deal on them.

""Through this package, you have made a thousand little steps forward together,"" said Michal Kurtyka, a senior Polish official chairing the talks.

He said while each individual country would likely find some parts of the agreement it didn't like, efforts had been made to balance the interests of all parties.

Family of migrant girl disputes official story on her death

The family of a 7-year-old Guatemalan girl who died in U.S. Border Patrol custody is disputing an account from U.S. officials who said she had not been given food or water for days.

In a statement released by lawyers, the parents of Jakelin Caal said the girl had been given food and water and appeared to be in good health as she traveled through Mexico with her father, 29-year-old Nery Gilberto Caal Cuz. The family added that Jakelin had not been traveling through the desert for days before she was taken into custody.

Tekandi Paniagua, the Guatemalan consul in Del Rio, Texas, told The Associated Press that he spoke with the Jakelin's father. The consul said Nery Caal told him the group they were traveling with was dropped off in Mexico about a 90-minute walk from the border.

Border Patrol officials did not immediately respond to the family's comments.

The family's statement was released Saturday during a news conference in El Paso, Texas, at an immigrant shelter where Jakelin's father is staying. Her family did not attend and has asked for privacy.

Girl who died fled intensely poor Guatemalan village

SAN ANTONIO SECORTEZ, Guatemala (AP) - Jakelin Amei Rosmery Caal Maquin received her first pair of shoes several weeks ago, when her father said they would set out together for the United States, thousands of miles from this small indigenous community in Guatemala where she spent her days plodding through mud and surrounded by coconut trees.

The 7-year-old was excited about the possibility of a new life in another country, relatives said Saturday. Maybe she would get her first toy, or learn to read and write.

Instead she died in a Texas hospital two days after being taken into custody by U.S. Border Patrol agents in a remote stretch of New Mexico desert.

The death has drawn attention to the increasingly perilous routes that Central American migrants traverse to reach the U.S., where some plan to apply for asylum, and to the way migrants are treated once in custody. Jakelin's family says her father paid a human smuggler to sneak them across the border; asylum wasn't the plan.

Sadness hangs in the air outside the tiny wooden house with a straw roof, dirt floors, a few bedsheets and a fire pit for cooking where Jakelin used to sleep with her parents and three siblings. The brothers are barefoot, their feet caked with mud and their clothes in tatters. A heart constructed out of wood and wrapped in plastic announces Jakelin's death.

Almost every part of Trump's life is under investigation

WASHINGTON (AP) - Investigations now entangle Donald Trump's White House, campaign, transition, inauguration, charity and business. For Trump, the political, the personal and the deeply personal are all under examination.

Less than two years into Trump's presidency, his business associates, political advisers and family members are being probed, along with the practices of his late father. On Saturday, Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke became the fourth Cabinet member to leave under an ethical cloud, having sparked 17 investigations into his actions on the job, by one watchdog's count.

All of this with the first special counsel investigation against a president in 20 years hanging over Trump's head, spinning out charges and strong-arming guilty pleas from underlings while keeping in suspense whether the president - ""Individual 1"" in prosecutor Robert Mueller's coded legalese - will end up accused of criminal behavior himself.

The scope of the scrutiny has shaped Trump's presidency, proving a steady distraction from his governing agenda. So far, much of it has been launched by federal prosecutors and government watchdogs that eschew partisanship. The intensity is certain to increase next year when Democrats assume control of the House and the subpoena power that comes with it.

Although Trump dismisses the investigations as politically motivated ""witch hunts,"" his high-octane Twitter account frequently betrays just how consumed he is by the scrutiny. He's also said to watch hours of television coverage on milestone days in the investigations.

Executive's arrest, security worries stymie Huawei's reach

BEIJING (AP) - While a Huawei executive faces possible U.S. charges over trade with Iran, the Chinese tech giant's ambition to be a leader in next-generation telecoms is colliding with security worries abroad.

Australia and New Zealand have barred Huawei Technologies Ltd. as a supplier for fifth-generation networks. They joined the United States and Taiwan, which limit use of technology from the biggest global supplier of network switching gear. This week, Japan's cybersecurity agency said Huawei and other vendors deemed risky will be off-limits for government purchases.

None has released evidence of wrongdoing by Huawei, which denies it is a risk and has operated a laboratory with Britain's government since 2010 to conduct security examinations of its products. But the accusations, amid rising tension over Chinese technology ambitions and spying, threaten its ability to compete in a sensitive field as carriers prepare to invest billions of dollars.

""This is something that's definitely concerning Huawei at this stage, because there is a political angle to it and a business angle,"" said Nikhil Bhatra, a senior researcher for IDC.

Huawei is no ordinary electronics supplier. The company founded in 1987 by a former military engineer is China's first global tech brand and a national champion at the head of an industry Beijing is promoting as part of efforts to transform this country into a technology creator. It has China's biggest corporate research-and-development budget at 89.7 billion yuan ($13 billion) in 2017 - 10 percent more than Apple Inc.'s - and foreign customers can draw on a multibillion-dollar line of credit from the official China Development Bank.

Ruling to strike down health law puts GOP in a quandary

WASHINGTON (AP) - A federal judge's ruling that the Obama health law is unconstitutional has landed like a stink bomb among Republicans, who've seen the politics of health care flip as Americans increasingly value the overhaul's core parts, including protections for pre-existing medical conditions and Medicaid for more low-income people.

While the decision by the Republican-appointed judge in Texas was sweeping, it has little immediate practical impact because the Affordable Care Act remains in place while the legal battle continues, possibly to the Supreme Court.

HealthCare.gov , the government's site for signing up, was taking applications Saturday, the deadline in most states for enrolling for coverage next year, and those benefits will take effect as scheduled Jan. 1. Medicaid expansion will proceed in Virginia, one of the latest states to accept that option. Employers will still be required to cover the young adult children of workers, and Medicare recipients will still get discounted prescription drugs.

But Republicans, still stinging from their loss of the House in the midterm elections, are facing a fresh political quandary after U.S. District Judge Reed O'Connor said the entire 2010 health law was invalid.

Warnings about the Texas lawsuit were part of the political narrative behind Democrats' electoral gains. Health care was the top issue for about one-fourth of voters in the November election, ahead of immigration and jobs and the economy, according to VoteCast, a nationwide survey for The Associated Press. Those most concerned with health care supported Democrats overwhelmingly.

Worries about ballot security overshadow disputed House race

BLADENBORO, N.C. (AP) - Six months ago, election officials in rural North Carolina's Bladen County resolved to tighten security at their headquarters and protect the ballots stored there by installing an alarm and video cameras and securing an unlocked door that leads to another government office.

The fixes never got done before Election Day. The then-chairman of the county commissioners, who control the purse strings, did not see the need.

Now Bladen County is at the center of a disputed congressional election rife with suspicions of fraud, including the possibility that absentee ballots were altered or discarded.

While no evidence has surfaced to suggest ballots were stolen or tampered with inside the building, warnings about the potential for political chicanery in Bladen County were raised years before the burgeoning scandal dragged this patch of eastern North Carolina's pine barrens into the spotlight.

Marshall Tutor, who was lead investigator for the state Board of Elections for 15 years, said he frequently traveled to Bladen County over the years to probe accusations of wrongdoing. He said residents were often hesitant to talk to outsiders about possible voting fraud, much less testify.

Cleveland Browns beat injury-plagued Broncos 17-16

DENVER (AP) - Baker Mayfield capitalized on Denver's depleted cornerback corps and dubious coaching decisions in leading the Cleveland Browns past the Broncos 17-16 on Saturday night, keeping alive their slim hopes of ending the NFL's longest playoff drought.

Mayfield's 2-yard TD toss to Antonio Calloway with just under 12 minutes left provided the winning margin for the Browns (6-7-1). They snapped an 11-game losing streak to the Broncos (6-8).

Improving to 3-28 on the road over the last four seasons, the Browns still have a shot at their first winning season since 2007 and even their first playoff berth since 2002 thanks to their first win over Denver since 1990.

Calloway's touchdown made it 17-13 and came with safety Justin Simmons in coverage because the Broncos were down five cornerbacks.

The Broncos responded with a 13-play drive that ate up more than seven minutes, but after Phillip Lindsay was stuffed for no gain on third-and-1 from the Cleveland 6, coach Vance Joseph sent in kicker Brandon McManus for a field goal instead of going for it."
342,bbc news,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-46860902,"Turkey has dismissed President Donald Trump's threat to ""devastate"" its economy if it attacks Kurdish forces in Syria following a planned pullout of US troops.

""You cannot get anywhere by threatening Turkey economically,"" Foreign Minister Nevlut Cavusoglu said.

US forces have fought alongside a Kurdish militia in northern Syria against the Islamic State (IS) group.

Turkey, however, regards the People's Protection Units (YPG) as terrorists.

In December Mr Trump announced that the US would pull out all troops from Syria because the Islamic State militant group had been ""defeated"".

The sudden move shocked allies and led to criticism. Several senior US military officials resigned shortly afterwards.

There were also fears that Kurds in the Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF), which had partnered with the US, would be attacked by Turkey once the US withdrew.

Mr Trump tweeted on Sunday that the withdrawal from Syria had begun, and that the US would ""devastate Turkey economically if they hit the Kurds"".

He also said any remaining IS fighters could be attacked from the air, and that a 20-mile (32km) ""safe zone"" could be established.

His tweet could be seen as a response to criticism that his decision to withdraw troops will hurt the US's regional allies.

Mr Trump offered no specifics on how the US could hurt Turkey's economy, and his announcement appeared to catch his advisers by surprise.

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who is currently touring the Middle East, responded to questions about Mr Trump's threat with: ""You'll have to ask the president... We have applied economic sanctions in many places, I assume he is speaking about those kinds of things.""

Meanwhile, Turkey's foreign minister Mevlut Cavusoglu described Mr Trump's tweet as a ""domestic policy message"" to critics.

Mr Cavusoglu has rejected Mr Trump's threats, saying: ""We have said multiple times that we will not fear or be deterred by any threat.""

He also criticised Mr Trump's methods, saying: ""Strategic alliances should not be discussed over Twitter or social media.""

However, US sanctions have had an impact on Turkey's economy before.

The Trump administration imposed sanctions and trade tariffs in August, amid a row over a detained US pastor - contributing to a sharp drop in the value of the Turkish lira. Pastor Andrew Brunson was released in October.

Meanwhile, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's spokesman, Ibrahim Kalin, said Turkey expected the US to ""honour our strategic partnership"".

""Terrorists can't be your partners and allies,"" he said.

Over the weekend, before Mr Trump's latest tweets, Mr Pompeo said he had spoken to Mr Cavusoglu by phone and was ""optimistic"" that an agreement could be reached with Turkey to protect Kurdish fighters.

Mr Pompeo said the US recognised ""the Turkish people's right and Mr Erdogan's right to defend their country from terrorists"".

""We also know that those fighting alongside us for all this time deserve to be protected as well,"" he added.

Mr Erdogan has spoken angrily about American support for the Kurdish YPG militia, and vowed to crush it.

Mr Cavusoglu said Turkey was ""not against"" the idea of a secure zone - but was targeting ""a terrorist organisation trying to divide Syria"".

Mr Pompeo is now in Riyadh, where he discussed Iran and the conflicts in Yemen and Syria with the Saudi leadership.

He said he also raised human rights issues, including the detention of women's rights activists, and the murder of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Turkey.

Mr Pompeo said King Salman and Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman had both ""reiterated their commitment"" to holding the killers of Mr Khashoggi accountable.

Prosecutors say Mr Khashoggi, a US-based critic of the Saudi government, was murdered in a ""rogue"" operation in Istanbul, by agents sent to persuade him to return to the kingdom.

However, many in the West have accused the crown prince of ordering the killing - something he has denied.

About 2,000 US military personnel are reported to be deployed in northern Syria.

Ground troops first arrived in autumn 2015 when then-President Barack Obama sent in a small number of special forces to train and advise YPG fighters.

The US did this after several attempts at training and arming Syrian Arab rebel groups to battle IS militants descended into chaos.

Over the intervening years, the number of US troops in Syria has increased, and a network of bases and airfields has been established in an arc across the north-eastern part of the country."
343,daily mail online,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6548717/Whats-Trump-insists-FIRED-Jim-Mattis-boasts-wouldve-good-general.html,"President Donald Trump on Wednesday insisted that he 'essentially' fired former Defense Secretary James Mattis, whose fiery resignation letter was seen as a rebuke of his presidency.

'As you know, President Obama fired him, and essentially so did I,' Trump said before the start of a Cabinet meeting with acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan at his side.

'What's he done for me? How had he done in Afghanistan? Not too good,' the president said of the retired four-star general whom he used to refer to as 'Mad Dog.'

Trump went on to tout his own credentials on the field of battle.

'I think I would've been a good general, but who knows,' he said.

President Trump insisted he 'essentially' fired Defense Secretary James Mattis

Jim Mattis' resignation letter was seen as a rebuke of Trump's presidency

Acting Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan sat to Trump's left in Wednesday's Cabinet meeting

The president has not served in combat. During the Vietnam War, Trump received four education deferments from the draft when, in the fall of 1968, a bone spur diagnosis made him medically ineligible.

The end of Mattis' tenure in the Trump administration came when Mattis left in protest after the president announced he was pulling out U.S. troops from Syria, which the two men disagreed about.

Mattis offered a resignation letter on December 20 that was seen as a dig at his commander-in-chief.

And he ensured it would be seen. He ordered aides to distribute 50 copies of it.

The move - and the media coverage of his letter - pushed him out the door even faster.

A scant three days later, on Dec. 23, Trump announced Mattis was leaving his administration on January 1 amid his anger at how the resignation letter was received.

Tensions have long said to be thick between the two men. Mattis was long rumored to be on the way out - a bit of gossip Trump stroked by saying repeatedly he expected his Pentagon chief would not hang around.

Mattis' departure brought groans from Trump critics, who claimed one of the few 'grownups' in the Trump administration was leaving.

Democrats also used Mattis' fiery resignation letter as their new cause celebrity.

But lawmakers and the defense industry were also rattled by Mattis' departure.

'I was one of many senators who privately sat down with General Mattis and said, 'Please stay, stay as long as you possibly can,' Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin said on NBC's Meet the Press' shortly after Mattis announced his departure.

He added: 'It breaks my heart that he's going to step aside. We counted on him to be there and to stop this president from his worst impulse.'

Mattis was supposed to remain on the job until Feb. 28.

He named late February as his exit in his resignation letter, calling it 'a date that should allow sufficient time for a successor to be nominated and confirmed as well as to make sure the Department's interests are properly articulated and protected at upcoming events.'

His letter also noted his views were not aligned with the president's.

'Because you have the right to a Secretary of Defense whose views are better aligned with yours on these and other subjects,' Mattis wrote in his letter, 'I believe it is right for me to step down from my position.'

'As you know, President Obama fired him, and essentially so did I,' Trump said of Mattis

Jim Mattis' last day was December 31; Trump moved it up amid anger of Mattis' resignation letter

Trump announced Mattis' early departure in December

'One core belief I have always held is that our strength as a nation is inextricably linked to the strength of our unique and comprehensive system of alliances and partnerships,' he wrote.

'While the US remains the indispensable nation in the free world, we cannot protect our interests or serve that role effectively without maintaining strong alliances and showing respect to those allies.'

Mattis also declared that America 'must be resolute and unambiguous in our approach to those countries whose strategic interests are increasingly in tension with ours.'

Mattis enlisted in the Marine Corps Reserve in 1969 and was commissioned as an officer in 1972.

He served in the Persian Gulf War and in conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq.

He was promoted to four-star general in 2007 when he was the head of U.S. Joint Forces Command.

In 2010, he was named the head of Central Command, where he oversaw U.S. forces in Iraq and Afghanistan.

In 2013 President Obama removed Mattis over differences about U.S. policy in Iraq.

Mattis retired from the Marines that same year.

Secretary of Defense James Mattis's letter of resignation

December 20, 2018

Dear Mr. President:

I have been privileged to serve as our country's 26th Secretary of Defense which has allowed me to serve alongside our men and women of the Department in defense of our citizens and our ideals.

I am proud of the progress that has been made over the past two years on some of the key goals articulated in our National Defense Strategy: putting the Department on a more sound budgetary footing, improving readiness and lethality in our forces, and reforming the Department's business practices for greater performance. Our troops continue to provide the capabilities needed to prevail in con?ict and sustain strong U.S. global influence.

One core belief I have always held is that our strength as a nation is inextricably linked to the strength of our unique and comprehensive system of alliances and partnerships. While the US remains the indispensable nation in the free world, we cannot protect our interests or serve that role effectively without maintaining strong alliances and showing respect to those allies. Like you, I have said from the beginning that the armed forces of the United States should not be the policeman of the world. Instead, we must use all tools of American power to provide for the common defense, including providing effective leadership to our alliances. NATO's 29 democracies demonstrated that strength in their commitment to fighting alongside us following the 9-11 attack on America. The Defeat-ISIS coalition of 74 nations is further proof.

Similarly, I believe we must be resolute and unambiguous in our approach to those countries whose strategic interests are increasingly in tension with ours. It is clear that China and Russia, for example, want to shape a world consistent with their authoritarian model gaining veto authority over other nations? economic, diplomatic, and security decisions to promote their own interests at the expense of their neighbors, America and our allies. That is why we must use all the tools of American power to provide for the common defense.

My views on treating allies with respect and also being clear-eyed about both malign actors and strategic competitors are strongly held and informed by over four decades of immersion in these issues. We must do everything possible to advance an international order that is most conducive to our security, prosperity and values, and we are strengthened in this effort by the solidarity of our alliances.

Because you have the right to have a Secretary of Defense whose views are better aligned with yours on these and other subjects, I believe it is right for me to step down from my position. The end date for my tenure is February 28, 2019, a date that should allow sufficient time for a successor to be nominated and confimed as well as to make sure the Department's interests are properly articulated and protected at upcoming events to include Congressional posture hearings and the NATO Defense Ministerial meeting in February. Further, that a full transition to a new Secretary of Defense occurs well in advance of the transition of Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in September in order to ensure stability Within the Department.

I pledge my full effort to a smooth transition that ensures the needs and interests of the 2.15 million Service Members and 732,079 civilians receive undistracted attention of the Department at all times so that they can fulfill their critical, round-the-clock mission to protect the American people.

I very much appreciate this opportunity to serve the nation and our men and women in uniform.

James N. Mattis"
344,daily mail online,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6521351/Supreme-Court-Trump-deny-asylum-illegals-enter-official-border-crossings.html,"The Supreme Court turned back the Trump administration's attempt to enforce a ban on granting asylum requests to illegal immigrants on the basis of where they enter the United States.

Lower courts had blocked President Donald Trump's executive order that denied asylum opportunities to people who jumped the border in between official entry points between the U.S. and Mexico.

But in a 5-4 ruling, the nation's highest court said that's an unacceptable way to limit immigration.

Justice Brett Kavanaugh, Trump's latest appointee, sided with the minority. Chief Justice John Roberts voted against the administration, joining the court's four most liberal members.

Chief Justice of the United States John Roberts sided with liberal justices against the Trump administration on Friday, turning back an appeal of a lower court ruling that bloked one of the president's policies on asylum-seeking illegal immigrants

Trump's November executive order was meant to slow down the flow of illegal immigrants hopping the border, including caravans of thousands of Central Americans traveling the length of Mexico

Neither side issued written opinions describing their rationale for blocking the administration's appeal.

While the case advanced through the federal courts, the Homeland Security and Justice Departments announced a separate policy that keeps migrants on the Mexican side of the border, instead of releasing them into the interior of the country, while they await asylum hearings.

It's unclear if Friday's ruling will affect that policy's implementation, although Mexico has agreed to cooperate.

The Supreme Court's action upheld a ruling by U.S. District Judge John Tigar, who drew Trump's ire by issuing an injunction to stop the selective asylum-granting from taking effect.

Tigar's order came in a lawsuit that could still take a year or more to resolve; Friday's decision concerned only the temporary hold Tigar put on the policy while the suit proceeds.

The U.S. Supreme Court consists of (front, L-R) Stephen Breyer, Clarence Thomas, Chief Justice John Roberts, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Samuel Alito and (back, L-R) Neil Gorsuch, Sonia Sotomayor, Elena Kagan, and Brett Kavanaugh

Tigar found that federal law allows immigrants to request asylum status no matter how they reach U.S. soil.

That Nov. 19 ruling drew an exasperated Trump to lash out at him as an 'Obama judge,' leading Roberts to issue a rare personal rebuke of the president.

'We do not have Obama judges or Trump judges, Bush judges or Clinton judges,' Roberts said in a statement distributed by the Supreme Court. 'What we have is an extraordinary group of dedicated judges doing their level best to do equal right to those appearing before them.'

Trump was on the golf course in Palm Beach, Florida at the time and tweeted his response.

'Sorry Chief Justice John Roberts, but you do indeed have ""Obama judges,"" and they have a much different point of view than the people who are charged with the safety of our country,' he wrote.

'It would be great if the 9th Circuit was indeed an ""independent judiciary"",' he added, 'but if it is why are so many opposing view (on Border and Safety) cases filed there, and why are a vast number of those cases overturned.'

During a Thanksgiving Day call with American troops serving in Afghanistan, the president blamed the famously liberal Ninth Circuit courts for stymieing his plans.

'We got a lot of bad decisions from the Ninth Circuit, which has become a big thorn in our side. We always lose, and then you lose again and again, and you hopefully win at the Supreme Court,' he said.

Trump's latest policy directives came in response to caravans of Central Americans making their way through Mexico.

While some are likely genuine asylum cases, many are in search of work in the United States.

Only about 15 per cent of asylum seekers who cross into the U.S. illegally are ultimately granted that status once judges hear their cases.

The judicial backlog, however, stood at more than 311,000 at the beginning of 2018.

Friday's Supreme Court order came at a tense moment when Trump was trying to outmaneuver Senate Democrats on a government funding package whose failure could shut a quarter of the government at midnight.

The central issue of that conflict is the president's long-sought border wall between Mexico and the United States. He has insisted that it's a needed measure to shore up border security."

Trump scolded Romney following the soon-to-be-senator's scorching op-ed, published Tuesday by The Washington Post.

'I won big, and he didn't,' the president tweeted.

Trump had Election Day support from 2 million more voters than Romney had four years learlier. But Mr. Conway, a persistent thorn in Trump's side, tweeted a barb about the comparatively smaller percentage of Americans who chose him at the polls.

'Romney got a *higher* percentage of the vote against a *much, much stronger* opponent who was (unlike you) a very popular sitting president,' he tweeted at Trump.

George Conway, a consistent Trump critic whose wife is among the president's closest advisers, tweeted a jab at him on Wednesday about the 2016 election result

After the president mocked Mitt Romney by tweeting that 'I won big, and he didn't,' Conway replied that Romney had won a larger percentage of votes in 2012 than Trump did four years later

Trump won 2 million more votes in 2016 than Romney did four years earlier, and turned in a far better showing in the more important electoralCollege, but his raw vote percentage was lower

Kellyanne Conway, counselor to the president, has been married to George Conway since 2001

Mr. Conway was adding to the observation of a historian who noted that Romney won the support of 47.2 per cent of voters in 2012 when he lost to Barack Obama. Trump got 46.1 per cent in his victory over Hillary Clinton.

The American presidency isn't decided by raw vote totals, but by an Electoral College system that apportions 538 final votes among the 50 states and requires a majority of 270 to win.

Romney lost to Obama by a 332-206 margin, winning in 24 states. Trump defeated Clinton 304-227, beating her in 30 states.

Mr. Conway is a lawyer who is famous for trolling President Trump on Twitter despite his wife's professional role as one of his closest confidantes.

Trump vented on Twitter at Mitt Romney after the senator-elect from Utah slammed him in a Washington Post op-ed

The Conways engaged in a live debate last month, with George live-tweeting his responses to Kellyanne's live CNN interview.

After she denied the president had known ahead of time about hugh-money payments to pornographic actress Stormy Daniels and Playboy model Karen McDougal, he fired back.

'Given that Trump has repeatedly lied about the Daniels and McDougal payments - and given that he lies about virtually everything else, to the point that his own former personal lawyer described him as a 'f****ing liar' - why should we take his word over that of federal prosecutors?'

Conway trashed Trump in December for claiming a prosecutor's sentencing memorandum on Michael Cohen cleared him

Conway also questioned Trump's credibility last month just as his wife was arguing the opposite on CNN

Mr. Conway also reacted to a December Trump tweet praising the 'guts' of longtime advisor Roger Stone, who has refused to testify against him in Special Counsel Robert Mueller's ongoing Russia probe.

His response consisted of tweeting a citation of the federal law against witness tampering.

Days later when a government sentencing memorandum laid bare the rationale for former Trump lawyer Michael Cohen's multiple guilty pleas, Trump tweeted that it '[t]otally clears the President.'

Conway shot back: 'Except for that little part where the US Attorney's Office says that you directed and coordinated with Cohen to commit two felonies. Other than that, totally scot-free.'"
346,daily mail online,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6548065/New-Pentagon-leader-Shanahan-says-focusing-China.html,"Patrick Shanahan, the acting defense secretary, started his first full day at the Pentagon's helm Wednesday by telling colleagues he sees China as a key priority.

Shanahan, who took the top spot January 1 after Jim Mattis resigned amid disagreements with President Donald Trump, told key Defense Department staff to focus on the National Defense Strategy, a broad review that highlights a new era of 'Great Power competition' with Russia and China.

The former Boeing executive, who moved up from the No. 2 job after Pentagon chief Jim Mattis left Monday, gathered civilian leaders of the military services and other top civilian officials before going to the White House for a Cabinet meeting.

'While we are focused on ongoing operations, Acting Secretary Shanahan told the team to remember China, China, China,' a defense official said.

The official said Shanahan told the Pentagon gathering that he is focused on the strategy as developed and put in place under Mattis.

First say: Acting defense secretary Patrick Shanahan arrived early Wednesday for his first full day in office and told senior officials he was focused on 'China, China, China'

Seat of power: Patrick Shanahan is the first acting defense secretary in 30 years and is at the head of the Pentagon after Jim Mattis quit over differences with President Trump

It emphasizes the importance of great power competition with Russia and China, after America's many years of fighting insurgent wars in the Middle East.

The Trump administration has had a rocky relationship with China. Like the Obama administration, President Donald Trump's government is concerned by what it calls China's militarization of disputed areas in the South China Sea and by its advances in certain high-tech weaponry.

The US accuses Beijing of an ongoing pattern of military and economic espionage, and has criticized China's ambitious 'Belt and Road' trade and infrastructure initiative as being a form of economic coercion.

'In 2019, the National Defense Strategy remains our guide. America's military strength remains our focus,' Shanahan said in a New Year's message on Twitter.

The defense official said Shanahan would later Wednesday attend a cabinet meeting with Trump, the president's first of 2019.

Little known outside business and Washington circles, Shanahan takes the world stage at a time of tumultuous changes and unpredictable foreign policy moves under Trump.

Shanahan did not serve in the military but has worked since July 2017 as the deputy defense secretary. Before that, he spent more than 30 years at Boeing.

Among the most immediate issues on his plate will be the pace at which the US pulls 2,200 or so troops out of Syria, following Trump's decision last month to exit the war-torn country.

According to US officials, Trump is also mulling a 50 percent draw down in Afghanistan -- another momentous move that has left lawmakers and international allies fearing for what comes next.

Shanahan announced that Pentagon comptroller David Norquist will perform the duties of deputy secretary of defense, the official said.

As acting defense secretary, Shanahan has all the authorities of a permanent secretary. It's unclear whether Trump will nominate Shanahan as Mattis' successor or will chose someone else.

Change of tone: Patrick Shanahan name checked Trump twice in his first statement as acting secretary of defense; his predecessor Jim Mattis had avoided using Trump's name

Chaos out: Jim Mattis - whose call sign in combat was Chaos and who was nicknamed Mad Dog - left the Pentagon with a final defiant shoulder aimed at Trump

Mattis, a retired Marine general, submitted his resignation on Dec. 20 after a series of policy disagreements with Trump, including the president's decision to withdraw troops from Syria.

Mattis said he would stay until the end of February, but on Dec. 23 Trump announced that Shanahan would take over Jan. 1, speeding up Mattis' departure.

Shanahan, a native of Washington state, had worked for Boeing since 1986. His views on strategic issues such as U.S. alliances and the wars in Afghanistan and Syria are largely unknown to the public.

During his Senate confirmation hearing in June 2017, Shanahan drew the ire of Sen. John McCain, R-Ariz., for equivocating on whether he favored providing defensive weaponry to Ukraine in response to Russian military intervention.

It is rare for the Pentagon to be run by an acting secretary. The last was William H. Taft, who served in that capacity for about 60 days in 1989 after President George H.W. Bush's initial choice to be defense secretary, John Tower, became mired in controversy and ultimately failed to be confirmed by the Senate.

Dick Cheney, the future vice president under President George W. Bush, then was nominated and confirmed.

Shanahan's statement of 'China, China, China' comes after a Chinese admiral said that his country's military is capable of sinking American aircraft carriers in the East and South China Seas.

Rear Admiral Luo Yuan's comments were made in a speech on Sino-U.S. relations which he gave on December 20, according to News Corp Australia Network.

Luo said that sinking American ships would resolve the ongoing territorial disputes in that part of the world.

Rear Admiral Luo Yuan's (seen above) comments were made in a speech on Sino-U.S. relations which he gave on December 20

'What the United States fears the most is taking casualties,' Admiral Luo said.

He estimated that sinking an American carrier would result in the deaths of 5,000 servicemen and women. Sinking two such ships would double the casualty toll to 10,000.

'We'll see how frightened America is,' he said.

Luo, 67, holds the rank of rear admiral in the People's Liberation Army Navy, though he is acting in an academic capacity rather than as an active service member.

He is the deputy head of the Chinese Academy of Military Sciences.

An author, social commentator, and military theorist, Luo has been known to express hawkish, anti-American views in the past.

In his remarks to the 2018 Military Industry List summit in Shenzhen. Luo boasted of China's weapons capability, which includes anti-ship ballistic and cruise missiles that could hit American carriers.

Luo said that the U.S. was vulnerable and that China should 'use its strength to attack the enemy's shortcomings.'

'Attack wherever the enemy is afraid of being hit,' he said.

'Wherever the enemy is weak...'

China and the U.S. have been at odds for years on a number of geopolitical issues, including Beijing's pressing of territorial claims in the South and East China Seas.

The above image shows replenishment oiler USNS Tippecanoe (center) and the aircraft carrier USS Kitty Hawk (right) performing maneuvers with the Japanese destroyer Haruna (left) on October 8 in the Pacific Ocean. China has said it could strike U.S. ships in the South and East China Seas

In the South China Sea, the United States has criticized China's construction of islands on tiny reefs and shoals and its installation of military facilities on them, including air strips and docks.

China claims 'irrefutable' sovereignty over most of the South China Sea and the islands in it, and accuses the United States of raising military tension with its navy presence there.

Brunei, Malaysia, the Philippines and Vietnam all claim parts of the waterway, through which about $5 trillion in ship-borne trade passes each year.

Taiwan also claims the waters.

Taiwan is another sensitive issue that divides the U.S. and China.

In Beijing, the island is considered a breakaway province that must be unified with the mainland, even if it means using military force.

But Taiwan, which is formally known as the Republic of China on Taiwan, insists on autonomy.

The democratic province, which receives American weapons and aid, does not want to come under Chinese rule.

Luo warned the U.S. not to intervene in the Taiwan-China dispute.

'If the US naval fleet dares to stop in Taiwan, it is time for the People's Liberation Army to deploy troops to promote national unity on (invade) the island,' he said.

'Achieving China's complete unity is a necessary requirement.

'The achievement of the past 40 years of reform and opening-up has given us the capability and confidence to safeguard our sovereignty.

'Those who are trying to stir up trouble in the South China Sea and Taiwan should be careful about their future.'"
347,daily mail online,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-6559253/Outgoing-US-Interior-secretary-defends-legacy-leaves.html,"BILLINGS, Mont. (AP) - As former U.S. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke exits Washington chased by ethics investigations and criticism of his actions favoring industry, he told The Associated Press he's lived up to the conservation ideals of Theodore Roosevelt and insisted the myriad allegations against him will be proven untrue.

The former Montana congressman also said he quit President Donald Trump's cabinet on his own terms, despite indications he was pressured by the White House to resign effective Wednesday.

During almost two years overseeing an agency responsible for managing 500 million acres of public lands, Zinke's broad rollbacks of restrictions on oil and gas drilling were cheered by industry. But they brought a scathing backlash from environmental groups and Democratic lawmakers who accused him of putting corporate profits ahead of preservation.

In his first interview since stepping down, Zinke said the changes he instituted meshed with Roosevelt's belief in balance between nature and industry. He added that they were needed in part to unfetter energy companies bound by unreasonable curbs on drilling that were largely imposed under former President Barack Obama.

""Teddy Roosevelt said conservation is as much development as it is preservation,"" Zinke said, referencing a 1910 speech by the Republican president. ""Much of our work returned the American conservation ethic to best science, best practices ... rather than an elitist view of non-management that lets nature take its course.""

Zinke mentioned Roosevelt often during his almost two-year tenure, and historian Patricia Limerick said it's accurate that the former president talked of development as a component of conservation. But Limerick noted Zinke's recommendations to Trump to reduce the size of national monuments in the West and elsewhere was in direct contrast to Roosevelt's embrace of the law that allowed their creation, the Antiquities Act of 1906.

""You don't get to call yourself a follower of Roosevelt if you're really chiseling away at one of his principal heritages,"" said Limerick, who chairs the board of the Center of the American West at the University of Colorado, where she's a history professor.

House Democrats plan to put Zinke's policies under the spotlight with oversight hearings beginning next month, said Adam Sarvana, a spokesman for Rep. Raul Grijalva of Arizona, the Democrat in line to lead the House Natural Resources Committee.

The hearings initially will focus on policy changes such as ""giveaways"" to the oil and gas industry under the leadership of Zinke, Sarvana said. He added they later could be expanded to include the various ethics investigations pending against Zinke, a former Navy SEAL and avowed Trump loyalist.

The investigations have ranged from a probe into a land deal involving Zinke and the chairman of energy services giant Halliburton, to questions about his decision to reject a casino in Connecticut sought by two tribes.

During his interview with the AP, Zinke denied a Washington Post report that Interior Department investigators believe he may have lied to them, which has reportedly prompted an examination of potential criminal violations by the U.S. Justice Department's public integrity section.

Several other investigations into Zinke concluded with no findings of wrongdoing. In one case he was faulted by investigators for violating a department policy by allowing his wife to ride in government vehicles with him. That report also said the Interior Department spent more than $25,000 to provide security for the couple during a vacation to Turkey and Greece.

For the energy industry, Zinke brought relief from rules imposed under Obama that were meant to limit drilling in sensitive wildlife habitat, curb emissions of the greenhouse gas carbon monoxide and protect water supplies.

Despite the Democrats' newfound power in Washington after taking control of the House of Representatives, industry representatives said Zinke's impact will be lasting. That's because they involved agency regulations rather than congressional action and came at the order of Trump, said Dan Naatz, vice president of government relations for the Independent Petroleum Association of America.

""Although Secretary Zinke was effective at what he was doing, the policy really came from the president,"" Naatz said.

Until Trump nominates and the Senate confirms a permanent replacement, Zinke's shoes will be filled on an acting basis by his deputy, David Bernhardt, a former lobbyist for the oil and gas industry. Left-leaning groups that campaigned against Zinke already have turned their attention to Bernhardt with claims that his prior work leaves him compromised.

""David Bernhardt is too conflicted to serve him in any position, whether it's deputy, acting or full Interior secretary,"" said Aaron Weiss with the Center for Western Priorities. Weiss also suggested the pending investigations against Zinke are likely to continue and said the former secretary ""can't make his trouble go away by simply walking away.""

Wyoming Sen. John Barrasso, who chairs the Senate Environment and Natural Works Committee, said Zinke worked closely with western states and respected their priorities. Barrasso said it was important for the next secretary to likewise pursue Trump's American ""energy dominance"" agenda while following sound environmental practices.

In his resignation letter, Zinke said he was compelled to stop down because the political attacks against him had created a distraction from Trump's drive to boost U.S. energy production.

He told the AP that the allegations fit into a ""playbook"" used by the administration's critics to stifle Trump's energy agenda, smear Zinke's name and undercut any future bid he might make for public office. He said he won't run for Montana governor in 2020, but did not rule out a future run.

In the weeks leading up to his resignation, the White House concluded Zinke was likely the Cabinet member most vulnerable to investigations led by newly empowered Democrats in Congress, according to an administration official not authorized to publicly discuss personnel matters who spoke on condition of anonymity.

In Zinke's telling of events, Trump remained fully supportive to the end and it was the secretary himself who made the decision to go.

His departure comes amid a partial government shutdown in which Zinke ordered many national parks to stay open, saying visitors shouldn't be penalized for the political feud centered on Trump's proposed border wall with Mexico.

With reports of overflowing trash bins spurring calls for the parks to be closed until the shutdown ends, Zinke offered some parting advice as he prepared to head back to his hometown of Whitefish, Montana, just outside Glacier National Park: ""I would encourage everyone that visits their parks to help pitch in, grab a trash bag and take some trash out with you,"" he said. ""Pack it in, pack it out.""

348,daily mail online,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6543173/Elizabeth-Warren-dodges-question-Native-American-PR-disaster-campaign-press-conference.html,"Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren dodged questions on Monday about her biggest political liabilities as she jumped headfirst into the 2020 Democratic presidential primary process.

In announcing the formation of a presidential exploratory committee, Warren staked out the first significant territory in what will likely be a crowded field of Democrats itching for a swing at Donald Trump.

But showed no sign she's ready to overcome the self-inflected scandal that has dogged her for years: her questionable claim of American Indian ancestry.

The result was an unsteady performance that none of the three major cable news networks broadcast live from beginning to end.

Asked in her first question as a candidate-in-waiting how she will respond to Democrats who worry that questions about her ancestry had left her too vulnerable to be electable, Warren defaulted to talking points.

'I'm in this fight because I understand what's happening to working families,' she said outside her home near Boston, standing alongside her husband Bruce Mann.

Massachusetts Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren spoke to reporters with her husband Bruce (left) at her side, after announcing she has formed an exploratory committee to run for president in 2020

The first question from a reporter as she entered the 2020 fray was about her electability given her Native American DNA scandal - and she avoided answering it

President Donald Trump has hit Warren repeatedly as a fake Native American and nicknamed her 'Pocahontas'

President Donald Trump has long been critical of Warren for claiming to have Cherokee ancestry, a move the president claims gave her preferential treatment in university hiring at Harvard and the University of Pennsylvania.

Warren conceded this month that she is 'not a person of color,' following her embarrassing October release of DNA test data that concluded her proportion of American Indian blood might be as small as 1 part in 1,024 - lower than average European-Americans.

She sidestepped a separate question on Monday about whether her far-left brand of populism will polarize American voters, denying her meaningful support outside the liberal northeast U.S. and California.

Instead she acknowledged only that CEOs and investment bankers won't like her.

'The problem we've got right now in Washington is that it works great for those who have money, to buy influence,' said Warren, 69. 'And I'm fighting against that, and you bet it's going to make a lot of people unhappy.'

The 69-year-old Democrat would not, however, rule out accepting help from super PACs built with their political contributions.

'Would you take support from super PACs,' a reporter asked.

Despite a crush of TV cameras covering Warren's announcement and her short Q&A with reporters, none of the three big cable TV news networks broadcast the entire event live

Warren, pictured walking away after the short press availability, said she's no fan of super PACs or the billionaire who fund them, but didn't rule out accepting their help in 2020

How she announced: Elizabeth Warren used New Year's Eve morning to make her presidential move in a video recorded in her kitchen but slickly produced

A flustered Warren said only that 'I don't think we ought to be running campaigns that are funded by billionaires, whether it goes through super PACs or their own money that they're spending.'

That fell short of a pledge to shun their help as she runs for the White House.

'I've already received donations from all 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico,' she boasted, before revealing that she would spend New Year's Eve with her husband doing what they always do: watching the 1942 film 'Casablanca.'

Trump aides licked their chops and laughed as they anticipated a battle between the president and the ultra-liberal swashbuckler he regularly mocks as 'Pocahontas.'

A Trump administration official with knowledge of the president's thinking said Monday that Warren 'will go down in flames,' and cracked a subtle Native American joke.

'She's going to somehow ride her far-left platform into the White House?' the official asked.

'How?'

'It's a dream come true,' said a second official, adding a fond hope that Connecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal would follow Warren into the race.

'Can we get Blumenthal to run too? More phony Democrats, please,' said that official.

She's (almost) running: Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren used New Year's Eve to announce she is setting up an exploratory committee for a 2020 bid

President Donald Trump has said he would love to face Warren, and has already spent two years publicly mocking her to soften the ground

Trump has similarly weaponized Blumenthal's past missteps, turning his military career into a case of stolen valor because he has falsely claimed to have fought in Vietnam.

Blumenthal served in uniform as a U.S. Marine reservist for six years but spent the war thousands of miles from harm's way.

Warren's New Year's Eve launch guaranteed she had the nation's political spotlight largely to herself.

'America's middle class is under attack,"" the 69-year-old Massachusetts Democrat said in a launch video. 'How did we get here? Billionaires and big corporations decided they wanted more of the pie. And they enlisted politicians to cut them a bigger slice.'

She tried to strike a uniting tone, declaring that 'no matter what our differences, most of us want the same thing: 'to be able to work hard, play by the same set of rules and take care of the people we love. That's what I'm fighting for.'

The Republican National Committee blasted out a scathing reply.

Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said that Warren 'couldn't be more out of touch. With her lack of support from voters - including in her home state - on top of her phony claim to minority status, now that she is formally running Americans will see her for what she is: another extreme far-left obstructionist and a total fraud.'

Connecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal is another liberal Democrat who Trump aides would like to see enter the 2020 contest, because of his false claims to have fought in Vietnam

On the blocks: In an email to supporters, Warren said she'd more formally announce a campaign plan early in 2019. She can now raise money for a run

Warren burst onto the national scene a decade ago during the financial crisis with calls for greater consumer protections.

She quickly became one of the party's more prominent liberals even as she sometimes fought with Obama administration officials over their response to the market turmoil.

Now, as a likely presidential contender, she is making an appeal to the party's base. Her video notes the economic challenges facing people of color along with images of a women's march and Warren's participation at an LGBT event.

In an email to supporters, Warren said she'd more formally announce a campaign plan early in 2019.

Warren is the most prominent Democrat yet to make a move toward a presidential bid and has long been a favorite target of President Donald Trump.

In mid-December, former Obama housing chief Julian Castro also announced a presidential exploratory committee, which legally allows potential candidates to begin raising money. Outgoing Maryland Rep. John Delaney is the only Democrat so far to have formally announced a presidential campaign.

But that's likely to change quickly in the new year as other leading Democrats take steps toward White House runs.

Greatest hits: Trump is likely to make use of his previous assault on Elizabeth Warren's claims of Native American roots, which he stepped up in the wake of her DNA test

Warren enters a Democratic field that's shaping up as the most crowded in decades, with many of her Senate colleagues openly weighing their own campaigns, as well as governors, mayors and other prominent citizens.

One of her most significant competitors could be Sen. Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent who is eyeing another presidential run harnessing the same populist rhetoric.

She must also move past the widely panned October DNA test stunt meant to bolster her claim to Native American heritage. Instead, the use of a genetic test to prove her ethnicity emboldened Trump's taunts of her as 'Pocahontas.'

There was no direct mention of the controversy, or of Trump, in Monday's video. It did include images of the president and his inner-circle current and former aides who her base most loves to hate: Kellyanne Conway, Stephen Miller and Steve Bannon.

Warren has the benefit of higher name recognition than many others in the Democratic mix for 2020, thanks to her years as a prominent critic of Wall Street who originally conceived of what became the government's Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

She now faces an arduous battle to raise money and capture Democratic primary voters' attention before Iowa casts its first vote in more than a year.

She has an advantage in the $12.5 million left over from her 2018 re-election campaign that she could use for a presidential run.

Warren's campaign is likely to revolve around the same theme she's woven into speeches and policy proposals in recent years: battling special interests, paying mind to the nexus between racial and economic inequities.

'America's middle class is under attack,' Warren said in the video.

'How did we get here? Billionaires and big corporations decided they wanted more of the pie. And they enlisted politicians to cut them a fatter slice.'

349,daily mail online,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6556745/Rhodes-scholar-Dreamer-fears-return-US.html,"'If I leave, there's a very real possibility that I won't be able to come back. That's the biggest fear for sure,' said Park, whose family illegally came to the U.S. from South Korea when he was 7 years old

He became the first 'Dreamer' to win the prestigious Rhodes scholarship, but for recent Harvard University graduate Jin Park, the joy of that achievement has given way to uncertainty.

The 22-year-old, who lives in New York City, risks not being allowed back in the country if he enrolls at the University of Oxford in England in the fall.

President Donald Trump's administration rescinded the option for overseas travel for those with Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals status, or DACA, when he moved to phase out the Obama-era program in 2017.

Harvard University graduate Jin K. Park, who holds a degree in molecular and cellular biology entered the U.S. illegally as a child, moving to Queens borough of New York City with his family

But travel abroad, which was allowed under limited circumstances such as academic study during the Obama administration, should still be permitted because the federal courts have upheld the program for now, argue Park and his supporters.

'If I leave, there's a very real possibility that I won't be able to come back. That's the biggest fear for sure,' said Park, whose family came to the U.S. from South Korea when he was 7 years old. 'I haven't really thought about what that's going to mean if I'm not allowed back.'

U.S. Citizen and Immigration Services, which administers DACA, didn't respond to emails seeking comment.

DACA recipients, commonly called 'Dreamers' because of never-passed proposals in Congress called the DREAM Act, are protected from deportation because they were brought into the country illegally at a young age.

The undocumented student, who participates in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program (DACA), is not sure if he'll be allowed back in the U.S. after his studies in the United Kingdom

Discussing the risks has been a delicate topic to broach with his parents, who cried out of joy when he won the scholarship, Park said.

The 22-year-old, who lives in New York City, risks not being allowed back in the country if he enrolls at the University of Oxford in England in the fall.

'I've been avoiding that question,' he said days after graduating from Harvard last month. 'This was especially meaningful for them. It was like a validation of the sacrifices they've made for me.'

Nearly 700,000 individuals are currently on DACA, which was created in 2012 and can be renewed every two years. To qualify, immigrants must have entered the country by 2007 and been under age 16 when they arrived.

The Trump administration issued an order winding down the program in 2017, but federal judges in New York, California and Washington, D.C., ruled against those efforts last year and have effectively kept the program running. The administration is now seeking a Supreme Court review.

Past Rhodes scholars and other Rhodes Trust supporters are volunteering their private counsel to Park in the meantime, but it's a 'matter of American law and not anything the Rhodes Trust can resolve alone,' said Elliot Gerson, the British organization's American secretary.

'Our hope is for federal action,' he added.

'The government should enforce the law as it currently stands, to allow Jin to fulfil his scholarly work,' said Kristian Ramos, a spokesman for Define American, an immigrant advocacy organization that supported Park in his Rhodes scholarship bid.

Park could turn down the scholarship but has decided against that route. He wants to continue to be a voice in the immigration debate and believes the benefits of going to Oxford outweigh the risks.

'I'm looking forward to having that unstructured time to think about these broader questions of who belongs in America and the value judgments we make about others,' he said.

Park has been a vocal advocate for DACA recipients since he was in high school. In 2015, he founded Higher Dreams, a nonprofit organization that helps students without permanent immigration status navigate the college application process.

President Donald Trump's administration rescinded the option for overseas travel for those with Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals status, or DACA, when he moved to phase out the Obama-era program in 2017

With the backing of Harvard, Park applied for the Rhodes scholarship last year as part of a broader effort to underscore how DACA recipients didn't qualify for the venerated award and others like it. The scholarship was created in 1902 by British businessmen and politician Cecil Rhodes and provides all expenses for at least two years of study at Oxford.

Park's application - like a number of others in recent years - was rejected, but the message was received. The Rhodes organization changed its policy effective this year. Park re-applied and was accepted.

Gerson said the change reflects the organization's efforts to expand eligibility. Legal permanent residents and residents of U.S. territories like Puerto Rico have also been allowed to apply in recent years.

At Oxford, Park hopes to study migration and political theory as he weighs his future.

The molecular and cell biology major has also applied to medical school, but he hasn't ruled out working in city government, where he believes he can make an impact on immigration policy 'no matter who is in the White House.'

And regardless what happens next, Park has the conviction of knowing where home is.

'For me, I think of Queens, New York,' he said. 'Whatever happens, I'm always going to know that fact. Even if I have to spend the rest of my life convincing the administration, or whoever comes next."
350,daily mail online,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6509223/Facebook-COO-Sheryl-Sandberg-says-company-needs-protect-users-civil-rights.html,"Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg admitted that executives at the social media giant 'know we need to do more' to protect users' civil rights on the platform as 31 civil rights groups call for a change in the company's leadership.

Sandberg made the remarks in a statement on Tuesday, the same day the NAACP launches a week-long boycott of the site after a Senate Intelligence Committee report revealed that Russian-backed actors targeted African-American Facebook users in an attempt to influence the 2016 presidential election.

'Facebook is committed to working with leading U.S. civil rights organizations to strengthen and advance civil rights on our service. They've raised a number of important concerns, and I'm grateful for their candor and guidance,' Sandberg wrote.

'We know that we need to do more: to listen, look deeper and take action to respect fundamental rights.'

Facebook COO Sheryl Sandberg admitted that executives at the social media giant 'know we need to do more' to protect users' civil rights on the platform in a statement Tuesday responding to an update to a company audit. Her remarks came just as the NAACP is launching a week-long boycott of the site and 31 civil rights groups have called for a leadership overhaul

Facebook concurrently released the findings of a civil rights audit headed by Laura Murphy, a former director of the ACLU Legislative Office.

In the audit report, Murphy highlighted specific areas of concern on the platform, including voter suppression, targeted advertising, content moderation and diversity and inclusion - both on the site and within the company.

She called for more transparency and improvements in content moderation as well as the creation of a 'civil rights advocacy infrastructure'.

'For the past several years, civil rights groups have consistently expressed, both publicly and privately, their deeply held concerns about Facebook's products, policies, and practices and their implications on civil and human rights,' Murphy wrote.

Sandberg (above in September) said that the ongoing civil rights audit, headed by former ACLU director Laura Murphy, will be one of her top objectives for 2019

She acknowledged the work that strides that executives have taken this year, but said there is still much to be done.

'The work that has been done over the last six months is an attempt to capture and consolidate their concerns to produce meaningful results,' Murphy wrote.

'Given Facebook's scope and scale, this continues to be a challenge.'

Facebook has acknowledged many of the civil rights concerned outlined in the audit, and Sandberg said the audit will be 'one of my top priorities for 2019'.

'I'm committed to overseeing its progress and making sure that it is a well-resourced, cross-company effort,' she wrote.

'I'm grateful to all of the leaders and advocates who have contributed to the audit this year, and I look forward to continuing this important work with them in the future.'

The audit progress update was released just two days after two independent studies commissioned by the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, which revealed that Russian-backed troll accounts disproportionately targeted minorities and marginalized groups during the 2016 election.

Sandberg said of those Senate reports: 'We take this incredibly seriously, as demonstrated by the investments we've made in safety and security.'

According to the bombshell analysis of the Russian influence operation, the Russian Internet Research Agency purchased a total of 1,087 ads targeting African American politic and culture and black identity and nationalism during the campaign.

Facebook's ad program allowed purchasers to select users with certain interests, like Malcolm X - a capability the St. Petersburg-based outfit relied on to slice up the American electorate.

The Kremlin-linked Internet Research Agency, which has been charged with interfering in the elections, relied on Facebook, Google and Twitter and other platforms for targeted messaging, according to the report for the Senate Intelligence Committee.

It used words, videos and images to persuade voters to back Trump, according to a report by Oxford University's Computational Propaganda Project and network analysis company Graphika.

It outlines repeated Russian efforts to divide and target black voters - and even a program to set up hotlines to get people to confess problems that could be potential fodder for blackmail.

The tactics reached tens of millions of Americans during the multi-year durations, and targeted key interest groups known to impact US elections.

A Senate Intelligence Committee report released on Monday revealed that Russian-backed social media campaigns aimed at influencing the 2016 election disproportionately targeted African-American voters. An example of one of the ads used is pictured above

The senate report found that online activity focused on police violence against blacks

Russians tried ginning up support online using multiple campaigns, including Blacktivist

US intelligence assessed and prosecutors have charged that the outfit was financed by a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin. Many of the ad purchases were in rubles. Early posts before 2014 were in Russian, but English language social media activity jumped that year, and continued even into 2017.

The Russians set up 30 Facebook pages on black Americans, while another 10 YouTube channels focused on police violence against blacks and put out 571 videos on the subject.

The efforts to target African Americans and suppress the black vote came during a 2016 election where Hillary Clinton won an overwhelming share of support among African American vote.

According to the report: 'Messaging to African Americans sought to divert their political energy away from established political institutions by preying on anger with structural inequalities faced by African Americans, including police violence, poverty, and disproportionate levels of incarceration.'

It continued: 'These campaigns pushed a message that the best way to advance the cause of the African American community was to boycott the election and focus on other issues instead. This often happened through the use of repetitive slogans. This accounts for the majority of content in the dataset that targeted this group.'

After a Russian 'Black Matters' Facebook page got shut down, the IRA simply created new renamed campaigns to push its message. 'Cops kill black kids. Are you sure that your son won't be the next?' went one aimed at African Americans.

The Russians also went after other demographic slices: Muslims, southerners, Texans, and more.

The campaign didn't stop after the trolls got caught, and in fact peaked in 2017, according to the report.

The report found that conservative users 'were actively encouraged to get behind Trump's campaign' while other users were 'encouraged to boycott the election, abstain from voting for Clinton, or to spread cynicism about participating in the election' through Russian ads

The report was presented to the Senate Intelligence Committee. The bipartisan panel released it publicly on Monday morning.

It tracks observations like an increase in activity on election day in 2016 and during general election debates between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. Activity by the group spiked the most at the end of the year when Barack Obama announced that he was opening up probes into Russia's attempt to hack the election.

Among its findings were that conservative users 'were actively encouraged to get behind Trump's campaign' while other users were 'encouraged to boycott the election, abstain from voting for Clinton, or to spread cynicism about participating in the election in general'.

'What is clear is that all of the messaging clearly sought to benefit the Republican Party - and specifically Donald Trump,' the report says.

'Trump is mentioned most in campaigns targeting conservatives and right-wing voters, where the messaging encouraged these groups to support his campaign. The main groups that could challenge Trump were then provided messaging that sought to confuse, distract and ultimately discourage members from voting.'

The Senate Intelligence Committee found that the Russian-backed actors 'clearly sought to benefit the Republican Party - and specifically Donald Trump (pictured this month)

Committee chairman Richard Burr, a North Carolina Republican, said the data 'demonstrates how aggressively Russia sought to divide Americans by race, religion and ideology, and how the IRA actively worked to erode trust in our democratic institutions.'

'Most troublingly, it shows that these activities have not stopped,' he assessed. 'As we work to address these threats, these reports are proof positive that one of the most important things we can do is increase information sharing between the social media companies who can identify disinformation campaigns and the third-party experts who can analyze them.'

The committee's vice chair, Mark Warner, a Virginia Democrat, likewise said the report revealed that Russian election meddling was worse than previously revealed.

'This should stand as a wake up call to us all that none of us are immune from this threat, and it is time to get serious in addressing this challenge,' he said. 'That is going to require some much-needed and long-overdue guardrails when it comes to social media. I hope these reports will spur legislative action in the Congress and provide additional clarity to the American public about Russia's assault on our democracy.'

What is clear is that all of the messaging clearly sought to benefit the Republican Party - and specifically Donald Trump.

Researchers also noted that the data includes evidence of sloppiness by the Russians that could have led to earlier detection, including the use of Russia's currency, the ruble, to buy ads.

House Intelligence ranking member Adam Schiff, a California Democrat, said in a statement after the release of the report that social media companies share in the blame and must be held accountable.

'Their reluctance to conduct and publish such deep analysis themselves, to actively and meaningfully collaborate with one another to compare and publicize data and information to build out the extent of the IRA's efforts, and to otherwise make available to outside research groups comprehensive, uniform access to the data, have made our task far more difficult than it should have been,' he scolded.

Schiff said the companies, which he did not call out by name, should be doing more to keep their users and the public aware of disinformation operations.

It comes after President Trump and his attorney unleashed a fresh series of attacks people investigating him, questioning their integrity while categorically ruling out the possibility of a presidential interview with the special counsel for the Department of Justice's probe into Russia."

352,daily mail online,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6514167/THEY-want-Trump-claims-troops-killed-battling-ISIS-Syria-support-sudden-pullout-plan.html,"President Donald Trump cut a video declaring victory in Syria after getting brushback on his sudden withdrawal announcement - and suggested that fallen U.S. servicemen and women back his plan for an immediate withdrawal.

Trump released the video on Twitter Wednesday evening - after cancelling a planned meeting with lawmakers where he was certain to get more pushback on his sudden announcement, made via Twitter, which appears to have caught senior military leaders off guard.

'Our boys, our young women, our men, they're all coming back. And they're coming back now. We won, and that's the way we want it. And that's the way they want it,' Trump said, pointing to the sky for emphasis.

The passage in the video came after Trump hailed fallen soldiers who died in the anti-ISIS campaign.

After declaring victory on Twitter, President Trump, who had no public schedule Wednesday, released a video from the White House where he said: 'We have beaten them and we've beaten them badly. We've taken back the land.'

'Now we've won. It's time to come back. They're getting ready. You're going to see them soon. These are great American heroes,' Trump said.

'These are great heroes of the world. Because they fought for us. But they've killed ISIS, who hurts the world,' the president said, speaking in broad terms about an enemy that tore across Iraq and Syria in 2014 and proclaimed an Islamic State.

'And we're proud to have done it. And I'll tell you they're up there looking down on us. And there is nobody happier or more proud of their families to put them in a position where they've done such good for so many people,' the president continued.

The president made the video just steps away from the Oval Office, on a day when he had no public events, and took incoming from GOP lawmakers and retired military commanders who said the U.S. should maintain a force to keep pressure on ISIS and prevent domination by Russian and Iranian influence.

Earlier Wednesday morning, Trump claimed 'we have defeated ISIS,' although the military estimates some 30,000 ISIS fighters remain.

The president's most detailed policy announcement on the plan came in a video posted on Twitter

'Now we've won. It's time to come back. They're getting ready. You're going to see them soon. These are great American heroes,' Trump said

The video featured Trump speaking directly to the camera with a few headlines splashed across for emphasis

'We've been fighting for a long time in Syria. I've been president for two years. And we've really stepped it up. And we have won against ISIS. We have beaten them and we've beaten them badly. We've taken back the land. And now it's time for our troops to come back home,' said Trump, who has long called for withdrawal from overseas conflicts.

'I get very saddened when I have to write letters or call parents or wives or husbands of soldiers who have been killed fighting for our country,' the president continued. 'It's a great honor. We cherish them. But it's heartbreaking. There is no question about it, it's heartbreaking,' the president said.

Earlier, Trump declared victory over ISIS in Syria on Wednesday, as the Pentagon made preparations for an immediate troop withdrawal.

Shortly after the president posted his video, images of him attending a White House Christmas party began showing up on Instagram

Time to celebrate: Trump attended a Christmas Party at the White House Wednesday evening

'We have defeated ISIS in Syria, my only reason for being there during the Trump Presidency,' the president wrote on Twitter.

The announcement came under immediate scrutiny, as policymakers admitted they had been blindsided and worried that Trump was making a monumental misstep.

Allies of the president on Capitol Hill called it a 'huge Obama-like mistake' and 'great disservice' to the nation. One GOP congressman said he was 'speechless' and that Iran and Russia are probably 'cheering.'

The White House launched a defense of the policy on a conference call on Wednesday afternoon with reporters in which a senior administration official claimed that no one should be 'surprised' by the announcement, because Trump has been saying he wants to get out of Syria since he was a candidate.

Yet, the same official could not offer a timeline for the troops are actually leaving, saying it was was still under design by the Pentagon.

'It's not that I'm not telling you, it's that I don't know, quite frankly,' the senior official said.

The person directed all questions of that nature to the Department of Defense.

President Donald Trump declared a victory in Syria in the U.S. campaign against ISIS as the military prepares for a total pullout

Trump declared victory in Syria over ISIS on Wednesday morning in a surprise announcement that the U.S. was pulling troops out of the region

GOP lawmakers were miffed that Trump declared victory against ISIS over Twitter before they had been notified of his intent to withdraw troops.

Vice President Mike Pence just happened to be on Capitol Hill for a weekly meeting with Republican senators on Tuesday and took the brunt of the criticism behind closed doors, CNN reported.

'It doesn't feel to me there was any inter-agency process,' Senate Foreign Relations Chairman Bob Corker said of the conversation with the vice president. 'I'm not sure even the principles knew.'

Corker suggested that Trump just 'woke up' and decided to make the policy announcement.

He told reporters at the Capitol hours later that he was at the White House for a planned meeting with Trump when the president, who has not been seen all day, cancelled on him.

The Tennessee Republican is leaving Congress for good at the end of this year and is effectively a lame duck. His complaints were shared by other lawmakers, however, who begged Trump to rethink his position.

Texas Sen. John Cornyn, the GOP whip, said it was a 'mistake' to leave Syria and the matter would most certainly be investigated by the upper chamber.

'I think the first mistake was to surprise Members of Congress. Nobody likes to be surprised,' he told CNN.

Graham also chided Trump for announcing the withdrawl on Twitter.

In a tweet, he said, 'Withdrawal of this small American force in Syria would be a huge Obama-like mistake.'

'This is the role of the Congress. To make administrations explain their policy, not in a tweet, but before Congress answering questions,' he told reporters later.

Graham said he was 'annoyed' and pledged 'aggressive' oversight of the move.

Sen. Marco Rubio likewise said the withdrawl is a 'great disservice' to the nation and a 'big mistake' that invites 'America's adversaries America is an unreliable partner.'

'Today's decision will lead to grave consequences in the months and years to come,' the Republican senator cautioned.

A senior administration official refused to get into the details of the 'deliberative process' a short time after on a call with reporters during which the White House said that National Security Advisor John Bolton had been calling lawmakers all day.

'He's very committed to keeping them informed,' the senior official said.

The official was left exposed on the call when a reporter brought up Bolton's September claim that the U.S. would not leave Syria until Iran's military and its proxies do.

'I think the issue here is that the president has made the decision, and so previous statements -- he gets to do that, that's his prerogative,' the official said in an admission that Trump was undermining his own aides.

Responding directly to complaints that legislators were informed after the fact, the person said, 'The president's views have been well known, so I really don't see this as a surprise.'

The official said that the comparison that Graham and others were making to Obama's withdrawl of U.S. troop from Iraq in 2011 was 'apples to oranges,' because the drawdown was much larger and came about as a result of a failure to come to an agreement with the Iraqi government about leaving troops in the country.

'The president has judged that the purpose for which those troops have been put into Syria has been accomplished to the point where they can reposition,' the person said.

As for Sen. Graham, the official said 'he is entitled to his opinion' but it's unreasonable to think that the U.S. is going to turn 'Syria into a utopian democracy.'

Trump's declaration came after the Wall Street Journal and other outlets quoted Pentagon officials saying the U.S. would soon begin pulling out remaining forces, which number about 2,000.

'The Pentagon has an order to get to move troops out of Syria as quickly as possible,' a U.S. official told the paper.

The White House said in a statement following Trump's announcement that troops have 'started returning' home and a transition has begun.

'Five years ago, ISIS was a very powerful and dangerous force in the Middle East, and now the United States has defeated the territorial caliphate. These victories over ISIS in Syria do not signal the end of the Global Coalition or its campaign,' White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said in a statement.

'We have started returning United States troops home as we transition to the next phase of this campaign.'

She added, 'The United States and our allies stand ready to re-engage at all levels to defend American interests whenever necessary, and we will continue to work together to deny radical Islamist terrorists territory, funding, support, and any means of infiltrating our borders.'

Turkish president Recep Erdogan was likely to welcome the move. His country shares a border with Syria. So was Russia, which is allied with Syrian dictator Bashar al-Assad and is establishing a permanent military presence in the country as part of a deal with Damascus, and Iran.

Defense Secretary Jim Mattis is said to have pressed Trump not to pull out America troops out of concern that ISIS will rebound. It still controls some territory in region.

GOP senators expressed the same sentiments on Wednesday as they vented their frustrations.

GOP Rep. Adam Kinzinger disputed the president's claim that ISIS had been defeated

Graham compared Trump to his Democratic predecessor Barack Obama's resolve to pull troops out of Iraq, which critics say paved the way for ISIS to develop.

Illinois Rep. Adam Kinzinger also disputed the president's claim that ISIS had been defeated.

'This is simply not true,' Kinzinger wrote after retweeting the president.

He said in another message, addressing Trump's decision to pull out troops, 'Really? Iran is rejoicing right now. We left Iraq, and had to come back. I would sure hope the President and his advisers are smarter than this.'

Kinzinger said on CNN later that he was 'speechless' and that terrorists would be 'emboldened' by the withdrawl. 'This makes no sense to me,' he said. 'I don't get it.'

He said that Moscow and Tehran are 'cheering' over the decision he claimed makes America less safe.

House Foreign Affairs Chairman Ed Royce said he too was 'disturbed,' because while 'ISIS is on the run, it's not yet defeated.'

'The limited number of U.S. forces in Syria is critical to rooting out these terrorists and stopping Iran from moving fighters and missiles to Israel's doorstep. Our presence is also key to helping leverage a political transition to end Syria's civil war,' he contended.

'The last administration showed what happens when arbitrary political deadlines - rather than reality on the ground - dictate policy in war zones. We must learn from the mistakes of the past, not repeat them.'

Retired Gen. Mark Hertling also turned in a devastating review in an appearance on CNN, saying the move appeared to be 'transactional' in nature, having to do with an arrangement with Turkey and Russia.

'This was very surprising to me -- not only the announcement but the timing. I don't understand why it is happening now,' he told the network.

'The U.S. Forces have just started an offensive with the Syrian defense forces and the Kurds against the town of Hajin, which is considered an ISIS stronghold... You're talking about making both the Russians, the Syrian Bashar Al Assad, the Iranians and the Turks very happy about this move because the Kurdish forces are going to see this as us turning against them one more time.'

Hertling added: 'What is interesting that has not been brought up yet is there seems to be a transactional element to this, too,' Raw Story reported. 'Over the last days the U.S. Has sealed the deal with Turkey for $3.5 billion worth of Patriot missile systems that were signed yesterday by our State Department. I'm sure that played a role, a little bit, in this.'

The State Department subsequently cancelled its daily briefing with reporters. The White House held a call for journalists but neither Trump nor his spokeswoman appeared before cameras.

Just last week the Special Presidential Envoy for the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS, McGurk, said at a State Department briefing that ISIS had not been defeated.

'Even as the end of the physical caliphate is clearly now coming into sight, the end of ISIS will be a much more long-term initiative. We've talked about that many times. Nobody working on these issues day to day is complacent. Nobody is declaring a mission accomplished,' he'd said. 'Defeating a physical caliphate is one phase of a much longer-term campaign.'

He said that ISIS was down to one percent of controlled territory and said the coalition was shifting its focus to how to sustain the gains it had made in the region.

'We're prepared to maintain the stabilization effort in Iraq and Syria,' he said.

Trump has said for months that he wants to 'get out' of Syria and would recall troops as soon he was able. His announcement on Wednesday that it had already started to happen, however, is what startled lawmakers.

The U.S. was believed to have about 2,000 troops in Syria, where Trump led a three-party coalition that dropped bombs on Assad's forces for illicit use of chemical weapons.

Some 5,200 troops are still believed to be across the border in Iraq, a number that the Pentagon has declined as a matter of routine since Trump took office to confirm.

Trump has derided Barack Obama for withdrawing U.S. forces from Iraq. Republicans claim that the move left a power vacuum in the country that ISIS took advantage of.

He in 2016 contended repeatedly that Obama was the 'founder of ISIS' and claimed he was the terror group's 'most valuable player.'"
353,the huffington post,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/michelle-obama-becoming-teenage-girls-dalls_us_5c1a6e9de4b01059bfc62091,"A group of teenage girls reading Michelle Obama's best-selling memoir Becoming got a special surprise this week.

The former first lady was in Dallas for her book tour on Monday when she stopped by a young women's leadership conference at the Winspear Opera House, The Dallas Morning News reported.

In video from local station NBC 5 News, a smaller group of attendees can be seen and heard excitedly cheering as Obama walks in. The students had been having a discussion on Becoming when the author made her appearance, according to the newspaper.

Her presence brought many of the young women to tears.

""Everything she went through, it wasn't for herself,"" one teenage girl told NBC 5. ""It was for kids like me that are dealing with struggles. To make us understand and acknowledge that we can be who we want to be.""

During her visit, Obama also spoke before the entire conference, which more than 100 young women were attending.

Obama later joined Valerie Jarrett, former senior adviser to President Barack Obama, for a conversation onstage at the city's American Airlines Center. She has made a number of surprise visits in various cities during her tour.

In a tweet Wednesday, Obama shared some of the words of encouragement she gave the young women during the conference.

""As I told the ladies I met in Dallas, your story is the most powerful part of who you are -- the struggles, failures, successes and everything in between,"" she wrote. ""Remember to always stay open to new experiences and never let the doubters get in the way. You all are beautiful."""
354,daily mail online,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6596345/Manafort-claimed-placing-people-Trump-administration-filing.html,"Paul Manafort, the convicted former chairman of Donald Trump's presidential campaign, told a business associate in January of 2017 he was using middlemen to get people appointed to the Trump administration, according to a court filing on Tuesday.

US Special Counsel Robert Mueller had been given until Monday by a federal court in Washington, DC, to provide evidence of his accusations that Manafort had lied to prosecutors on five subjects.

If such allegations are proven to be true, that would put Manafort in breach of a plea agreement under which he was meant to be cooperating with Mueller's probe into Russian interference in the 2016 president election, and whether Trump's campaign colluded with the foreign government.

The heavily redacted 188-page filing included new details about Manafort's communications with Trump administration officials, which continued even after he left the campaign in August of 2016 due to a scandal over cash payments related to his work for pro-Russia politicians in Ukraine.

Scroll down for video

Court documents filed in Washington, DC allege that Paul Manafort, convicted former chairman of Donald Trump's presidential campaign, said that he was using intermediaries to 'get people appointed in the [Trump] Administration' in January 2017. Manafort is pictured (left) arriving for arraignment on a charge of witness tampering at US District Court in Washington, DC on June 15. Trump is pictured (right) on the South Lawn of the White House on Monday

In January of 2017 Manafort told his former business partner Richard Gates that he was using intermediaries to 'get people appointed in the Administration,' according to the sworn statement of an FBI agent working for Mueller included in the filing.

Gates, who also served on Trump's presidential transition team, pleaded guilty last year to lying to the FBI and conspiracy against the United States.

Gates also agreed to cooperate with Mueller's probe.

In January of 2017 Manafort told his former business partner Richard Gates that he was using intermediaries to 'get people appointed in the Administration,' according to the sworn statement of an FBI agent working for Mueller included in the filing, which is shown in relevant part here

Also on Tuesday, Mueller asked a federal judge for more time before sentencing Gates because of his ongoing cooperation, suggesting the probe into Russian interference may still have a ways to go.

The latest request for more time before sentencing came in a joint filing by Mueller's office and Gates' lawyers to US District Judge Amy Berman Jackson in Washington, who is overseeing the case.

In a request similar to one made to the judge in November, they cited Gates' cooperation with 'several ongoing investigations' in asking for another 60 days before they update the judge again about the case and whether it was time to move to sentencing.

Gates, who also served on Trump's presidential transition team, pleaded guilty last year to lying to the FBI and conspiracy against the United States. Like Manafort, Gates has also agreed to cooperate with Robert Mueller's probe into Russian election interference, and collusion between Trump's presidential campaign and the foreign government.

The filing in the Manafort case, which was also submitted to Jackson's court, touched on Manafort's other alleged lies, including about his interactions with Konstantin Kilimnik, a former business partner who Mueller has accused of having Russian intelligence ties.

But due to heavy redactions it was unclear if the filing contained any major new revelations.

Last week, Manafort's lawyers in court papers inadvertently disclosed that Manafort had shared polling data related to the Trump 2016 presidential campaign with Kilimnik.

The mistaken disclosure - caused by a formatting error that allowed redacted material to be viewed - triggered new concerns among legal experts and Democratic lawmakers about the extent of Manafort's Russia ties during his time on Trump's campaign, which included three months as chairman.

Mueller is investigating whether Russia interfered in the 2016 presidential election and whether Trump campaign members coordinated with Moscow officials.

Trump, who denies any campaign collusion with Russia, says he did not know Manafort shared the data. Russia denies interfering in US elections.

In addition to the polling data revelation, the filing also showed that Mueller believed Manafort lied to prosecutors about his discussions with Kilimnik on a 'Ukrainian peace plan' and a previously undisclosed meeting between Manafort and Kilimnik in Madrid.

Manafort's lawyers said any incorrect statements by him were unintentional.

Judge Jackson has said she would review the evidence submitted by Mueller and any reply by Manafort's team before deciding whether a hearing on the matter is necessary.

Manafort was convicted on August 21 on eight counts of financial crimes. The jury was deadlocked on 10 additional charges.

A second trial for Manafort on charges of failing to register as a foreign agent has been set for September.

On the same day as Manafort's conviction came down, Trump's former lawyer Michael Cohen pleaded guilty to multiple counts of campaign finance violations in federal court, related to payments made to multiple women who said they had sexual relationships with Trump while he was with Melania Trump.

ROBERT MUELLER'S PROBE SO FAR: EIGHT CONVICTIONS - INCLUDING THREE TOP TRUMP AIDES, A JAILED ATTORNEY AND 25 RUSSIANS ACCUSED

GUILTY: MICHAEL FLYNN

Pleaded guilty to making false statements in December 2017. Awaiting sentence

Flynn was President Trump's former National Security Advisor and Robert Mueller's most senior scalp to date. He previously served when he was a three star general as President Obama's director of the Defense Intelligence Agency but was fired.

He admitted to lying to special counsel investigators about his conversations with a Russian ambassador in December 2016. He has agreed to cooperate with the special counsel investigation.

GUILTY: MICHAEL COHEN

Pleaded guilty to eight counts including fraud and two campaign finance violations in August 2018. Pleaded guilty to further count of lying to Congress in November 2018. Sentenced to three years in prison and $2 million in fines and forfeitures in December 2018

Cohen was Trump's longtime personal attorney, starting working for him and the Trump Organization in 2007. He is the longest-serving member of Trump's inner circle to be implicated by Mueller. Cohen professed unswerving devotion to Trump - and organized payments to silence two women who alleged they had sex with the-then candidate: porn star Stormy Daniels and Playboy model Karen McDougal. He admitted that payments to both women were felony campaign finance violations - and admitted that he acted at the 'direction' of 'Candidate-1': Donald Trump.

He also admitted tax fraud by lying about his income from loans he made, money from taxi medallions he owned, and other sources of income, at a cost to the Treasury of $1.3 million.

And he admitted lying to Congress in a rare use of the offense. The judge in his case let him report for prison on March 6 and recommended he serve it in a medium-security facility close to New York City.

GUILTY: PAUL MANAFORT

Found guilty of eight charges of bank and tax fraud in August 2018. Pleaded guilty to two further charges. Awaiting sentence

Manafort worked for Trump's campaign from March 2016 and chaired it from June to August 2016, overseeing Trump being adopted as Republican candidate at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland. He is the most senior campaign official to be implicated by Mueller. Manafort was one of Washington D.C.'s longest-term and most influential lobbyists but in 2015, his money dried up and the next year he turned to Trump for help, offering to be his campaign chairman for free - in the hope of making more money afterwards. But Mueller unwound his previous finances and discovered years of tax and bank fraud as he coined in cash from pro-Russia political parties and oligarchs in Ukraine.

Manafort pleaded not guilty to 18 charges of tax and bank fraud but was convicted of eight counts. The jury was deadlocked on the other 10 charges. A second trial on charges of failing to register as a foreign agent is due in September.

GUILTY: RICK GATES

Pleaded guilty to conspiracy against the United States and making false statements in February 2018. Awaiting sentence

Gates was Manafort's former deputy at political consulting firm DMP International. He admitted to conspiring to defraud the U.S. government on financial activity, and to lying to investigators about a meeting Manafort had with a member of congress in 2013. As a result of his guilty plea and promise of cooperation, prosecutors vacated charges against Gates on bank fraud, bank fraud conspiracy, failure to disclose foreign bank accounts, filing false tax returns, helping prepare false tax filings, and falsely amending tax returns.

GUILTY AND JAILED: GEORGE PAPADOPOLOUS

Pleaded guilty to making false statements in October 2017. Sentenced to 14 days in September 2018, and reported to prison in November. Served 12 days and released on December 7, 2018

Papadopoulos was a member of Donald Trump's campaign foreign policy advisory committee. He admitted to lying to special counsel investigators about his contacts with London professor Josef Mifsud and Ivan Timofeev, the director of a Russian government-funded think tank.

He has agreed to cooperate with the special counsel investigation.

GUILTY AND JAILED: RICHARD PINEDO

Pleaded guilty to identity fraud in February 2018. Sentenced to a year in prison

Pinedo is a 28-year-old computer specialist from Santa Paula, California. He admitted to selling bank account numbers to Russian nationals over the internet that he had obtained using stolen identities.

He has agreed to cooperate with the special counsel investigation.

GUILTY AND JAILED: ALEX VAN DER ZWAAN

Pleaded guilty to making false statements in February 2018. He served a 30-day prison sentence earlier this year and was deported to the Netherlands on his release

Van der Zwaan is a Dutch attorney for Skadden Arps who worked on a Ukrainian political analysis report for Paul Manafort in 2012.

He admitted to lying to special counsel investigators about when he last spoke with Rick Gates and Konstantin Kilimnik.

GUILTY: W. SAMUEL PATTEN

Pleaded guilty in August 2018 to failing to register as a lobbyist while doing work for a Ukrainian political party. Awaiting sentence

Patten, a long-time D.C. lobbyist was a business partner of Paul Manafort. He pleaded guilty to admitting to arranging an illegal $50,000 donation to Trump's inauguration.

He arranged for an American 'straw donor' to pay $50,000 to the inaugural committee, knowing that it was actually for a Ukrainian businessman.

Neither the American or the Ukrainian have been named.

CHARGED: KONSTANTIN KILIMNIK

Indicted for obstruction of justice and conspiracy to obstruct justice. At large, probably in Russia

Kilimnik is a former employee of Manafort's political consulting firm and helped him with lobbying work in Ukraine. He is accused of witness tampering, after he allegedly contacted individuals who had worked with Manafort to remind them that Manafort only performed lobbying work for them outside of the U.S.

He has been linked to Russian intelligence and is currently thought to be in Russia - effectively beyond the reach of extradition by Mueller's team.

INDICTED: THE RUSSIANS

Twenty-five Russian nationals and three Russian entities have been indicted for conspiracy to defraud the United States. They remain at large in Russia

Two of these Russian nationals were also indicted for conspiracy to commit wire fraud and 11 were indicted for conspiracy to launder money. Fifteen of them were also indicted for identity fraud.

Vladimir Putin has ridiculed the charges. Russia effectively bars extradition of its nationals. The only prospect Mueller has of bringing any in front of a U.S. jury is if Interpol has their names on an international stop list - which is not made public - and they set foot in a territory which extradites to the U.S.

INDICTED: MICHAEL FLYNN'S BUSINESS PARTNERS

Bijan Kian (left), number two in now disgraced former national security adviser Mike Flynn's lobbying company, and the two's business partner Ekim Alptekin (right) were indicted for conspiracy to lobby illegally. Kian is awaiting trial, Alptekin is still to appear in court

Kian, an Iranian-American was arrested and appeared in court charged with a conspiracy to illegally lobby the U.S government without registering as a foreign agent. Their co-conspirator was Flynn, who is called 'Person A' in the indictment and is not charged, offering some insight into what charges he escaped with his plea deal.

Kian, vice-president of Flynn's former lobbying firm, is alleged to have plotted with Alptekin to try to change U.S. policy on an exiled Turkish cleric, Fethullah Gulen, who lives in Pennsylvania and who is accused by Turkey's strongman president Recep Tayyip Erdogan, of trying to depose him.

Vice President Mike Pence tried to walk back one of President Trump's claims in an interview after four living U.S. presidents contradicted one of Trump's assertions about the border wall.

Pence was in the hot-seat when he was asked to back up the president's statement that some of his predecessors have told him they should have built a border wall. If true, it could have provided powerful ammunition in support of Trump's demand for a wall, which is at the heart of a government shutdown.

But all four living presidents have denied it ever happened - putting Pence in the difficult position of trying to carry out cleanup duty without contradicting the man who put him on the ticket.

IMPRESSIVE: Vice President Mike Pence was asked to defend President Trump's claim that former presidents have told him they regretted not building a border wall. He responded that that was Trump's 'impression'

'Which former presidents told President Trump, as he said, that he should've built a wall? All their representatives have denied that that was the case,' Pence got asked by interviewer Hallie Jackson in an interview that aired on NBC's 'Today' show Tuesday.

'Well, you, ...' Pence said, stalling for a few instants before exhaling.

'I know the president has said that that was his impression from previous administrations, previous presidents,' Pence tried to explain - substituting the word 'impression' for what Trump stated as fact.

Pence was asked point-blank which presidents told President Trump that they should have built a border wall

'I know I've seen clips of previous presidents talking about the importance of border security, the importance of addressing the issue of illegal immigration,' he continued.

Many past presidents have spoken about border security, something that was never in dispute.

'That's different from telling the president though, right?' responded Jackson.

'But look, honestly the American people want us to address this issue,' Pence continued.

Pence spoke on the eve of Trump's scheduled prime-time address to the nation, where he plans to push the case for his border wall, as well as what he claims is his legal right to declare an emergency and fund construction outside of the normal congressionally-authorized spending process.

His comments came after all four living former presidents said they didn't tell Trump they regretted not building a wall on the U.S. Mexico border.

Representatives for former presidents Barack Obama, George W. Bush, Bill Clinton and Jimmy Carter confirmed to The Washington Post that none of them said those words to Trump.

The president made the claim on Friday as he defended his decision to demand $5.6 billion to fund his border wall as the government shutdown continued.

Jimmy Carter said he did not talk to Trump about building a border wall, joining Bill Clinton in denying the was the former president who spoke about it

Barack Obama and George W. Bush have also denied it was them who spoke to Trump

'This should have been done by all of the presidents that preceded me,' Trump said during remarks in the Rose Garden last week. 'And they all know it. Some of them have told me that we should have done it.'

But none of the past living presidents said it was them.

On Monday, Carter became the latest to deny it, joining his former fellow past presidents.

'I have not discussed the border wall with President Trump, and do not support him on the issue,' Carter said in the statement issued through his Carter Center.

Eric Shultz, a spokesman for former president Barack Obama, pointed The Post to past remarks in which Obama spoke critically about the wall.

'Suggesting that we can build an endless wall along our borders, and blame our challenges on immigrants - that doesn't just run counter to our history as the world's melting pot; it contradicts the evidence that our growth and our innovation and our dynamism has always been spurred by our ability to attract strivers from every corner of the globe,' Obama said at Rutgers University in 2016. 'That's how we became America. Why would we want to stop it now?'

Bush spokesman Freddy Ford told Politico the former president had not discussed the matter with Trump.

A spokesperson for Clinton said he hadn't discussed with Trump either.

Clinton spokesman Angel Ureña said: 'He did not. In fact, they've not talked since the inauguration.'

President Trump - flanked by (from left) Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, Vice President Mike Pence, Republican Minority Whip Steve Scalise and Republican Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy - said Friday a former president advised him on the border wall

Trump has not had much interaction with his fellow presidents; he's seen here with Melania, Barack and Michelle Obama, Bill and Hillary Clinton, Jimmy and Rosslyn Carter, and George W. Bush at the late President George H.W. Bush's funeral

Trump has had little past interaction with his fellow members of the world's most exclusive club.

He attended former President George H.W. Bush's funeral with them but the atmosphere between the first couples was decidedly chilly.

Only the Obamas greeted Trump. Hillary Clinton, who lost to him in the 2016 presidential election, pointedly ignored him.

Trump also has a long record of exaggerations. The Post's fact checker noted he has made 7,600 false or misleading statements since he became president."
356,daily mail online,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-6523247/US-envoy-anti-IS-coalition-quits-Trumps-Syria-move.html,"WASHINGTON (AP) - Brett McGurk, the U.S. envoy to the global coalition fighting the Islamic State group, has resigned in protest over President Donald Trump's abrupt decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria, a U.S. official said, joining Defense Secretary Jim Mattis in an administration exodus of experienced national security figures.

Only 11 days ago, McGurk had said it would be ""reckless"" to consider IS defeated and therefore would be unwise to bring American forces home. McGurk decided to speed up his original plan to leave his post in mid-February.

Appointed to the post by President Barack Obama in 2015 and retained by Trump, McGurk said in his resignation letter that the militants were on the run, but not yet defeated, and that the premature pullout of American forces from Syria would create the conditions that gave rise to IS. He also cited gains in accelerating the campaign against IS, but that the work was not yet done.

His letter, submitted Friday to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, was described to The Associated Press on Saturday by an official familiar with its contents. The official was not authorized to publicly discuss the matter before the letter was released and spoke on condition of anonymity.

In a tweet shortly after news of McGurk's resignation broke, Trump again defended his decision to pull all of the roughly 2,000 U.S. forces from Syria in the coming weeks.

""We were originally going to be there for three months, and that was seven years ago - we never left,"" Trump tweeted. ""When I became President, ISIS was going wild. Now ISIS is largely defeated and other local countries, including Turkey, should be able to easily take care of whatever remains. We're coming home!""

Although the civil war in Syria has gone on since 2011, the U.S. did not begin launching airstrikes against IS until September 2014, and American troops did not go into Syria until 2015.

McGurk, whose resignation is effective Dec. 31, was planning to leave the job in mid-February after a U.S.-hosted meeting of foreign ministers from the coalition countries, but he felt he could continue no longer after Trump's decision to withdraw from Syria and Mattis' resignation, according to the official.

Trump declaration of a victory over IS has been roundly contradicted by his own experts' assessments, and his decision to pull troops out was widely denounced by members of Congress, who called his action rash and dangerous.

Mattis, perhaps the most respected foreign policy official in the administration, announced on Thursday that he will leave by the end of February. He told Trump in a letter that he was departing because ""you have a right to have a Secretary of Defense whose views are better aligned with yours.""

The withdrawal decision will fulfill Trump's goal of bringing troops home from Syria, but military leaders have pushed back for months, arguing that the IS group remains a threat and could regroup in Syria's long-running civil war. U.S. policy has been to keep troops in place until the extremists are eradicated.

Among officials' key concerns is that a U.S. pullout will leave U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces vulnerable to attacks by Turkey, the Syrian government and remaining IS fighters. The SDF, a Kurdish-led force, is America's only military partner in Syria

A second official said McGurk on Friday was pushing for the U.S. to allow the SDF to reach out to troops allied with Syrian President Bashar Assad's government for protection. McGurk argued that America had a moral obligation to help prevent the allied fighters from being slaughtered by Turkey, which considers the SDF an enemy.

McGurk said at a State Department briefing on Dec. 11 that ""it would be reckless if we were just to say, 'Well, the physical caliphate is defeated, so we can just leave now.' I think anyone who's looked at a conflict like this would agree with that.""

A week before that, Gen. Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the U.S. had a long way to go in training local Syrian forces to prevent a resurgence of IS and stabilize Syria. He said it would take 35,000 to 40,000 local troops in northeastern Syria to maintain security over the long term, but only about 20 percent of that number had been trained.

McGurk, 45, previously served as a deputy assistant secretary of state for Iraq and Iran, and during the negotiations for the landmark Iran nuclear deal by the Obama administration, led secret side talks with Tehran on the release of Americans imprisoned there.

McGurk, was briefly considered for the post of ambassador to Iraq after having served as a senior official covering Iraq and Afghanistan during President George W. Bush's administration.

A former Supreme Court law clerk to the late Chief Justice William Rehnquist, McGurk worked as a lawyer for the Coalition Provisional Authority in Iraq after the 2003 U.S.-led invasion and joined Bush's National Security Council staff, where in 2007 and 2008, he was the lead U.S. negotiator on security agreements with Iraq.

Taking over for now for McGurk will be his deputy, retired Lt. Gen. Terry Wolff, who served three tours of active duty in Iraq.

Jim Jeffrey, a veteran diplomat who was appointed special representative for Syria engagement in August, is expected to stay in his position, officials said.

IS militants still hold a string of villages and towns along the Euphrates River in eastern Syria, where they have resisted weeks of attacks by the U.S.-supported Syrian Democratic Forces to drive them out. The pocket is home to about 15,000 people, among them 2,000 IS fighters, according to U.S. military estimates.

But that figure could be as high as 8,000 militants, if fighters hiding out in the deserts south of the Euphrates River are also counted, according to according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which monitors the conflict through networks of local informants. Military officials have also made it clear that IS fighters fleeing Euphrates River region have found refuge in other areas of the country, fueling concerns that they could regroup and rise again.

The SDF said Thursday: ""The war against Islamic State has not ended and the group has not been defeated.""

357,daily mail online,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6531181/Reid-Hoffman-apologizes-giving-money-group-linked-fake-news-campaign-against-Roy-Moore.html,"Silicon Valley billionaire Reid Hoffman apologized on Wednesday for giving money to a pro-Democratic organization linked to spreading 'fake news' during last year's special election for the U.S. Senate seat from Alabama.

Hoffman, the co-founder of LinkedIn and an early investor in Facebook, released a statement acknowledging that he gave money to a group that spread disinformation during the contest between eventual winner Doug Jones, a Democrat, and Republican Roy Moore.

The group's campaign was alleged to have used social media to damage Moore's chances and help Jones, who won the race by 1.5 percentage points.

The tech mogul says that after the 2016 election, he donated large amounts of cash to organizations whose aim was to help get Democrats elected.

Hoffman says that he gave $750,000 to American Engagement Technologies, 'a group which sought to develop technical solutions to counteract fake news, bot armies, and other kinds of digital manipulation and disinformation,' he wrote on Medium.

AET then gave money to an organization called New Knowledge, a small cyber security company that investigated Russian trolling and hacking operations during the 2016 elections.

The company 'experimented with many of the tactics now understood to have influenced the 2016 elections,' according to an internal report obtained by The New York Times.

One of the disinformation tactics used was creating a Facebook page in which they posed as conservatives living in Alabama.

The members of this page would then promote a write-in candidate to try and divide the Republican vote and siphon votes from Moore.

It was also reported that during the campaign, thousands of so-called 'Russian' accounts on Twitter began following Moore.

'We orchestrated an elaborate ""false flag"" operation that planted the idea that the Moore campaign was amplified on social media by a Russian botnet,' the report said.

Jonathon Morgan, the CEO of New Knowledge, told the Times that the false flag operation 'does not ring a bell.'

He said the company's efforts in Alabama, dubbed 'Project Birmingham,' were 'a small experiment' aimed at examining how certain tactics worked.

'The research project was intended to help us understand how these kind of campaigns operated,' said Morgan.

'We thought it was useful to work in the context of a real election but design it to have almost no impact.'

It is unlikely that the disinformation campaign had any lasting impact on the race. The entire budget for the program was $100,000, while the total money spent in the race between the two candidates surpassed $51million.

Hoffman, who according to Forbes has a net worth of $1.5billion, says he now regrets giving money to AET.

'Through AET or otherwise, I have never personally authorized or directed any funding to New Knowledge,' he wrote.

'I - regretfully - do not know why AET chose to support New Knowledge or for what specific purposes, if any, this funding was allocated.

'To reiterate yet again, I find the tactics that have been recently reported highly disturbing.

'For that reason, I am embarrassed by my failure to track AET - the organization I did support - more diligently as it made its own decisions to perhaps fund projects that I would reject.'

The head of AET, Mikey Dickerson, who once worked for Google and the Obama administration, declined to comment.

Jones narrowly defeated Moore after a campaign filled with revelations of the Republican's alleged penchant for molesting underage girls when he was in his 30s.

A total of nine women came forward and accused Moore of either pursuing a relationship with them even though they were in their teens or initiating sexual contact.

Moore has denied the allegations.

Jones told Politico last week that he supports a federal investigation into the use of fake news to help sway the Alabama Senate race."
358,daily mail online,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6569121/Trump-says-fixing-economy-EASY-Fed-Reserve-hadnt-raised-rates.html,"President Donald Trump touted the nation's strong economy on Tuesday as the partial government shutdown hit day 18 and talks to reopen federal operations remain at a standstill.

But he also expressed longing for the kind of interest rates President Barack Obama had during his presidency when an economic recession resulted in nearly zero percent rates.

'Economic numbers looking REALLY good. Can you imagine if I had long term ZERO interest rates to play with like the past administration, rather than the rapidly raised normalized rates we have today. That would have been SO EASY! Still, markets up BIG since 2016 Election!,' he tweeted.

President Trump expressed longing for the kind of interest rates President Obama had

His tweet touted the economy

During the 2007-09 recession, the Federal Reserve kept interest rates unusually low to stimulate borrowing and risk-taking in a move to boost the sagging U.S. economy.

Trump indicated he could do the same if the Fed would give him similarly low numbers.

The president is said to fear the economy could slip into a recession ahead of the 2020 election and it could prove detrimental to his reelection efforts.

He's been critical of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, who has raised interest rates in the last four quarters.

And it remains to be seen how the U.S. economy will be effected by the shutdown, which is approaching the record for the longest in American history.

President Trump will address the nation from the Oval Office Tuesday night at 9 p.m. ET on the matter as he and Democrats remained head locked about funding for his border wall.

The president wants $5.6 billion while Democrats are holding firm at $1.3 billion.

Trump will seek to turn the narrative in his first primetime Oval Office address. He will argue America faces a humanitarian and security crisis.

Meanwhile, strong job numbers out on Friday blew past economist expectations for the largest monthly gain since February.

Employment increased by 312,000 jobs for the month, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics.

Interest rates were low during President Obama's tenure to try and help the U.S. economy recover from a global recession

Trump has been critical of Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell for raising rates

Stocks surged on the news and upon Powell's remarks Friday that the central bank will be patient in raising interest rates going forward.

'As always, there is no preset path for policy, ' Powell said at a forum in Atlanta. 'And particularly with muted inflation readings that we've seen coming in, we will be patient as we watch to see how the economy evolves.'

Powell also said he would not resign if Trump asked him to.

The Fed recently cut its forecast for 2019's economic growth down to 2.3 percent from 2.5 percent amid concerns about the stock market correction and trade talks between China and the U.S.

Powell has insisted the economy will stay in healthy range of growth.

'Unemployment has been under 4 percent for nine months now. We have inflation under control. I think that's a pretty good outcome, and we sure think it can continue,' he said."
359,daily mail online,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6569257/Networks-air-Democratic-response-Trumps-border-wall-speech.html,"By David Martosko, U.s. Political Editor For Dailymail.com and Wires

At least three television networks have bowed to pressure from Democrats and agreed to air a response to President Donald Trump's Oval Office address about what the White House says is a 'humanitarian crisis' on America's southern border.

CNN, NBC and CBC have committed to the gesture, only the second of its kind for a presidential speech other than an address to a joint session of Congress.

TV networks allowed Republicans to respond in 2011 to President Barack Obama's speech about the merits of raising the federal debt limit. Then-House speaker John Boehner delivered that counterpoint.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and top Senate Democrat Chuck Schumer demanded equal time on Monday after Trump said he would address the nation Tuesday night about the federal government's partial shutdown, triggered by a stalemate over funding for a border wall.

'Now that the television networks have decided to air the President's address, which if his past statements are any indication will be full of malice and misinformation, Democrats must immediately be given equal airtime,' they wrote in a joint statement released Monday night.

It's unclear who will carry the Democrats' message on TV after the president is finished speaking.

With no breakthrough in sight, Trump will argue his case to the nation Tuesday night that a 'crisis' at the U.S.-Mexico border requires the long and invulnerable wall he's demanding before ending the partial government shutdown

CNN's media reporter confirmed his network's decision, and that of CBS and NBC, to air a Democratic Party response after Trump's speech on Tuesday

With no breakthrough in sight, Trump will make his case that a 'crisis' at the U.S.-Mexico border requires the long and invulnerable wall he's demanding before the government's shuttered agencies can reopen.

Hundreds of thousands of federal workers face missed paychecks Friday as the shutdown drags through a third week.

'There is a humanitarian and national security crisis,' Vice President Mike Pence told reporters Monday as it's feared Trump will declare a national emergency that would empower him to construct the $5.6billion border wall without congressional approval. Pence said the White House counsel's office is looking at the idea.

Trump's Oval Office speech - his first as president - will be followed by his visit Thursday to the southern border to highlight his demand for a barrier.

White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders tweeted that he will use the visit to 'meet with those on the front lines of the national security and humanitarian crisis'.

Such a move would certainly draw legal challenges, and Trump - who told lawmakers he would be willing to keep the government closed for months or ever years - has said he would like to continue negotiations for now.

Trump's prime-time address will be carried live by ABC, CBS, CNN, Fox Broadcasting, Fox News Channel, Fox Business Network, MSNBC and NBC.

As Trump's speech and border visit were announced, newly empowered House Democrats - and at least a few Republican senators - stepped up pressure on GOP lawmakers to reopen the government without giving in to the president's demands.

The closure, which has lasted 17 days, is already the second-longest in history and would become the longest this weekend.

Leaning on Senate Republicans, some of whom are growing anxious about the impact of the shutdown, Pelosi said the House would begin passing individual bills this week that would reopen federal agencies, starting with the Treasury Department to ensure Americans receive their tax refunds.

White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders confirmed the president will visit the southern border on Thursday as the partial government shutdown was on its third week

The White House moved to pre-empt the Democrats, telling reporters Monday that tax refunds would be paid despite the shutdown.

That shutdown exemption would break from the practice of earlier administrations and could be challenged.

'There is an indefinite appropriation to pay tax refunds. As a result ... the refunds will go out as normal,' said Russell Vought, acting director of the White House budget office.

There were other signs that administration was working to control the damage from the shutdown, which has furloughed 380,000 federal workers and forced another 420,000 to work without pay.

The National Park Service said it was dipping into entrance fees to pay for staffing at some highly visited parks to maintain restrooms, clean up trash and patrol the grounds, after reports of human waste and garbage overflowing in some spots.

Over the weekend, the federal agency tasked with guaranteeing U.S. airport security acknowledged an increase in the number of its employees missing work or calling in sick.

But Trump and the Transportation Security Administration pushed back on any suggestion that the call-outs at the agency represented a 'sickout' that was having a significant effect on U.S. air travel.

TSA said it screened more than 2.2 million passengers Sunday, a historically busy day due to holiday travel.

Ninety percent waited less than 15 minutes, the agency said.

'We are grateful to the more than 51,000 agents across the country who remain focused on the mission and are respectful to the traveling public,' said TSA spokesman Michael Bilello.

The talks over ending the shutdown have been at an impasse over Trump's demand for the wall.

He has offered to build the barrier with steel rather than concrete, billing that as a concession to Democrats' objections.

They 'don't like concrete, so we'll give them steel,' he said.

But Democrats have made clear that they object to the wall itself, not how it's constructed.

They see it as immoral and ineffective and prefer other types of border security funded at already agreed-upon levels.

'Maybe he thinks he can bully us. But I'm from Brooklyn. You let a bully succeed, you'll be bullied again worse,' Schumer said at a breakfast with the Association for a Better New York.

At the White House, spokeswoman Mercedes Schlapp complained that Democratic leaders have yet to define what they mean when they say they are for enhancing border security.

'Democrats want to secure the border? Great. Come to the table,' she said Monday.

'We are willing to come to a deal to reopen the government.'

Trump has tasked Pence during the shutdown fight to negotiate with Democrats, including during talks over the weekend with Democratic staffers.

But the Vice President is increasingly being called upon to prevent defections in the GOP ranks.

Asked whether cracks were forming between the White House and Republicans eager for the shutdown to end, Pence told reporters, 'We've been in touch with those members and others.'

He said that he and Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen would be at the Capitol Tuesday and Wednesday to brief lawmakers.

Among the Republicans expressing concern was Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, who said Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell should take up funding bills from the Democratic-led House.

'Let's get those reopened while the negotiations continue,' Collins said Sunday on NBC's Meet the Press.

However, McConnell has said he won't take up funding bills without Trump's support.

Adding to concerns of lawmakers, federal workers who are still on the job apparently will miss this week's paychecks.

Acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney said on NBC's 'Meet the Press' that if the shutdown continues into Tuesday, 'then payroll will not go out as originally planned on Friday night."

Kilmeade skewered Sanders Friday following Pentagon chief James Mattis' stunning resignation, saying Trump had 're-founded ISIS' by bucking Mattis and other military brass and announcing a troop withdrawal.

Sanders appeared on the program Friday amid reverberations from Mattis' harsh resignation letter, which defended U.S. alliances and split with Trump following his sudden announcement of a pullout of U.S. troops from Syria.

Kilmeade could be seen shifting in his chair in what started out as a softball interview with Sanders, who was out to defend the embattled Trump Whitehouse amid a looming government shutdown.

'Sarah, he is giving Russia a big win. Vladimir Putin praised him. He also is doing exactly what he criticized president Obama for doing,' Kilmeade pounced on the president's favorite morning program.

White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said ISIS is '99 per cent' defeated in Syria, days after President Trump declared victory. She was challenged on Fox News after the resignation of Defense secretary James Mattis

Referring to Trump, Kilmead said: 'He said president Obama is the founder of ISIS. He just re-founded ISIS because they got 30,000 men there and they are already striking back with our would-be evacuation,' Kilmeade continued. 'The president is really on the griddle with this,' he added.

'Brian, I have to respectfully and vehemently disagree with you,' Sanders pushed back. 'The idea that the president has had anything to do with helping ISIS reemerge is absolutely outrageous,' she countered.

Then Kilmeade, who wrote a book on Andrew Jackson and the battle of New Orleans, interjected: 'Leaving is helping. Leaving is helping,' echoing concerns inside the pentagon that the removal of 2,000 U.S. forces could provide relief to ISIS, while leaving Russia and Iran in power positions.

'Sarah, he is giving Russia a big win. Vladimir Putin praised him. He also is doing exactly what he criticized president Obama for doing,' host Brian Kilmeade told Sanders

Sanders stood for an interview with Fox after Pentagon chief Mattis flamed Trump in his resignation letter, and Republican lawmakers publicly stood with the Defense secretary

Sanders responded that Trump 'has put so much emphasis on rebuilding the strongest military on the face of the planet. If ISIS wants to pick a fight with somebody, they sure as heck don't want to pick one with Donald Trump. Because he will destroy them and defeat them,' she said.

'And he's has made that extremely clear. We have wiped out 99% of ISIS in Syria. The president doesn't want to be in the middle of a civil war in the Middle East and continue to put American lives on the line.'

Kilmeade interjected again,' saying 'The word on the ground is different from what you just said,' in a reference to the 30,000 ISIS fighters the Pentagon estimates remain in Iraq and Syria.

'If we need to fight ISIS again the president is not afraid to do that,' Sanders countered.

Co-host Ainsley Earhardt quickly cut off the interview. 'All right, Sarah. Thank you so much. We wish you a very, very merry Christmas,' she said."
362,bbc news,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-46792676,"US President Donald Trump is set to argue that an immigration ""crisis"" requires his long-promised wall along the Mexican border.

Mr Trump will make his case in his first speech from the Oval Office at 21:00EST (0200 GMT Wednesday), ahead of a trip to the border on Thursday.

A partial government shutdown has been in effect for 17 days after lawmakers failed to break a budget impasse.

The president is insisting that $5bn (£4bn) be included for the border wall.

The decision by the major US TV networks to set aside at least eight minutes of airtime for the speech has sparked controversy and fuelled debate on social media.

Critics pointed out that the networks aired President George W. Bush's prime-time address on immigration in 2006, but did not air one by President Barack Obama in 2014.

Democratic leaders in the House and Senate released a joint statement saying the speech would be misleading and demanding airtime to counter Mr Trump's arguments.

""Now that the television networks have decided to air the President's address, which if his past statements are any indication will be full of malice and misinformation, Democrats must immediately be given equal airtime,"" their statement read.

The partial government shutdown, which began on 22 December, has affected 25% of the government. Some 800,000 federal employees have been temporarily laid off - or forced to work without pay.

While its repercussions ripple across the country, Mr Trump has also threatened to bypass Congress and invoke emergency powers to build the wall along half the 2,000-mile (3,100km) border.

White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said in a tweet that Mr Trump would use his visit to the border on Thursday to ""meet with those on the front lines of the national security and humanitarian crisis"".

Curbing illegal immigration was one of the main campaign promises Mr Trump made when he ran for president.

During the campaign for the midterm elections in November, he repeatedly agitated over a caravan of Central American migrants making its way towards the US border with Mexico.

Mr Trump deployed about 5,800 troops to the border and described the migrants as an ""invasion""."
363,bbc news,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-middle-east-46792329,"Turkey's president has strongly rejected US calls for his country to protect Kurdish fighters in Syria.

President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said such statements made by US National Security Adviser John Bolton at the weekend were ""unacceptable"".

Mr Bolton is in Turkey to seek guarantees that Kurds fighting Islamic State (IS) in northern Syria will be safe after a planned US pullout.

Turkey regards the Kurdish YPG militia fighting IS militants as terrorists.

On Tuesday Mr Erdogan told MPs from his AK Party that Turkey could not ""accept and swallow"" Mr Bolton's message.

He added that the Americans did not know who the YPG and other Kurdish groups were. ""If the US evaluates them as 'Kurdish brothers' then they are in a serious delusion,"" Mr Erdogan said.

Last month US President Donald Trump shocked allies and faced criticism at home when he announced the withdrawal of US forces from Syria, saying that IS had been ""defeated"".

But over the weekend, at the start of his visit to Israel and Turkey, Mr Bolton said the pullout depended on certain conditions.

The US needed to ensure that the Kurdish fighters were safe and that remnants of IS were defeated, he said.

The YPG is the main component of the Syria Democratic Forces (SDF), a US-backed group that is credited with playing a major role in the fight against IS.

Analysis by Selin Girit, BBC News, Istanbul

US-Turkish talks in Ankara over the withdrawal of US troops from Syria were expected to be tense after Mr Bolton's comments about the YPG. But no-one really contemplated that President Erdogan would speak in such blunt terms.

Mr Erdogan said it was impossible to swallow Mr Bolton's comments suggesting that Turkey should agree to protect YPG forces as a pre-condition to the withdrawal.

He said Turkey would do whatever it takes to kill terrorists, adding that an operation in the Kurdish controlled area in northern Syria would take place soon.

Ankara sees the YPG as a national security threat. But Washington wants to reassure the Kurds over the Turkish threat, so they don't feel obliged to cosy up to Russia.

The US national security adviser met a spokesman for Mr Erdogan, Ibrahim Kalin, on Tuesday morning, to discuss how the planned US withdrawal could take place.

A news briefing was cancelled without explanation.

During his visit to Israel on Sunday, Mr Bolton said: ""We don't think the Turks ought to undertake military action that is not fully co-ordinated with, and agreed to by, the United States at a minimum so they don't endanger our troops, but also so that they meet the president's requirement that the Syrian opposition forces that have fought with us are not endangered.""

He told reporters there was no timetable for a withdrawal but that there was not an unlimited commitment.

Some 2,000 US military personnel are reported to be in northern Syria. American ground troops first became involved in the country in autumn 2015 when then-President Barack Obama sent in a small number of special forces to train and advise local Kurdish fighters who were fighting IS.

The US did this reluctantly after several attempts at arming anti-IS groups had descended into chaos.

Over the intervening years the number of US troops in Syria has increased, and a network of bases and airfields has been established in an arc across the north-eastern part of the country."

After many years they are coming home. We also discussed heavily expanded Trade,' he tweeted on Sunday.

His move comes as some lawmakers from his own Republican Party were critical of his decision to pull the 2,000 U.S. troops out of Syria.

'Why are you still there?' Turkish President Recep Erdogan asked President Trump during a call where Trump ditched a script and ended up promising a withdrawal from Syria

'We were going to leave Syria. But to leave it when you're within a couple of months of doing something that is very important in the fight against ISIS and the president knows that, and we pull - jerk the rug out from under two months in advance, that's hard to understand,' outgoing Republican Sen. Bob Corker said on CNN's 'State of the Union' on Sunday.

Corker has been one of the biggest Republican critics of the president's decision. He was at the White House on Thursday, waiting to meet with Trump on the issue, when the president abruptly canceled the meeting before Corker could see him.

The senator, who is chair of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said he thinks Trump realizes he made a mistake with his Syria decision.

'I think he knows that he has made a mistake. I do. The president's tendencies are to dig in and double down even if he knows he did something incorrect. I don't think he wanted to talk about Syria that day and so the meeting was called off. And in a that's what happened,' Corker said.

Republican congresswoman Liz Cheney said the decision would hand a victory to ISIS.

'I think he knows that he has made a mistake,' GOP Sen. Bob Corker said of Trump's decision on Syria

'I am deeply, deeply concerned and I oppose strongly the president's decision apparently to withdraw troops from Syria. The apparent decision that- that we're now going to be looking at withdrawing troops from Afghanistan,' she said Sunday on CBS' 'Face the Nation.'

'These two decisions would be disastrous. They would really, in many ways, hand the victories to our enemies to Iran, to ISIS in Syria, the Taliban, al-Qaeda in Afghanistan. It's a very dangerous path to go down and we shouldn't be going down it. We ought to make sure that we keep our troops there in order to prevent the establishment of safe havens from those groups that want to attack us.'

But hardline Republican Sen. Rand Paul applauded the president's move.

'I'm very proud of the president. This is exactly what he promised. And I think the people agree with him, actually. I think people believe we've been at war too long in too many places and we do need to turn attention to problems we have at home here. Roads, bridges, schools,' he said on CNN's 'State of the Union.'

And French President Emmanuel Macron on Sunday criticized Trump's decision, saying 'an ally must be reliable'.

But acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney said there was little chance the president would change his mind.

'No, I think the president has told people from the very beginning that he doesn't want us to stay in Syria forever. You're seeing the end result now of two years worth of work,' he said on ABC's 'This Week.'

Trump shocked lawmakers on Capitol Hill and foreign allies last week when he announced plans to remove troops from Syria, where they have been helping coordinate a multinational fight against ISIS.

Turkey applauded the move.

Trump's decision came after a private call with the hard-line president of Turkey where the president ditched a script crafted by his aides and was told allies fighting alongside the U.S. were terrorists.

French President Emmanuel Macron criticized Trump's decision, saying 'an ally must be reliable'.

But Republican Sen. Rand Paul backed Trump's decision in an interview with CNN's Jake Tapper

The fateful call occurred Friday, according to multiple press accounts, just as Turkey's President Recep Erdogan publicly saber-rattling about a campaign to wipe out U.S.-allied Turkish forces in northeastern Syria.

The U.S. has relied on Kurdish fighters in Iraq and Syria to take out ISIS elements in a multi-year military campaign that Trump cheered on Twitter Friday.

On the call, Erdogan was able to seize control of the conversation by pointing to U.S. military success, saying the U.S. had already defeated 99 per cent of ISIS.

When he asked Trump 'Why are you still there?', it prompted Trump to pass on the query to his own security advisor, John Bolton, who was monitoring the call.

Sources on the call said Trump 'quickly capitulated' and yielded to Erdogan's withdrawal demand, the Associated Press reported.

Trump has swiped at critics of his decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria by saying if anyone else brought soldiers home they would be branded a 'hero'.

In a series of fiery tweets Saturday night, the president also dismissed the top U.S. envoy in the fight against ISIS as an 'Obama appointee' who he claimed he did not know.

Trump launched a tirade on Twitter (pictured) against top US officials who resigned within days of each other after they disagreed with his decision to pull troops out of Syria

Earlier Saturday, Special Presidential Envoy for the Global Coalition to Counter ISIL Brett McGurk announced his resignation in the wake of Trump's decision to pull troops out of Syria and just days after Mattis's announced departure.

McGurk was to leave the role in February but moved up his departure date by two months to December 31 after very publicly stating that the move to pull American forces at this time could result in a 'possibly catastrophic outcome'.

Responding to the news , Trump tweeted: 'Brett McGurk, who I do not know, was appointed by President Obama in 2015.

'Was supposed to leave in February but he just resigned prior to leaving. Grandstander? The Fake News is making such a big deal about this nothing event!.

'If anybody but your favorite President, Donald J. Trump, announced that, after decimating ISIS in Syria, we were going to bring our troops back home (happy & healthy), that person would be the most popular hero in America. With me, hit hard instead by the Fake News Media. Crazy!

The veteran diplomat, who got his start in the administration of George W. Bush and was appointed to his current post by Barack Obama, now joins Mattis in an administration exodus of experienced national security officials.

Trump also fired a parting shot at Mattis, the most respected foreign policy official in the administration who will leave by the end of February.

He tweeted: 'When President Obama ingloriously fired Jim Mattis, I gave him a second chance.

'Some thought I shouldn't, I thought I should. Interesting relationship-but I also gave all of the resources that he never really had. Allies are very important-but not when they take advantage of U.S'.

A new trade treaty among 11 nations that doesn't include the United States leaves worried American farmers to face significantly stiffer international tariffs than their competition.

The new Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership (CPTPP) treaty goes into effect Sunday. It will slash tariffs across much of the Pacific rim region -- but not for the U.S. since Trump administration officials pulled out of negotiations last year.

Investment bank HSBC said in a statement that 90 percent of tariffs on goods in the first six countries -- Canada, Japan, Australia, New Zealand, Mexico and Singapore -- will immediately be removed in the first round of cuts, Reuters reported.

Cuts will also be implemented in Vietnam, Brunei, Chile, Malaysia and Peru in early 2019. Japan has also worked out a similar tariff deal with the European Union that will go into effect Feb. 1, according to CNN.

The treaty is expected to hit American wheat farmers particularly hard as tariffs on wheat from Canada and Australia will immediately drop seven percent. By April, tariffs on wheat from those nations will be cut 12 percent.

""Our competitors in Australia and Canada will now benefit from those provisions as U.S. farmers watch helplessly,"" U.S. Wheat Associates President Vince Peterson said at a hearing held earlier this month by the U.S. Trade Representative.

""Japan is generally a market where we seek to maintain our strong 53 percent market share, but [now] we face an imminent collapse,"" he said.

Officials representing Tyson's pork, Welch's grape juice, the California almond industry and American beef industry, among others, have also complained that they face major losses as the U.S. misses out on the treaty benefits, reports CNN.

American farmers are already struggling with significant sales decreases to China amid the current trade war, and are being bailed out with billions of dollars in taxpayer subsidies.

The Obama administration had hoped to win similar concessions for American producers when officials began negotiating the Trans-Pacific Partnership. But President Donald Trump shut down the negotiations for TPP -- which he termed a ""disaster"" for American workers and producers -- in favor of a strategy of working out one-on-one agreements. That approach resulted in a trade war with China.

Trump, meanwhile, tweeted Saturday that he spoke on the phone with Chinese President Xi and ""big progress"" was made in trade talks, but he provided no other details.

Chinese state media confirmed that Trump and Xi spoke, and quoted Xi as saying that teams from both sides are working to forge an agreement."

The one-day event was organized by the School of Public Affairs at American University and billed as a chance to engage in free learning and networking opportunities.

But for many of the 550 people who signed up, it was a welcome opportunity to tackle the boredom and stress they have been facing since a budgetary impasse over a border wall sought by President Donald Trump but opposed by Democrats forced the partial closure of the government on December 22.

Some 800,000 workers have been affected, forced either to stay at home or work without pay until the government is funded.

""I do childcare for my daughter, take care of the house making dinner, the laundry,"" he said of the three weeks he has now spent at home.

For Matthew Garlipp, who lives in the capital Washington and works for the Treasury Department, there has been one major upside: ""My dog really appreciates the extra time with me!""

But, he continued: ""The point of being here is pretty much to have something to put on the schedule.""

""It's a beautiful opportunity to get out of the apartment, learn a little bit,"" the 28-year-old added.

""I'd just like to get back to work.""

Behind the boredom and the jokes, however, there is a real fear about the financial consequences of the shutdown, which has deprived them of their salaries as the bills pile up.

She considers herself ""lucky"" because her husband doesn't work in the public sector and they can manage for the moment on one salary.

If things continue much longer, she said, ""We'll have to spend our savings to cover our mortgage and childcare costs.""

Melinda Batson, a 44-year-old single mother who works for the Food and Drug Administration, is something of a veteran of shutdowns: her first was in 2013 and lasted 16 days, under the administration of former president Barack Obama.

""I would be a fool to say I'm not worried,"" she said. ""I have spoken to my landlord and credit card companies, so far they have been lenient, but again you are still obligated to pay what you owe.""

On Tuesday, she participated in a ""workplace mindfulness"" class. ""It is really helpful to deal with my emotions as it is a situation out of my control... I know one day I will go back to work, the problem is when.""

The situation could even begin to turn people away from public service, said Vicky Wilkins, spokeswoman for the School of Public Affairs.

Cooped up in the White House after canceling a vacation to his private Florida club, President Donald Trump fired Twitter barbs at Democrats on Saturday as talks to end a weeklong partial government shutdown remained at a stalemate.

Trump took to his Twitter on Saturday night to blast the Russia probe, boldly claiming that the only collusion has occurred with Hillary and the Democrats.

'""Absolutely nothing"" (on Russian Collusion). Kimberley Strassel, The Wall Street Journal,' he said in the first of the tweets. 'The Russian Collusion fabrication is the greatest Hoax in the history of American politics. The only Russian Collusion was with Hillary and the Democrats!'

As the disruption in federal services and public employees' pay appeared set to continue into the new year, there were no signs of any substantive negotiation between the blame-trading parties. Trump held out for billions in federal funds for a border wall between the U.S. and Mexico, which Democrats have said they were intent on blocking.

Trump tweeted Saturday that he was 'in the White House waiting for the Democrats to come on over and make a deal on Border Security.' But there has been little direct contact between the sides during the stalemate, and Trump did not ask Republicans, who hold a monopoly on power in Washington for another five days, to keep Congress in session.

As he called for Democrats to negotiate on the wall, Trump brushed off criticism that his administration bore any responsibility for the recent deaths of two migrant children in Border Patrol custody.

Trump claimed the deaths were 'strictly the fault of the Democrats and their pathetic immigration policies that allow people to make the long trek thinking they can enter our country illegally.' His comments on Twitter came as his Homeland Security secretary met with medical professionals and ordered policy changes meant to better protect children detained at the border.

Trump earlier had upped the brinkmanship by threatening anew to close the border with Mexico to press Congress to cave to his demand for money to pay for a wall. Democrats are vowing to pass legislation restoring the government as soon as they take control of the House on Thursday, but that won't accomplish anything unless Trump and the Republican-controlled Senate go along with it.

Talks have been at a stalemate for more than a week, after Democrats said the White House offered to accept $2.5 billion for border security last Saturday. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer told Vice President Mike Pence that it wasn't acceptable, nor was it guaranteed that Trump, under intense pressure from his conservative base to fulfill his signature campaign promise, would settle for that amount.

Trump has remained out of the public eye since returning to the White House early Thursday from a 29-hour visit to U.S. troops in Iraq, instead taking to Twitter to attack Democrats. He also moved to defend himself from criticism that he couldn't deliver on the wall while the GOP controlled both the House and Senate.

'For those that naively ask why didn't the Republicans get approval to build the Wall over the last year, it is because IN THE SENATE WE NEED 10 DEMOCRAT VOTES, and they will gives us 'NONE' for Border Security!,' he tweeted. 'Now we have to do it the hard way, with a Shutdown.'

Meanwhile, the effects to the public of the impasse grew as the Environmental Protection Agency, which had the money to function a week longer than some agencies, implemented its shutdown plan at midnight Friday night. EPA spokeswoman Molly Block said many of the agency's 14,000 employees were being furloughed, while disaster-response teams and certain other employees deemed essential would stay on the job. That includes workers needed for preventing immediate public health threats at more than 800 Superfund hazardous-waste sites.

Also running short on money: the Smithsonian Institution, which said its museums, art galleries and zoo in the capital will close starting midweek if the partial shutdown drags on.

The shutdown is forcing hundreds of thousands of federal workers and contractors to stay home or work without pay

But federal flood insurance policies will continue to be issued and renewed, in a reversal prompted by pressure from lawmakers, said Republican Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida.

Trump appeared no closer to securing money for his signature border wall, which he vowed during the campaign that he would make Mexico pay for. He's failed to do so. Now Democratic leaders are adamant that they will not authorize money for the project, calling it wasteful and ineffective. They show no signs of bending, either.

The shutdown is forcing hundreds of thousands of federal workers and contractors to stay home or work without pay.

The White House has not directly engaged in weeks with the House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi, who has all but locked up the support she needs to win the speaker's gavel after the new Congress convenes on Thursday.

Pelosi has vowed to pass legislation to reopen the nine shuttered departments and dozens of agencies now hit by the partial shutdown as soon as she takes the gavel.

Pelosi spokesman Drew Hammill added that Democrats are united against the wall and won't seriously consider any White House offer unless Trump backs it publicly because he 'has changed his position so many times.'"
368,daily mail online,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/aap/article-6539205/Landmark-TPP-11-pact-goes-effect.html,"Malcolm Turnbull has taken a small victory lap as a landmark trade deal between Australia and five other countries has gone into effect.

The TPP-11, a revamped version of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, went into force at 12am on Sunday for Australia, New Zealand, Canada, Japan, Mexico and Singapore, slashing tariffs across much of the Asia-Pacific region.

Vietnam will follow on January 14, while Brunei, Chile, Malaysia and Peru will begin 60 days after they complete their ratification process.

Turnbull on Saturday posted a picture of himself with Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and their spouses by the Sydney Harbour Bridge, apparently taken from Kirribilli House.

Turnbull wrote that nearly two years ago in Sydney he and Abe determined to keep the TPP alive after Donald Trump pulled out.

At the time time most analysts and headline-writers were declaring the trade deal dead without US participation, but the other nations resurrected it.

Turnbull thanked Abe, Singapore Prime Minister Lee Hsien Loong, New Zealand Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern ""& other TPP-11 leaders for defying the dead end of protectionism! More trade means more jobs.""

In a follow up tweet Turnbull thanked then-New Zealand prime minister John Key as a strong voice for keeping TPP on track, pointedly failing to mention Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau.

Replying to Turnbull, a Canadian reporter mentioned how Australian officials were reportedly ""gobsmacked"" by Canada's behaviour after their delegation skipped a planned meeting with other TPP members on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific Economic Forum on Vietnam.

""Let's just say there were varying degrees of enthusiasm for TPP-11 in terms of constancy and intensity,"" Turnbull said in reply. ""But we got it done, despite the doomsayers.""

Across the Ditch, New Zealand Trade Minister David Parker lauded the agreement for giving New Zealand access to markets in Japan, Canada and Mexico,.

""The CPTPP has the potential to deliver an estimated NZ$222 million (A$211.5m) of tariff savings to New Zealand exporters annually once it is fully in force.""

Investment bank HSBC said in a press release that 90 per cent of tariffs on goods in the first six countries were removed on Sunday in the first round of cuts.

American wheat and beef producers have been particularly unhappy about being left out of the deal, expecting Australian and Canadian farmers to use their TPP advantage to sell more to Japan.

""Japan is generally a market where we seek to maintain our strong 53 per cent market share, but today we face an imminent collapse,"" US Wheat Associates President Vince Peterson told a public hearing held by the US Trade Representative earlier this month.

""Frankly, this is because of provisions negotiated by (former US president Barack Obama's administration) for our benefit under the Trans-Pacific Partnership.

""Our competitors in Australia and Canada will now benefit from those provisions, as US farmers watch helplessly.""

US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Colombian President Ivan Duque discussed Wednesday how to help restore democratic rule to crisis-wracked Venezuela and reject its ""dictatorship.""

Pompeo followed up a trip to Brazil to meet with new far right President Jair Bolsonaro with a visit to Colombia for talks on the migrant exodus from neighboring Venezuela, and its regime led by President Nicolas Maduro.

""Our conversations today covered how we can collaborate with regional and international partners to help those fleeing and help Venezuelans recover their democratic heritage,"" Pompeo said from the Caribbean city of Cartagena.

He described Colombia as ""a natural leader on regional efforts to support democracy and the rule of law in Venezuela,"" its neighbor.

Right-wing Duque, who succeeded Juan Manuel Santos in August, said that ""all the countries that share the value of democracy should unite to reject the Venezuelan dictatorship and do everything necessary to restore democracy and constitutional order.""

Pompeo praised Colombia for its support of the one million Venezuelans that have crossed the border and ""fled the crisis caused by the Maduro regime's authoritarian misrule.""

According to the United Nations, 2.3 million Venezuelans have escaped poverty and economic meltdown since 2015 as those who remain face shortages of basic necessities such as food and medicine, as well as failing public services, including water, electricity and transport.

Pompeo said the US has dedicated almost $92 million in aid to help Colombia deal with its influx of Venezuelan migrants.

During his visit to Brazil, Pompeo agreed with his Peruvian and Brazilian counterparts to increase the pressure on Maduro, with Venezuela's government reacting by decrying interference.

Maduro will begin his second mandate as president on January 10, although the result of last year's election was branded a fraud by the US, European Union and Organization of American States.

Relations between Bogota and Caracas have been tense since Duque came to power.

Maduro has accused Colombia and Brazil of collaborating with Washington to overthrow and assassinate him, although both neighboring South American countries have dismissed any suggestions of a military intervention.

US President Donald Trump has ramped up sanctions against the Maduro regime since succeeding Barack Obama."
370,daily mail online,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-6523245/Top-US-envoy-fight-against-IS-group-resigns-official.html,"Brett McGurk reportedly said in his resignation letter that IS militants had not been defeated, and that pulling out US troops could result in the jihadists regaining strength

Brett McGurk, the special US envoy to the coalition fighting the Islamic State group, has resigned, a State Department official said Saturday.

His resignation, effective December 31, comes just after Donald Trump abruptly ordered the withdrawal of US troops from Syria as well as the announcement that Defense Secretary Jim Mattis was quitting, citing key disagreements with the US president.

Just last week McGurk, a Barack Obama appointee who Trump kept on, said ""nobody is declaring a mission accomplished"" in the battle against IS -- just days before the president's stunning announcement of victory against the jihadist movement.

Trump -- who postponed his holiday vacation as failed budget talks triggered a partial US government shutdown -- again on Saturday said ""ISIS is largely defeated.""

""When I became President, ISIS was going wild,"" the president tweeted. ""Now ISIS is largely defeated and other local countries, including Turkey, should be able to easily take care of whatever remains. We're coming home!""

McGurk reportedly said in his resignation letter that IS militants were in fact not defeated, and that prematurely withdrawing US troops could foster conditions allowing the jihadists to amass power in the region once more.

The 45-year-old top envoy was set to leave his position in February, but reportedly felt he could no longer continue in the job after Trump's declaration.

The news capped a chaotic week that saw Mattis -- seen as a voice of moderation in the mercurial Trump White House -- quit after telling the president he could not go along with the Syria decision.

The troop pullout will leave thousands of Kurdish fighters -- which the Pentagon spent years training and arming against IS -- vulnerable to Turkish attack.

""It would be reckless if we were just to say, 'Well, the physical caliphate is defeated, so we can just leave now,'"" McGurk had told journalists earlier this month.

""I think anyone who's looked at a conflict like this would agree with that.""

- 'Complete reversal of policy' -

McGurk has served as the US envoy to the Global Coalition to Defeat ISIS, another acronym for the jihadist group, since 2015.

He also served as the deputy assistant secretary of state for Iraq and Iran, and worked under Republican George W. Bush as a senior official on Iraq and Afghanistan.

In an email announcing his decision to his colleagues obtained by The New York Times, McGurk called Trump's move ""a shock"" and ""a complete reversal of policy that was articulated to us.""

""It left our coalition partners confused and our fighting partners bewildered,"" he said, according to the paper.

""I worked this week to help manage some of the fallout but -- as many of you heard in my meetings and phone calls -- I ultimately concluded that I could not carry out these new instructions and maintain my integrity.""

In addition to the Syria decision, Trump blindsided politicians and international allies with plans to slash troop numbers in Afghanistan.

The momentous reversal of years of US foreign policy will leave the war-torn regions at risk of continued and potentially heightened bloodshed.

Heavyweight adviser Mattis -- a decorated Marine general often referred to as ""the last adult in the room"" -- made clear in his resignation letter that pulling out of Syria crossed the line.

The departures of Mattis and now McGurk follow those of National Security Advisor H.R. McMaster and White House chief of staff John Kelly -- leaving Trump, who has no political, diplomatic or military experience, increasingly alone.

On Friday White House press secretary Sarah Sanders dismissed concerns over the slew of resignations and Trump's isolation.

""At the end of the day, the American people elected one person to be the commander-in-chief,"" she said.

""And at the end of the day, he makes the decision,"" Sanders said. ""That's what he was elected to do."""
371,the huffington post,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-cabinet-meeting_us_5c2d2363e4b08aaf7a958218,"President Donald Trump ranted about immigrants, attractive generals, the difficulty of being president and more on Wednesday in his first televised appearance of the year.

In a rambling and often disjointed conversation, the president led reporters and members of his Cabinet through his thinking on issues ranging from immigration to military strategy to the very role of the presidency.

Here are some of the standout moments from the over 90-minute meeting:

That number is about three times greater than experts' estimates. Pew Research Center estimated there were 10.7 million undocumented immigrants in the U.S. as of 2016.

In one extended rant, Trump put forth his theory that Afghanistan was responsible for turning the Soviet Union into Russia, shared his thoughts on military strategy to fight terrorism and then claimed he would have been a good general. Trump avoided the draft five times.

Former President Barack Obama was harshly criticized for taking vacation days -- including by Trump. But Trump has far surpassed Obama in the number of days he's spent golfing during his presidency.

Trump has a long history of spouting greatly inflated or invented numbers for how much illegal immigration costs the U.S. During his presidential campaign, he often claimed it cost $100 billion. That number has risen steadily over the years, unattached to any apparent research or reports, as The Washington Post's Philip Bump has documented.

After abruptly announcing plans in December to withdraw all American troops from war-torn Syria, Trump backpedaled somewhat on Wednesday, saying it might take longer than previously expected. ""We're talking about sand and death,"" he said. ""That's what we're talking about.""

This one pretty much speaks for itself, but ""computer boards,"" anyone?"

Tapper pointed to a Twitter message from 2016 -- two years before Romney accepted the president's endorsement in 2018 -- in which Romney seemed to reject the idea wholesale. Romney claimed in the tweet that he wouldn't have accepted Trump's endorsement in the 2012 presidential race if Trump had made the same sort of inappropriate comments about the Klan, Muslims and people with disabilities he became known for later, according to Raw Story.

""Now, some people point out, OK, he hadn't said those things, but he was the nation's leading birther, pushing the lie that Barack Obama, the first African-American president, was born in Africa,"" Tapper said. ""Again, a lie. And you accepted his endorsement even though that was his political claim to fame.""

Then Tapper asked Romney point-blank: ""Was that a mistake?""

The senator-elect tried to slip out of that potentially awkward question by saying, ""You know, I'm sure I've made a lot of mistakes.""

Tapper then pushed harder: ""Is that one of them?""

Romney refused to acknowledge his potential hypocrisy, saying he'd let the American people decide that.

""I will let the people make the assessment of which things were mistakes and not,"" he said, before justifying why he accepted Trump's endorsement in 2018. ""But when the president of the United States, frankly of either party, were to say 'I'm endorsing your candidacy,' I think you'd say thank you very much.""

Romney also emphasized that in his campaign to be a Utah senator campaign, Trump was ""endorsing me, I wasn't endorsing him.""

Although Romney told Tapper he would support Trump's proposed border wall, he wouldn't say if he would support the president's re-election."
373,bbc news,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-24370967,"With the deadline upon us to buy Obamacare coverage for the coming year, national data shows fewer people are enrolling than before.

Around 4.1 million Americans have signed up for new plans so far this year, according to government reports, down 12% from last year.

President Donald Trump promised to dismantle his predecessor's landmark 2010 healthcare law. So, to what extent has he succeeded?

Congressional Republicans last year finally succeeded in repealing the Obamacare requirement that people buy health insurance or pay a tax penalty.

Mr Trump argued that repealing the mandate would end Obamacare. Nevertheless, the act stumbles on.

The mandate was not as successful as Obamacare's architects hoped in driving younger, healthier Americans into the healthcare marketplace.

Now, as they ditch their coverage, analysts say insurance firms are making up for the loss by charging more to the sick or medically vulnerable patients left behind.

In 2018, the Trump administration allowed insurance companies to offer Americans cheaper, less-comprehensive policies called Association Health Plans (AHPs) that last only up to a year.

Since AHPs are short-term, companies can charge higher premiums or deny coverage based on medical history and pre-existing conditions, which Obamacare made illegal for long-term plans.

These skimpy plans will appeal to young, healthy Americans, but some AHPs may not cover basics like prescription drugs or maternity care.

Initially, users had 90 days to sign up for insurance on the federal marketplace.

In 2017, the Trump administration cut it down to 45 days, and then closed the website every Sunday for 12 hours, citing maintenance.

Funding for the ""navigator"" programme, under which trained individuals or organisations help people sign up for insurance through Obamacare, has dropped from $62.5m (£48m) to $10m under President Trump.

His administration has also cut Obamacare advertising spending to $10m - a 90% reduction.

According to a November 2018 Kaiser Health poll, 61% of Americans aged 18 to 64 said they did not know about any enrolment deadlines.

Insurance companies who covered lower-income Obamacare patients used to get cost-sharing reduction (CSR) payments from the US government.

When the Trump administration cancelled these payments in October 2017, insurance firms increased premiums to compensate for the loss.

The end of CSR payments had little effect on lower-income Americans, who still receive other healthcare subsidies. But it did lead to a cost hike for patients who pay full-price for their medical coverage.

For now, former President Obama's law still stands - and he keeps fighting for it. He recently posted a video urging uninsured Americans to register.

A 2018 government report saw 11.8 million Americans re-enrol in Obamacare plans, and 27% were new users.

It was around 400,000 fewer people than in 2017 - a smaller figure than expected given the Trump administration's efforts.

Average premiums have nearly doubled since 2014.

A Gallup poll earlier this year found 55% of Americans worry ""a great deal"" about accessing and affording medical care - the fifth year in a row that healthcare has topped the issues list.

Gallup also reported the adult uninsured rate had dropped to a record low of 10.9% in 2016, but has since risen to 12.3% post-Trump.

The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare or the ACA, was the largest overhaul of the US healthcare system since the 1960s.

It aimed to eventually slow the growth of US healthcare spending, which is the highest in the world.

Obamacare intended to extend health insurance coverage to the estimated 15% of Americans who lacked it and were not covered by other health programmes for the poor and elderly.

The law created state-run marketplaces - with websites akin to online shopping sites - where individuals can compare prices as they shop for coverage.

Some of the more popular provisions include:

'Don't take away our healthcare' says Trump country

Republicans say it imposes too many costs on business, with many describing it as a ""job killer"". However, since the implementation of Obamacare jobs in the healthcare sector, at least, rose by 9% and a 2017 study found that around 2.6 million jobs could be lost by 2019 if it is repealed.

Conservatives have also decried the act as an unwarranted intrusion into the affairs of private businesses and individuals.

They have also argued against Obamacare's rule requiring most companies to cover birth control for free.

The Trump administration tried to put in place new guidelines for organisations to opt out on moral grounds last year, but two federal judges blocked the move.

During the Obama presidency, the Republican-controlled House of Representatives took dozens of symbolic votes to repeal the law and forced a partial government shutdown over the issue.

After repeated legal challenges, in 2012 the US Supreme Court declared Obamacare constitutional.

Despite having a majority on Capitol Hill under President Trump, a Republican repeal bid failed in dramatic fashion in 2018.

Democratic leaders have acknowledged Obamacare is not perfect, and have previously offered to work with Republicans to fix its flaws.

Growing numbers of left-wing Democrats are coalescing around a universal healthcare plan proposed by former Democratic presidential candidate Bernie Sanders.

He advocates expanding Medicare, the US government's medical coverage programme for pensioners, to all Americans.

Mr Sanders' idea - Medicare for All - would provide healthcare for everyone free of charge. He says it would be funded by higher taxes.

The plan's champions say its tax burden on Americans would be offset by savings in an array of often opaque medical charges they currently face, such as premiums, co-pays, out-of-pocket expenses and deductibles.

Mr Sanders has cited a figure from a libertarian study suggesting Medicare for all would save the US $2tn on healthcare spending over a decade.

But the research, by a pro-free market think tank, said that estimate was based on hospitals and doctors accepting payments of 40% less for patients who currently have private insurance.

The study projected that if current rates stay around the same, American healthcare spending could increase by more than $3tn under Medicare for All."
374,bbc news,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-46374191,"Around the world attitudes towards the use of cannabis are shifting.

Mexico's new government plans to legalise recreational cannabis use, as does the incoming government of Luxembourg. Meanwhile, New Zealand's Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern is considering a referendum on what its approach should be.

As public opinion - and that of governments - changes, it seems increasingly likely that other countries will follow, raising questions about how they work together to manage the use and supply of cannabis.

What has led one country after another to move towards a relaxation of their laws and, in many cases, outright legalisation?

It was only in 2012 that Uruguay announced it would be the first country in the world to legalise recreational cannabis use. In large part, the move was aimed at replacing links between organised crime and the cannabis trade with more accountable state regulation.

Later the same year, voters in Washington State and Colorado became the first in the US to support legalisation of the drug for non-medical use.

Under President Barack Obama, a critic of the US-led war on drugs, the US government stepped back from enforcing federal laws and effectively gave states a green light to explore alternatives.

Eight more states and Washington DC have since supported the legalisation of recreational cannabis and penalties are softening elsewhere. The use of the drug for medical reasons is allowed in 33 of the 50 states.

In many ways the jury is still out on the effects of legalisation on society and individuals' health, but there is no question that public opinion and government policy has softened.

The tide has crept across the Americas, with Canada legalising the sale, possession and recreational use of cannabis nationwide in October.

That Mexico will legalise marijuana seems a virtual certainty. The new government of Andrés Manuel López Obrador has introduced a bill that would legalise its medical and recreational use, while the country's supreme court recently ruled an absolute ban on recreational use unconstitutional.

Other countries are pushing ahead. Although the sale of cannabis remains illegal, possession of small amounts is no longer a crime in countries including Brazil, Jamaica and Portugal. In Spain it is legal to use cannabis in private, while the drug is sold openly in coffee shops in the Netherlands. Still more countries allow the use of medicinal cannabis.

Around the world, there are many more countries where change is under way:

In many countries, the move towards legalisation started with a softening of public attitudes.

In the US and Canada, images of sick children being denied potentially life-changing medicines had a tremendous impact on public opinion - a concern that brought forward legalisation for medical purposes.

A similar softening of attitudes has been seen in the UK.

In June, 12-year-old Billy Caldwell, who has severe epilepsy, was admitted to hospital after his medical cannabis oil was confiscated. A month later, a special licence to use cannabis oil was granted to seven-year-old Alfie Dingley, who has a rare form of epilepsy.

Following high-profile campaigns, the UK government changed the law to allow doctors to prescribe cannabis products.

As US states such as California found in the 1990s and 2000s, familiarity with medical cannabis can soften attitudes towards recreational use.

But in the UK, the Home Office says the recreational use of cannabis will remain banned, although senior figures, including former Conservative leader William Hague, have suggested a rethink.

Mexico has also had cases of children being denied medical cannabis, but it has also been motivated by the extraordinary violence of its drugs war.

Although marijuana makes up a relatively small share of drug cartel revenues, continuing to ban it is seen as increasingly at odds with reality.

Mexican diplomats warned the US it was difficult to enforce the fight against cannabis when the neighbouring American state of California legalised recreational use.

With countries worldwide moving towards some form of legalisation, others are rushing to catch up.

Often, as in many parts of Latin America, governments want their farmers to have access to the potentially lucrative medicinal cannabis markets that are developing.

Corporations have also expressed interest. For example, Altria, which owns cigarette brands including Marlboro, has made a $1.86bn (£1.46bn) investment in a Canadian cannabis company.

Over time, as the US demonstrates, it is quite possible that the medical trade could quite easily morph into recreational sales - potentially opening up an even bigger market.

One immediate obstacle is that cannabis for recreational purposes cannot be traded across borders. Countries can only import and export medicinal cannabis under a licensing system supervised by the International Narcotics Control Board.

Farmers in countries such as Morocco and Jamaica may have a reputation for producing cannabis, but they can't access markets that domestic producers sometimes struggle to supply - as happened in Canada following legalisation.

While there are some rumblings of change within the international legal system, as yet this seems far off.

Governments that want to move towards legalisation face a challenge: steering a course between uncontrolled legalisation and hard prohibition.

Poorly-regulated industry and mind-altering substances are not a combination about which many societies would feel comfortable.

But it seems a virtual certainty that more countries will change their approach to cannabis in the coming decades.

As such, domestic and international rules will need to catch up.

375,daily mail online,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-6523225/Trumps-2018-A-year-stranger-sitcom-presidency.html,"WASHINGTON (AP) - The stranger-than-sitcom American presidency opened 2018 with a big tease about mutual nuclear destruction from two leaders who then found ""love"" not war. It seems President Donald Trump and North Korea's Kim Jong Un were just playing hard to get.

The presidency ends the year saturated in tumult, with the government in partial shutdown and Trump tweeting a video of himself warbling a parody of the theme song from ""Green Acres,"" a television sitcom from the 1960s, to mark his signing of a farm bill.

Throw in a beer-loving and very angry Supreme Court nominee, an unhappy departing defense secretary, Trump's parallel universe of facts and his zillion tweets, and you can see that the president's world this year was touched by the weird, the traumatic and the fantastical - also known as WTF.

There was no holding back the self-described ""very stable genius"" with the ""very, very large brain.""

Some serious and relatively conventional things got done in 2018.

There was a midterm election. Many more Democrats are coming to Congress and not quite all of them plan to run for president. Divided government dawns in January when Democrats take control of the House; Republicans retain their grip on the Senate.

An overhaul of the criminal justice system was accomplished, and in an unusually bipartisan way, though it took a dash of reality TV's Kim Kardashian West to move it along. Gun control actually was tightened a bit, with Trump's unilateral banning of bump stocks.

Trump shocked allies and lost Defense Secretary Jim Mattis over a presidential decision to pull U.S. troops out of Syria, quickly following up with indications that up to half the troops in Afghanistan might be withdrawn, too.

Self-described ""Tariff Man"" started one trade war, with China, and headed off a second by tweaking the North American Free Trade Agreement and giving it an unpronounceable acronym, USMCA. He withdrew the U.S. from the Iran nuclear deal, putting action behind his Twitter shout: ""WE ARE NO LONGER A COUNTRY THAT WILL STAND FOR YOUR DEMENTED WORDS OF VIOLENCE & DEATH.""

Trump placed his second justice on the Supreme Court in two years after Brett Kavanaugh, accused of alcohol-fueled sexual assault in his youth, raged against the allegations at a congressional hearing and acknowledged only: ""I liked beer, I still like beer,"" but ""I never sexually assaulted anyone.""

There were frustrations and fulminations aplenty for the president, particularly about the steaming-ahead Russia-Trump campaign investigation by special counsel Robert Mueller (""special councel"" in some Trump tweets).

Nor did he make much progress on his promised border wall (""boarder wall""), which he renamed ""artistically designed steel slats"" in December in what he regarded as a concession to wall-despising, concrete-cursing Democrats. The concession did not work: large parts of the government closed Saturday over the wall-induced budget impasse.

He took heat for a zero-tolerance policy that forced migrant children from their parents until he backed off, inaccurately blaming Democrats for ""Child Seperation.""

It was a very good year for jobs. It was a check-your-smartphone-right-now, pass-the-smelling-salts year for the stock market. Trump, who assailed the unemployment rate as a phony measure when he was a candidate, couldn't speak of it enough as Obama-era job growth continued on his watch. He went mum about the market, a prime subject for his boasting before it took a sustained dive.

Trump's approval rating in polls was one of the few constants on this swiftly tilting planet: 42 percent approval and 56 percent disapproval in The Associated Press-NORC's latest and 38 percent-57 percent via Gallup, neither much different than in January.

Through it all, the mainstreaming of the bizarre proceeded apace and North Korea's Kim set that tone right on Jan. 1 with his New Year cheer to Americans across the ocean: ""It's not a mere threat but a reality that I have a nuclear button on the desk in my office. All of the mainland United States is within the range of our nuclear strike.""

Trump responded the next day with a tweet about size and performance. ""I too have a Nuclear Button, but it is a much bigger & more powerful one than his, and my Button works!""

Once they got that out of their system, things quickly improved, helped along by Kim's letters to Trump, which the U.S. president called ""beautiful."" There was no more talk about Trump being a ""mentally deranged dotard"" or Kim being a ""maniac,"" the musty insults of an earlier time. In June, they held history's first meeting between a North Korean leader and a current U.S. president. ""We fell in love,"" Trump later said at a West Virginia rally.

Kim had previously vowed to visit ""fire and fury"" on the U.S. but the ""Fire and Fury"" that made Trump livid early this year was the book of the same name, Michael Wolff's insider account of the Trump White House. That was a different sort of missile. The president took particular exception to observations in the book by his former chief strategist, tweeting about ""Sloppy Steve Bannon, who cried when he got fired and begged for his job. Now Sloppy Steve has been dumped like a dog by almost everyone. Too bad!""

They are said to be on better terms now.

Over the course of the year, Trump spoke at more than 40 campaign rallies, kept up his Twitter barrage (40,000 tweets since 2009 on his @realDonaldTrump account) and answered plenty of questions in infrequent but lengthy news conferences and sit-down interviews.

So what stands out in this blizzardy whiteout of unconventionality?

How about this farewell to his secretary of state, Rex Tillerson? ""He was dumb as a rock and I couldn't get rid of him fast enough. He was lazy as hell."" (The president usually reserves ""dumb as a rock"" for journalists.)

Or his description of Stormy Daniels, paid to stay quiet about their alleged affair, as ""horseface?""

Or this description of his attorney general, Jeff Sessions, as ""scared stiff and Missing in Action,"" before Sessions was finally out in November?

Will history long remember that in 2018 the president called Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff ""little Adam Schitt"" on Twitter and nations in Africa ""shithole countries"" in a private meeting?

Or that he (correctly) predicted Hurricane Florence would be ""tremendously wet"" or told the AP: ""I have a natural instinct for science?""

In July, Trump appeared to side with Russian President Vladimir Putin when he stood by Putin's side at a Helsinki summit news conference and gave weight to Putin's denial that Russia meddled in the 2016 election, despite the firm conclusion of U.S. intelligence agencies that it had. ""I don't see any reason why it would be"" Russia, Trump said.

But while it's been hardly noticed in a capital consumed by the shutdown drama, Mattis, Syria, steel slats and market convulsions, 2018 draws to a close as it started - with warnings of a nuclear Armageddon, this time from Putin.

Putin's prompt was Trump's intention to walk away from one arms control treaty and his reluctance to extend another.

That, said Putin, ""could lead to the destruction of civilization as a whole and maybe even our planet.""

Maybe he's just playing hard to get.

""So the goal in my therapy would be to work through my 'trauma' and therefore I would revert to my innate heterosexuality,"" says Gajdics. ""Everything about my therapy became focused to do that.""

The treatments grew increasingly intense. He was prescribed a cocktail of psychiatric medications - antidepressants, a sedative and more - and told they were necessary ""to silence the noise"" of his homosexuality.

The young Canadian man spent six years under the psychiatrist's care, eventually moving into a house with other patients, ""isolated from the world, definitely not talking to family or former friends, which was prohibited"".

He finally left the treatment, got off the medications, and sued the doctor for medical malpractice.

One of the grounds for his lawsuit, which was settled out of court in 2003, was that the psychiatrist had tried to treat Gajdics' homosexuality as a disease.

For Gajdics, part of the process of reclaiming his life after that experience was to speak out against conversion therapy - sometimes also called ""sexual reorientation"", ""reparative"", or ""gay cure"" therapy.

He recognises what he went through was an extreme form of the practice, but the intended goal of any form of conversion therapy is the same: to attempt to change an LGBT person's sexual orientation or gender identity.

Conversion therapy has been widely discredited by major psychotherapy and medical associations in many countries, including Canada, the US and the UK, and is opposed by the World Health Organisation and the United Nations.

Gajdics eventually wrote a memoir - The Inheritance of Shame - about his experience, and shortly before its release approached the city of Vancouver, where he lives, to lobby for a ban on the practice there.

A motion to prohibit businesses from providing conversion therapy to minors passed in June.

Two provinces in Canada - Ontario and Manitoba - have also taken steps to limit conversion therapy within their jurisdictions.

Now, there's a growing push for a nationwide ban.

Two separate petitions have racked up tens of thousands signatures since being posted earlier this year.

""In 2018, there's no reason that Canada, which considers itself a forerunner in human rights, to be allowing the practice,"" Devon Hargreaves, who helped launch one of those campaigns, tells the BBC.

The petition, which has more than 11,200 signatures so far, calls on Canadian legislators to ban conversion therapy for minors and to prohibit taking minors outside of the country for such purposes.

The second petition, started by It Gets Better Canada, an affiliate of the US-based non-profit organisation that supports LGBT youth, has over 58,400 signatures.

That petition calls on the federal government to clearly state that Canada ""opposes the use of conversion therapy and other related treatments"" and to develop policies to prevent anyone from attempting to alter a minor's sexual orientation or gender identity or expression.

It Gets Better Canada's Chris Gudgeon says people have two reactions when they hear about the group's efforts to ban the practice: ""'I can't believe this is happening in Canada', or 'this happened to me and it's time we ban it''.

Only three countries in the world - Ecuador, Brazil, and Malta - ban conversion therapy.

But a number of factors have brought the issue into the open in recent years.

""There was this strange moment where all of a sudden conversion therapy caught people's attention,"" says Gudgeon.

Three years ago, former US President Barack Obama spoke out against the practice after the suicide of a transgender teenager who posted online about religious therapists trying to turn her back into a boy.

This year saw Hollywood release two films that centre on conversion therapy.

Boy Erased is based on American writer Garrard Conley's personal experience with conversion therapy in Bible belt southern US.

The Miseducation of Cameron Post, which took home one of the top prizes at the latest Sundance film festival, tells the fictional tale of a gay teenage girl sent to a conversion camp in the 1990s.

Lucas Ramon Mendos, who researches conversion therapy legislation worldwide for The International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association, says he has seen a shift in the debate over the past year.

""There's a lot happening, it's taking various forms, not just bills,"" he tells the BBC.

He points to efforts in Australia and Spain, and to China, where last year a court ruled against a hospital that had forced a gay man into conversion therapy, ordering a public apology and compensation.

In the US, a record number of states have tabled proposed legislation to tackle the issue amid a national ""50 Bills, 50 States"" campaign to ensure protections across the country.

Nineteen states have proposed legislation to protect LGBT youth from conversion therapy and 14 states, as well as DC, prohibit the practice.

In July, the UK announced plans to bring forward proposals to end conversion therapy, which it called a ""harmful practice"".

Mendos says that ""for the first time victims have had the courage and the tools and the space to come out and speak about this"".

""This is one of the issues in which victims were forced into a scheme of shame, were harmed through these techniques, of questioning the self-identity of a person.""

There are no current statistics on the practice in Canada, but a 2017 UK government survey of LGBT citizens indicated that 2% of respondents had undergone conversion therapy and a further 5% had been offered it.

Faith organisations were by far the most likely to have carried out the practice, according to the report.

In the US, an estimated 700,000 LGBT adults have received conversion therapy, about half when they were in their teens, according to research out of the University of California at Los Angeles.

Researchers also estimated that some 20,000 LGBT teens between 13 and 17 will receive some form of the therapy from a medical professional and another 57,000 from a religious adviser.

Those who monitor conversion therapy say they've noticed a shift in recent years away from organisations promising a ""cure"" to offering instead the ability to suppress any expression of an LGBT individual's sexuality.

Gudgeon says he thinks that those who offer some form of conversion therapy often believe they are trying to help youth struggling with their identity.

Many LGBT youth coming to terms with their sexuality ""want to stop feeling conflicted"", he says.

Having support can be vital, he says, but ""the fact is, that going to a therapy that tries to talk you into being somebody you're not isn't going to help you. It doesn't solve the conflict"".

Both Hargreaves and Gudgeon are hopeful for a positive response on their respective campaigns from Justin Trudeau's Liberal government, which has made efforts to support LGBT Canadians in the past.

Hargreaves' petition, filed on the parliamentary e-petition site, is guaranteed a formal response since it surpassed the 500 signature benchmark for a government response the night it was posted.

Gajdics, who has been campaigning against the practice for some 20 years, says he is "" thrilled"" at the growing international scrutiny.

""It's been a long, long time coming,"" he says.

""It's such a deep, deep transgression and violation of the gay person, of the lesbian person, of the trans person, it cuts to such a deep level psychically, emotionally."""

Clinton sank down to Number 3 on Gallup's list of 'Most Admired Man and Woman, 2018,' after Oprah Winfrey, tying with current first lady Melania Trump.

Obama, who is in the midst of book tour for her memoir 'Becoming,' won big time.

She came in first with 15 percent - a whopping 10 points ahead of Winfrey at number two.

Clinton and Trump both garnered 4 percent.

After a long career in the public eye as first lady, senator, secretary of state and 2016 Democratic presidential nominee, Clinton has stepped back from the spotlight.

Obama, meanwhile, has seen her book sky rocket up the best seller list. It was the best-selling book of 2018.

The former first lady also has been on a nationwide book tour in theaters and concert venues in addition to making multiple media appearances to tout her memoir.

Clinton had a long run atop the list.

She finished first 22 times - more than any other man or woman - according to Gallup, including in 1993 and 1994, 1997 through 2000, and 2002 through 2017.

On the male side, former President Barack Obama is the 'Most Admired Man' for the 11th year in a row.

President Donald Trump came in at number two for the fourth year in a row.

Obama topped his successor by 6 points, coming in with 19 percent to Trump's 13 percent.

George W. Bush, Pope Francis, and businessman Bill Gates rounded out the top five.

Former President Bill Clinton came in a distant seventh - after Sen. Bernie Sanders who took the number six slot.

Bill Clinton, Gates and Sanders all garnered a scant one percent.

Usually, the president does not win, Gallup notes, when he has subpar job approval ratings, as is the case with Trump, who has an average approval rating of 39 percent in Gallup's polling.

There are also two notable men missing from the list who typically make the Top Ten: Sen. John McCain and the Rev. Billy Graham, both of whom died in the past year.

'I haven't decided who I'm going to endorse in 2020. I'm going to wait and see what the alternatives are,' Romney said on CNN. 'I think it's early to make that decision. I want to see what the alternatives are.'

But the former Massachusetts governor who fell short as the Republican presidential nominee in 2012 insisted he won't make another run at the White House himself.

'I'm not running again. And we'll see whether someone else does in a Republican primary or not, but time will tell,' Romney said.

Mitt Romney, who will be sworn in Thursday as Utah's junior senator, said Wednesday that he hasn't decided whether to endorse President Donald Trumpfor re-election next year

Romney said presidents should 'demonstrate the qualities of integrity and honesty forthrightness, empathy and respect for the institutions of our democratic republic,' suggesting Trump needs to 'elevate his game'

'You may have heard,' he chuckled. 'I ran before. I've had that experience.'

'And, by the way, I acknowledge the president was successful and I was not. He did something Icouldn't do. He won.'

A day after penning a scorching op-ed that blasted Trump for what Romney sees as a failure to lead the United States by moral example, he struck a mostly conciliatory tone in his first national TV interview since winning a U.S. Senate seat in Utah.

But he emphasized that while he is likely to agree with the president on some policy issues, 'there are places that I think the president can, if you will, elevate his game and do a better job to help bring us together as a nation.'

Republican Party chairwoman Ronna Romney McDaniel, lashed out at her uncle Mitt on Twitter after The Washington Post published his op-ed, which claimed Trump's actions are 'evidence that the President has not risen to the mantle of the office.'

McDaniel called that take 'disappointing and unproductive.'

On CNN, Romney said her choice of words was 'probably more civil than it might have been across the Thanksgiving dinner table.'

Romney said he'll wait to see if other Republicans challenge the president for the 2020 GOP nomination, but added that he won't run for the White House again

The 71-year-old politician is entering Congress amid a partial government shutdown sparked by a Pennsylvania Avenue dispute over funding for a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border.

Trump has demanded $5.6 billion to continue construction. Democrats are offering $1.3 billion for border security, none of which could be spend on the project.

Romney said he's in favor of Trump's border barrier, in whatever form it might take.

'I would vote for the border wall. I've made that part of my platform for many, many years,' he declared. 'I think we should have a border wall on our southern border, and whether it's a wall or fence or technology - and perhaps in some cases the natural landscape prevents people from coming in - but we've got to secure our border.'

Romney's op-ed credited Trump for his tax and trade policies, but condemned him for failing to rise to the challenge of leading the nation by good-character example

But he stopped short of saying he agrees with the president that taking a hard line with Democrats in Congress is worth putting 780,000 federal workers at risk of missing paychecks in nine days.

'He's got to make that assessment himself,' Romney said.

On CNN, Romney largely soft-pedaled his more strident words from a day earlier.

But even the op-ed was a step down from the March 2016 speech in which he front-loaded a sneer onto a script full of venom.

'Donald Trump is a phony, a fraud,' Romney said then, hoping to sway Republican primary voters to abandon the future president. 'His promises are as worthless as a degree from Trump University. He's playing members of the American public for suckers: He gets a free ride to the White House, and all we get is a lousy hat.'

'Dishonesty is Donald Trump's hallmark,' Romney added at the time, venting about Trump's 'bullying, the greed, the showing off, the misogyny, [and] the absurd third-grade theatrics.'

Trump said hours earlier during a Cabinet meeting that if Romney had been as critical of Barack Obama as he has been of him, the 2012 presidential election would have turned out differently.

'If he fought really hard against President Obama like he does against me, he would have won the election. Does that make sense to you?' he asked a day after the Utah senator-elect targeted him in the Post op-ed.

President Trump urged Mitt Romney to be 'a team player' in the U.S. Senate and warned that 'we don't need another Democrat'

The president told Cabinet secretaries and reporters that Romney would have won the White House in 2012 if he were as tough on Barack Obama as he has been on him

'I think people are very upset with what he did. He hasn't even gotten to office yet,' he complained.

'I'd love him to be a team player. Poossibly he won't be,' Trump said while Cabinet secretaries looked on and cameras rolled.

'I endorsed him and he thanked me profusely,' he added, referring to his support in the Republican primary 11 months ago.

Trump said he expected Romney to turn on him, 'but I was surprised he did it this quickly.'

He boasted of a positive spirit in the House of Representatives, which voted to authorize $5.6 billion in funding for his proposed border wall between the U.S. and Mexico.

'I'd like Mitt Romney to join in that spirit. Because, you know, we're doing some great things,' he said. 'We don't need another Democrat.'"

'Here we go with Mitt Romney, but so fast! Question will be, is he a Flake? I hope not,' Trump tweeted, suggesting Romney will take over outgoing Sen. Jeff Flake's role as the most prominent GOP voice holding him in check.

'Would much prefer that Mitt focus on Border Security and so many other things where he can be helpful. I won big, and he didn't. He should be happy for all Republicans. Be a TEAM player & WIN!'

Utah Senator-elect Mitt Romney, 71, penned a harsh critique of Trump in the Washington Post on Tuesday and will be sworn into Congress on Thursday. He says he will speak out against Trump's hateful and derisive comments

President Donald Trump blasted Mitt Romney on Wednesday, saying the Utah senator-elect could be the new go-to Republican thorn in his side

Romney said the president must also be honest, of integrity, and bring the nation together, which he says Trump has failed to do

Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale slammed Romney and claimed he 'lacked the ability to save this nation' when he lost the 2012 presidnetial election to Barack Obama

'It is well known that Donald Trump was not my choice for the Republican presidential nomination. After he became the nominee, I hoped his campaign would refrain from resentment and name-calling. It did not,' the 71-year-old Republican said.

Brad Parscale, Trump's 2020 campaign manager, tweeted Tuesday night: 'The truth is @MittRomney lacked the ability to save this nation. @realDonaldTrump has saved it.'

Parscale also dropped a Trump-style typo in his tweet: 'Jealously [sic] is a drink best served warm and Romney just proved it. So sad, I wish everyone had the courage @realDonaldTrump had.'

Romney's takedown of the president was the talk of Washington on the first day of the new year, just 48 hours before he's scheduled to replace outgoing Sen. Orrin Hatch, a reliable Trump ally.

'When he won the election, I hoped he would rise to the occasion. His early appointments of Rex Tillerson, Jeff Sessions, Nikki Haley, Gary Cohn, H.R. McMaster, Kelly and Mattis were encouraging. But, on balance, his conduct over the past two years, particularly his actions this month, is evidence that the president has not risen to the mantle of the office,' he wrote.

Romney said Trump's job in the White House and as the nation's leader is to 'demonstrate the essential qualities of honesty and integrity', something he has failed to do.

'With the nation so divided, resentful and angry, presidential leadership in qualities of character is indispensable. And it is in this province where the incumbent's shortfall has been most glaring,' Romney wrote.

He added that America's reputation as a global leader has also plummeted following Trump's presidency.

'Trump's words and actions have caused dismay around the world. In a 2016 Pew Research Center poll, 84 percent of people in Germany, Britain, France, Canada and Sweden believed the American president would ""do the right thing in world affairs."" One year later, that number had fallen to 16 percent,' he said.

The former Massachusetts governor said Trump 'has not risen to the mantle of the office' and he intends to defy the president if he makes 'divisive, racist, and anti-immigrant' comments. Trump and Romney pictured together at the Trump Golf Club in New Jersey in 2016

He shared his opinion piece just two days before he'll be sworn in as Senator

However, he noted that some of Trump's policy decisions during his time in office have been worthy of applause.

He praised his corporate taxes, the end of excessive regulations, the crack down on China's international trade practices, his criminal justice reform, and the appointment of conservative judges - hot button issues that Republicans have rallied behind for years.

Romney, the former Massachusetts governor, will be sworn into the Senate on Thursday and says that he will speak out against Trump's wrongdoings while in office.

He promised to counter Trump's statements that are divisive and combative.

'I will act as I would with any president, in or out of my party: I will support policies that I believe are in the best interest of the country and my state, and oppose those that are not,' he said.

'I do not intend to comment on every tweet or fault. But I will speak out against significant statements or actions that are divisive, racist, sexist, anti-immigrant, dishonest or destructive to democratic institutions,' he added.

He added that he looks forward to his term as senator and working with Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and the rest of Congress."

Elizabeth Warren is preparing to bring a populist message to Iowa voters just days after taking her first major step toward launching a campaign for president.

The Massachusetts Democrat told reporters on Wednesday that she's planning to visit the state with the nation's first presidential caucuses after being sworn in on Thursday to a second Senate term.

Warren said that Washington 'works great for the wealthy and the well-connected' but that it needs to work for everybody else.

'This is a moment in America where people really want to get the focus back on the points that touch their lives, about things like student loans and what it costs to get a prescription filled,' Warren said after a swearing-in ceremony for state lawmakers at the Massachusetts Statehouse.

Warren on Monday announced she's launching an exploratory committee for president.

Here for a day or two: Elizabeth Warren was on Capitol Hill Wednesday but said she would be on her way to Iowa, the first in the nation caucus, once she was sworn in

The Instagram livestream echoed similar down-the-lens efforts by O'Rouke and Ocasio-Cortez

She is the most prominent Democrat yet in what is expected to be a crowded field of fellow contenders hoping to retake the White House from Republican President Donald Trump in 2020.

The former Harvard law professor made a name for herself a decade ago with calls for greater consumer protections, which led to the creation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau under former Democratic President Barack Obama.

Warren said she plans to run on many of those same basic economic issues, which she said have been made even more precarious by Washington politics.

'I believe that Washington is corrupt,' she said. 'I see it firsthand.'

Warren was been a favorite target of Trump, who frequently calls her 'Pocahontas' - a reference to Warren's claims of Native American heritage.

Warren in October released a DNA test meant to bolster those claims, but the test seemed only to generate more controversy for Warren.

The test indicated that Warren likely had Native American in her bloodline, though the ancestor probably lived six to 10 generations ago.

Some critics complained that the genetic analysis cheapened the identities of tribal members with deeper ties.

Trump told Fox News Channel's 'All-American New Year' in an interview Monday that he hopes Warren runs.

'We'll see how she does,' he said. 'I wish her well. I hope she does well. I'd love to run against her.'

Warren plans to start her swing through Iowa on Friday with a stop at an organizing event in Council Bluffs followed by similar events on Saturday in Sioux City and Des Moines and a roundtable discussion in Storm Lake.

Warren also defended her decision to host a live Instagram event on New Year's Eve from the kitchen of her home in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

The live feed showed her drinking a beer, petting her dog and taking questions from viewers - an event some derided as awkward.

'It's one more way to be able just to invite people into your home. I wish I could just open the door and have lots of folks in, but this is a way to do it,' she said, adding that her beer of choice is Michelob Ultra, what she called 'the club soda of beers.'"
383,bbc news,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-46628811,"President Donald Trump's decision to withdraw all US troops from Syria has been met with heavy criticism.

Mr Trump made the announcement on Wednesday, asserting that the Islamic State (IS) group had been defeated.

But major allies, including senior Republicans and foreign powers, have disputed the claim and say the move could lead to a resurgence of IS.

US troops have helped rid much of Syria's north-east of the jihadist group, but pockets of fighters remain.

Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, who is one of Mr Trump's supporters, called the withdrawal decision a ""huge Obama-like mistake"".

And the UK government pushed back on the president's assurance that IS had now been defeated.

The Pentagon said it was transitioning to the ""next phase of the campaign"" to eliminate IS but did not provide further details.

President Trump, who has long promised to pull American troops out of Syria, said on Twitter that it was time to bring them home after their ""historic victories"".

Senator Graham, who sits on the armed services committee, warned that the withdrawal would have ""devastating consequences"" both in Syria and beyond.

He said that he feared it would mean ceding influence in the region to Russia and Iran.

""An American withdrawal at this time would be a big win for [IS], Iran, Bashar al-Assad of Syria, and Russia,"" he said in a statement.

Meanwhile, the UK government distanced itself from President Trump's assertion that IS had now been defeated.

""Much remains to be done and we must not lose sight of the threat they pose,"" a statement from the Foreign Office said.

Israel said it had been told the US had ""other ways to have influence in the area"" but would ""study the timeline [of the withdrawal], how it will be done and of course the implications for us"".

Striking a different tone, Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said the US decision could result in ""genuine, real prospects for a political settlement"" in Syria.

By James Robbins, diplomatic correspondent, BBC News

The British government is stopping just short - at least in public - of condemning President Trump's decision to pull US forces out of Syria.

It said that IS remains a threat despite the ""important advances"" that have been made in recent days.

In Syria, Kurdish forces fighting IS feel abandoned, just as Turkey is vowing to step up attacks against the Kurds.

And the most powerful allies of Syria's President Bashar al-Assad, Russia and Iran, are pleased by the decision.

They hope it will mean they can increase their power in Syria and beyond.

Some 2,000 US troops have largely been stationed in the Kurdish region in northern Syria.

A partnership with an alliance of Syrian Kurdish and Arab fighters, known as the Syrian Democratic Forces, is credited with playing a major role in the virtual elimination of IS after it overran large swathes of Syria four years ago.

However, the militant group has not disappeared entirely.

A recent US report said there were still as many as 14,000 IS militants in Syria and even more in neighbouring Iraq - and there is a fear they will shift to guerrilla tactics in an attempt to rebuild their network.

But the partnership between the US and the Kurds has enraged neighbouring Turkey, which views the Kurdish YPG militia - the main fighting force in the SDF - as an extension of a banned Kurdish group fighting for autonomy in Turkey.

On Monday, Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said his country might soon start a new military operation against the YPG in Syria.

Mr Erdogan added that he had discussed his plan with Mr Trump by telephone and that he had given a ""positive response""."

Previous presidents have used the Oval Office to make major announcements to the American people although some have also used other White House venues such as the East Room or the Rose Garden.

The televised 9:00 pm (0200 GMT) speech, which comes amid a partial government shutdown, will be Trump's first prime-time address from the Oval Office.

Here are some of the previous occasions US presidents have addressed the nation from the Oval Office:

- Harry Truman -

President Harry Truman delivered the first televised address from the Oval Office, in October 1947, during which he urged Americans to conserve food to help alleviate hunger in war-torn Europe.

- Dwight D. Eisenhower -

President Dwight D. Eisenhower frequently addressed the nation from the Oval Office. In September 1957, he informed the country he was dispatching troops to Arkansas to enforce school desegregation.

- John F. Kennedy -

President John F. Kennedy, in an October 1962 speech from the Oval Office, informed the American people of the Cuban Missile Crisis, announcing a US naval blockade of the island to prevent the delivery of Soviet missiles.

- Lyndon B. Johnson -

President Lyndon B. Johnson announced in an address from the Oval Office in March 1968 that he would not seek re-election as president.

- Richard Nixon -

President Richard Nixon announced his decision to resign in an August 1974 address to the nation from the Oval Office.

- Ronald Reagan -

President Ronald Reagan was another frequent user of the Oval Office address. In a January 1986 speech he addressed the deaths of the seven astronauts aboard the space shuttle Challenger.

- George H.W. Bush -

President George H.W. Bush used the Oval Office in January 1991 to announce the start of the Gulf War to evict Iraqi troops from Kuwait.

- Bill Clinton -

President Bill Clinton announced military strikes in Iraq and against Serb forces from the Oval Office. But he chose the Map Room of the White House to tell the nation in August 1998 about his relationship with White House intern Monica Lewinsky.

- George W. Bush -

President George W. Bush addressed the nation from the Oval Office on September 11, 2001 following the Al-Qaeda attacks on New York and Washington.

- Barack Obama -

President Barack Obama was an infrequent user of the Oval Office address, giving only three during his time in the White House -- one on the Deepwater Horizon oil spill, one on the end of US combat operations in Iraq and one on the San Bernardino terror attack.

He made one of his most significant announcements -- the 2011 raid which killed Al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden -- from the East Room of the White House."
385,daily mail online,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6548793/Trump-vents-Mitt-Romney-won-2012-tough-Obama.html,"Donald Trump said Wednesday during a Cabinet meeting that if Mitt Romney had been as critical of Barack Obama as he has been of him, the 2012 presidential election would have turned out differently.

'If he fought really hard against President Obama like he does against me, he would have won the election. Does that make sense to you?' he asked a day after the Utah senator-elect targeted him in a Washington Post op-ed.

'I think people are very upset with what he did. He hasn't even gotten to office yet,' he complained.

'I'd love him to be a team player. Poossibly he won't be,' Trump said while Cabinet secretaries looked on and cameras rolled.

'I endorsed him and he thanked me profusely,' he added, referring to his support in the Republican primary 11 months ago.

Trump said he expected Romney to turn on him, 'but I was surprised he did it this quickly.'

He boasted of a positive spirit in the House of Representatives, which voted to authorize $5.6 billion in funding for his proposed border wall between the U.S. and Mexico.

'I'd like Mitt Romney to join in that spirit. Because, you know, we're doing some great things,' he said. 'We don't need another Democrat.'

The president told Cabinet secretaries and reporters that Romney would have won the White House in 2012 if he were as tough on Barack Obama as he has been on him

Utah Senator-elect Mitt Romney, 71, penned a harsh critique of Trump in the Washington Post on Tuesday and will be sworn into Congress on Thursday. He says he will speak out against Trump's hateful and derisive comments

President Donald Trump blasted Mitt Romney on Wednesday, saying the Utah senator-elect could be the new go-to Republican thorn in his side

The president began his morning responding to the op-ed, tweeting of Romney that 'I won big, and he didn't.'

He has said repeatedly that the race in which Romney fell short of unseating Obama was 'winnable' until Romney 'choked.'

'Here we go with Mitt Romney, but so fast! Question will be, is he a Flake? I hope not,' Trump tweeted, suggesting Romney will take over outgoing Sen. Jeff Flake's role as the most prominent GOP voice holding him in check.

'Would much prefer that Mitt focus on Border Security and so many other things where he can be helpful. I won big, and he didn't. He should be happy for all Republicans. Be a TEAM player & WIN!'

Romney wrote in his op-ed that 'the president has not risen to the mantle of the office.'

'It is well known that Donald Trump was not my choice for the Republican presidential nomination. After he became the nominee, I hoped his campaign would refrain from resentment and name-calling. It did not,' the 71-year-old Republican said.

Brad Parscale, Trump's 2020 campaign manager, tweeted Tuesday night: 'The truth is @MittRomney lacked the ability to save this nation. @realDonaldTrump has saved it.'

Parscale also dropped a Trump-style typo in his tweet: 'Jealously [sic] is a drink best served warm and Romney just proved it. So sad, I wish everyone had the courage @realDonaldTrump had.'

Romney said in his op-ed that the president must be honest, have integrity, and bring the nation together, which he says Trump has failed to do

Trump campaign manager Brad Parscale slammed Romney and claimed he 'lacked the ability to save this nation' when he lost the 2012 presidnetial election to Barack Obama

Romney's takedown of the president was the talk of Washington on the first day of the new year, just 48 hours before he's scheduled to replace outgoing Sen. Orrin Hatch, a reliable Trump ally.

'When he won the election, I hoped he would rise to the occasion. His early appointments of Rex Tillerson, Jeff Sessions, Nikki Haley, Gary Cohn, H.R. McMaster, Kelly and Mattis were encouraging. But, on balance, his conduct over the past two years, particularly his actions this month, is evidence that the president has not risen to the mantle of the office,' he wrote.

Romney said Trump's job in the White House and as the nation's leader is to 'demonstrate the essential qualities of honesty and integrity', something he has failed to do.

'With the nation so divided, resentful and angry, presidential leadership in qualities of character is indispensable. And it is in this province where the incumbent's shortfall has been most glaring,' Romney wrote.

He added that America's reputation as a global leader has also plummeted following Trump's presidency.

'Trump's words and actions have caused dismay around the world. In a 2016 Pew Research Center poll, 84 percent of people in Germany, Britain, France, Canada and Sweden believed the American president would ""do the right thing in world affairs."" One year later, that number had fallen to 16 percent,' he said.

The former Massachusetts governor said Trump 'has not risen to the mantle of the office' and he intends to defy the president if he makes 'divisive, racist, and anti-immigrant' comments. Trump and Romney pictured together at the Trump Golf Club in New Jersey in 2016

He shared his opinion piece just two days before he'll be sworn in as Senator

However, he noted that some of Trump's policy decisions during his time in office have been worthy of applause.

He praised his corporate taxes, the end of excessive regulations, the crack down on China's international trade practices, his criminal justice reform, and the appointment of conservative judges - hot button issues that Republicans have rallied behind for years.

Romney, the former Massachusetts governor, will be sworn into the Senate on Thursday and says that he will speak out against Trump's wrongdoings while in office.

He promised to counter Trump's statements that are divisive and combative.

'I will act as I would with any president, in or out of my party: I will support policies that I believe are in the best interest of the country and my state, and oppose those that are not,' he said.

'I do not intend to comment on every tweet or fault. But I will speak out against significant statements or actions that are divisive, racist, sexist, anti-immigrant, dishonest or destructive to democratic institutions,' he added.

He added that he looks forward to his term as senator and working with Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and the rest of Congress."
386,daily mail online,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6507673/Good-luck-Michael-Trump-wishes-Flynn-ahead-sentencing.html,"Donald Trump has wished Michael Flynn good luck at his sentencing today.

The President's former National Security Advisor has pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his conversations with Russian ambassador to the US, Sergey Kislyak.

In a tweet this morning, Trump also denied collusion with Russia during his election campaign.

He wrote: 'Good luck today in court to General Michael Flynn.

'Will be interesting to see what he has to say, despite tremendous pressure being put on him, about Russian Collusion in our great and, obviously, highly successful political campaign. There was no Collusion!'

Donald Trump has wished Michael Flynn good luck for his court appearance today

Special Counsel Robert Mueller (left) released a memo about the January 2017 interview in which Michael Flynn (right) lied to the FBI about his contacts with the Russian government

It comes after Special Counsel Robert released a memo about the January 2017 interview in which Michael Flynn lied to the FBI about his contacts with the Russian government.

It was that interview in which Flynn told investigators, among them now-former FBI agent Peter Strzok, about his conversations with Kislyak.

The memo indicates that Flynn denied asking the Russian government for political favors, according to CNN.

The agents who interviewed him, meanwhile, kept pressing President Donald Trump's former National Security Adviser for more specifics.

It was that interview in which Flynn told investigators, among them now-former FBI agent Peter Strzok (above), about his conversations with then-Russian ambassador to the United States, Sergey Kislyak

Flynn told Strzok and other FBI agents who interviewed him that he and Kislyak did not discuss U.S. sanctions against Russia.

The memo also describes how Flynn played down his attempts to lobby Russia to oppose a United Nations Security Council resolution to condemn Israeli settlements.

Flynn initially told agents that he did not try to convince Russia to vote against the resolution.

'The interviewing agents asked Flynn if he recalled any discussions with Kislyak about a United Nations vote surrounding the issue of Israeli settlements,' the memo said.

'Flynn quickly responded, 'Yes, good reminder'.'

He was also asked by the agents whether he tried to encourage Kislyak and his government not to retaliate to the Obama administration's decision to expel Russian diplomats.

'Flynn responded, 'Not really. I don't remember.'

Liar, liar: Flynn will be sentenced for admitting lying to the FBI about his contact before the 2016 election with Kislyak, then Putin's ambassador to Washington D.C.

'It wasn't, 'Don't do anything',' the memo said.

But the FBI knew Flynn asked Russia not to retaliate strongly to the expulsions.

When Flynn pleaded guilty last year, he admitted that he did do just that.

The Special Counsel's office said in the memo that Flynn did ask Russia to 'refrain from escalating the situation.'

The memo was released after Flynn's lawyers suggested that investigators discouraged him from having an attorney present during the interview and never informed him it was a crime to lie.

Prosecutors shot back: 'He does not need to be warned it is a crime to lie to federal agents to know the importance of telling them the truth.'

The mere insinuation of underhanded tactics was startling given the seemingly productive relationship between the two sides, and it was especially striking since prosecutors with Mueller's office have praised Flynn's cooperation and recommended against prison time.

The defense arguments spurred speculation that Flynn, 59, may be trying to get sympathy from President Donald Trump or may be playing to a judge known for a zero-tolerance view of government misconduct.

At his side: Flynn became a vocal supporter of Trump and spoke at campaign rallies such as this one in Grand Junction, CO, and the Republican national convention in Cleveland, OH, where he led chants of 'lock her up'

Notorious meeting: Flynn traveled to Moscow in December 2015 and dined with Vladimir Putin to celebrate the 10th anniversary of RT, the Russian English-language propaganda channel

What a change of tone: In the run-up to his former aide's sentencing, Trump has turned from portraying him as a liar to saying that he did not, as the president steps up his attacks on the Mueller probe

'It's an attempt, I think, to perhaps characterize Flynn as a victim or perhaps to make him look sympathetic in the eyes of a judge - and, at the same time, to portray the special counsel in a negative light,' said former federal prosecutor Jimmy Gurule, a University of Notre Dame law school professor.

Until the dueling memos were filed last week, the sentencing hearing for Flynn - who pleaded guilty to lying about a conversation during the transition period with the then-Russian ambassador - was expected to be devoid of the drama characterizing other of Mueller's cases.

Prosecutors, for instance, have accused former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort of lying to them even after he agreed to cooperate.

Another potential target, Jerome Corsi, leaked draft court documents and accused Mueller's team of bullying him.

And George Papadopoulos, a Trump campaign adviser recently released from a two-week prison sentence, has lambasted the investigation and publicly claimed that he was set up.

Flynn, by contrast, has been notably silent even as his supporters advocated a more combative stance. He met privately with investigators 19 times and provided cooperation so extensive that prosecutors said he was entitled to avoid prison altogether.

Then came his sentencing memo.

Although Flynn and his attorneys stopped short of any direct accusations of wrongdoing, they took pains to note that Flynn, unlike other defendants in Mueller's investigation, was not informed that it was against the law to lie to the FBI.

They suggest the FBI, which approached Flynn at the White House just days after Trump's inauguration, played to his desire to keep the encounter quiet by telling him the quickest way to get the interview done was for him to be alone with the agents - rather than involve lawyers.

They also insinuate that Flynn, of Middletown, Rhode Island, deserves credit for not publicly seizing on the fact that FBI officials involved in the investigation later came under scrutiny themselves.

Former Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, who contacted Flynn to arrange the interview, was fired this year for what the Justice Department said was a lack of candor over a news media leak.

Strzok, one of the two agents who interviewed Flynn, was removed from Mueller's team and later fired for trading anti-Trump texts with another FBI official.

Sentenced: Flynn will join his former cohort Michael Cohen - Trump's fixer - in having been sentenced. Cohen is due to report to federal prison in March

Business partners: Flynn was in business with Bijan Kian (second left). Kian, an Iranian-American, is now indicted on charges of lobbying illegally along with Flynn, who appears to have flipped on him. Flynn's wife Lori is expected at his sentencing

Mueller's team has sharply pushed back at any suggestion that Flynn was duped, with prosecutors responding in their own sentencing memo Friday that there was no obligation to warn Flynn against lying.

'A sitting National Security (Adviser), former head of an intelligence agency, retired Lieutenant General, and 33-year veteran of the armed forces knows he should not lie to federal agents,' prosecutors wrote.

Former FBI Director James Comey criticized the broadsides on the Flynn investigation during a Monday appearance on Capitol Hill, saying, 'They're up here attacking the FBI's investigation of a guy who pled guilty to lying to the FBI.'

Trump has made no secret that he sees Mueller's investigation as a 'witch hunt' and has continued to lash out at prosecutors he sees as biased against him and those who help them.

He's shown continued sympathy for Flynn, though, calling him a 'great person' and asserting - erroneously - that the FBI has said he didn't lie.

Flynn has not tried to retract his guilty plea, and there's every indication the sentencing will proceed as scheduled.

Arun Rao, a former Justice Department prosecutor in Maryland, said the defense memo is striking because it's 'inconsistent' with Flynn's cooperative stance so far.

'You also wonder in this very unusual situation,' he said, 'whether it is a play for a pardon.'

It's also possible that at least some of the defense arguments may resonate with U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan, who directed prosecutors to produce FBI records related to Flynn's interview.

Scalp: Flynn will become the fourth of Robert Mueller's targets to be sentenced

Sullivan was the judge in the Justice Department's botched prosecution of now-deceased Republican Sen. Ted Stevens of Alaska.

He dismissed the case after prosecutors admitted that they withheld exculpatory evidence, prompting the judge to say that in nearly 25 years on the bench, 'I've never seen anything approaching the mishandling and misconduct that I've seen in this case.'

In an opinion piece for The Wall Street Journal last year, Sullivan said the case inspired him to explicitly remind prosecutors in every criminal case before him of their obligation to provide defendants with favorable evidence. He says he has encouraged colleagues to do the same.

But while Sullivan has proved especially sensitive to hints of government overreach, nothing about the Flynn case comes close, said Gurule, the law professor.

'To portray him as somehow an innocent dupe, as somehow just this innocent victim in the process, this suggestion that there was a perjury trap - it's an absurd allegation,' he said.

But the sentencing also comes the day after a dramatic move by Mueller to arrest Flynn's former business partner and reveal that Flynn had been part of an effort to lobby illegally.

Bijan Kian, an Iranian-American who was number two to Flynn was arrested and appeared in federal court in Washington D.C. before being freed on bail.

He is charged with a plot to lobby for Turkey without declaring that he and Flynn's firm was working for the Turkish government, breaking the Foreign Agent Registration Act which makes it illegal to lobby for foreign governments without registering with the State Department. Kian has yet to enter a plea.

Also indicted was the business partner who worked with him and Flynn, Turkish-Dutch dual national Ekim Alpetkin, who is the subject of an arrest warrant and thought to be in Turkey.

Kian and Alpetkin are accused in court papers of a plot to convince the U.S. government to extradite or otherwise expel Fethullah Gulen, a Turkish cleric who is a deadly rival of the country's strongman president Recep Tayyip Erdogan.

Mueller says in the court papers that with Flynn, who is referred to a 'Person A' they placed an op-ed in The Hill newspaper without acknowledging that it was at the prompting of the Turkish government.

Flynn wrote the op-ed and his firm, The Flynn Intel Group, was paid $600,000 for their lobbying campaign - but he is not indicted himself in what appears to be a sign that he flipped on his former associates.

The special counsel has praised the former Trump administration official for his 'substantial help' in several investigations. It is believed this is one of them.

ROBERT MUELLER'S PROBE SO FAR: EIGHT CONVICTIONS - INCLUDING THREE TOP TRUMP AIDES, A JAILED ATTORNEY AND 25 RUSSIANS ACCUSED

GUILTY: MICHAEL FLYNN

Pleaded guilty to making false statements in December 2017. Awaiting sentence

Flynn was President Trump's former National Security Advisor and Robert Mueller's most senior scalp to date. He previously served when he was a three star general as President Obama's director of the Defense Intelligence Agency but was fired.

He admitted to lying to special counsel investigators about his conversations with a Russian ambassador in December 2016. He has agreed to cooperate with the special counsel investigation.

GUILTY: MICHAEL COHEN

Pleaded guilty to eight counts including fraud and two campaign finance violations in August 2018. Pleaded guilty to further count of lying to Congress in November 2018. Sentenced to three years in prison and $2 million in fines and forfeitures in December 2018

Cohen was Trump's longtime personal attorney, starting working for him and the Trump Organization in 2007. He is the longest-serving member of Trump's inner circle to be implicated by Mueller. Cohen professed unswerving devotion to Trump - and organized payments to silence two women who alleged they had sex with the-then candidate: porn star Stormy Daniels and Playboy model Karen McDougal. He admitted that payments to both women were felony campaign finance violations - and admitted that he acted at the 'direction' of 'Candidate-1': Donald Trump.

He also admitted tax fraud by lying about his income from loans he made, money from taxi medallions he owned, and other sources of income, at a cost to the Treasury of $1.3 million.

And he admitted lying to Congress in a rare use of the offense. The judge in his case let him report for prison on March 6 and recommended he serve it in a medium-security facility close to New York City.

GUILTY: PAUL MANAFORT

Found guilty of eight charges of bank and tax fraud in August 2018. Pleaded guilty to two further charges. Awaiting sentence

Manafort worked for Trump's campaign from March 2016 and chaired it from June to August 2016, overseeing Trump being adopted as Republican candidate at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland. He is the most senior campaign official to be implicated by Mueller. Manafort was one of Washington D.C.'s longest-term and most influential lobbyists but in 2015, his money dried up and the next year he turned to Trump for help, offering to be his campaign chairman for free - in the hope of making more money afterwards. But Mueller unwound his previous finances and discovered years of tax and bank fraud as he coined in cash from pro-Russia political parties and oligarchs in Ukraine.

Manafort pleaded not guilty to 18 charges of tax and bank fraud but was convicted of eight counts. The jury was deadlocked on the other 10 charges. A second trial on charges of failing to register as a foreign agent is due in September.

GUILTY: RICK GATES

Pleaded guilty to conspiracy against the United States and making false statements in February 2018. Awaiting sentence

Gates was Manafort's former deputy at political consulting firm DMP International. He admitted to conspiring to defraud the U.S. government on financial activity, and to lying to investigators about a meeting Manafort had with a member of congress in 2013. As a result of his guilty plea and promise of cooperation, prosecutors vacated charges against Gates on bank fraud, bank fraud conspiracy, failure to disclose foreign bank accounts, filing false tax returns, helping prepare false tax filings, and falsely amending tax returns.

GUILTY AND JAILED: GEORGE PAPADOPOLOUS

Pleaded guilty to making false statements in October 2017. Sentenced to 14 days in September 2018, and reported to prison in November. Served 12 days and released on December 7, 2018

Papadopoulos was a member of Donald Trump's campaign foreign policy advisory committee. He admitted to lying to special counsel investigators about his contacts with London professor Josef Mifsud and Ivan Timofeev, the director of a Russian government-funded think tank.

He has agreed to cooperate with the special counsel investigation.

GUILTY AND JAILED: RICHARD PINEDO

Pleaded guilty to identity fraud in February 2018. Sentenced to a year in prison

Pinedo is a 28-year-old computer specialist from Santa Paula, California. He admitted to selling bank account numbers to Russian nationals over the internet that he had obtained using stolen identities.

He has agreed to cooperate with the special counsel investigation.

GUILTY AND JAILED: ALEX VAN DER ZWAAN

Pleaded guilty to making false statements in February 2018. He served a 30-day prison sentence earlier this year and was deported to the Netherlands on his release

Van der Zwaan is a Dutch attorney for Skadden Arps who worked on a Ukrainian political analysis report for Paul Manafort in 2012.

He admitted to lying to special counsel investigators about when he last spoke with Rick Gates and Konstantin Kilimnik.

GUILTY: W. SAMUEL PATTEN

Pleaded guilty in August 2018 to failing to register as a lobbyist while doing work for a Ukrainian political party. Awaiting sentence

Patten, a long-time D.C. lobbyist was a business partner of Paul Manafort. He pleaded guilty to admitting to arranging an illegal $50,000 donation to Trump's inauguration.

He arranged for an American 'straw donor' to pay $50,000 to the inaugural committee, knowing that it was actually for a Ukrainian businessman.

Neither the American or the Ukrainian have been named.

CHARGED: KONSTANTIN KILIMNIK

Indicted for obstruction of justice and conspiracy to obstruct justice. At large, probably in Russia

Kilimnik is a former employee of Manafort's political consulting firm and helped him with lobbying work in Ukraine. He is accused of witness tampering, after he allegedly contacted individuals who had worked with Manafort to remind them that Manafort only performed lobbying work for them outside of the U.S.

He has been linked to Russian intelligence and is currently thought to be in Russia - effectively beyond the reach of extradition by Mueller's team.

INDICTED: THE RUSSIANS

Twenty-five Russian nationals and three Russian entities have been indicted for conspiracy to defraud the United States. They remain at large in Russia

Two of these Russian nationals were also indicted for conspiracy to commit wire fraud and 11 were indicted for conspiracy to launder money. Fifteen of them were also indicted for identity fraud.

Vladimir Putin has ridiculed the charges. Russia effectively bars extradition of its nationals. The only prospect Mueller has of bringing any in front of a U.S. jury is if Interpol has their names on an international stop list - which is not made public - and they set foot in a territory which extradites to the U.S.

INDICTED: MICHAEL FLYNN'S BUSINESS PARTNERS

Bijan Kian (left), number two in now disgraced former national security adviser Mike Flynn's lobbying company, and the two's business partner Ekim Alptekin (right) were indicted for conspiracy to lobby illegally. Kian is awaiting trial, Alptekin is still to appear in court

Kian, an Iranian-American was arrested and appeared in court charged with a conspiracy to illegally lobby the U.S government without registering as a foreign agent. Their co-conspirator was Flynn, who is called 'Person A' in the indictment and is not charged, offering some insight into what charges he escaped with his plea deal.

Kian, vice-president of Flynn's former lobbying firm, is alleged to have plotted with Alptekin to try to change U.S. policy on an exiled Turkish cleric, Fethullah Gulen, who lives in Pennsylvania and who is accused by Turkey's strongman president Recep Tayyip Erdogan, of trying to depose him.

Erdogan's government wanted him extradited from the U.S. and paid Flynn's firm through Alptekin for lobbying, including an op-ed in The Hill calling for Gulen to be ejected. Flynn and Kian both lied that the op-ed was not paid for by the Turkish government.

The indictment is a sign of how Mueller is taking an interest in more than just Russian involvement in the 2016 election."
387,daily mail online,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6509319/Sarah-Sanders-insists-Flynns-crimes-Trump.html,"Sarah Sanders insisted on Tuesday that crimes committed by President Trump's ex-national security adviser had 'nothing to do with the president' -- even though he told lies about his contacts with the Russians in the course of his service to Trump during an interview that took place at the White House.

Sanders claimed that Michael Flynn was 'ambushed' by the FBI and seemed to dispute that he'd actually lied as she wished the former White House official 'well' after a sentencing hearing.

Trump had told Flynn 'good luck' before it started and claimed that he would get a 'great deal' because he'd been mistreated.

Sanders defended the president's remarks, saying, 'It is perfectly acceptable for the president to make a positive comment about somebody while we wait to see what the court's determination is.'

Sarah Sanders insisted on Tuesday that crimes committed by President Trump's ex-national security adviser had 'nothing to do with the president,' even though he told lies about his contacts with the Russians while he was serving Trump after the election during an interview that took place at the White House

Flynn admits that he lied and said today that he knew it was a crime to do so, but believes his cooperation with the feds is redeeming enough to keep him out of jail.

The judge did not appear to agree with him, and Flynn asked for and received a delay in the hour before Sanders appeared on camera.

Sanders briefed reporters after a judge decided to delay Flynn's sentencing after lecturing him on the severity of his crimes and the bad example that it sets when a senior U.S. official to lie to the feds from the White House property.

Pressed to say whether the White House was 'concerned' that Flynn lied about his conversations with the Russian ambassador during the period after the election before Trump took the oath of office and became president, Sanders said it's up to the court if Flynn engaged in inappropriate behavior.

'Look the things that may have taken place, again that's up to the judge to make that determination, whether he engaged in something inappropriate,' she asserted.

Asked by DailyMail.com if the White House is disputing that Flynn lied -- given that Trump fired him for lying to the vice president about the same conversations with the Russians, Sanders dodged again.

'Maybe he did do those things, but that doesn't have anything to do with the president directly,' she asserted.

President Donald Trump's former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn, his attorney Robert Kelner and his wife Lori Andrade arrive at federal court in Washington, Tuesday, Dec. 18, 2018 for Flynn to receive sentencing following his guilty plea

Flynn sought to delay his sentencing on Tuesday after admitting in open court that he was 'guilty' of lying to the FBI only to get excoriated by a federal judge for 'selling out' his country.

Flynn faced the real possibility of jail time after Judge Emmet Sullivan repeatedly dressed-down the three-star general and former top Trump advisor in court for his lies.

'I cannot assure you, if you proceed today, you will not receive a sentence of incarceration, Sullivan told him. 'I'm not hiding my disgust, my disdain for this criminal offense,' he fumed.

Following a tense hearing filled with similar broadsides, Flynn and his lawyers changed course and asked to delay sentencing while Flynn continues to cooperate with prosecutors.

He will now have a status hearing on March 13 with his sentencing put off indefinitely. The government earlier said in court that Flynn may still be cooperate further, giving him an additional chance to prove his worth.

Sullivan kept alive the possibility of a prison sentence, nodding towards Flynn and saying: 'I don't promise him anything.'

Following angry lectures from the bench, Flynn sought a 30-minute break to huddle with his lawyers following his guilty plea.

Flynn exited the courthouse Tuesday afternoon without resolution - only to be met with rivaling cheers of 'Lock him up!' and 'USA.' Flynn had led a cheer of 'Lock her up' directed at Hillary Clinton during the 2016 Republican convention, when he was a top advisor to Donald Trump.

Sullivan had told him he sold out his country by lying about his Russia contacts from inside the White House - and asked prosecutors why they hadn't charged Flynn with treason.

Sullivan tied together both of the crimes Flynn admitted to committing: lying to cover up his Russia contacts, and lobbying on behalf of Turkey without disclosing his activities - and banking hundreds of thousands of dollars in the process.

'All along, you were an unregistered agent of a foreign country while serving as the National Security Advisor to the President of the United States. That undermines everything this flag over here stands for,' Sullivan thundered.

'Arguably you sold your country out.'

During the hearing, Flynn also told Sullivan knew that doing so was a crime when he met with investigators in 2016.

Judge Emmet Sullivan tore into Mike Flynn at his sentencing hearing

Flynn arrived in federal court for sentencing Tuesday following his guilty plea hours after getting 'good luck' wishes from his former boss.

During conversations with Sullivan in court, Flynn's team backed off it's claim that the FBI lead him into lying. That claim, contained in a memo to the judge in advance of sentencing, appears to have backfired, antagonizing the judge and putting Flynn's team in the awkward position of maintaining a guilty plea even after attacking the government's investigation.

Asked if Flynn had been 'entrapped by the FBI, lawyer Stephen Anthony replied, 'No, your Honor.'

That comment by Flynn's team was directly contradicted by the White House, where Sanders said Flynn was 'ambushed' by FBI agents. She made the claim on Fox News and doubled down on it at her briefing later.

'What we do know that was inappropriate, by own self-admittance of James Comey, is that the FBI broke standard protocol in the way that they came in and ambushed General Flynn, and in the way that they questioned him, and in the way that they encouraged him not to have White House Counsel's Office present,' she said.

'And we know that because James Comey told us that, and he said that the very reason that they did it was because -- the only reason that they did it, it was the Trump administration and they thought they could get away with it. Those are the facts.'

Flynn's lawyers had previously claimed that he was tricked into lying by the FBI but backed off the position in court on Tuesday as the former intelligence agency head tried to avoid any and all jail time.

Sullivan asked Flynn if he wanted to go ahead with his hearing because he was guilty. 'Yes, your honor,' Flynn replied. He declined an opportunity to withdraw his guilty plea.

Judge Sullivan told Flynn he would consider the 'substantial assistance' he has given the Mueller probe as well as his '33 years of military service and sacrifice'.

Flynn also said he was 'aware' that lying to FBI investigators was a crime.

He was hoping to avoid jail time after prosecutors vouched for his extensive cooperation with Special Counsel Robert Mueller, including 19 interviews, according to the government.

Asked if Flynn was still assisting prosecutors, the government was coy. 'It remains a possibility,' a prosecutor said.

'The more you assist the government, the more you arguably help yourself at the time of sentencing,' Sullivan responded.

Sullivan lectured Flynn about what he admitted he did, calling it a 'very serious offense,' noting that it involved a senior official lying to the FBI 'while on the physical premises of the White House.'

'It's a very serious offense. You can't minimize that,' said the judge.

'Arguably, you sold your country out,' said Sullivan.

At one point, Sullivan asked prosecutor Brandon Van Grack whether what Flynn did 'rises to the level of treasonous activity?'

Van Grack said prosecutors did not consider charging him with Treason - which carries the death penalty as a possible punishment.

Only later after a recess did Judge Sullivan said he was merely asking to get a sense of potential charges. ""I was just curious,' he said.

It was 'not something they had considered,' Van Grack responded.

'Could he have been charged with treason?' the judge asked.

Van Grack later in the hearing said he was confident Flynn did not commit treason.

Flynn came in for even more criticism over his admitted big bucks representation of Turkey without disclosing it.

After the short recess, Flynn's Attorney Robert Kelner told the court that Flynn had 'held nothing back' in his dealings with the Mueller case.

He said Flynn had agreed 'publicly, clearly, completely and utterly to cooperate, sending a signal to every other defendant.'

Kelner agreed, however, that sentencing should be delayed because Flynn may be asked to testify in the upcoming federal prosecution of Bijan Kian, Flynn's former business partner.

Kian, an Iranian-American, is accused of breaking the Foreign Agent Registration Act for failing to inform the State Department he was working for the Turkish government.

Turkish-Dutch dual national Ekim Alpetkin, another business partner of Kian and Flynn, is the subject of an arrest warrant but is thought to be in Turkey. Kian and Alpetkin are accused in court papers of a plot to convince the US government to extradite or otherwise expel Fethullah Gulen, a Turkish cleric who opposes the country's strongman president Recep Tayyip Erdogan.

The court heard Tuesday that Flynn could have been charged in that same indictment but the government decided not to prosecute to him because of his cooperation.

Judge Sullivan adjourned the case until noon on March 13 but he kept alive the possibility of a prison sentence, nodding towards Flynn and saying: 'I don't promise him anything.'

Sullivan also snapped at defense attorneys when they referred to a 2015 plead deal whereby David H. Petraeus, the ­storied wartime general and former CIA director, escaped with a misdemeanor charge and no jail time after he admitted mishandling classified material.

'I don't agree with the Petraeus sentence,' the judge said, before adding: 'It's none of my business, maybe there were extenuating circumstances. I don't know.' Sullivan also backpedaled on suggestions he felt Flynn should be charged with treason.

'I've never presided over a treason offense,' he said. 'I was just asking the question,' he said.

Flynn, who received the unusual boost from the president's Twitter account, arrived amid a smattering of protesters, including one calling him Vladimir Putin's puppet' and another calling him innocent and a 'great patriot.'

He was in the fortuitous position of having both the prosecution and the defense recommend he not face jail time, after special counsel Robert Mueller's prosecutors cited his extensive prosecution with the Russia probe and other investigations.

Flynn, who was accompanied by his wife Lori on Tuesday, has pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his conversations with former Russian ambassador to the US, Sergey Kislyak.

Interview notes by the FBI released Monday night reveal Flynn had numerous conversations and contacts with Kislyak, but denied a substantive conversation about lifting U.S. sanctions on Russia.

In a tweet Tuesday morning, Trump also denied collusion with Russia during his election campaign.

He wrote: 'Good luck today in court to General Michael Flynn.'

The president also wrote: 'Will be interesting to see what he has to say, despite tremendous pressure being put on him, about Russian Collusion in our great and, obviously, highly successful political campaign. There was no Collusion!'

It comes after Special Counsel Robert Mueller released a memo about the January 2017 interview in which Michael Flynn lied to the FBI about his contacts with the Russian government.

Sullivan, who received federal appointments from Presidents Reagan, George H.W. Bush, and Clinton, had ordered the special counsel to provide more documents, after Flynn's lawyers argued he was railroaded into giving an interview just days after starting work at the White House without benefit of having a lawyer present. The government argued that Flynn had long government service and should have known it was a crime not to be truthful with investigators.

At the interview, Flynn told investigators, among them now-former FBI agent Peter Strzok, about his conversations with Kislyak.

According to the 302 notes, when asked whether he pushed Russia for a particular position, 'FLYNN answered, 'No.'

Flynn 'stated the conversations were along the lines of where do you stand, and what's your position,' according to the 302.

The memo indicates that Flynn denied asking the Russian government for political favors, according to CNN.

The agents who interviewed him, meanwhile, kept pressing President Donald Trump's former National Security Adviser for more specifics.

It was that interview in which Flynn told investigators, among them now-former FBI agent Peter Strzok (above), about his conversations with then-Russian ambassador to the United States, Sergey Kislyak

Flynn told Strzok and other FBI agents who interviewed him that he and Kislyak did not discuss U.S. sanctions against Russia.

The memo also describes how Flynn played down his attempts to lobby Russia to oppose a United Nations Security Council resolution to condemn Israeli settlements.

Flynn initially told agents that he did not try to convince Russia to vote against the resolution.

'The interviewing agents asked Flynn if he recalled any discussions with Kislyak about a United Nations vote surrounding the issue of Israeli settlements,' the memo said.

'Flynn quickly responded, 'Yes, good reminder'.'

He was also asked by the agents whether he tried to encourage Kislyak and his government not to retaliate to the Obama administration's decision to expel Russian diplomats.

'Flynn responded, 'Not really. I don't remember.' It wasn't, 'Don't do anything.'

Liar, liar: Flynn will be sentenced for admitting lying to the FBI about his contact before the 2016 election with Kislyak, then Putin's ambassador to Washington D.C.

But the FBI knew Flynn asked Russia not to retaliate strongly to the expulsions, and had the benefit of monitoring of Kislyak's communications.

When Flynn pleaded guilty last year, he admitted that he did do just that.

The Special Counsel's office said in the memo that Flynn did ask Russia to 'refrain from escalating the situation.'

The memo was released after Flynn's lawyers suggested that investigators discouraged him from having an attorney present during the interview and never informed him it was a crime to lie.

Prosecutors shot back: 'He does not need to be warned it is a crime to lie to federal agents to know the importance of telling them the truth.'

The mere insinuation of underhanded tactics was startling given the seemingly productive relationship between the two sides, and it was especially striking since prosecutors with Mueller's office have praised Flynn's cooperation and recommended against prison time.

The defense arguments spurred speculation that Flynn, 59, may be trying to get sympathy from President Donald Trump or may be playing to a judge known for a zero-tolerance view of government misconduct.

At his side: Flynn became a vocal supporter of Trump and spoke at campaign rallies such as this one in Grand Junction, CO, and the Republican national convention in Cleveland, OH, where he led chants of 'lock her up'

Notorious meeting: Flynn traveled to Moscow in December 2015 and dined with Vladimir Putin to celebrate the 10th anniversary of RT, the Russian English-language propaganda channel

What a change of tone: In the run-up to his former aide's sentencing, Trump has turned from portraying him as a liar to saying that he did not, as the president steps up his attacks on the Mueller probe

'It's an attempt, I think, to perhaps characterize Flynn as a victim or perhaps to make him look sympathetic in the eyes of a judge - and, at the same time, to portray the special counsel in a negative light,' said former federal prosecutor Jimmy Gurule, a University of Notre Dame law school professor.

Until the dueling memos were filed last week, the sentencing hearing for Flynn - who pleaded guilty to lying about a conversation during the transition period with the then-Russian ambassador - was expected to be devoid of the drama characterizing other of Mueller's cases.

Prosecutors, for instance, have accused former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort of lying to them even after he agreed to cooperate.

Another potential target, Jerome Corsi, leaked draft court documents and accused Mueller's team of bullying him.

And George Papadopoulos, a Trump campaign adviser recently released from a two-week prison sentence, has lambasted the investigation and publicly claimed that he was set up.

Flynn, by contrast, has been notably silent even as his supporters advocated a more combative stance. He met privately with investigators 19 times and provided cooperation so extensive that prosecutors said he was entitled to avoid prison altogether.

Then came his sentencing memo.

Although Flynn and his attorneys stopped short of any direct accusations of wrongdoing, they took pains to note that Flynn, unlike other defendants in Mueller's investigation, was not informed that it was against the law to lie to the FBI.

They suggest the FBI, which approached Flynn at the White House just days after Trump's inauguration, played to his desire to keep the encounter quiet by telling him the quickest way to get the interview done was for him to be alone with the agents - rather than involve lawyers.

They also insinuate that Flynn, of Middletown, Rhode Island, deserves credit for not publicly seizing on the fact that FBI officials involved in the investigation later came under scrutiny themselves.

Former Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, who contacted Flynn to arrange the interview, was fired this year for what the Justice Department said was a lack of candor over a news media leak.

Strzok, one of the two agents who interviewed Flynn, was removed from Mueller's team and later fired for trading anti-Trump texts with another FBI official.

Business partners: Flynn was in business with Bijan Kian (second left). Kian, an Iranian-American, is now indicted on charges of lobbying illegally along with Flynn, who appears to have flipped on him. Flynn's wife Lori is expected at his sentencing

Mueller's team has sharply pushed back at any suggestion that Flynn was duped, with prosecutors responding in their own sentencing memo Friday that there was no obligation to warn Flynn against lying.

'A sitting National Security (Adviser), former head of an intelligence agency, retired Lieutenant General, and 33-year veteran of the armed forces knows he should not lie to federal agents,' prosecutors wrote.

Former FBI Director James Comey criticized the broadsides on the Flynn investigation during a Monday appearance on Capitol Hill, saying, 'They're up here attacking the FBI's investigation of a guy who pled guilty to lying to the FBI.'

Trump has made no secret that he sees Mueller's investigation as a 'witch hunt' and has continued to lash out at prosecutors he sees as biased against him and those who help them.

He's shown continued sympathy for Flynn, though, calling him a 'great person' and asserting - erroneously - that the FBI has said he didn't lie.

Flynn has not tried to retract his guilty plea, and there's every indication the sentencing will proceed as scheduled.

Arun Rao, a former Justice Department prosecutor in Maryland, said the defense memo is striking because it's 'inconsistent' with Flynn's cooperative stance so far.

'You also wonder in this very unusual situation,' he said, 'whether it is a play for a pardon.'

It's also possible that at least some of the defense arguments may resonate with U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan, who directed prosecutors to produce FBI records related to Flynn's interview.

Scalp: Flynn will become the fourth of Robert Mueller's targets to be sentenced

Sullivan was the judge in the Justice Department's botched prosecution of now-deceased Republican Sen. Ted Stevens of Alaska.

He dismissed the case after prosecutors admitted that they withheld exculpatory evidence, prompting the judge to say that in nearly 25 years on the bench, 'I've never seen anything approaching the mishandling and misconduct that I've seen in this case.'

In an opinion piece for The Wall Street Journal last year, Sullivan said the case inspired him to explicitly remind prosecutors in every criminal case before him of their obligation to provide defendants with favorable evidence. He says he has encouraged colleagues to do the same.

But while Sullivan has proved especially sensitive to hints of government overreach, nothing about the Flynn case comes close, said Gurule, the law professor.

'To portray him as somehow an innocent dupe, as somehow just this innocent victim in the process, this suggestion that there was a perjury trap - it's an absurd allegation,' he said.

But the sentencing also comes the day after a dramatic move by Mueller to arrest Flynn's former business partner and reveal that Flynn had been part of an effort to lobby illegally.

Bijan Kian, an Iranian-American who was number two to Flynn was arrested and appeared in federal court in Washington D.C. before being freed on bail.

He is charged with a plot to lobby for Turkey without declaring that he and Flynn's firm was working for the Turkish government, breaking the Foreign Agent Registration Act which makes it illegal to lobby for foreign governments without registering with the State Department. Kian has yet to enter a plea.

Also indicted was the business partner who worked with him and Flynn, Turkish-Dutch dual national Ekim Alpetkin, who is the subject of an arrest warrant and thought to be in Turkey.

Kian and Alpetkin are accused in court papers of a plot to convince the U.S. government to extradite or otherwise expel Fethullah Gulen, a Turkish cleric who is a deadly rival of the country's strongman president Recep Tayyip Erdogan.

Mueller says in the court papers that with Flynn, who is referred to a 'Person A' they placed an op-ed in The Hill newspaper without acknowledging that it was at the prompting of the Turkish government.

Flynn wrote the op-ed and his firm, The Flynn Intel Group, was paid $600,000 for their lobbying campaign - but he is not indicted himself in what appears to be a sign that he flipped on his former associates.

The special counsel has praised the former Trump administration official for his 'substantial help' in several investigations. It is believed this is one of them.

ROBERT MUELLER'S PROBE SO FAR: EIGHT CONVICTIONS - INCLUDING THREE TOP TRUMP AIDES, A JAILED ATTORNEY AND 25 RUSSIANS ACCUSED

GUILTY: MICHAEL FLYNN

Pleaded guilty to making false statements in December 2017. Awaiting sentence

Flynn was President Trump's former National Security Advisor and Robert Mueller's most senior scalp to date. He previously served when he was a three star general as President Obama's director of the Defense Intelligence Agency but was fired.

He admitted to lying to special counsel investigators about his conversations with a Russian ambassador in December 2016. He has agreed to cooperate with the special counsel investigation.

GUILTY: MICHAEL COHEN

Pleaded guilty to eight counts including fraud and two campaign finance violations in August 2018. Pleaded guilty to further count of lying to Congress in November 2018. Sentenced to three years in prison and $2 million in fines and forfeitures in December 2018

Cohen was Trump's longtime personal attorney, starting working for him and the Trump Organization in 2007. He is the longest-serving member of Trump's inner circle to be implicated by Mueller. Cohen professed unswerving devotion to Trump - and organized payments to silence two women who alleged they had sex with the-then candidate: porn star Stormy Daniels and Playboy model Karen McDougal. He admitted that payments to both women were felony campaign finance violations - and admitted that he acted at the 'direction' of 'Candidate-1': Donald Trump.

He also admitted tax fraud by lying about his income from loans he made, money from taxi medallions he owned, and other sources of income, at a cost to the Treasury of $1.3 million.

And he admitted lying to Congress in a rare use of the offense. The judge in his case let him report for prison on March 6 and recommended he serve it in a medium-security facility close to New York City.

GUILTY: PAUL MANAFORT

Found guilty of eight charges of bank and tax fraud in August 2018. Pleaded guilty to two further charges. Awaiting sentence

Manafort worked for Trump's campaign from March 2016 and chaired it from June to August 2016, overseeing Trump being adopted as Republican candidate at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland. He is the most senior campaign official to be implicated by Mueller. Manafort was one of Washington D.C.'s longest-term and most influential lobbyists but in 2015, his money dried up and the next year he turned to Trump for help, offering to be his campaign chairman for free - in the hope of making more money afterwards. But Mueller unwound his previous finances and discovered years of tax and bank fraud as he coined in cash from pro-Russia political parties and oligarchs in Ukraine.

Manafort pleaded not guilty to 18 charges of tax and bank fraud but was convicted of eight counts. The jury was deadlocked on the other 10 charges. A second trial on charges of failing to register as a foreign agent is due in September.

GUILTY: RICK GATES

Pleaded guilty to conspiracy against the United States and making false statements in February 2018. Awaiting sentence

Gates was Manafort's former deputy at political consulting firm DMP International. He admitted to conspiring to defraud the U.S. government on financial activity, and to lying to investigators about a meeting Manafort had with a member of congress in 2013. As a result of his guilty plea and promise of cooperation, prosecutors vacated charges against Gates on bank fraud, bank fraud conspiracy, failure to disclose foreign bank accounts, filing false tax returns, helping prepare false tax filings, and falsely amending tax returns.

GUILTY AND JAILED: GEORGE PAPADOPOLOUS

Pleaded guilty to making false statements in October 2017. Sentenced to 14 days in September 2018, and reported to prison in November. Served 12 days and released on December 7, 2018

Papadopoulos was a member of Donald Trump's campaign foreign policy advisory committee. He admitted to lying to special counsel investigators about his contacts with London professor Josef Mifsud and Ivan Timofeev, the director of a Russian government-funded think tank.

He has agreed to cooperate with the special counsel investigation.

GUILTY AND JAILED: RICHARD PINEDO

Pleaded guilty to identity fraud in February 2018. Sentenced to a year in prison

Pinedo is a 28-year-old computer specialist from Santa Paula, California. He admitted to selling bank account numbers to Russian nationals over the internet that he had obtained using stolen identities.

He has agreed to cooperate with the special counsel investigation.

GUILTY AND JAILED: ALEX VAN DER ZWAAN

Pleaded guilty to making false statements in February 2018. He served a 30-day prison sentence earlier this year and was deported to the Netherlands on his release

Van der Zwaan is a Dutch attorney for Skadden Arps who worked on a Ukrainian political analysis report for Paul Manafort in 2012.

He admitted to lying to special counsel investigators about when he last spoke with Rick Gates and Konstantin Kilimnik.

GUILTY: W. SAMUEL PATTEN

Pleaded guilty in August 2018 to failing to register as a lobbyist while doing work for a Ukrainian political party. Awaiting sentence

Patten, a long-time D.C. lobbyist was a business partner of Paul Manafort. He pleaded guilty to admitting to arranging an illegal $50,000 donation to Trump's inauguration.

He arranged for an American 'straw donor' to pay $50,000 to the inaugural committee, knowing that it was actually for a Ukrainian businessman.

Neither the American or the Ukrainian have been named.

CHARGED: KONSTANTIN KILIMNIK

Indicted for obstruction of justice and conspiracy to obstruct justice. At large, probably in Russia

Kilimnik is a former employee of Manafort's political consulting firm and helped him with lobbying work in Ukraine. He is accused of witness tampering, after he allegedly contacted individuals who had worked with Manafort to remind them that Manafort only performed lobbying work for them outside of the U.S.

He has been linked to Russian intelligence and is currently thought to be in Russia - effectively beyond the reach of extradition by Mueller's team.

INDICTED: THE RUSSIANS

Twenty-five Russian nationals and three Russian entities have been indicted for conspiracy to defraud the United States. They remain at large in Russia

Two of these Russian nationals were also indicted for conspiracy to commit wire fraud and 11 were indicted for conspiracy to launder money. Fifteen of them were also indicted for identity fraud.

Vladimir Putin has ridiculed the charges. Russia effectively bars extradition of its nationals. The only prospect Mueller has of bringing any in front of a U.S. jury is if Interpol has their names on an international stop list - which is not made public - and they set foot in a territory which extradites to the U.S.

INDICTED: MICHAEL FLYNN'S BUSINESS PARTNERS

Bijan Kian (left), number two in now disgraced former national security adviser Mike Flynn's lobbying company, and the two's business partner Ekim Alptekin (right) were indicted for conspiracy to lobby illegally. Kian is awaiting trial, Alptekin is still to appear in court

Kian, an Iranian-American was arrested and appeared in court charged with a conspiracy to illegally lobby the U.S government without registering as a foreign agent. Their co-conspirator was Flynn, who is called 'Person A' in the indictment and is not charged, offering some insight into what charges he escaped with his plea deal.

Kian, vice-president of Flynn's former lobbying firm, is alleged to have plotted with Alptekin to try to change U.S. policy on an exiled Turkish cleric, Fethullah Gulen, who lives in Pennsylvania and who is accused by Turkey's strongman president Recep Tayyip Erdogan, of trying to depose him.

Erdogan's government wanted him extradited from the U.S. and paid Flynn's firm through Alptekin for lobbying, including an op-ed in The Hill calling for Gulen to be ejected. Flynn and Kian both lied that the op-ed was not paid for by the Turkish government.

The indictment is a sign of how Mueller is taking an interest in more than just Russian involvement in the 2016 election."

'We're going to do whatever is necessary to build the border wall to stop this ongoing crisis of illegal immigration,' Miller said on CBS' 'Face the Nation.'

Asked if that meant a shut down when the government runs out of funding on Friday, he replied: 'If it comes to it, absolutely.'

Trump is trying to get $5 billion to fund his wall before Democrats take control of the House

As Miller talked tough on TV, Trump took to Twitter to defend his actions on immigration policy and to advocate for tougher measures.

'The Democrats policy of Child Seperation on the Border during the Obama Administration was far worse than the way we handle it now. Remember the 2014 picture of children in cages - the Obama years. However, if you don't separate, FAR more people will come. Smugglers use the kids!,' he wrote.

Trump was heavily criticized for his policy of separating migrant kids from their parents.

During that time, photos went viral of kids behind bars, but they were later revealed to be from 2014, when President Barack Obama was in office.

The Obama administration did not enforce the separation policy the way the Trump administration has done.

Trump walked back his policy after first lady Melania Trump, his daughter Ivanka Trump and members of his own party said they disagreed with it.

Sunday's tweet seemed to suggest he was considering reinforcement.

'However, if you don't separate, FAR more people will come. Smugglers use the kids!,' he wrote.

Miller said a border wall was necessary for U.S. security.

'This is a very fundamental issue. At stake is the question of whether or not the United States remains a sovereign country. Whether or not we can establish and enforce rules for entrance into our country. The Democrat Party has a simple choice, they can either choose to fight for America's working class or to promote illegal immigration. You can't do both,' he said.

The White House and Capitol Hill are in a lock down over funding for the wall, which is estimated to cost $5 billion.

Democrats are willing to cough up $1.3 billion and want additional protections for immigrants like the Dreamers, illegals who were brought to the country by their parents as children.

Friday is the deadline to fund the government.

Without a new spending bill, about 25 percent of the $1.2 trillion federal budget - including funds for the Department of Homeland Security - will expire after Dec. 21.

Trump was said on Friday to be shopping a two-week delay in hostilities after declaring on Tuesday that he would 'absolutely' preside over a shutdown until Congress approves $5 billion for his border wall.

That would push the fight that could furlough federal workers over the Christmas holiday into early next year. Trump will have lost much of his leverage by then, as Democrats take the majority in the House, but as he made clear in a Thursday tweet he now sees the value of avoiding an expensive and potentially toxic government closure.

'Let's not do a shutdown, Democrats - do what's right for the American people!' Trump had tweeted.

But this could be the president's last chance to fully fund his wall. Democrats take control of the House of Representatives on Jan. 3 and they are not likely to give Trump the money he needs to make his wall a reality.

Trump, in an extraordinary Oval Office shouting match with Democratic leaders Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi last week, said he would shut down the government if he didn't get his funding - and take responsibility for it.

'I will shut down the government. Absolutely,' he said.

For twenty minutes, Pelosi and Schumer sparred with Trump on camera, emphasizing their long-stated position that he cannot have his border wall funding.

Furious, the president said that he would shut down the government if they don't give it to him.

'You want to put that on [me], I'll take it,' he rebutted as Schumer told him that the last government closure was his fault, too. 'You know what I'll say: Yes, if we don't get what we want, one way or the other -- whether it's through you, through a military, through anything you want to call -- I will shut down the government. Absolutely.'

Schumer was willing to let the argument rest there, but Trump dug in, saying repeatedly that he'd shut the government down and happily take the blame.

'I am proud to shut down the government for border security, Chuck, because the people of this country don't want criminals and people that have lots of problems and drugs pouring into our country. So I will take the mantle,' he said. 'I will be the one to shut it down. I'm not going to blame you for it. The last time you shut it down, it didn't work. I will take the mantle of shutting down.'"
389,daily mail online,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6495609/Will-Cohen-dish-dirt-Trump-prepares-hear-presidents-former-lawyer-finally-tell-all.html,"By Miranda Aldersley For Dailymail.com and Geoff Earle, Deputy U.s. Political Editor For Dailymail.com

Donald Trump's longtime lawyer and 'fixer' Michael Cohen delivered a scathing tell-all interview where he said his former boss 'directed' him to negotiate hush payments in order to benefit Trump and his campaign - implicating his ex-boss in a crime that is putting him in jail.

Cohen told ABC anchor George Stephanopoulos on 'Good Morning America' Friday that 'of course' the President knew it was wrong to pay off two women, and said he had only an advisory role in the $150,000 that went to former Playboy model Karen McDougal as part of a plan prosecutors say was hatched by Trump, Cohen, and National Enquirer boss David Pecker.

Cohen's disclosures came as Trump was in increasing legal peril over the $130,000 payment to porn star Stormy Daniels, which Cohen made through an LLC he had set up for the purpose, and the payoff to McDougal in exchange for the 'life rights' to her story of an affair. Both women claim they had affairs with Trump, who denies it.

He also provided new details on his role regarding a $150,000 payment that National Enquirer publisher American Media Inc. made to bury McDougal's story, and put it in the context of Trump's furious effort to capture the White House.

'Of course' Trump knew what he was doing was wrong, said Cohen, who regretted his 'blind loyalty' to his longtime employer.

'And he was doing that to help his election?' asked Stephanopoulos.

'You have to remember at what point in time that this matter came about - two weeks or so before the election. Post the Billy Bush [""p**** tape""] comments, so, yes, he was very concerned about how this would affect the election,' Cohen replied.

'To help his campaign?' the host inquired.

'To help him and the campaign,' Cohen responded.

Cohen: 'People of the United States of America, people of the world, don't believe what [Trump] is saying'

Trump 'directed' Cohen to make a $130,000 to Daniels, a porn star, as well as review a separate hush agreement with McDougal, a former Playboy model, 'to help him and the campaign.'

That language relates to the felony crime that Cohen pleaded guilty to, contributing to his three year jail sentence. It has also brought Trump in increasing legal peril, with the president's word going up against not only Cohen, David Pecker of the National Enquirer, which reached its own cooperation agreement with prosecutors.

Cohen asserted repeatedly that it was not just his word against Trump's, mentioning 'others' who know what happened.

'He knows the truth, I know the truth, others know the truth, and here is the truth: The people of the United States of America, people of the world, don't believe what he is saying. The man doesn't tell the truth. And it is sad that I should take responsibility for his dirty deeds,' Cohen said.

He also sought to rebut the president's claim of Thursday: that he was a victim of bad lawyering, and that Cohen was to blame if any crime was committed, which Trump maintains didn't happen.

'I don't think there is anybody that believes that. First of all, nothing at the Trump Organization was ever done unless it was run through Mr. Trump,' Cohen said.

'He directed me, as I said in my allocution and I said as well in the plea, he directed me to make the payments, he directed me to become involved in these matters. Including the one with McDougal, which was really between him and David Pecker and then David Pecker's counsel,' Cohen continued.

'I just reviewed the documents ... in order to protect him. I gave loyalty to someone who truthfully does not deserve loyalty.'

Cohen's slashing comments aired a day after Trump was revealed to be the third man who attended a 2015 meeting with Cohen and Pecker where they forged a plan to keep the president's alleged affairs out of the press.

That 2015 meeting was outlined in a letter prosecutors sent to AMI that revealed its cooperation and statement of facts about the 'catch and kill' arrangement - opening up yet another dangerous avenue for Trump.

To those who would doubt Cohen due to his lies in the past, the former Trump loyalist pointed to the language Special Counsel Robert Mueller's office put in a sentencing memo vouching for his cooperation.

'Because the special counsel stated emphatically that the information that I gave to them is credible and helpful. There is a substantial amount of information that they possessed that corroborates the fact that I am telling the truth,' Cohen said.

The explosive interview is Cohen's first since he was sentenced to three years in prison for the McDougal and Daniels campaign finance violations among other crimes.

He did not mince his words, issuing the people of America a stark warning.

'Here is the truth,' he said. 'People of the United States of America, people of the world, don't believe what he is saying. The man doesn't tell the truth. And it is sad that I should take responsibility for his dirty deeds.'

Admitting it is 'never good to be on the wrong side of the president of the United States of America' Cohen also said he is 'angry at himself' for helping Trump because he 'gave loyalty to someone who, truthfully, does not deserve loyalty,' he said.

Cohen was sentenced to three years in jail on Wednesday for multiple crimes - including bank fraud, campaign finance violations and lying to Congress.

However he does not have to report to prison in Otisville - around 70 miles from New York City - to begin his 36-month sentence until March 6.

In the GMA interview, Cohen expressed his wish to 'not be the villain' of the saga and defended himself against the President, who has publicly attacked him numerous times since he pleaded guilty to a 'veritable smorgasbord' of charges in August.

The crime that is most perilous for Trump - who is said to be 'privately fretting over impeachment' is Cohen's campaign violation payments.

Prosecutors say a figure identified as 'Individual-1' - Trump - 'directed' Cohen to make a $130,000 payment to porn star Stormy Daniels, who claims she had an affair with the president.

Trump initially denied any payment, but on Thursday put forward the defense that it was his lawyer's job to know the law.

Trump distanced himself from the $150,000 deal in an interview with Fox News on Thursday

'I never directed Michael Cohen to break the law,' Trump wrote on Twitter yesterday. 'He was a lawyer and he is supposed to know the law. It is called 'advice of counsel,' and a lawyer has great liability if a mistake is made.'

But Cohen told Stephanopoulos: 'I don't think there is anybody that believes that.

'First of all, nothing at the Trump organization was ever done unless it was run through Mr. Trump. He directed me to make the payments, he directed me to become involved in these matters.'

Trump said Cohen agreed to plead guilty before a federal judge 'in order to embarrass the president and get a much reduced prison sentence,' after his former lawyer was sentenced to three years in jail

Trump then went on to say Cohen agreed to plead guilty before a federal judge 'in order to embarrass the president and get a much reduced prison sentence.'

In his GMA interview, Cohen hit back saying: 'It is absolutely not true. Under no circumstances do I want to embarrass the president. He knows the truth. I know the truth.'

The President's Twitter outburst also appeared to dangle a hint that Cohen's family members will be facing prosecution in the future.

Cohen, who was engaged in the taxi medallion business with his father-in-law, furiously slammed this comment, telling Stephanopoulos: 'Instead of him taking responsibility for his actions, what does he do? He attacks my family.'

An anguished Cohen also said his family come first and he was 'done with the lying'.

'I am done being loyal to President Trump and my first loyalty belongs to my wife, my daughter, my son and this country,' he said.

However, Trump's former trusted fixer is not quite done fixing - although his priorities are different now. 'I will spend the rest of my life in order to fix the mistake that I made.'

Trump's previous attacks on Cohen, in which he called him 'a weak person and not a very smart person' as well as a 'rat' were repeatedly mentioned during the lawyer's dramatic trial.

Cohen also gave an emotional explanation of what it took to provide information against the President.

Michael Cohen's weepy statements in court

I stand before your honor humbly and painfully aware that we are here for one reason.

I take full responsibility for each act that I pled guilty to: The personal ones to me and those involving the President of the United States of America.

This may seem hard to believe, but today is one of the most meaningful days of my life.

I have been living in personal and mental incarceration ever since the day that I accepted the offer to work for a real estate mogul whose business acumen that I deeply admired. In fact, I now know there is little to admire.

Recently the president tweeted a statement calling me weak and it was correct, but for a much different reason than he was implying. It was because time and time again I felt it was my duty to cover up his dirty deeds.

I blame myself for the conduct which has brought me here today and it was my own weakness and a blind loyalty to this man that led me to choose a path of darkness over light.

Seeing the unbearable pain that my associations and my actions have brought to my entire family - this is why I did not enter into a cooperation agreement.

I do not need a cooperation agreement in place to do the right thing. I will continue to cooperate.

I want to apologize to the people of the United States. You deserve to know the truth and lying to you was unjust.

I am committed to proving my integrity and making sure history will not remember me as the villain in his story.

I'm truly sorry and I promise I will be better.

He told the courtroom: 'I have been living in personal and mental incarceration ever since the day that I accepted the offer to work for a real estate mogul whose business acumen I deeply admired. In fact, I now know there is little to admire.'

'Recently the president tweeted a statement calling me weak and it was correct, but for a much different reason than he was implying. It was because time and time again I felt it was my duty to cover up his dirty deeds.'

'I blame myself for the conduct which has brought me here today and it was my own weakness and a blind loyalty to this man that led me to choose a path of darkness over light,' Cohen added.

The President said in an interview with Fox News yesterday that he made a mistake in trusting Cohen, saying: 'I hire usually good people.'

'I liked him and he was a lawyer,' he said. 'In retrospect I made a mistake.'

In the same interview Trump also made a jibe at Cohen by claiming former national security advisor Michael Flynn - also caught up in the Mueller investigation into possible Russian interference in Trump's election - faces no jail time because 'He's a tougher kind of a guy than Cohen.'

Cohen's lawyer, Lanny Davis, appeared on CBS 'This Morning' and suggested his client still had more information to share.

Davis quoted back a term used by Mueller's sentencing memo, which argued that Cohen's help had been 'core' to his investigation.

Cohen himself said of GMA that: 'the special counsel stated emphatically that the information that I gave to them is credible and helpful.'

'There's a substantial amount of information that they possessed that corroborates the fact that I am telling the truth.'

Cohen refused to answer specific questions about the investigation, saying he did not want to jeopardize it had respect for due process.

But asked whether he thinks the Trump is telling the truth about the Russia probe, Cohen did tell Stephanopoulos simply, 'No.'

Ahead of the interview, Cohen's lawyer Lanny Davis told Vanity Fair that this interview could make Cohen the 'next generation of what John Dean was to Richard Nixon'.

Dean was Nixon's former White House Counsel who covered up the Watergate scandal and then struck a deal with prosecutors to become a key witness in exchange for reduce jail time. He is regarded as instrumental in Nixon's downfall.

'Go to Congress, and turn the television cameras on, and tell us all that you know about Donald Trump over the years. Not just about the Mueller investigation -- over the years,' Davis told Vanity Fair.

Trump, meanwhile has reportedly told allies in his closest circle that he is alarmed by the possibility of impeachment, despite publicly stating that he isn't concerned.

On Thursday, the president was revealed to be the third man who attended a 2015 meeting with Cohen and American Media Inc. boss David Pecker where they forged a plan to keep Trump's alleged affairs out of the press.

'The entire question about whether the president committed an impeachable offense now hinges on the testimony of two men: David Pecker (left) and Allen Weisselberg (right), both cooperating witnesses in the SDNY investigation,' a friend of Trump's claims

The meeting, which was referenced in a letter federal prosecutors sent to National Enquirer publisher American Media Inc, included an offer by the company CEO to 'help deal with negative stories about the presidential candidate's relationships with women'.

With Trump identified as having been there, it means he was present when a plan was developed that ultimately led to Cohen pleading guilty to a felony and getting three years in jail.

It also led to a cooperation agreement with prosecutors in which Pecker - one of Trump's former best friends - would not be prosecuted 'for any crimes' related to campaign finance law resulting from the meeting.

Cohen pleaded guilty to campaign and banking violations after he created a shell company to transfer $130,000 to porn star Stormy Daniels, who claims she had an affair with Trump.

AMI gave $150,000 to Playboy model Karen McDougal, who says she had a 10-month affair with the president, and Cohen was involved in discussions relating to this.

That could leave Trump as the odd man out if he continues his denials that he did anything wrong and never 'directed' Cohen to break the law and he is now the only person in the room who claims that the hush money wasn't used to impact the outcome of the election.

The documents revealing the deal make clear that Pecker agreed to flip - and is still cooperating with federal authorities.

They do not say who he and his company flipped on, raising the possibility that he has handed over information on his former friend, Trump.

The news comes amid a spike in talk in Washington about the possibility that the president could be charged with directing a federal crime, even if it is ultimately held that he is immune from such charges due to his office and the Justice Department's prior interpretation of the Constitution that sitting presidents cannot be indicted, only impeached.

A statement of facts spelled out the $150,000 payment to a former Playboy model and that AMI knew about federal campaign laws at the time it reached the deal

After the bombshell development, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said: 'The president was clear that he directed no one to do anything wrong, particularly Michael Cohen. He's been clear on this.'

DOJ's Office of Legal Counsel determined during the Nixon Administration that a sitting president could not be indicted, although its position has not been tested in court.

Amid the swirling developments of the week, one powerful Democrat, Rep. Adam Schiff of California, is calling for that interpretation to change.

Although the founders included impeachment in the constitution as a political remedy, critics of the status quo have argued they never intended to give the executive a 'free pass' for crimes just by holding office, including alleged crimes that helped a president obtain the White House.

Trump's inauguration is probed for 'accepting cash-for-access from the Middle East'

Federal prosecutors are reportedly looking into whether some of the top donors to Trump's 2017 inauguration gave money in exchange for access to his administration, policy concessions or to influence the administration.

The inquiry is particularly focusing on Middle Eastern donors like Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates.

According to The New York Times, investigators are trying to determine whether those nations used straw donors to disguise their donations to President Donald Trump's inaugural committee and the pro-Trump super PAC, Rebuilding America Now, in hopes of buying influence.

Foreign nations are prohibited from contributing to federal campaigns, PACs and inaugural funds by law.

Federal prosecutors are also examining whether Trump's inaugural committee misspent some of the $107million it raised.

The investigation came partly out of materials seized in the federal probe of Trump's former personal attorney Michael Cohen's business dealings, according to The Wall Street Journal.

During April raids of Cohen's home, office and hotel room, federal agents obtained a recorded conversation between Cohen and Stephanie Winston Wolkoff, a former adviser to Melania Trump, who worked on the inaugural events.

In their conversation, Wolkoff expressed concern about how the inaugural committee was spending its money.

Wolkoff, a former Vogue staffer who is one of the first lady's longtime friends, left the administration in February after reports her firm, WIS Media Partners, received $26million in payments to help plan the inauguration.

She was an unpaid adviser to the first lady.

It's unknown when the conversation between Wolkoff and Cohen took place or why it was recorded.

'I think the Justice Department needs to re-examine that OLC opinion, the Office of Legal Counsel opinion, that you cannot indict a sitting president under circumstances in which the failure to do so may mean that person escapes justice,' Schiff told CNN on Wednesday, hours after Cohen pleaded guilty to breaking campaign finance laws and other matters.

Meanwhile, impeachment - a subject Democratic leaders sought to tamp down before the elections - continues to hover over the courtroom developments.

If it is determined that the Justice Department can't or won't charge Trump, even with a recommendation from Special Counsel Robert Mueller, it would then fall to House Democrats to begin the process that can result in the president's removal from office.

Adding to the pressure on Democrats will be the statute of limitations on potential campaign finance crimes. That could allow Trump to avoid facing charges by winning election to a second term - even as his subordinate Cohen cools his heels in jail well past the time Trump would again take the oath of office.

Former Acting Solicitor General under President Barack Obama, Neal Katyal, wrote Wednesday on Twitter that existing special counsel regulations 'put thumb on scale of Mueller asking Acting AG to indict, as that is the one way Mueller can be sure info he has uncovered in his investigation is provided to Congress. EVEN if Mueller thinks AG would say no, he may need to ask'.

Despite the current regulations, Mueller could ask the Justice Department to allow for a waiver to indict, according to Katyal.

If the official overseeing the Russia probe refuses, Mueller would be required to report it to Congress - which would then have that information as it considered any impeachment proceedings.

It is not entirely clear who is even overseeing the probe who would make that call.

Trump installed loyalist Matt Whitaker as Acting Attorney General, but Justice has refused media requests for information on whether Whitaker received an ethics review of any potential conflicts, following a slew of comments critical of the Mueller investigation.

If he weren't in an oversight role, it could be Deputy Attorney Gen Rod Rosenstein who would make the call.

Trump 'and his Republican supporters do not appreciate what legal analysts do: that the president is in serious legal jeopardy and it is mounting,' wrote former federal prosecutor Renato Mariotti in Politico.

In a statement, the US Attorney's Office for the Southern District said it agreed not to prosecute AMI after the company admitted 'that it made the $150,000 payment in concert with a candidate's presidential campaign, and in order to ensure that the woman did not publicize damaging allegations about the candidate before the 2016 presidential election'.

Representatives for AMI and Pecker could not be immediately reached for comment.

Federal prosecutors in New York are also examining whether Trump's 2017 inaugural committee misspent some of the $107million it raised.

The investigation is looking into whether some of the top donors to Trump's crowning event gave money in exchange for access to his administration, policy concessions or to influence the administration, according to The Wall Street Journal.

Money in exchange for political favors could violate federal corruption laws.

There could also be a violation of federal law if funds were diverted from the inaugural committee, which was registered as a nonprofit.

'That doesn't have anything to do with the president or the first lady,' White House press secretary Sanders said Thursday night.

'The biggest thing the president did in his engagement for the inauguration was to come here and raise his hand and take the oath of office. The president was focused on the transition during that time and not on any of the planning.'"

Christmas has arrived a bit early for a deported Mexican mother.

Maria Mendoza-Sanchez returned to the United States on Saturday on a special visa for workers, 16 months after she and her spouse were ordered to return to their native country.

Her husband, Eusebio Sanchez, was not eligible for the visa waiver and remained in Mexico.

'There were many nights I couldn't sleep,' Mendoza-Sanchez said in front of a bevy of media members that assembled for a makeshift press conference at San Francisco International Airport on Saturday night, according to KRON4.

'There were many days I was ready to give up. This is really a dream that I never expected was going to come true.'

Maria Mendoza-Sanchez is back in the United States on Saturday on a special visa for workers after a deportation order forced her to abandon the U.S. in August 2017

The couple's American dream crashed when it was informed in May 2017 that it had three months to abandon the family home in Oakland, California, by the United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement [ICE] agency.

Although an immigration judge in 2013 ordered the family removed, immigration officials under the Obama administration offered the couple one-year stays of deportation.

The family thought their immigration fears were close to being solved under the 2014 Deferred Action for Parents of Americans program supported by Obama, which offered protection to parents of citizens from deportation as long as they arrived before 2010.

But opponents of the law shut it down in courts.

The family's worst fears were confirmed on election night 2016 when Donald Trump won the presidency.

Mendoza-Sanchez and her husband encountered an ICE agency under the Trump administration that was not too keen to the family's wishes.

Government officials had denied the family's request to delay their deportation order because the couple had entered the country illegally and spent two decades living as undocumented immigrants.

Mendoza-Sanchez, a nurse, saw her family split in two as she left her three daughter's behind, including a teenager, and hopped aboard a flight to Hidalgo, Mexico, with her husband and then 12-year-old son Jesus Sanchez, according to 2017 story that first ran in the San Francisco Chronicle.

While looking for ways to re-enter the U.S. through legal channels, Mendoza-Sanchez applied for special waiver and was one of 65,000 chosen through a visa lottery.

But since she had entered the country illegally in 1992, she was ruled not eligible for the special visa.

Determined to rejoin her daughters, she applied for a waiver that granted visa worker's to skilled workers but ICE denied her petition for the visa.

She took her battle to the State Department's consular's office in Mexico City, which ruled on her side based on her critical role as nurse at her former employer, Highland Hospital, where cancer patients received treatment.

Mendoza-Sanchez's successful appeal granted her a three-year H-1B work visa in November which was sponsored by the Alameda Health System.

Mendoza-Sanchez, who graduated from nursing school, is working on returning to her old post as an oncology nurse sometime soon.

There is a chance it can be extended for another three."
391,the huffington post,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/ryan-zinke-democrats-oversight-resignation_us_5c158663e4b049efa752d748,"Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke has often said that he's not afraid of a fight.

In an interview with Breitbart News last month, the former Montana congressman and Navy SEAL dismissed reports that his days in the Trump administration were numbered as nothing more than rumors.

""I've been in a lot of firefights. I don't mind getting shot at,"" he said. ""It is better to charge up a hill under fire than cower in a foxhole.""

But the intense scrutiny Zinke was certain to face next year from House Democrats wielding new oversight authority turned out to be a fight that he -- or perhaps the boss he's been so loyal to -- wasn't up for. President Donald Trump announced early Saturday that Zinke will resign at the end of the year.

Zinke's final day as agency chief will be Jan. 2, The Associated Press reported Saturday, citing his resignation letter. That's one day before Democrats take control of the House of Representatives. In recent weeks, some Democratic lawmakers made clear that they intended to investigate both Zinke's personal conduct and policy decisions. He has faced nearly 20 federal investigations, one of which has been referred to the Justice Department for possible criminal violations.

Rep. Gerry Connolly (D-Va.), the vice ranking member of the House oversight committee, told HuffPost last month that Zinke ""is definitely going to be a subject of great interest"" following a ""complete desert of oversight under the Republican watch."" Since Trump took office, Republicans on the House oversight committee have denied more than 60 subpoena requests from Democratic members, including one related to Zinke's reassignment of career employees.

And Rep. Raul Grijalva (D-Ariz.), one of Zinke's fiercest critics in Washington and the incoming chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee, told Outside Magazine and other outlets he was prepared to subpoena Zinke, if necessary, to obtain information.

In his resignation letter to Trump, Zinke wrote that ""vicious and politically motivated attacks"" against him had ""created an unfortunate distraction,"" according to the AP. And in a statement posted to Twitter, the ongoing agency chief said he ""cannot justify spending thousands of dollars defending myself and my family against false allegations.""

""It is better for the President and Interior to focus on accomplishments rather than fictitious allegations,"" Zinke added.

While it appears on the surface that Zinke's departure was a personal decision, the AP and The New York Times reported Saturday that the White House forced him out over concerns about ongoing scandals, mounting scrutiny and negative press.

""This is no kind of victory, but I'm hopeful that it is a genuine turning of the page,"" Grijalva said in a statement. ""The next secretary should respect public desire for strong environmental standards and an end to corporate favoritism.""

There had been numerous signs that Zinke was possibly on his way out. Last month, Trump told reporters that Zinke is ""doing an excellent job,"" but that he would ""take a look"" at the allegations against him and soon make a decision about his future. Zinke's personal attack last month against the congressman soon to wield oversight power over him only added to the speculation.

""It's hard for him to think straight from the bottom of a bottle,"" Zinke wrote of Grijalva after the Arizona lawmaker called for his resignation.

In recent interviews and public appearances, Zinke seemed to be working to maintain his boss' approval. He told Bloomberg that Trump is ""great to work for,"" despite occasional calls at 2 a.m., and that ""if you do your job, he supports you."" And Zinke repeatedly touted the administration's effort to boost domestic fossil fuel production while continuing to ignore the scientific community's dire warnings that we are running out of time to rein in greenhouse gas emissions and stave off catastrophic climate change.

""I'm proud of the fact that we're the No. 1 oil and gas producer"" in the world, he said at a Dec. 11 briefing to announce a proposed rollback of Obama-era clean water rules. ""I'm proud of the fact that we're going to get even better. Because when America prospers, the world is safer.""

Unsurprisingly, critics see his looming exit as a clear attempt to avoid scrutiny from House Democrats.

Stepping down now ""may spare Zinke some embarrassment, but it will not reduce the need for oversight of the Administration's poor stewardship at Interior,"" Rep. Don Beyer (D-Va.) said in a statement.

And in a blistering response, Austin Evers, executive director of the watchdog group American Oversight, reminded Zinke that resigning from the post doesn't bring an end to probes by the Justice Department.

""For all his feigned swagger, Ryan Zinke lacked the courage or integrity to face accountability, skipping town as soon as he faced scrutiny,"" Evers said. ""Unfortunately for the American people, Zinke leaves behind a deputy secretary with similar ethical concerns. It is high time for the glare of sunlight to focus on Deputy Secretary David Bernhardt. We'll see if he has the spine to answer questions that Zinke lacked."""
392,daily mail online,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6505871/Russian-trolls-set-hotlines-people-discuss-sexual-problems-blackmail-trap.html,"A new report on Russian social media tactics to sow discord in the U.S. before and after the elections reveals efforts to stir up sentiment among African American voters was Moscow's leading tactic.

The Russian Internet Research Agency purchased a total of 1,087 ads targeting African American politic and culture and black identity and nationalism during the campaign, according to a bombshell analysis of the Russian influence operation that investigators have yet to fully examine.

Facebook's ad program allowed purchasers to select users with certain interests, like Malcolm X - a capability the St. Petersburg-based outfit relied on to slice up the American electorate.

The Kremlin-linked Internet Research Agency, which has been charged with interfering in the elections, relied on Facebook, Google and Twitter and other platforms for targeted messaging, according to the report for the Senate Intelligence Committee.

Russia used every social media platform to drum up support for Donald Trump in the 2016 election, a new report has found, and put an emphasis on going after African American voters, who mostly backed Hillary Clinton

It used words, videos and images to persuade voters to back Trump, according to a report by Oxford University's Computational Propaganda Project and network analysis company Graphika.

It outlines repeated Russian efforts to divide and target black voters - and even a program to set up hotlines to get people to confess problems that could be potential fodder for blackmail.

The tactics reached tens of millions of Americans during the multi-year durations, and targeted key interest groups known to impact U.S. elections.

U.S. intelligence assessed and prosecutors have charged that the outfit was financed by a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin. Many of the ad purchases were in rubles. Early posts before 2014 were in Russian, but English language social media activity jumped that year, and continued even into 2017.

The report identifies a Russian focus on targeting black voters

Online activity focused on police violence against blacks

Russians tried ginning up support online using multiple campaigns, including Blacktivist

Other ads targeted conservatives and particular regions

The Russians sought to boost Trump and drive down turnout among potential Hillary Clinton supporters

The Russians set up 30 Facebook pages on black Americans, while another 10 YouTube channels focused on police violence against blacks and put out 571 videos on the subject.

The efforts to target African Americans and suppress the black vote came during a 2016 election where Hillary Clinton won an overwhelming share of support among African American vote.

According to the report: 'Messaging to African Americans sought to divert their political energy away from established political institutions by preying on anger with structural inequalities faced by African Americans, including police violence, poverty, and disproportionate levels of incarceration.'

It continued: 'These campaigns pushed a message that the best way to advance the cause of the African American community was to boycott the election and focus on other issues instead. This often happened through the use of repetitive slogans. This accounts for the majority of content in the dataset that targeted this group.'

The Russians also went after other demographic slices: Muslims, southerners, Texans, and more.

The campaign didn't stop after the trolls got caught, and in fact peaked in 2017, according to the report.

In one notably callous tactics, Russians set up hotlines to get people to call in and talk about their sex problems and other personal issues - a source for possible blackmail material, NBC reported.

Other trickery enticed Americans to take political actions.

On Twitter, English-language posts from Russia shot up in late 2015.

After a Russian 'Black Matters' Facebook page got shut down, the IRA simply created new renamed campaigns to push its message. 'Cops kill black kids. Are you sure that your son won't be the next?' went one aimed at African Americans.

Activity spiked around major political debates between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton.

Broken down by state, a leading 265 ads targeted Missouri.

Researchers even found that racial geography, more than the the Electoral College, was a driver in ad purchases.

'We believe the targeting had more to do with race than a state's role in the Electoral College or status as a swing state. For example, African Americans in Ferguson, MO were targeted for the 'Black Matters' campaign. African Americans in Baltimore, MD and Oakland, CA were targeted for the 'Blacktivist' campaign. Texan cities were targeted for campaigns focusing on patriotism and pro-gun politics,' according to the report.

Russia used nearly every social media platform to drum up support for Donald Trump in the 2016 election, the report has found.

'What is clear is that all of the messaging clearly sought to benefit the Republican Party - and specifically Donald Trump,' the report says.

'Trump is mentioned most in campaigns targeting conservatives and right-wing voters, where the messaging encouraged these groups to support his campaign. The main groups that could challenge Trump were then provided messaging that sought to confuse, distract and ultimately discourage members from voting.'

The report was presented to the Senate Intelligence Committee. The bipartisan panel released it publicly on Monday morning.

It tracks observations like an increase in activity on election day in 2016 and during general election debates between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. Activity by the group spiked the most at the end of the year when Barack Obama announced that he was opening up probes into Russia's attempt to hack the election.

Russian company The Internet Research Agency has been charged with interfering. Pictured: Russian President Putin

Among its findings were that conservative users 'were actively encouraged to get behind Trump's campaign' while other users were 'encouraged to boycott the election, abstain from voting for Clinton, or to spread cynicism about participating in the election in general.'

Committee chairman Richard Burr, a North Carolina Republican, said the data 'demonstrates how aggressively Russia sought to divide Americans by race, religion and ideology, and how the IRA actively worked to erode trust in our democratic institutions.'

'Most troublingly, it shows that these activities have not stopped,' he assessed. 'As we work to address these threats, these reports are proof positive that one of the most important things we can do is increase information sharing between the social media companies who can identify disinformation campaigns and the third-party experts who can analyze them.'

The committee's vice chair, Mark Warner, a Virginia Democrat, likewise said the report revealed that Russian election meddling was worse than previously revealed.

'This should stand as a wake up call to us all that none of us are immune from this threat, and it is time to get serious in addressing this challenge,' he said. 'That is going to require some much-needed and long-overdue guardrails when it comes to social media. I hope these reports will spur legislative action in the Congress and provide additional clarity to the American public about Russia's assault on our democracy.'

Researchers also noted that the data includes evidence of sloppiness by the Russians that could have led to earlier detection, including the use of Russia's currency, the ruble, to buy ads.

House Intelligence ranking member Adam Schiff, a California Democrat, said in a statement after the release of the report that social media companies share in the blame and must be held accountable.

'Their reluctance to conduct and publish such deep analysis themselves, to actively and meaningfully collaborate with one another to compare and publicize data and information to build out the extent of the IRA's efforts, and to otherwise make available to outside research groups comprehensive, uniform access to the data, have made our task far more difficult than it should have been,' he scolded.

Schiff said the companies, which he did not call out by name, should be doing more to keep their users and the public aware of disinformation operations.

It comes after President Trump and his attorney unleashed a fresh series of attacks people investigating him, questioning their integrity while categorically ruling out the possibility of a presidential interview with the special counsel for the Department of Justice's probe into Russia.

Trump and lawyer Rudy Giuliani used Twitter and television interviews Sunday to deliver a series of broadsides against special counsel Robert Mueller and federal prosecutors in New York.

Giuliani said he was 'disgusted' by the tactics used by Mueller in his probe into Russian election interference, including in securing guilty pleas from the president's former national security adviser Michael Flynn on a charge of lying to federal investigators.

Trump, Giuliani said, would not submit to an interview by Mueller's team.

'They're a joke,' Giuliani told 'Fox News Sunday. 'Over my dead body, but, you know, I could be dead.'

The special counsel, who is investigating possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russia, has continued to request an interview with the president.

Last month, the White House sent written answers in response to the special counsel's questions about possible collusion. The White House has resisted answering questions on possible obstruction of justice.

Giuliani sarcastically said that the only thing left to ask the president was about 'several unpaid parking tickets that night, back in 1986, '87 that haven't been explained.'

If the president officially refuses an interview request, the special counsel's team could theoretically seek to subpoena him to compel his testimony. Such a move would almost certainly trigger an immediate court fight.

The Supreme Court has never directly ruled on whether a president can be subpoenaed for testimony in a criminal investigation, though the justices have said that a president can be forced to turn over records that have been subpoenaed and can be forced to answer questions as part of a lawsuit.

The special counsel's investigation has spun out charges and strong-armed guilty pleas from Trump underlings while keeping in suspense whether the president - 'Individual-1,' in Mueller's coded legalese - will end up accused of criminal behavior himself.

This past week, his legal exposure grew as his former personal attorney, Michael Cohen, was sentenced to three years in prison after admitting he issued hush-money payments to women who alleged sexual trysts with Trump. Prosecutors and Cohen say he acted at the president's direction, which Trump and Giuliani deny.

Trump and Giuliani have repeatedly tried to paint Cohen as untrustworthy, with the former New York City mayor calling him a 'pathological liar.'

'Which is the truth?' Giuliani said of the competing stories from Trump and Cohen. 'I think I know what the truth is. Unless you're God, you'll never know what the truth is.'

Trump and Giuliani have also accused prosecutors of intimidating the president's associates into making false claims.

'Remember, Michael Cohen only became a 'Rat' after the FBI did something which was absolutely unthinkable & unheard of until the Witch Hunt was illegally started,' Trump tweeted. 'They BROKE INTO AN ATTORNEY'S OFFICE!'

It comes after President Trump and his attorney (pictured) unleashed a fresh series of attacks people investigating him, questioning their integrity while categorically ruling out the possibility of a presidential interview with the special counsel

It was not a break-in. The FBI executed a search warrant obtained from a judge in conducting a raid in April on Cohen's home, office and hotel room and seizing records on a variety of matters, among them a $130,000 payment made to porn actress Stormy Daniels by Cohen. The application for the warrant was approved high in the Justice Department.

In response to Trump's tweet, former FBI Director James Comey tweeted, 'This is from the President of our country, lying about the lawful execution of a search warrant issued by a federal judge. Shame on Republicans who don't speak up at this moment - for the FBI, the rule of law, and the truth.

Prosecutors have said Trump directed Cohen to arrange the payments to buy the silence of Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal in the run-up to the 2016 campaign. Federal prosecutors in New York say the payments amounted to illegal campaign contributions because they were made at the height of election season to keep voters from learning of Trump's alleged infidelities.

Giuliani has argued the payments were made to protect Trump's family, not to influence the election.

'If there's another purpose, it's not a campaign contribution,' Giuliani told ABC. 'Suppose he tried to use campaign funds to pay Stormy Daniels. It wouldn't be illegal. These are not campaign contributions.'

The hush money wasn't initially reported on campaign finance documents and, in any case, far exceeded the legally acceptable amount for in-kind contributions. The federal limit on individual contributions is $2,700.

Trump (pictured) and Rudy Giuliani used Twitter and television interviews Sunday to deliver a series of broadsides against special counsel Robert Mueller and federal prosecutors in New York

Cohen also pleaded guilty to lying to investigators about the Trump Organization's goals to build a tower in Moscow. His representative, Lanny Davis, told CBS' 'Face the Nation' on Sunday that his written statement to Congress, which contained the lie, was published ahead of his testimony and Cohen then spoke to the White House.

'Not one person from the White House ever said, 'Don't lie,'' Davis said.

Rep. Elijah Cummings, the top Democrat on the House oversight committee and the likely chairman come January, said he wanted Cohen to testify before Congress about what he told prosecutors. Meanwhile, Trump's fellow Republican, Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, acknowledged on CNN that 'it was not a good week for President Trump' and urged 'that the special counsel be allowed to complete his investigation unimpeded.'

Trump compared his situation to one involving President Barack Obama's 2008 campaign. The Federal Election Commission docked the Obama campaign $375,000 for regulatory civil violations. The fines stemmed from the campaign's failure to report a batch of contributions, totaling nearly $1.9 million, on time in the final days of the campaign.

But legal analysts said the accusations against Trump could amount to a felony because they revolve around an alleged conspiracy to conceal payments from campaign contribution reports - and from voters.

It's unclear what federal prosecutors in New York will decide to do if they conclude that there is evidence that Trump himself committed a crime.

Trump has not yet laid out a detailed defense, though he could conceivably argue that the payments were made not for the purposes of advancing his campaign but rather to prevent salacious stories from emerging that would be personally humiliating to him and harm his marriage.

That argument was advanced by former Sen. John Edwards, a North Carolina Democrat, in a similar campaign finance case that went to trial in 2012. But that may be tougher for Trump than it was for Edwards given the proximity of the president's payment to the election - timing that, on its face, suggests a link between the money and his political ambitions.

Edwards was acquitted on one count of accepting illegal campaign contributions, but jurors couldn't reach a verdict on the five remaining counts, including conspiracy and making false statements."
393,daily mail online,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6505757/Run-Flynn-sentencing-tinged-unexpected-drama.html,"Monday Mueller arrested his business partner and indicted their associate, revealing that Flynn had admitted to a plot to lobby illegally for Turkey

Michael Flynn may have given extraordinary cooperation to prosecutors, but the run-up to his sentencing hearing on Tuesday has exposed raw tensions over an FBI interview in which the former national security adviser lied about his Russian contacts.

Flynn's lawyers have suggested that investigators discouraged him from having an attorney present during the January 2017 interview and never informed him it was a crime to lie.

Prosecutors shot back: 'He does not need to be warned it is a crime to lie to federal agents to know the importance of telling them the truth.'

The mere insinuation of underhanded tactics was startling given the seemingly productive relationship between the two sides, and it was especially striking since prosecutors with special counsel Robert Mueller's office have praised Flynn's cooperation and recommended against prison time.

The defense arguments spurred speculation that Flynn, 59, may be trying to get sympathy from President Donald Trump or may be playing to a judge known for a zero-tolerance view of government misconduct.

Liar, liar: Michael Flynn will be sentenced for admitting lying to the FBI about his contact before the 2016 election with Sergei Kislyak, then Putin's ambassador to Washington D.C.

At his side: Flynn became a vocal supporter of Trump and spoke at campaign rallies such as this one in Grand Junction, CO, and the Republican national convention in Cleveland, OH, where he led chants of 'lock her up'

Notorious meeting: Flynn traveled to Moscow in December 2015 and dined with Vladimir Putin to celebrate the 10th anniversary of RT, the Russian English-language propaganda channel

What a change of tone: In the run-up to his former aide's sentencing, Trump has turned from portraying him as a liar to saying that he did not, as the president steps up his attacks on the Mueller probe

'It's an attempt, I think, to perhaps characterize Flynn as a victim or perhaps to make him look sympathetic in the eyes of a judge - and, at the same time, to portray the special counsel in a negative light,' said former federal prosecutor Jimmy Gurule, a University of Notre Dame law school professor.

Until the dueling memos were filed last week, the sentencing hearing for Flynn - who pleaded guilty to lying about a conversation during the transition period with the then-Russian ambassador - was expected to be devoid of the drama characterizing other of Mueller's cases.

Prosecutors, for instance, have accused former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort of lying to them even after he agreed to cooperate.

Another potential target, Jerome Corsi, leaked draft court documents and accused Mueller's team of bullying him.

And George Papadopoulos, a Trump campaign adviser recently released from a two-week prison sentence, has lambasted the investigation and publicly claimed that he was set up.

Flynn, by contrast, has been notably silent even as his supporters advocated a more combative stance. He met privately with investigators 19 times and provided cooperation so extensive that prosecutors said he was entitled to avoid prison altogether.

Then came his sentencing memo.

Although Flynn and his attorneys stopped short of any direct accusations of wrongdoing, they took pains to note that Flynn, unlike other defendants in Mueller's investigation, was not informed that it was against the law to lie to the FBI.

They suggest the FBI, which approached Flynn at the White House just days after Trump's inauguration, played to his desire to keep the encounter quiet by telling him the quickest way to get the interview done was for him to be alone with the agents - rather than involve lawyers.

They also insinuate that Flynn, of Middletown, Rhode Island, deserves credit for not publicly seizing on the fact that FBI officials involved in the investigation later came under scrutiny themselves.

Former Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, who contacted Flynn to arrange the interview, was fired this year for what the Justice Department said was a lack of candor over a news media leak.

Peter Strzok, one of the two agents who interviewed Flynn, was removed from Mueller's team and later fired for trading anti-Trump texts with another FBI official.

Tarnished: Flynn (left) became a three-star general while his brother Charlie (right) became a two-star general. Now one brother's service is overshadowed by his guilt. His mother Helen (center) had nine children with the Flynn's later father, Charles

Sentenced: Flynn will join his former cohort Michael Cohen - Trump's fixer - in having been sentenced. Cohen is due to report to federal prison in March

Business partners: Flynn was in business with Bijan Kian (second left). Kian, an Iranian-American, is now indicted on charges of lobbying illegally along with Flynn, who appears to have flipped on him. Flynn's wife Lori is expected at his sentencing

Mueller's team has sharply pushed back at any suggestion that Flynn was duped, with prosecutors responding in their own sentencing memo Friday that there was no obligation to warn Flynn against lying.

'A sitting National Security (Adviser), former head of an intelligence agency, retired Lieutenant General, and 33-year veteran of the armed forces knows he should not lie to federal agents,' prosecutors wrote.

Former FBI Director James Comey criticized the broadsides on the Flynn investigation during a Monday appearance on Capitol Hill, saying, 'They're up here attacking the FBI's investigation of a guy who pled guilty to lying to the FBI.'

Trump has made no secret that he sees Mueller's investigation as a 'witch hunt' and has continued to lash out at prosecutors he sees as biased against him and those who help them.

He's shown continued sympathy for Flynn, though, calling him a 'great person' and asserting - erroneously - that the FBI has said he didn't lie.

Flynn has not tried to retract his guilty plea, and there's every indication the sentencing will proceed as scheduled.

Arun Rao, a former Justice Department prosecutor in Maryland, said the defense memo is striking because it's 'inconsistent' with Flynn's cooperative stance so far.

'You also wonder in this very unusual situation,' he said, 'whether it is a play for a pardon.'

It's also possible that at least some of the defense arguments may resonate with U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan, who directed prosecutors to produce FBI records related to Flynn's interview.

Scalp: Flynn will become the fourth of Robert Mueller's targets to be sentenced

Sullivan was the judge in the Justice Department's botched prosecution of now-deceased Republican Sen. Ted Stevens of Alaska.

He dismissed the case after prosecutors admitted that they withheld exculpatory evidence, prompting the judge to say that in nearly 25 years on the bench, 'I've never seen anything approaching the mishandling and misconduct that I've seen in this case.'

In an opinion piece for The Wall Street Journal last year, Sullivan said the case inspired him to explicitly remind prosecutors in every criminal case before him of their obligation to provide defendants with favorable evidence. He says he has encouraged colleagues to do the same.

But while Sullivan has proved especially sensitive to hints of government overreach, nothing about the Flynn case comes close, said Gurule, the law professor.

'To portray him as somehow an innocent dupe, as somehow just this innocent victim in the process, this suggestion that there was a perjury trap - it's an absurd allegation,' he said.

But the sentencing also comes the day after a dramatic move by Mueller to arrest Flynn's former business partner and reveal that Flynn had been part of an effort to lobby illegally.

Bijan Kian, an Iranian-American who was number two to Flynn was arrested and appeared in federal court in Washington D.C. before being freed on bail.

He is charged with a plot to lobby for Turkey without declaring that he and Flynn's firm was working for the Turkish government, breaking the Foreign Agent Registration Act which makes it illegal to lobby for foreign governments without registering with the State Department. Kian has yet to enter a plea.

Also indicted was the business partner who worked with him and Flynn, Turkish-Dutch dual national Ekim Alpetkin, who is the subject of an arrest warrant and thought to be in Turkey.

Kian and Alpetkin are accused in court papers of a plot to convince the U.S. government to extradite or otherwise expel Fethullah Gulen, a Turkish cleric who is a deadly rival of the country's strongman president Recep Tayyip Erdogan.

Mueller says in the court papers that with Flynn, who is referred to a 'Person A' they placed an op-ed in The Hill newspaper without acknowledging that it was at the prompting of the Turkish government.

Flynn wrote the op-ed and his firm, The Flynn Intel Group, was paid $600,000 for their lobbying campaign - but he is not indicted himself in what appears to be a sign that he flipped on his former associates.

The special counsel has praised the former Trump administration official for his 'substantial help' in several investigations. It is believed this is one of them.

ROBERT MUELLER'S PROBE SO FAR: EIGHT CONVICTIONS - INCLUDING THREE TOP TRUMP AIDES, A JAILED ATTORNEY AND 25 RUSSIANS ACCUSED

GUILTY: MICHAEL FLYNN

Pleaded guilty to making false statements in December 2017. Awaiting sentence

Flynn was President Trump's former National Security Advisor and Robert Mueller's most senior scalp to date. He previously served when he was a three star general as President Obama's director of the Defense Intelligence Agency but was fired.

He admitted to lying to special counsel investigators about his conversations with a Russian ambassador in December 2016. He has agreed to cooperate with the special counsel investigation.

GUILTY: MICHAEL COHEN

Pleaded guilty to eight counts including fraud and two campaign finance violations in August 2018. Pleaded guilty to further count of lying to Congress in November 2018. Sentenced to three years in prison and $2 million in fines and forfeitures in December 2018

Cohen was Trump's longtime personal attorney, starting working for him and the Trump Organization in 2007. He is the longest-serving member of Trump's inner circle to be implicated by Mueller. Cohen professed unswerving devotion to Trump - and organized payments to silence two women who alleged they had sex with the-then candidate: porn star Stormy Daniels and Playboy model Karen McDougal. He admitted that payments to both women were felony campaign finance violations - and admitted that he acted at the 'direction' of 'Candidate-1': Donald Trump.

He also admitted tax fraud by lying about his income from loans he made, money from taxi medallions he owned, and other sources of income, at a cost to the Treasury of $1.3 million.

And he admitted lying to Congress in a rare use of the offense. The judge in his case let him report for prison on March 6 and recommended he serve it in a medium-security facility close to New York City.

GUILTY: PAUL MANAFORT

Found guilty of eight charges of bank and tax fraud in August 2018. Pleaded guilty to two further charges. Awaiting sentence

Manafort worked for Trump's campaign from March 2016 and chaired it from June to August 2016, overseeing Trump being adopted as Republican candidate at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland. He is the most senior campaign official to be implicated by Mueller. Manafort was one of Washington D.C.'s longest-term and most influential lobbyists but in 2015, his money dried up and the next year he turned to Trump for help, offering to be his campaign chairman for free - in the hope of making more money afterwards. But Mueller unwound his previous finances and discovered years of tax and bank fraud as he coined in cash from pro-Russia political parties and oligarchs in Ukraine.

Manafort pleaded not guilty to 18 charges of tax and bank fraud but was convicted of eight counts. The jury was deadlocked on the other 10 charges. A second trial on charges of failing to register as a foreign agent is due in September.

GUILTY: RICK GATES

Pleaded guilty to conspiracy against the United States and making false statements in February 2018. Awaiting sentence

Gates was Manafort's former deputy at political consulting firm DMP International. He admitted to conspiring to defraud the U.S. government on financial activity, and to lying to investigators about a meeting Manafort had with a member of congress in 2013. As a result of his guilty plea and promise of cooperation, prosecutors vacated charges against Gates on bank fraud, bank fraud conspiracy, failure to disclose foreign bank accounts, filing false tax returns, helping prepare false tax filings, and falsely amending tax returns.

GUILTY AND JAILED: GEORGE PAPADOPOLOUS

Pleaded guilty to making false statements in October 2017. Sentenced to 14 days in September 2018, and reported to prison in November. Served 12 days and released on December 7, 2018

Papadopoulos was a member of Donald Trump's campaign foreign policy advisory committee. He admitted to lying to special counsel investigators about his contacts with London professor Josef Mifsud and Ivan Timofeev, the director of a Russian government-funded think tank.

He has agreed to cooperate with the special counsel investigation.

GUILTY AND JAILED: RICHARD PINEDO

Pleaded guilty to identity fraud in February 2018. Sentenced to a year in prison

Pinedo is a 28-year-old computer specialist from Santa Paula, California. He admitted to selling bank account numbers to Russian nationals over the internet that he had obtained using stolen identities.

He has agreed to cooperate with the special counsel investigation.

GUILTY AND JAILED: ALEX VAN DER ZWAAN

Pleaded guilty to making false statements in February 2018. He served a 30-day prison sentence earlier this year and was deported to the Netherlands on his release

Van der Zwaan is a Dutch attorney for Skadden Arps who worked on a Ukrainian political analysis report for Paul Manafort in 2012.

He admitted to lying to special counsel investigators about when he last spoke with Rick Gates and Konstantin Kilimnik.

GUILTY: W. SAMUEL PATTEN

Pleaded guilty in August 2018 to failing to register as a lobbyist while doing work for a Ukrainian political party. Awaiting sentence

Patten, a long-time D.C. lobbyist was a business partner of Paul Manafort. He pleaded guilty to admitting to arranging an illegal $50,000 donation to Trump's inauguration.

He arranged for an American 'straw donor' to pay $50,000 to the inaugural committee, knowing that it was actually for a Ukrainian businessman.

Neither the American or the Ukrainian have been named.

CHARGED: KONSTANTIN KILIMNIK

Indicted for obstruction of justice and conspiracy to obstruct justice. At large, probably in Russia

Kilimnik is a former employee of Manafort's political consulting firm and helped him with lobbying work in Ukraine. He is accused of witness tampering, after he allegedly contacted individuals who had worked with Manafort to remind them that Manafort only performed lobbying work for them outside of the U.S.

He has been linked to Russian intelligence and is currently thought to be in Russia - effectively beyond the reach of extradition by Mueller's team.

INDICTED: THE RUSSIANS

Twenty-five Russian nationals and three Russian entities have been indicted for conspiracy to defraud the United States. They remain at large in Russia

Two of these Russian nationals were also indicted for conspiracy to commit wire fraud and 11 were indicted for conspiracy to launder money. Fifteen of them were also indicted for identity fraud.

Vladimir Putin has ridiculed the charges. Russia effectively bars extradition of its nationals. The only prospect Mueller has of bringing any in front of a U.S. jury is if Interpol has their names on an international stop list - which is not made public - and they set foot in a territory which extradites to the U.S.

INDICTED: MICHAEL FLYNN'S BUSINESS PARTNERS

Bijan Kian (left), number two in now disgraced former national security adviser Mike Flynn's lobbying company, and the two's business partner Ekim Alptekin (right) were indicted for conspiracy to lobby illegally. Kian is awaiting trial, Alptekin is still to appear in court

Kian, an Iranian-American was arrested and appeared in court charged with a conspiracy to illegally lobby the U.S government without registering as a foreign agent. Their co-conspirator was Flynn, who is called 'Person A' in the indictment and is not charged, offering some insight into what charges he escaped with his plea deal.

Kian, vice-president of Flynn's former lobbying firm, is alleged to have plotted with Alptekin to try to change U.S. policy on an exiled Turkish cleric, Fethullah Gulen, who lives in Pennsylvania and who is accused by Turkey's strongman president Recep Tayyip Erdogan, of trying to depose him.

Erdogan's government wanted him extradited from the U.S. and paid Flynn's firm through Alptekin for lobbying, including an op-ed in The Hill calling for Gulen to be ejected. Flynn and Kian both lied that the op-ed was not paid for by the Turkish government.

The indictment is a sign of how Mueller is taking an interest in more than just Russian involvement in the 2016 election."

395,daily mail online,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-6531901/Trump-finally-hews-ritual-meeting-troops-harms-way.html,"AL-ASAD AIRBASE, Iraq (AP) - President Donald Trump once opined that it wasn't ""overly necessary"" for him to visit troops in danger zones abroad. But with the lights of Air Force One out and window shutters drawn, the president did just that, slipping into Iraq at night to greet U.S. service members and show that his norm-busting presidency would hew at least to this tradition.

Addressing troops at an air base in western Iraq Wednesday, Trump defended his decision to pull forces from neighboring Syria, declaring of Islamic State militants: ""We've knocked them out. We've knocked them silly.""

His appraisal is at odds with that of military officials, aides and allies who consider IS a diminished but deadly force. His defense secretary and envoy to the anti-IS coalition quit after Trump blindsided much of the national security establishment with his call.

Trump had faced criticism for not yet visiting U.S. troops stationed in harm's way as he comes up on his two-year mark in office. George W. Bush made four trips to Iraq and two to Afghanistan as president; President Barack Obama made four to Afghanistan and one to Iraq.

Such trips are typically unannounced and the subject of extreme security. Trump's was no exception as he flew overnight from Washington, spent three-plus hours on the ground and stopped at Ramstein Air Force Base in Germany for refueling and to greet service members in a hangar there before leaving.

Trump told his audience in Iraq that the decision to withdraw the roughly 2,000 troops from Syria illustrated his quest to put ""America first.""

(AP Photo/Andrew Harnik)

""We're no longer the suckers, folks,"" Trump said at al-Asad Air Base, about 100 miles or 60 kilometers west of Baghdad. ""We're respected again as a nation.""

He did not meet Iraqi officials while there but spoke on the phone with Iraqi Prime Minister Adel Abdul-Mahdi. The visit appeared to inflame sensitivities about the continued presence of U.S. forces in Iraq as the two major blocs in the Iraqi parliament condemned the trip, likening it to a violation of Iraqi sovereignty.

The air base where Trump spoke is about 155 miles (250 km) from Hajin, a Syrian town near the Iraqi border where Kurdish fighters are still battling IS extremists. Trump has said IS militants have been eradicated, but the latest estimate is that IS still holds about 60 square miles (100 square km) of territory in that region of Syria, although fighters also fled the area and are in hiding in other pockets of the country.

Defense Secretary Jim Mattis was supposed to continue leading the Pentagon until late February, but Trump moved up his exit and announced that Patrick Shanahan, deputy defense secretary, would take the job on Jan. 1. Trump said he was in ""no rush"" to nominate a new defense chief.

""Everybody and his uncle wants that position,"" Trump told reporters traveling with him. ""And also, by the way, everybody and her aunt, just so I won't be criticized.""

Critics said the U.S. exit from Syria, the latest in Trump's increasingly isolationist-style foreign policy, would provide an opening for IS to regroup, give Iran a green light to expand its influence in the region and leave U.S.-backed Kurdish forces vulnerable to attacks from Turkey.

""I made it clear from the beginning that our mission in Syria was to strip ISIS of its military strongholds,"" said Trump, who wore an olive green bomber-style jacket as chants of ""USA! USA!"" greeted him and speakers blared Lee Greenwood's song ""God Bless the USA.""

""We'll be watching ISIS very closely,"" said Trump, who was joined by first lady Melania Trump, but no members of his Cabinet or lawmakers. ""We'll be watching them very, very closely, the remnants of ISIS.""

Trump also said he had no plans to withdraw the 5,200 U.S. forces in Iraq. That's down from about 170,000 in 2007 at the height of the surge of U.S. forces to combat sectarian violence unleashed by the U.S.-led invasion to topple dictator Saddam Hussein.

Abdul-Mahdi's office said ""differences in points of view over the arrangements"" prevented the two from meeting but they discussed security issues and Trump's order to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria over the phone. Abdul-Mahdi's office also did not say whether he had accepted an invitation to the White House. But Trump press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told reporters on the flight back that the Iraqi leader had agreed to come.

Trump said that after U.S. troops in Syria return home, Iraq could still be used to stage attacks on IS militants.

""We can use this as a base if we wanted to do something in Syria,"" he said. ""If we see something happening with ISIS that we don't like, we can hit them so fast and so hard"" that they ""really won't know what the hell happened.""

He promised a ""strong, deliberate and orderly withdrawal"" of forces from Syria

Trump had told The Associated Press in October that he would visit U.S. troops in troubled areas ""at some point, but I don't think it's overly necessary."" He told reporters that he had planned to make the trip three or four weeks ago, but word started getting out and forced him to postpone it.

Iraqi leaders declared an end to combat operations against IS a year ago but the country's political, military and economic situation remains uncertain. It continues to experience sporadic bombings, kidnappings and assassinations, which most people attribute to IS.

On Dec. 15, the U.S.-led coalition launched an airstrike in support of Iraqi troops who were chasing IS fighters toward a tunnel west of Mosul. The strike destroyed the tunnel entrance and killed four IS fighters, according to the U.S. military in Baghdad. The last U.S. service member to die in Iraq was in August, as the result of a helicopter crash in Sinjar.

Trump had planned to spend Christmas at his private club in Florida, but stayed behind in Washington due to the partial government shutdown.

Trump campaigned for office on a platform of ending U.S. involvement in foreign trouble spots, such as Syria, Afghanistan and Iraq. The Pentagon is also said to be developing plans to withdraw up to half of the 14,000 American troops still serving in Afghanistan.

Associated Press writers Deb Riechmann and Lolita C. Baldor in Washington and Philip Issa in Baghdad contributed to this report.

397,daily mail online,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6513763/Our-politics-BROKEN-says-Paul-Ryan-quits-Speaker-veiled-attack-Trump.html,"Speaker Paul Ryan bemoaned the 'broken' state of American politics in his farewell address on Wednesday that both touted his achievements in office and got in a few swaps at the current political climate under President Donald Trump.

Ryan, 48, decided to retire at the end of the year after 20 years in the House of Representatives and three years as speaker.

His final speech came as Democrats prepare to take control of the lower chamber in Congress in January.

He spoke in the Library of Congress, which sits across the street from the U.S. Capitol building, in the ornate Great Room of the Thomas Jefferson Building with huge American flags hanging at either side.

Outgoing Speaker Paul Ryan gave his final address on Wednesday

Ryan accepts the Speaker's gavel from Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi in 2017

'The drivers of our broken politics are more obvious than the solutions,' Ryan said.

'Our complex problems are solvable,' he added. 'That is to say, our problems are solvable if our politics will allow it.'

Ryan was a reluctant speaker who took the job after John Boehner retired in 2015 and House Republicans came close to tearing themselves apart over who would lead them next.

He led his conference through the final years of Barack Obama's time in the Oval Office; the contentious 2016 presidential primary and general election; and the first, turbulent years of Trump's presidency.

He was Mitt Romney's running mate in 2012 and, after that failed attempt at the White House, returned to Capitol Hill to lead the quiet life of a lawmaker he led before being thrust in the national spotlight: walking by himself (instead of a cadre of aides surrounding him) to votes, often times with headphones on, and standing in line in the cafeteria to buy his lunch.

That changed when he became speaker and took the marble office with a balcony looking down the National Mall toward the Washington and Lincoln Memorials.

Once a rising star in the Republican Party - part of a group known as The Young Guns - Ryan leaves a Capitol Hill plagued with disfunction and struggling to fulfill its basic functions such as funding the government.

Republicans - with control of both chambers of Congress and the presidency - failed to complete their longtime goal of repealing the Affordable Care Act last year.

And the tax reform bill they did passed has been criticized for helping the rich while raising the deficit.

America's debt has grown since Ryan became speaker, rising from $438 billion in 2015 to $779 billion this year. Next year's deficit is projected to hit nearly $1 trillion.

Then there is the relationship with the head of his party: Ryan and Trump has a love-hate back-and-forth as each man sat at their respective ends of Pennsylvania Avenue.

Initially a Trump critic - Ryan cancelled a 2016 campaign appearance with Trump after the infamous 'Access Hollywood' interview tape came to light - he worked to repair relations once Trump won the White House.

But the two men have vastly different styles: Ryan's cool unflappable demeanor stood apart form Trump's tough talk; Ryan loves policy, numbers, facts and figures; Trump tweets from the hip.

Ryan thanks the friends, former staff and fellow lawmakers who came to his speech

And Ryan had to balance his form of economic conservatism with the president's brash politics.

Friction was sometimes the result.

He, at times, tried to push the president away from his fiery rhetoric with veiled comments about civility.

And he seemed to do the same with some of his comments Wednesday, even as he never said Trump's name.

Ryan spoke of his overseas travel at a time Trump has alienated America's traditional allies and pushed his 'America first' policy.

'The sense I get, from when I have traveled overseas as speaker, is that our allies wonder whether we are still in the game here,' Ryan said.

He also addressed the negative tone in America, something Trump has used repeatedly in his critic of rivals and allies alike.

'You can make a career out of criticism. You can deal from that deck all day long. Many do, and I certainly don't begrudge that. It seems like an easy living,' Ryan said.

'But today, too often, genuine disagreement quickly gives way to intense distrust. We spend far more time trying to convict one another than we do developing our own convictions,' he added.

Ryan argued technology amplifies the situation 'with an incentive structure that preys on people's fears, and algorithms that play on anger.'

Ryan's final speech touted his achievements in office and got in a few swaps at the current political climate under President Donald Trump

'Outrage is a brand,' he said.

Trump often uses anger and outrage in his prolific twitter account.

Then Ryan pivoted to a hopeful tone.

'Nothing - nothing says it has to be this way,' he said.

'Our problems are solvable if our politics will allow it. I know it. I have seen it. In a confident America, we don't shrug our shoulders and pass the buck. We roll up our sleeves and get on with our work. A confident America leads the world, too. Not with bluster, but with steady, principled action,' he added.

Ryan's legacy in Congress - his time heading the powerful Budget Committee and Ways and Means Committee along with his tenure of speaker - will be subject to debate.

But he touted what he is proud of in his 30 minute remarks to his former staff, fellow lawmakers, and friends. Former White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, an old Ryan friend from Wisconsin, was spotted in the crowd, as was Sen. Tim Scott, whom Ryan has worked on poverty issues with.

'After years of doubt, years of the cynics saying it could not be done, we achieved the first major overhaul of our tax code in 31 years,' he said of the GOP's signature tax cut passed one year ago.

'Think about it. We went from having the worst tax code in the industrialized world to one of the most competitive. This is something I worked on my entire adult life, and it is something that will help to improve people's lives for a long time to come,' Ryan added.

He also talked his time leading the Budget Committee, a time period the self-described 'policy wonk' is most proud of.

'I'm proud that every year I was Budget Committee chairman, we passed in the House a roadmap to balancing the budget and paying off our debt,' he said.

Those pieces of legislation usually never made it past the lower chamber.

He also mentioned the long-running Republican fight to kill Obamacare.

'In this Congress, we came within one vote of real health care entitlement reform,' he said.

'This House is the most productive we have had in at least a generation,' he added. 'To date, we have passed 1,175 bills, more than half of them with bipartisan support And - it is my duty as speaker to say this - nearly 750 bills that the House has passed remain stuck in the United States Senate. But the rest made it into law.'"
398,the huffington post,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/trump-immigration-enforcement_us_5c3cf54fe4b01c93e00c9f65,"The president's enforcement record is far less draconian than his liberal predecessor. Trump has only his own missteps to blame.

President Donald Trump wants a border wall so badly that he's willing to sustain what on Saturday became the longest federal government shutdown in U.S. history.

But for all his bluster, Trump has not racked up the draconian immigration enforcement record he threatened from the campaign trail. By the most important enforcement metric, deportations, Trump has trailed far behind his more liberal predecessor Barack Obama.

Immigration and Customs Enforcement deported about 95,000 people from the interior of the United States last year. Interior deportations in Obama's first three years in office topped 200,000 annually. Only in his final two years in office did Obama register numbers lower than Trump's.

Trump's comparatively low deportation numbers are no coincidence: They are a direct result of the administration's chaotic attempts to overhaul the immigration system. Each ill-planned and legally dubious move the Trump administration makes to change the enforcement system clogs up some part of the federal bureaucracy and makes it harder for the administration to achieve its stated goals.

Trump's fixation on the wall -- or fence, or steel slats, or ""peaches,"" or whatever he's calling it this week -- is a great example of how his policies tend to kneecap immigration enforcement.

The federal government is responsible for enforcing immigration law, so no one truly obsessed with deporting people would allow the federal government to shut down because that would further jam up a complex enforcement system that is already backlogged in the federal courts by more than 1 million cases.

That's exactly what's happening. The country's immigration courts are largely closed. Those who miss their court dates because of the shutdown are getting sent to the back of the line, according to The New York Times -- which can mean delays of up to four years. As of last week, nearly 43,000 hearings had been canceled, according to the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse project at Syracuse University -- with an additional 20,000 or so cancellations expected for every week the shutdown drags on.

ICE is about to blow through its detention budget again, raising legal questions about whether the agency can continue to detain some of the people in its custody, according to BuzzFeed.

These are not the kinds of results one would expect with a hard-liner in the White House. But it's a perfectly logical outcome for Trump, who campaigned on a border wall to solve a contrived crisis of illegal immigration at a time when unauthorized crossings stood at 45-year lows.

Trump's other actions have undermined enforcement, too. Within a week of taking office, he signed a sweeping executive order that, among other things, did away with Obama-era prosecutorial discretion guidelines that had directed ICE to focus its arrests on people with serious criminal records, recent border-crossers or people with previous deportations on their records. The message, which Trump's first acting director of ICE, Thomas Homan, repeated often, was clear: No one would be exempt from enforcement of federal law.

It was terrifying for migrant communities, which now feared more indiscriminate enforcement. But it also undermined the goal of increasing deportations, because it's a more complicated and longer process to remove someone from the country who has a clean criminal record and the right to a hearing before an immigration judge.

Likewise, the Trump administration shuffled judges to the border in an attempt to rush through the cases of Central American families that have shown up in larger numbers in recent years, often requesting asylum -- effectively putting cases guaranteed to be lengthy at the front of the jam-packed docket. But the judges didn't share then-Attorney General Jeff Sessions' enthusiasm for disposing of asylum cases quickly and skeptically. And the backlog in their home jurisdictions grew, too.

On top of all this, the Trump administration's hostility toward migrants and hyper-polarization of the immigration issue has made Democratic-led jurisdictions far more likely to embrace ""sanctuary"" policies limiting cooperation with ICE than they were under Obama. The consequence of Trump's lack of diplomacy is that ICE now has far less leeway to make arrests at local jails than it once did, reducing the agency's efficiency.

So, now the president who entered office promising to deport up to 3 million people is actually removing far fewer people than the Democrat who preceded him -- even though ICE's budget ballooned by more than 15 percent to $7.1 billion last year. And Trump's fixation on securing partial funding for a wall is only making him more inefficient.

None of this should be particularly surprising. Trump has fabricated a vision of the border untethered from reality to sell his wall proposal. But it has become increasingly common, as the shutdown drags on, for Trump's Republican backers in Congress to defend the president's intransigence as a common-sense plea for a long overdue commitment to a more vaguely defined ""border security.""

But there's no unusual crisis at the border other than a high number of Central American families and children, who hardly present a security threat. And to judge from Trump's record so far, he's more committed to the idea of a wall, regardless of the cost, than to actual immigration enforcement.

Some of this turns out to be good news for Trump's critics. When Trump took over the White House, he inherited an enforcement system capable of expelling a quarter-million migrants from the interior annually. But if the shutdown debacle offers any insight into his thinking, it would appear Trump does not care. He'd rather have a wall."
399,daily mail online,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6530903/Donald-Melania-Trump-make-surprise-visit-Iraq.html,"President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump made a surprise visit to Iraq on Wednesday -- their first visit to a war zone since the sitting president took office nearly two years ago.

They left from Joint Base Andrews in Maryland shortly after midnight with a small group of journalists and aides in tow. Trump was in the country for roughly three hours before the White House confirmed his whereabouts.

The president delivered a speech to the rank and file at Al Asad Airbase, took selfies with the troops and met with military leaders in Iraq.

'I want to come and pay my respects most importantly to the great soldiers,' he said of the visit. 'Great troopers we have here.'

Trump announced last week that he's pulling American troops out of neighboring Syria, because the U.S. had 'defeated ISIS' in the nation that's also mired in a civil war.

'We've knocked them out. We've knocked them silly,' he said of the U.S. assault on ISIS in Syria on Wednesday.

He claimed that in Iraq that the terror group had been 'very nearly defeated' altogether and Turkey and other regional powers will finish the job.

'We're no longer the suckers, folks,' the president said of the decision to start packing up. 'We're respected again as a nation.'

President Trump said he does not plan to withdrawal troops from Iraq, however, and could use the site as the home base for future operations in the region, according to Bloomberg News.

'If we see something happening with ISIS that we don't like, we can hit them so fast and so hard they really won't know what the hell happened,' he proclaimed.

Al Asad is roughly 185 kilometers outside of Syria, where the president last week initiated a withdrawal of 2,000 U.S. troops. It is west of Baghdad, the capital of Iraq, which is approximately 220 kilometers to the base's east.

Trump never served in the military, having received a medical diagnosis that he had bone spurs. It helped him receive an exemption from mandatory service during the Vietnam War.

The daughters of the doctor who provided the medical excuse came forward before the president was known to be in Iraq on Wednesday to claim that their father offered the diagnosis as a favor to the Trumps.

Never before had President Trump been to a war zone before his secret trip at Christmas that followed announcements that his secretary of defense and ISIS point man were leaving the administration.

Both General James Mattis and Brett McGurk tendered their resignations after Trump's realignment of the United States' military posture in the country that's closely aligned with Iran and Russia.

Trump said Wednesday that his 'generals' had received multiple six-month 'extensions' to get out of Syria.

'They said again, recently, can we have more time? I said, ""Nope. You can't have any more time. You've had enough time. We've knocked them out. We've knocked them silly,"" ' he said of ISIS' operations in Syria. 'I will tell you that I've had some very good talks with President Erdogan who wants to knock them out also and he'll do it. And others will do it to. Because we are in their region. They should be sharing the burden of costs and they're not.'

The president had spoken to Turkey's Recep Erdogan prior to his Iraq trip and was invited on the call to visit Ankara. He did not appear to have taken the leader who has begun amassing tanks on his border with Syria up on the offer before leaving the Middle East for a second undisclosed destination.

In Iraq, the president described an odd-couple coalition of Turkey and Saudi Arabia that he says will finish ISIS off and rebuild Syria.

'The United States cannot continue to be the policeman of the world,' he said, singing the same note as he had in tweets. 'It's not fair when the burden is all on us, the United States.'

Trump said he didn't want the U.S. to be 'taken advantage of any more by countries that use us and use our incredible military to protect them' as he complained that 'they don't pay for it, and they're going to have to.'

'In Syria, Erdogan said he wants to knock out ISIS, whatever's left, the remnants of ISIS. And Saudi Arabia just came out and said they are going to pay for some economic development. Which is great, that means we don't have to pay,' he rejoiced. 'We are spread out all over the world. We are in countries most people haven't even heard about. Frankly, it's ridiculous.'

Lawmakers on Capitol Hill had been highly critical of Trump's sudden withdrawal from Syria and have promised vigorous oversight of the policy he elected to share with the world before alerting them. They worry that he's making a mistake yanking U.S. forces at a time that generals like Mattis and people close to the situation like McGurk say is too early.

Still, Trump confidently told reporters Wednesday, 'It's time for us to start using our head. We don't want to be taken advantage of anymore.'

Legislators wouldn't have been alerted that Trump was traveling to Iraq this week, either, as the trip demands absolute secrecy to keep the president and his entourage safe. The president told reporters that he had actually planned previous trips to the region that had to be canceled 'because people were finding out' and it created a dangerous situation for the instiution.

'Pretty sad when you spend 7 trillion dollars in the Middle East and going in has to be under this massive cover with planes all over and all of the greatest equipment in the world and you do everything to get in safely. Pretty sad when you spend 7 trillion dollars and you have to come in through military escorts and all of the other incredible things that they did,' he griped.

Trump had reportedly avoided a trip to the region out of fear that he could be killed, but he said Wednesday that he was afraid for his wife and not himself.

'I had concerns about the institution of the presidency. Not for myself personally. I had concerns for the first lady, I will tell you,' he said. 'But if you would have see what we had to go through in the darkened plane with all window closed with no light anywhere. Pitch black. I've been on many airplanes. All types and shapes and sizes.'

The president and first lady posed for selfies with the troops before President Trump delivered a speech to U.S. forces stationed there. President Trump said one of the young men told him in the dining hall that he'd left the military and reenlisted because of the current commander in chief.

'He came back into the military because of me,' Trump repeated. The president turned back to the solider to tell him, 'And I am here because of you.'

Before the president addressed the troops in a hangar rally, the first lady greeted soldiers, telling them, 'I am proud of you.'

Her husband told the United States will defeat the terrorists. 'If anything should happen at all, nobody will ever have suffered the consequences they had suffered,' he asserted.

A meeting with the Iraqi prime minister, Adil Abdul-Mahdi, had also been scheduled for the stop that lasted three and a half hours but was cancelled.

The flight to and from Iraq takes 11-odd hours to make and the president was not expected to return to the United States until Thursday, when lawmakers were also due to be back in Washington. It is currently in the throes of a government shutdown.

President Trump had said a month ago that he would visit Afghanistan at some point but visited Iraq first over the Christmas holiday, several days after announcing that he will be pulling U.S. troops out of Syria.

'It's a place I have been talking about for many years, many many years,' he told journalists on Wednesday in a reference to his past claims that the U.S. shouldn't have waged war in Iraq after 9/11 and that it should have taken the oil as restitution. 'I was talking about it as a civilian,' he reminded.

The secret trip came amid speculation that President Trump was not at the White House, because he had not tweeted for more than 12 hours and the marine that stands guard when he's in the Oval Office was not outside the West Wing.

In a statement posted on Twitter, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders confirmed the visit in a tweet shortly after the wire service Reuters published photos of the president.

'President Trump and the First Lady traveled to Iraq late on Christmas night to visit with our troops and Senior Military leadership to thank them for their service, their success, and their sacrifice and to wish them a Merry Christmas,' she said.

President Trump suggested last month that he could visit a 'war zone' soon after a report claimed that he was avoiding Afghanistan out concern for his personal safety.

'No, I'm going to a war zone,' the president told reporters as he left the White House over his Thanksgiving break.

He didn't say whether he intended to visit troops in Iraq or Afghanistan, or when he might do so. He said in an interview that he hadn't taken the trip yet because he'd been so busy his first 22 months in office.

'I've been very busy with everything that's taking place here,' he explained.

Previous presidents have scheduled closely-held surprise trips to war zones to visit with U.S. troops stationed overseas, sometimes timed to the holidays, including George W. Bush. The former Republican president made history when he visited the country in 2003 at Thanksgiving.

Former President Barack Obama made his first and only trip to Iraq three months after taking office in 2009. He made also surprise visits to Afghanistan in 2010, 2012, and 2014.

Obama's first Afghanistan visit came over Memorial Day weekend under the cover of darkness roughly 15 months into office. His White House claimed that he was spending the holiday at Camp David, only to gather reporters in secret at Andrews Air Force Base for the covert trip.

President Trump also left overnight from Andrews under a cloud of secrecy. Reporters traveling with him were barred from sharing their whereabouts until he had left the conflict zone. Credible reports on social media that Air Force One had been spotted in foreign air space, though, tipped observant news outlets off that a secret trip was afoot.

The president's national security adviser, John Bolton, and the White House press secretary Sarah Sanders were traveling with President Trump.

Senior White House policy adviser Stephen Miller, social media director Dan Scavino, spokeswoman Lindsay Walters and Melania Trump's chief of staff Lindsay Reynolds and spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham were also aboard Air Force One.

Outgoing White House Chief of Staff John Kelly, a retired marine general whose final day working for Trump is next week, did not join his boss on the unannounced trip abroad. Incoming chief Mick Mulvaney, who wears two hats now as Office of Management and Budget head and head of the West Wing, did not make the trip, either.

Mulvaey's office oversees the shutdown that affects a quarter of the federal government.

SWIFT EXIT: Trump announced this past week that he was pulling troops out of neighboring Syria immediately"
400,daily mail online,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-6496819/Top-TV-moments-Roseanne-Oprahs-speech-message-funerals.html,"LOS ANGELES (AP) - It was a remarkably dramatic year on television, with much of it unscripted.

While prime-series including ""This Is Us"" and ""Atlanta"" reached notable emotional and provocative highs, TV impressively fulfilled its role as witness to gripping real-life events.

We had the chance to see it all unfold: today's barbed politics in unlikely settings; a woman essentially saying MeToo to U.S. senators; the suitably extravagant goodbye to an American queen.

Here are some of the moments with staying power:

OPRAH'S SPEECH

Winfrey's rousing call for social justice in the name of the MeToo movement drew wild cheers in the ballroom at the Golden Globes in January and reverberated across the land. Pundits and Oprah-whisperers proclaimed it a first step toward a presidential run, and #oprah2020 trended. It's would be a true Hollywood script: an entertainment mogul challenges a reality-show host for the Oval Office. Oprah said no way; the chatter continues.

JACK'S SACRIFICE

The time-shifting series revealed in season one that Jack Pearson (Milo Ventimiglia) was destined to die young, leaving a grieving widow, his unmoored children and viewers tortured by the mystery of what did him in. In episodes airing in January and February, we learned it was a faulty slow-cooker and Jack's boundless sense of duty. America's tears flowed even as we turned a fearful eye toward our kitchen appliances.

THE RISE AND FALL OF ""ROSEANNE""

Three decades after it ended, the comedy about the blue-collar Conner family and its brassy matriarch returned in March as a success for ABC and Roseanne Barr. The revival hit the sweet - or sour - spot of politics and culture today, with a polarizing star whose character mirrored her backing for President Donald Trump. The magic evaporated in May after Barr's racist slam of Obama adviser Valerie Jarrett. ABC called her tweet ""abhorrent"" and canceled the series.

""ATLANTA"" IN WHITE

Donald Glover, whose reimagination of the TV comedy challenges viewers, tested them with a truly unsettling character, Teddy Perkins, depicted in mask-like whiteface (an uncredited performance by Glover, though it remains a mystery who made Teddy's cameo appearance at the Emmys). Was the episode in April a riff on the sad life of a Michael Jackson-like celebrity? A slap at the insulting blackface used by white entertainers past? We're still mulling.

GADSBY'S REVOLUTION

The Australian standup was little known in America when her Netflix special ""Hannah Gadsby: Nanette"" arrived in June, dissecting culture and the very artform she practices. She was heralded as a major new voice and her work was labeled ""transformative"" and ""game changing,"" the kind of awe and admiration granted to enduring comedy greats such as Richard Pryor, George Carlin and Dave Chappelle.

ARETHA'S FAREWELL

The Queen of Soul's memorial was one for the ages, with preachers, Motown and gospel legends and political and religious leaders offering speeches and songs in praise of Franklin's life, artistry and activism on behalf of African-Americans and women. Stevie Wonder sang, and so did Smokey Robinson and Chaka Khan and Shirley Caesar and Gladys Knight and Ariana Grande and ... plenty of others, since the service ran eight hours. Franklin's voice was stilled, but her spirit resonated.

COLIN KAEPERNICK'S STAND

In his ""Just Do It"" TV spot for Nike that marked the campaign's 30th anniversary in September, the sidelined-by-kneeling NFL quarterback somberly challenged viewers to ""believe in something, even if it means sacrificing everything."" Some responded with anger, cutting or burning Nike gear and calling for boycotts. President Donald Trump slammed the company's move, while LeBron James defended it, saying he stands for those who believe in change.

A SUPREME BATTLE

In schools, at work, in coffee shops, Americans watched on phones, laptops and any available screen as U.S. Supreme Court appointee Brett Kavanaugh and sexual-misconduct accuser Christine Blasey Ford made their emotional cases in September to a Senate committee. The hearing reinforced the extraordinary power of TV to present an event as it unfolds, allowing us to judge it for ourselves before it's filtered and packaged for consumption and ""Saturday Night Live"" satire.

BLACKOUT FOR KELLY

Megyn Kelly argued the case for dressing up in Halloween blackface, telling her morning show viewers it was OK when she was a kid if it was an impersonation. The backlash was immediate, with critics accusing Kelly of ignoring the ugly history of white entertainers applying blackface to demean African-Americans. The former Fox News Channel host offered a tearful on-air apology, but NBC fired her in October from the 9 a.m. ""Today"" slot after just a year.

DEATH AND POLITICS

Funeral services were for mourning and messages. At Sen. John McCain's September memorial, daughter Meghan issued a sharp rebuke to his nemesis President Donald Trump, who was left off the invitation list. ""The America of John McCain has no need to be made great again because America was always great,"" she said. President George H.W. Bush's memorial in December was kinder and gentler and Trump attended, but he was the first sitting president in 45 years not asked to eulogize a predecessor.

401,the huffington post,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/audiences-boo-trump-footage-in-hit-play-network_us_5c1d8957e4b05c88b6f8c349,"""Network"" -- a wild trip into the dark underbelly of TV news, with its burgeoning bombast, twisted screen reality and rabid ratings chases -- ends each night after the standing ovation with filmed news sequences of the oaths of office taken by American presidents beginning with Jimmy Carter.

Barack Obama's oath is almost always met with cheers and applause, while Trump's ceremony is usually boisterously booed in the president's hometown, several theatergoers and staffers tell HuffPost.

Audiences members also began applauding George H.W. Bush after his death last month in previews (the play opened Dec. 6).

The play isn't about politics. It's a scathing commentary on the trajectory of the television news business as it careens into entertainment driven by profit. Originally written in 1976 as a screenplay by Paddy Chayevsky, the then over-the-top story line now seems eerily prescient.

""Breaking Bad"" star Cranston, who plays haunted protagonist anchor Howard Beale, took a dig at the media in an interview last month with The New York Times, saying ""people are ""gullible"" if they believe everything they see on TV. He not only named Fox News, but also CNN and MSNBC. He told The Hollywood Reporter that the manipulation of the media -- and politics -- is part of the ""toxic, destructive stew we're living in now.""

But the final news footage adds an anti-Trump grace note to the play that encourages audience participation.

New York theater is developing a bit of an anti-Trump reputation. Last summer the Public Theater's Shakespeare in the Park series presented a Julius Caesar production with an assassination scene featuring a contemporary blond Caesar in a red tie and dark suit that resembled Trump (Trump retweeted a critical tweet about the play.)"
402,the huffington post,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/jen-kerns_us_5c1f5461e4b08aaf7a89a53a,"Jen Kerns bashed the employees on Twitter, arguing that ""American ppl just don't feel sorry for paper-pusher bureaucrats.""

While more than 420,000 federal employees are working without pay during the government shutdown, one GOP strategist claimed it was of little importance to most Americans.

In an MSNBC interview Saturday, Jen Kerns told the Rev. Al Sharpton that those punching the clock without a paycheck would receive little sympathy from the public.

""I may sound like the Grinch saying it, but look, the bureaucrats in Washington, D.C., did not suffer as the rest of America did in the last 10 years with the Obama recession,"" she argued.

But Sharpton wasn't buying it.

""We're talking about a shutdown,"" he said, attempting to steer the strategist away from criticism of President Donald Trump's predecessor and back to the matter at hand. ""We're talking about men and women sitting at the dinner table on Christmas Day not knowing when they're going to see their next paycheck, and you're calling them paper pushers and bureaucrats, so they don't matter.""

Kerns shot back: ""I didn't say they don't matter. I'm saying they have a different job security and pay scale than the rest of the American people have felt over the last eight to 10 years.""

Doubling down on her remarks via Twitter, Kerns wrote, ""It's true! American ppl just don't feel sorry for paper-pusher bureaucrats in D.C. who bullied the Tea Party for years, & who haven't had a layoff or to forgo their 4-5% pay increases while Americans were laid off many years. Sorry!""

As of midnight Saturday, the government came grinding to a halt over Congress' inability to compromise on a spending deal as Trump demands it include $5 billion for the wall on the southern border.

The bill passed the Republican-led House, but it was blocked by the Senate, suggesting that the impasse might not be resolved until January when Democrats take back control of the House.

While federal workers have been reimbursed for their services following previous shutdowns, for now, they'll have to wait."

And the supermodel took to her Youtube channel on Tuesday to document all the great milestones she achieved during the year - all 118 of them.

The 26-year-old cover girl listed the myriad of experiences in a video post as she said one of the brighter highlights was her marriage to beau Joshua Kushner.

The American bombshell began the recorded diary session with showcasing her acheivements such as her Kode With Klossy initiative.

The program is a summer camp for girls to learn software programming.

It took off in 2018 as she promoted it on various talk shows and even a summit with Michelle Obama.

And that included dancing with the former First Lady on two separate occasions.

But her most heartwarming moment came when she broke down in tears seeing her Dior couture wedding dress for the first time.

She also shared snippets of her wedding to Joshua. Karlie married Joshua , 33, in mid-October in an intimate wedding in upstate New York.

The lovebirds exchanged their I do's after six years together; they got engaged this past July.

According to the Jewish Telegraphic Agency , the couple wed in a Jewish ceremony - Kloss reportedly converted in June before the couple became engaged.

Her good friend Derek Blasberg also attended, and after the ceremony wrote: 'I'm a bigger man for watching my little sister become a real wifey today.'

The couple, who are notoriously private, have been dating since 2012, and refuse to even pose together at most events.

New ventures: Karlie hosted a television show in 2018

New friends: Karlie made friends with a churros vendor on the NYC subway

It was not until 2015 that Josh was even spotted out at an event with Karlie when the two attended at the Met Gala.

The supermodel has also made it clear that the details of her private life are not something that she will be sharing with fans now or in the future.

'It's not like I've ever wanted to be so secretive about my private life,' she recently said in an interview with Porter.

'Carolina Herrera always says, ""A woman who's an open book is boring."" There's no mystery anymore. I know in my life what really matters to me. I'm not trying to hide that from the world; I just really like having a more private private life.' She then added: 'I've got nothing to hide, though!'

WASHINGTON (AP) - It looks like Christmas will be over and done with before the federal government will have a chance to get fully back to business.

Even a temporary measure to end a partial shutdown seems out of reach until the Senate returns for a full session Thursday.

President Donald Trump wants money for a border wall with Mexico and Democrats oppose that. The partial shutdown began Saturday and has limited impact over the next few days, because both Monday and Tuesday are federal holidays

The first day of the shutdown played out unevenly. The Statue of Liberty was still open for tours, thanks to money from New York state, and the U.S. Post Office was still delivering mail.

Yet the disruption is affecting many operations and some 800,000 federal employees.

AP Explains: What happens in a partial government shutdown

A look at the impact of the partial government shutdown:

____

WHAT'S OPEN AND WHAT'S CLOSED

Social Security checks will go out and troops will remain at their posts. Doctors and hospitals will receive their Medicare and Medicaid reimbursements. The U.S. Postal Service, busy delivering packages for the holiday season, is an independent agency and won't be affected. Passport services, which are funded by fees and not government spending, will also continue.

Virtually every essential government agency, including the FBI, the Border Patrol and the Coast Guard, will remain open. Transportation Security Administration officers will staff airport checkpoints.

Tsunami triggered by volcano sweeps Indonesia beach; 62 dead

JAKARTA, Indonesia (AP) - A tsunami apparently caused by the eruption of an island volcano killed at least 62 people around Indonesia's Sunda Strait, sending a wall of water crashing some 65 feet (20 meters) inland and sweeping away hundreds of houses including hotels, the government and witnesses said.

Some 600 people have been reported injured when the tsunami hit 9:27 p.m. Saturday, the Disaster Management Agency said. At least 20 others are unaccounted for.

Scientists from Indonesia's Meteorology and Geophysics agency said it could have been caused by undersea landslides from the eruption of Anak Krakatau, a volcanic island formed over years from the nearby Krakatau volcano. They also cited tidal waves caused by the full moon.

Footage posted on social media showed a pop band named ""Seventeen"" performing under a tent on a beach as dozens of people sat listening at tables covered in white cloths. As bright strobe lights flashed on stage, a child could be seen wandering through the crowd. Then, in between songs with the drummer pounding, the stage suddenly heaved forward, throwing the band and all their equipment into the audience.

The band released a statement saying their bass player and road manager were found dead, while four other members of their group remained missing.

US envoy to anti-IS coalition quits over Trump's Syria move

WASHINGTON (AP) - Brett McGurk, the U.S. envoy to the global coalition fighting the Islamic State group, has resigned in protest over President Donald Trump's abrupt decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria, joining Defense Secretary Jim Mattis in an administration exodus of experienced national security figures. McGurk described Trump's decision as a ""shock.""

Only 11 days ago, McGurk had said it would be ""reckless"" to consider IS defeated and therefore would be unwise to bring American forces home. McGurk decided to speed up his original plan to leave his post in mid-February.

""The recent decision by the president came as a shock and was a complete reversal of policy,"" he said in an email to his staff viewed by The Associated Press. ""It left our coalition partners confused and our fighting partners bewildered with no plan in place or even considered thought as to consequences.""

Trump's announcement of the withdrawal ""left our coalition partners confused and our fighting partners bewildered with no plan in place or even considered thought as to consequences,"" the email went on.

Appointed to the post by President Barack Obama in 2015 and retained by Trump, McGurk said in his resignation letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo that the militants were on the run, but not yet defeated, and that the premature pullout of U.S. forces from Syria would create the conditions that gave rise to IS.

Trump's 2018: A year in a stranger-than-sitcom presidency

WASHINGTON (AP) - The stranger-than-sitcom American presidency opened 2018 with a big tease about mutual nuclear destruction from two leaders who then found ""love"" not war. It seems President Donald Trump and North Korea's Kim Jong Un were just playing hard to get.

The presidency ends the year saturated in tumult, with the government in partial shutdown and Trump tweeting a video of himself warbling a parody of the theme song from ""Green Acres,"" a television sitcom from the 1960s, to mark his signing of a farm bill.

Throw in a beer-loving and very angry Supreme Court nominee, an unhappy departing defense secretary, Trump's parallel universe of facts and his zillion tweets, and you can see that the president's world this year was touched by the weird, the traumatic and the fantastical - also known as WTF.

There was no holding back the self-described ""very stable genius"" with the ""very, very large brain.""

Some serious and relatively conventional things got done in 2018.

Analysis: Trump, Republicans flirting with a political split

WASHINGTON (AP) - President Donald Trump's relationship with the Republican Party, always a marriage of convenience, is showing signs of serious strain.

The president threatened his bond with virtually every GOP constituency this past week.

His move to withdraw troops from Syria led to the resignation of Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and left Washington's Republican foreign policy establishment aghast, drawing unusual criticism from Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., and Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., normally a Trump ally.

Trump's initial openness to a government funding bill that didn't include money for his much-heralded border wall with Mexico infuriated conservatives, including the talk radio and cable television personalities who often shower the president with praise. By pushing the government into a partial shutdown with no clear strategy out, Trump frustrated the rest of his party, which was hoping for a holiday break from Trump-driven dramas.

The divergent plotlines had a common theme: Trump's rejection of his party's counsel as he looks once again to rely on his own instincts to guide his political future.

Partial government shutdown compounds risks for US economy

WASHINGTON (AP) - Now in its 10th year, America's economic expansion still looks sturdy. Yet the partial shutdown of the government that began Saturday has added another threat to a growing list of risks.

The stock market's persistent fall, growing chaos in the Trump administration, higher interest rates, a U.S.-China trade war and a global slowdown have combined to elevate the perils for the economy.

Gregory Daco, chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, said he thinks the underlying fundamentals for growth remain strong and that the expansion will continue. But he cautioned that the falling stock market reflects multiple hazards that can feed on themselves.

""What really matters is how people perceive these headwinds - and right now markets and investors perceive them as leading us into a recessionary environment,"" Daco said.

Many economic barometers still look encouraging. Unemployment is near a half-century low. Inflation is tame. Pay growth has picked up. Consumers boosted their spending this holiday season. Indeed, the latest figures indicate that the economy has been fundamentally healthy during the final month of 2018.

Connected cars accelerate down data-collection highway

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - That holiday trip over the river and through the woods to grandmother's house could turn into nice little gift for automakers as they increasingly collect oodles and oodles of data about the driver.

Automakers are collecting valuable pieces of information thanks to the internet connections, cameras and sensors built into most vehicles in recent years. The online access makes it possible for cars to be unlocked remotely if the keys are lost. It's how safety features can be upgraded wirelessly and maintenance schedules adjusted based on performance.

But these digital peepholes are also offering a windshield-size view of people's lives. That's creating the potential for intrusive marketing pitches and government surveillance.

No serious incidents have occurred in the United States, Europe and Japan, but a red flag has already been raised in China, where automakers have been sharing location details of connected cars with the government.

""We are not that far away from when 100 percent of all new cars will come equipped with data modems,"" Navigant Research analyst Sam Abuelsamid predicted. ""Having the potential to collect more data about people in their cars means there is going to be potential for abuses, too.""

No. 18 Arizona State knocks off top-ranked Kansas 80-76

TEMPE, Ariz. (AP) - Rob Edwards scored 15 points and hit two free throws with 6.1 seconds left, setting off a wild celebration in the desert as No. 18 Arizona State knocked off No. 1 Kansas 80-76 on Saturday night.

The second No. 1 team to play in Tempe drew a star-studded crowd, with Michael Phelps, Jason Kidd, Grant Hill, Eddie House and Arizona governor Doug Ducey among the third-largest crowd (14,592) in school history.

Arizona State (9-2) struggled hitting shots around the rim and stopping Kansas preseason All-American Dedric Lawson while falling behind by nine.

Like Arizona State did while beating Kansas a year ago, the Sun Devils rallied late, using a 10-0 run to go up 76-74 with 90 seconds left.

Kansas tied it on two free throws, then Arizona State's Remy Martin hit a pull-up jumper with 58 seconds left. The Jayhawks (10-1) fumbled the ball away for a backcourt violation on the next possession and Edwards hit the two sealing free throws for Arizona State's second win over a No. 1 team. The victory set off a massive celebration inside Wells Fargo Arena as the students poured out of the stands onto the court.

Gabbert keeps Titans' hopes alive, beating Redskins 25-16

NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) - The Tennessee Titans finally have a victory in a game where quarterback Marcus Mariota left injured, and Blaine Gabbert did much more than just win.

Gabbert kept the Titans' playoff hopes alive.

The veteran threw a 2-yard touchdown pass to MyCole Pruitt with 4:30 left and the Titans rallied to beat the Washington Redskins 25-16 on Saturday for their fourth straight victory.

""I don't know,"" Gabbert said when asked if this was the biggest win of his eight-year career with four teams. ""It was a fun win. We got a big game next week.""

The victory was Tennessee's first in the seven career games that Mariota has left with an injury."

The resignation letter to Pompeo was submitted Friday and described to the AP on Saturday by an official familiar with its contents. The official was not authorized to discuss the matter publicly before the letter was released and spoke on condition of anonymity.

Trump played down the development, tweeting Saturday night that ""I do not know"" the envoy and it's a ""nothing event."" He noted McGurk planned to leave soon anyway and added: ""Grandstander?""

Shortly after news of McGurk's resignation broke, Trump again defended his decision to pull all of the roughly 2,000 U.S. forces from Syria in the coming weeks.

""We were originally going to be there for three months, and that was seven years ago - we never left,"" Trump tweeted. ""When I became President, ISIS was going wild. Now ISIS is largely defeated and other local countries, including Turkey, should be able to easily take care of whatever remains. We're coming home!""

Although the civil war in Syria has gone on since 2011, the U.S. did not begin launching airstrikes against IS until September 2014, and American troops did not go into Syria until 2015.

McGurk, whose resignation is effective Dec. 31, was planning to leave the job in mid-February after a U.S.-hosted meeting of foreign ministers from the coalition countries, but he felt he could continue no longer after Trump's decision to withdraw from Syria and Mattis' resignation.

In his email to his staff, McGurk said: ""I worked this week to help manage some of the fallout, but - as many of you heard in my many meetings and phone calls - I ultimately concluded that I could not carry out these new instructions and maintain my integrity at the same time.""

Trump's declaration of a victory over IS has been roundly contradicted by his own experts' assessments, and his decision to pull troops out was widely denounced by members of Congress, who called his action rash.

Mattis, perhaps the most respected foreign policy official in the administration, announced on Thursday that he will leave by the end of February. He told Trump in a letter that he was departing because ""you have a right to have a Secretary of Defense whose views are better aligned with yours.""

The withdrawal decision will fulfill Trump's goal of bringing troops home from Syria, but military leaders have pushed back for months, arguing that the IS group remains a threat and could regroup in Syria's long-running civil war. U.S. policy has been to keep troops in place until the extremists are eradicated.

Among officials' key concerns is that a U.S. pullout will leave U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces vulnerable to attacks by Turkey, the Syrian government and remaining IS fighters. The SDF, a Kurdish-led force, is America's only military partner in Syria

McGurk said at a State Department briefing on Dec. 11 that ""it would be reckless if we were just to say, 'Well, the physical caliphate is defeated, so we can just leave now.'""

McGurk, 45, previously served as a deputy assistant secretary of state for Iraq and Iran. During the negotiations for the Iran nuclear deal by the Obama administration, he led secret side talks with Tehran on the release of Americans imprisoned there.

McGurk was briefly considered for the post of ambassador to Iraq after having served as a senior official covering Iraq and Afghanistan during President George W. Bush's administration.

A former Supreme Court law clerk to the late Chief Justice William Rehnquist, McGurk worked as a lawyer for the Coalition Provisional Authority in Iraq after the 2003 U.S.-led invasion and joined Bush's National Security Council staff, where in 2007 and 2008, he was the lead U.S. negotiator on security agreements with Iraq.

Taking over for now for McGurk will be his deputy, retired Lt. Gen. Terry Wolff, who served three tours of active duty in Iraq.

IS militants still hold a string of villages and towns along the Euphrates River in eastern Syria, where they have resisted weeks of attacks by the U.S.-supported Syrian Democratic Forces to drive them out. The pocket is home to about 15,000 people, among them 2,000 IS fighters, according to U.S. military estimates.

But that figure could be as high as 8,000 militants, if fighters hiding out in the deserts south of the Euphrates River are also counted, according to according to the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which monitors the conflict through networks of local informants."

In a series of fiery tweets tonight, POTUS also dismissed the top US envoy in the fight against ISIS as an 'Obama appointee' who he claimed he did not know.

Earlier today Brett McGurk announced that he is resigning in the wake of Trump's decision to pull troops out of Syria and just days after Secretary of Defense James Mattis stepped down.

McGurk was to leave the role in February but moved up his departure date by two months to December 31 after very publicly stating that the move to pull American forces at this time could result in a 'possibly catastrophic outcome'.

Trump also fired a parting shot at Mattis, the most respected foreign policy official in the administration who will leave by the end of February.

McGurk (left) and Mattis (right), who worked alongside each other, had both opposed withdrawing troops from Syria as well as reducing the US presence in Afghanistan

President Donald Trump reportedly overruled Mattis' objection in deciding to withdraw American troops from Syria. He later said he would leave so Trump could have someone in the position that more closely agreed with him on policy strategy

He tweeted: 'When President Obama ingloriously fired Jim Mattis, I gave him a second chance.

'Some thought I shouldn't, I thought I should. Interesting relationship-but I also gave all of the resources that he never really had. Allies are very important-but not when they take advantage of U.S'.

The former United States Marine Corps general commanded the 1st Marine Division during the 2003 invasion of Iraq.

He later served as the Commander of United States Central Command under Obama.

In his resignation later on Thursday, he told Trump that he was departing because 'you have a right to have a Secretary of Defense whose views are better aligned with yours.'

Only 11 days ago, McGurk urged those who believed ISIS had been defeated to reexamine that notion while explaining why he believed it would be unwise to bring American forces home.

He reiterated those points in his resignation letter, stating that the militants were on the run, but not yet defeated.

McGurk also noted that the premature pullout of American forces from Syria would create the conditions that had initially given rise to ISIS and other terror groups in the past.

He also cited gains in accelerating the campaign against IS, but that the work was not yet done.

McGurk said at a State Department briefing on December 11 that 'it would be reckless if we were just to say: 'Well, the physical caliphate is defeated, so we can just leave now.

'I think anyone who's looked at a conflict like this would agree with that.'

A week before that, Gen. Joseph Dunford, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said the U.S. had a long way to go in training local Syrian forces to prevent a resurgence of IS and stabilize Syria.

He said it would take 35,000 to 40,000 local troops in northeastern Syria to maintain security over the long term, but only about 20 percent of that number had been trained.

McGurk, whose resignation is effective December 31, was planning to leave the job in mid-February after a US-hosted meeting of foreign ministers from the coalition countries.

However said he he felt he could continue no longer after Trump's decision to withdraw from Syria and Mattis' resignation.

'When I became President, ISIS was going wild. Now ISIS is largely defeated and other local countries, including Turkey, should be able to easily take care of whatever remains. We're coming home!'

Many lawmakers have called his action rash and dangerous.

The U.S. began airstrikes in Syria in 2014, and ground troops moved in the following year to battle IS and train Syrian rebels in a country torn apart by civil war.

The SDF, a Kurdish-led force that is America's only military partner in Syria, said Thursday: ""The war against Islamic State has not ended and the group has not been defeated."" The group is at the front lines of the battle against IS along the Euphrates River.

It said a U.S. withdrawal would leave Syrians ""between the claws of enemy forces.""

At their height in 2014, Islamic State militants controlled approximately a third of territory in Syria and Iraq, including major cities in both countries. The group flourished in the political vacuum of Syria's civil war, in which President Bashar Assad has violently put down a 2011 uprising against his family's 40-year rule.

Secretary of Defense James Mattis's letter of resignation

December 20, 2018

Dear Mr. President:

I have been privileged to serve as our country's 26th Secretary of Defense which has allowed me to serve alongside our men and women of the Department in defense of our citizens and our ideals.

I am proud of the progress that has been made over the past two years on some of the key goals articulated in our National Defense Strategy: putting the Department on a more sound budgetary footing, improving readiness and lethality in our forces, and reforming the Department's business practices for greater performance. Our troops continue to provide the capabilities needed to prevail in con?ict and sustain strong U.S. global influence.

One core belief I have always held is that our strength as a nation is inextricably linked to the strength of our unique and comprehensive system of alliances and partnerships. While the US remains the indispensable nation in the free world, we cannot protect our interests or serve that role effectively without maintaining strong alliances and showing respect to those allies. Like you, I have said from the beginning that the armed forces of the United States should not be the policeman of the world. Instead, we must use all tools of American power to provide for the common defense, including providing effective leadership to our alliances. NATO's 29 democracies demonstrated that strength in their commitment to fighting alongside us following the 9-11 attack on America. The Defeat-ISIS coalition of 74 nations is further proof.

Similarly, I believe we must be resolute and unambiguous in our approach to those countries whose strategic interests are increasingly in tension with ours. It is clear that China and Russia, for example, want to shape a world consistent with their authoritarian model gaining veto authority over other nations? economic, diplomatic, and security decisions to promote their own interests at the expense of their neighbors, America and our allies. That is why we must use all the tools of American power to provide for the common defense.

My views on treating allies with respect and also being clear-eyed about both malign actors and strategic competitors are strongly held and informed by over four decades of immersion in these issues. We must do everything possible to advance an international order that is most conducive to our security, prosperity and values, and we are strengthened in this effort by the solidarity of our alliances.

Because you have the right to have a Secretary of Defense whose views are better aligned with yours on these and other subjects, I believe it is right for me to step down from my position. The end date for my tenure is February 28, 2019, a date that should allow sufficient time for a successor to be nominated and confimed as well as to make sure the Department's interests are properly articulated and protected at upcoming events to include Congressional posture hearings and the NATO Defense Ministerial meeting in February. Further, that a full transition to a new Secretary of Defense occurs well in advance of the transition of Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in September in order to ensure stability Within the Department.

I pledge my full effort to a smooth transition that ensures the needs and interests of the 2.15 million Service Members and 732,079 civilians receive undistracted attention of the Department at all times so that they can fulfill their critical, round-the-clock mission to protect the American people.

I very much appreciate this opportunity to serve the nation and our men and women in uniform.

407,daily mail online,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6527387/Trump-tears-ISIS-envoy-quit-early-rants-Republican-critic-Little-Bob-Corker.html,"President Donald Trump claimed Monday that a diplomat who quit the administration, because he's pulling troops out of Syria, was responsible for the pallets of cash the U.S. sent Iran after a global nuclear agreement.

Trump slammed both the ex-official and retiring Republican Sen. Bob Corker in a tweet that he sent from the White House residence, as he defended his dismissal of Defense Secretary James Mattis in a string of Christmas Eve tweets.

'For all of the sympathizers out there of Brett McGurk remember, he was the Obama appointee who was responsible for loading up airplanes with 1.8 Billion Dollars in CASH & sending it to Iran as part of the horrific Iran Nuclear Deal (now terminated) approved by Little Bob Corker,' Trump claimed.

The president appeared to be referring to a 2016 article in the Wall Street Journal that said McGurk helped then-Secretary of State John Kerry facilitate a prisoner swap with Tehran and the return of frozen funds that the nuclear agreement freed up.

Trump slammed both the ex-official and retiring Republican Sen. Bob Corker in a tweet, that he sent from the White House residence, as he defended his dismissal of Defense Secretary James Mattis (right in a string of Christmas Eve tweets

He's feuding with Corker, who is on his final days as a senator, over Syria, as well

Since the Iranian revolution, the U.S. had been sitting on the money that Tehran paid for weapons it never received. That money, roughly $1.7 billion, was returned after the U.S. lifted certain economic sanctions on Iran as part of the nuclear deal.

The timing of the prisoner swap and the cash hand-off had Republicans crying foul.

Corker was the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee at the time.

Trump has never forgiven him for his role in helping Obama get the approval he needed for the Iran nuclear deal from Congress.

The Republican senator personally disapproved of the agreement and said so repeatedly. He led the charge to create a congressional approval process that ultimately gave Barack Obama permission to move forward so that Congress would have a role in reviewing whatever was put forward.

Corker is retiring from the Senate and has been vocal on his way out about his differences with the president.

He said Sunday on CNN that he was 'saddened' by Trump's decision to withdraw troops from Syria.

'I'm just saddened for our country. I'm saddened for the broken relationships with countries that have been with us. I'm saddened for the many Kurds and others that likely will be -- will be killed and slaughtered by the Syrians or the Turks. I'm saddened for our country in being so unreliable,' the Republican senator said.

The chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee in the Senate until the first of the year, Corker has been critical of Trump's decision to suddenly withdraw U.S. troops from the country that's mired in a civil war.

'I do not understand, I have no understanding of what we did -- why we did what we did in Syria,' Corker said on 'State of the Union' on Sunday morning. 'It just totally boggles any sane thinking that could take place, boggles. I don't understand it.'

Trump announced after the appearance that he was pushing Defense Secretary James Mattis out of his administration on January 1. Mattis was supposed to remain on the job until Feb. 28.

Mattis named late February as his exit in his resignation letter, calling it 'a date that should allow sufficient time for a successor to be nominated and confirmed as well as to make sure the department's interests are properly articulated and protected at upcoming events.'

His letter noted his views were not aligned with the president's.

Trump agreed in tweets over the weekend that they had very different positions on the global responsibilities of the United States.

'We are substantially subsidizing the Militaries of many VERY rich countries all over the world, while at the same time these countries take total advantage of the U.S., and our TAXPAYERS, on Trade. General Mattis did not see this as a problem. I DO, and it is being fixed! he said in a Monday morning twee.,

The president named Deputy Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan acting Pentagon chief in a Sunday morning tweet.

'I am pleased to announce that our very talented Deputy Secretary of Defense, Patrick Shanahan, will assume the title of Acting Secretary of Defense starting January 1, 2019. Patrick has a long list of accomplishments while serving as Deputy, & previously Boeing. He will be great!' he said.

Trump announced Mattis' imminent departure on Sunday morning on Twitter

This will be the third acting Cabinet member in Trump's administration: Matthew Whitaker is acting attorney general; David Bernhardt will take over as acting Secretary of Interior with Ryan Zinke exit at end of the year; and now Shanahan at Pentagon.

Mick Mulvaney has been named acting chief of staff, which the Trump White House classifies as Cabinet level position.

Pentagon spokesman Col. Rob Manning said in a statement Sunday that 'the secretary of defense serves at the pleasure of the President. The department remains focused on national security.'

Mulvaney said on Sunday -- before Mattis' early departure was announced -- that the relationship between Trump and Mattis had been 'fraying,' affirming reports that there's tension between the two men.

'Look, let's be honest with each other. I think the relationship between these two men have been fraying. I think the president no longer relied on Mattis to be able to deliver the president's vision,' he said on 'Fox News Sunday.'

He noted on ABC's 'This Week' that military general and Trump 'didn't have the same world view.'

'You heard the president say a couple weeks ago, I think, in an interview that he recognized that Mr. Mattis - he called him a Democrat,' Mulvaney said.

He added: 'So no, I don't think it was a surprise.'

Tensions have long said to be thick between the two. Mattis' departure brought groans from Trump critics, who claimed one of the few 'grownups' in the Trump administration was leaving.

Democrats also used Mattis' fiery resignation letter, which he told aides to distribute, as their new cause celebrity.

But lawmakers and the defense industry were also rattled by the departure.

'I was one of many senators who privately sat down with General Mattis and said, 'Please stay, stay as long as you possibly can,' Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin said Sunday on NBC's Meet the Press.' 'We desperately need your mature voice, your patriotism in the room when this president's making life or death decisions about national security. But it obviously reached a breaking point.'

He added: 'It breaks my heart that he's going to step aside. We counted on him to be there and to stop this president from his worst impulse.'

Trump complained on Sunday the media was more focused on his decision to remove U.S. troops from Syria than the two pieces of legislation he signed intio law last week.

'We signed two pieces of major legislation this week, Criminal Justice Reform and the Farm Bill. These are two Big Deals, but all the Fake News Media wants to talk about is ""the mistake"" of bringing our young people back home from the Never Ending Wars. It all began 19 years ago!,' he wrote.

When Mattis announced his exit on Thursday, the onetime Marine Corps general did it on his own terms - listing the ways he's incompatible with his commander-in-chief.

Chief among them is that Mattis believes Trump hasn't tended the diplomatic garden of international alliances, leaving the United States unable to defend its interests overseas.

Trump is said to be angry at how Mattis' (left) resignation letter is been seen as a rebuke of his presidency

Deputy Secretary of Defense Patrick M. Shanahan will be named acting Pentagon chief

And the timing of his announcement was unmistakably linked to the president's announcement Thursday of a troop pullout from Syria that the two men disagreed about.

'Because you have the right to a Secretary of Defense whose views are better aligned with yours on these and other subjects,' Mattis wrote after his litany, 'I believe it is right for me to step down from my position.'

'One core belief I have always held is that our strength as a nation is inextricably linked to the strength of our unique and comprehensive system of alliances and partnerships,' he wrote.

'While the US remains the indispensable nation in the free world, we cannot protect our interests or serve that role effectively without maintaining strong alliances and showing respect to those allies.'

Mattis also declared that America 'must be resolute and unambiguous in our approach to those countries whose strategic interests are increasingly in tension with ours.'

Trump has swiped at critics of his decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria by saying if anyone else brought soldiers home they would be branded a 'hero'.

In a series of fiery tweets Saturday night, the president also dismissed the top U.S. envoy in the fight against ISIS as an 'Obama appointee' who he claimed he did not know.

Trump launched a tirade on Twitter (pictured) against top US officials who resigned within days of each other after they disagreed with his decision to pull troops out of Syria

Earlier Saturday, Special Presidential Envoy for the Global Coalition to Counter ISIL Brett McGurk announced his resignation in the wake of Trump's decision to pull troops out of Syria and just days after Mattis's announced departure.

Responding to the news , Trump tweeted: 'Brett McGurk, who I do not know, was appointed by President Obama in 2015.

'Was supposed to leave in February but he just resigned prior to leaving. Grandstander? The Fake News is making such a big deal about this nothing event!.

'If anybody but your favorite President, Donald J. Trump, announced that, after decimating ISIS in Syria, we were going to bring our troops back home (happy & healthy), that person would be the most popular hero in America. With me, hit hard instead by the Fake News Media. Crazy!'

The veteran diplomat, who got his start in the administration of George W. Bush and was appointed to his current post by Barack Obama, now joins Mattis in an administration exodus of experienced national security officials.

Trump also fired a parting shot at Mattis, saying, 'When President Obama ingloriously fired Jim Mattis, I gave him a second chance.

'Some thought I shouldn't, I thought I should. Interesting relationship-but I also gave all of the resources that he never really had. Allies are very important-but not when they take advantage of U.S'.

The former United States Marine Corps general commanded the 1st Marine Division during the 2003 invasion of Iraq.

He later served as the Commander of United States Central Command under Obama.

Trump made waves Wednesday at the Pentagon by announcing his withdrawal of America's mid-size military contingent stationed in Syria.

The decision, reached Tuesday in a small group meeting at the White House, didn't include consultation with Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.

Mattis and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo were in the room. Both objected.

Trump declared this week that his administration has won the war against the ISIS terror army, even though the Pentagon has said the group still has 30,000 soldiers in Iraq and Syria.

Mattis has long been rumored to be on the way out -- talk that Trump at first shot down.

But asked in October during a '60 Minutes' interview whether his Pentagon chief might be leaving, President Trump later responded: 'Well, I don't know. He hasn't told me that.'

'I have a very good relationship with him. It could be that he is. I think he's sort of a Democrat, if you want to know the truth,' he said. 'But General Mattis is a good guy. We get along very well. He may leave. I mean, at some point, everybody leaves. Everybody. People leave. That's Washington.'

Secretary of Defense James Mattis's letter of resignation

December 20, 2018

Dear Mr. President:

I have been privileged to serve as our country's 26th Secretary of Defense which has allowed me to serve alongside our men and women of the Department in defense of our citizens and our ideals.

I am proud of the progress that has been made over the past two years on some of the key goals articulated in our National Defense Strategy: putting the Department on a more sound budgetary footing, improving readiness and lethality in our forces, and reforming the Department's business practices for greater performance. Our troops continue to provide the capabilities needed to prevail in con?ict and sustain strong U.S. global influence.

One core belief I have always held is that our strength as a nation is inextricably linked to the strength of our unique and comprehensive system of alliances and partnerships. While the US remains the indispensable nation in the free world, we cannot protect our interests or serve that role effectively without maintaining strong alliances and showing respect to those allies. Like you, I have said from the beginning that the armed forces of the United States should not be the policeman of the world. Instead, we must use all tools of American power to provide for the common defense, including providing effective leadership to our alliances. NATO's 29 democracies demonstrated that strength in their commitment to fighting alongside us following the 9-11 attack on America. The Defeat-ISIS coalition of 74 nations is further proof.

Similarly, I believe we must be resolute and unambiguous in our approach to those countries whose strategic interests are increasingly in tension with ours. It is clear that China and Russia, for example, want to shape a world consistent with their authoritarian model gaining veto authority over other nations? economic, diplomatic, and security decisions to promote their own interests at the expense of their neighbors, America and our allies. That is why we must use all the tools of American power to provide for the common defense.

My views on treating allies with respect and also being clear-eyed about both malign actors and strategic competitors are strongly held and informed by over four decades of immersion in these issues. We must do everything possible to advance an international order that is most conducive to our security, prosperity and values, and we are strengthened in this effort by the solidarity of our alliances.

Because you have the right to have a Secretary of Defense whose views are better aligned with yours on these and other subjects, I believe it is right for me to step down from my position. The end date for my tenure is February 28, 2019, a date that should allow sufficient time for a successor to be nominated and confimed as well as to make sure the Department's interests are properly articulated and protected at upcoming events to include Congressional posture hearings and the NATO Defense Ministerial meeting in February. Further, that a full transition to a new Secretary of Defense occurs well in advance of the transition of Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in September in order to ensure stability Within the Department.

I pledge my full effort to a smooth transition that ensures the needs and interests of the 2.15 million Service Members and 732,079 civilians receive undistracted attention of the Department at all times so that they can fulfill their critical, round-the-clock mission to protect the American people.

I very much appreciate this opportunity to serve the nation and our men and women in uniform.

408,bbc news,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-37982000,"Donald Trump made a string of promises during his long campaign to be the 45th president of the United States.

Many of them made headlines - from banning all Muslims entering the US, to building a wall along the border with Mexico.

So how is he doing?

Before election: Trump promised to lower the corporate tax rate and huge tax cuts for working Americans.

After: The Republican tax plan finally passed in December 2017, and it largely ticks the box for the president although its merits are hotly disputed. He has had to compromise on his pledge to bring corporation tax down from 35% to 15% (it will be 21% instead). And the tax cuts for individuals will expire, although Republicans say future governments will simply renew them. But wealthy Americans are expected to benefit more than poorer ones.

Before: As a candidate, Mr Trump derided climate change as a hoax concocted by China, and the regulations of Paris as stifling to American growth.

After: After three months of prevarications behind the closed doors of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue, the president came down decisively on the side near the exits. Quitting the Paris deal, signed by nearly 200 countries, will take a few years but this is unequivocally a promise kept.

Before: ""I am looking for judges and have actually picked 20 of them. They'll respect the Second Amendment and what it stands for and what it represents.""

After: He vowed to appoint a conservative justice and he has appointed two - Neil Gorsuch and Brett Kavanaugh.

Mr Gorsuch's appointment required a procedural change to Senate rules, but it was Mr Kavanaugh's appointment that was particularly controversial.

Mr Kavanaugh faced sexual assault allegations - which he denied - and was eventually voted through by 50-48 - the tightest nomination vote since 1881.

In addition to making his mark on the top court, Mr Trump has appointed dozens of conservative judges to lower federal courts.

Before: During a speech in Iowa in November 2015, Mr Trump warned that he would, using an expletive, bomb the Islamic State group into obliteration.

After: The president dropped the biggest non-nuclear bomb in the US arsenal on an IS-stronghold in Afghanistan. He also takes credit for driving IS out of parts of Iraq and Syria, saying the group has been ""largely defeated"". But while its physical caliphate is gone, IS' leader and thousands of his militants are still out there.

Before: Mr Trump has long called for the US to leave the Middle East. On the campaign trail, he said the region was a ""total and complete mess"" and wished the government had spent the trillions of dollars in the US instead.

His talk of an end to US military deployments overseas predates his presidential run. In 2013, he tweeted: ""Our troops are being killed by the Afghanis we train and we waste billions there. Nonsense! Rebuild the USA."" That same year, he said the US should ""stay the hell out"" of the Syrian war.

After: In September 2017, the Trump administration announced the deployment of 3,000 additional troops to Afghanistan. Mr Trump said his approach would be based on conditions on the ground. In Syria, the US had led a coalition against IS along with Syrian Kurdish and Arab fighters, with around 2,000 troops on the ground.

By December 2018, Mr Trump ordered the withdrawal of all US troops from Syria. Days later, US media reported the president planned to halve US forces in Afghanistan from 14,000 to 7,000.

The plans prompted warnings from senior Republicans and foreign powers that it could help the resurgence of IS. In Afghanistan, experts cautioned a US withdrawal would be a propaganda victory for the Taliban.

After Mr Trump's decision, Defence Secretary Jim Mattis and special envoy to the coalition against IS Brett McGurk both resigned.

Before: Mr Trump called Nafta ""a disaster"" and warned that the TPP ""is going to be worse, so we will stop it."" He also pledged to correct the trade deficit with China.

After: Mr Trump followed through in his first few days on his pledge to withdraw from the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP). He later said he would consider re-joining the TPP if he got a better deal.

On 30 November, after protracted negotiations, the US, Canada and Mexico signed the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement which was designed to replace Nafta, although it still requires congressional approval.

The US and China, meanwhile, became embroiled in an escalating trade battle - with both sides imposing tariffs on billions of dollars' worth of goods. They agreed a 90-day truce in December, although Mr Trump has threatened to impose more tariffs if necessary.

Before: Mr Trump initially promised to ban all Muslims entering the US - a ""total and complete"" shutdown should remain until the US authorities ""can figure out what's going on"".

But he switched to ""extreme vetting"" after he became the party's presidential candidate.

After: As president, he introduced two travel bans which become ensnarled in the courts but the third had more luck. The US Supreme Court ruled President Trump's ban on six mainly Muslim countries can go into full effect, pending legal challenges.

The decision is a boost for Mr Trump's policy against travellers from Chad, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Syria and Yemen.

Before: Mr Trump said in September 2016 that he would reverse the deal President Barack Obama had struck to reopen diplomatic relations and improve trade.

After: As president, he told an audience in Miami that he was ""cancelling the Obama administration's one-sided deal."" But in reality, he has only rolled back certain parts, placing restrictions on travel and business.

Before: One of Mr Trump's trademark rally pledges was to repeal and replace Obamacare - his predecessor's attempt to extend healthcare to the estimated 15% of the country who are not covered.

It is widely hated by Republicans, who say the law imposes too many costs on business, with many describing it as a ""job killer"" and decrying the reforms - officially the Affordable Care Act - as an unwarranted intrusion into the affairs of private businesses and individuals.

After: While Republicans have been unable to pass a repeal or reform bill, the Trump administration has managed to dismantle parts of the law - enrolment periods have been shortened, some subsidies have been axed, and the fine for people who did not purchase health insurance has been eliminated as part of the tax plan.

And in December 2018, a federal judge in Texas ruled that repealing this penalty, an ""essential"" part of the law, meant the entirety of Obamacare is therefore unconstitutional.

The law, however, remains in place as an appeal heads to the US Supreme Court.

Before: Mr Trump pledged during his campaign to move the embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, a divided city which both Israelis and Palestinians claim.

After: In December, he said he formally recognised Jerusalem as Israel's capital, and approved moving the US embassy. It opened in May 2018 to coincide with Israel's 70th anniversary.

Before: His vow to build a wall along the US-Mexican border was one of the most controversial of Mr Trump's campaign promises. Mr Trump also insisted that Mexico would pay for it.

After: Not one brick has been laid of the ""big, beautiful wall"". Mexico poured scorn on the claim that it would pay for such a barrier, and even Mr Trump appears to have dropped that idea.

Democrats are vociferously opposed to a wall, whereas some Republicans have baulked at a bill that could reach $21.5bn (£17bn), according to a Department of Homeland Security internal report.

In December 2018 the US government went into shutdown after Democrats resisted Mr Trump's demands for $5bn to fund the wall.

All Mr Trump has to show so far for his signature campaign pledge is a photocall of him posing alongside wall prototypes.

Before: Mr Trump repeatedly told his supporters that every single undocumented immigrant - of which there are estimated to be more than 11.3 million - ""have to go"".

After: As polling day approached, his stance began to soften slightly, then after the election he scaled it back to some two to three million deportations of people who ""are criminal and have criminal records, gang members, drug dealers"".

In fiscal year 2018 deportations were at 256,000, a slight rise on the year before, though not as high as the 2012 peak of 410,000 under the Obama administration.

The future of young undocumented immigrants known as Dreamers hangs in the balance because Mr Trump has cancelled the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (Daca) programme, which allows some 700,000 people to remain in the US. The case is now in legal limbo.

Before: Mr Trump repeatedly questioned the military alliance's purpose, calling it ""obsolete"". One issue that irked him was whether members were pulling their weight and ""paying their bills"". In one New York Times interview in July 2016, he even hinted that the US would not come to the aid of a member invaded by Russia.

After: But as he hosted Nato's secretary general at the White House in April 2018, the US president said the threat of terrorism had underlined the alliance's importance. ""I said it [Nato] was obsolete,"" Mr Trump said. ""It's no longer obsolete.""

In July 2018, Mr Trump reiterated his support at the Nato summit, but suggested the US might still leave if allies did not acquiesce to his budget demands.

The abrupt departure of Defence Secretary Jim Mattis has concerned some US allies, as the general had been among aides urging the president to keep the US in Nato.

Before: Mr Trump repeatedly pledged to label Beijing a ""currency manipulator"" on his first day in office, during an election campaign when he also accused the Asian powerhouse of ""raping"" the US. China has been accused of suppressing the yuan to make its exports more competitive with US goods.

After: He told the Wall Street Journal in April 2018 that China had not been ""currency manipulators"" for some time and had actually been trying to prevent the yuan from further weakening.

Before: Mr Trump said he would approve waterboarding ""immediately"" and ""make it also much worse"", adding ""torture works"".

After: But after his inauguration, the president said he would defer to the countervailing belief, espoused by Defence Secretary James Mattis and then-CIA director Mike Pompeo, who is now secretary of state.

Mr Pompeo said during his CIA confirmation hearing that he would ""absolutely not"" reinstate such methods.

Before: ""Lock her up"" was one of the main rallying cries of Mr Trump's supporters.

They wanted to see Democratic rival Hillary Clinton in prison over the use of her private email server while secretary of state.

And Mr Trump was more than willing to back their calls for, at the very least, a fresh investigation. During the debates, he told Mrs Clinton: ""If I win, I am going to instruct my attorney general to get a special prosecutor to look into your situation.""

After: The president-elect's tone changed almost as soon as he had won, describing the woman he had said was ""such a nasty woman"" as someone the country owed ""a debt of gratitude"". Later, he said he ""hadn't given [the prosecution] a lot of thought"" and had other priorities.

On 22 November, Mr Trump's spokeswoman said he would not pursue a further investigation - to help Mrs Clinton ""heal"".

Before: The country's infrastructure ""will become, by the way, second to none, and we will put millions of our people back to work as we rebuild it"", he said in his victory speech in November.

After: Has repeated his vow to spend big on the country's roads, rail and airports, but as yet, there is little sign of action. By March 2018 Congress had allocated $21bn for infrastructure spending - far short of the $1.5tn Mr Trump has called for. The money will be spent on a wide range of upgrades and investments, according to a congressional graphic."
409,the huffington post,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/opinion-donald-trump-government-shutdown_us_5c205647e4b0407e907c89a7,"What will it take for Republicans in Congress to conclude that President Donald Trump has outlived his political usefulness to them, and is dangerously unglued? We may soon find out.

In one ring of the circus, Trump abruptly decided to pull all U.S. forces out of Syria. This prompted the resignation of both Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and anti-ISIS coalition envoy Brett McGurk.

These guys, unlike many other former Trump appointees, didn't get fired by tweet. They quit in principled protest, something all too rare in American public life. McGurk sent an email to his staff, declaring: ""The recent decision by the president came as a shock and was a complete reversal of policy that was articulated to us. It left our coalition partners confused and our fighting partners bewildered.""

Trump's reversal also prompted much sharper criticism than usual from his slavish Senate allies. Lindsey Graham, ordinarily a Trump toady, told Vice President Mike Pence: ""If Obama had done this, all of us would be going nuts because it's such a bad idea. The job of the Congress is to hold the executive branch accountable. He's the commander in chief, but he needs to be held accountable for his decisions. And I want hearings as soon as possible.""

Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida called Trump's pullout ""a major mistake,"" and Ben Sasse of Nebraska declared that America's generals believe that ""the high-fiving winners today are Iran, ISIS and Hezbollah."" Even Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell was appalled and said so. The usually docile McConnell issued a lengthy statement breaking with Trump:

It's essential that the United States maintain and strengthen the post-World War II alliances that have been carefully built by leaders in both parties. We must also maintain a clear-eyed understanding of our friends and foes, and recognize that nations like Russia are among the latter.""

So I was sorry to learn that Secretary Mattis, who shares those clear principles, will soon depart the administration. But I am particularly distressed that he is resigning due to sharp differences with the president on these and other key aspects of America's global leadership.

Meanwhile, in another ring of the circus, Trump shut down the government over Christmas. This undercut Republican leadership, which had a deal with Democrats for a temporary resolution to keep the government funded until the New Year.

But Trump, goaded by commentators on Fox News, reversed course over funding for his promised ""big. beautiful wall."" In his deluded state, Trump still thinks the idea of a border wall to be built at a cost of tens of billions of taxpayer dollars along our southern border is hugely popular. In fact, it's only popular with his hard-core base and far-right pundits.

Trump seems to have an edifice complex about the wall. It's become a vanity project, like Trump Tower, or Mar-a-Lago, or the aborted Putin Penthouse in Moscow.

He insists that a big wall is the best way to keep people out. In fact, most undocumented immigrants in the U.S. do not sneak across America's southern border. They overstay student, tourist or work visas.

With the new Congress, Democrats in the House simply will not agree to fund Trump's proposed erection. And public opinion is with them.

You might think -- between the Syria withdrawal, the shutdown mess, and the fact that Trump has now managed to fire or drive out virtually all of his adult minders -- that Republicans have had enough. But that remains to be seen.

House Republicans, humiliated as they were by Trump's abrupt reversal, dutifully assembled to pass a budget resolution on Friday that included funding for Trump's wall. To no one's surprise, the measure died in the Senate.

Trump seems happiest when there are no adults in the room to contain his impulses. As he put it in an interview with The Washington Post, ""I have a gut, and my gut tells me more sometimes than anybody else's brain can ever tell me.""

But often, his gut is dead wrong. Trump has now increasingly become a rogue president, as retired 4-star Gen. Barry McCaffrey told The Washington Post. The more that the Mueller investigation's waters rise around him, the more reckless he becomes.

So where, finally, are the Republicans? Are they starting to connect the dots between Trump's disastrous, impulsive foreign policy moves, his budgetary antics and his unhinged personality? Are they, perhaps, worried for their country?

Republicans in Congress may conclude they need to reign in Trump, based on one of three considerations. First, his policies are doing serious damage to the national interest. Second, he is a madman. Third, he is humiliating them politically and has become a partisan liability.

Alas, the first two considerations have been all too evident since before Trump took office. But in his first two years, Trump was too convenient an ally for Republicans to have acted.

Now that Trump has cost Republicans the House and promises further political embarrassment, let's hope that sheer expedience gets their attention where principled concern for the republic failed."
410,daily mail online,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6526973/Trump-administration-disputes-claim-shutdown-cancel-workers-Christmas-paychecks.html,"The Trump administration is pushing back against claims from former FBI Director James Comey and Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren that federal workers will feel the government-shutdown crunch in the form of missed paychecks during Christmas week.

According to official instructions the White House issued last week, government employees will be at risk of delayed paychecks on January 11, if the shutdown isn't ended by then.

But Comey claimed Sunday that employees of his old agency and their families 'will spend Christmas without a paycheck' because of the partial shutdown that began Friday at midnight.

Warren tweeted that affected workers 'will go without a paycheck over the holidays.'

Russ Vought, the deputy director of the White House's Office of Management and Budget criticized Warren's 'inaccurate' claim: 'Federal employees will receive their next paycheck, even under a lapse.'

Former FBI Director James Comey inaccurately claimed this weekend that workers at his old agency will go without paychecks over Christmas because of the partial government shutdown

'FBI families will spend Christmas without a paycheck, said Comey, a reliable opponent of President Donald Trump

Massachusetts Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren made the same claim, ignoring that federal workers won't see their paychecks affected until January 11

Warren claimed on Twitter the an 'avoidable' shutdown means 'hundreds of thousands of federal employees will go without a paycheck over the holidays'

The deputy director of the White House office that instructs federal agencies what to do in the event of a shutdown fired back, saying federal employees will still be paid this coming Friday

Comey has stood as an uncompromising opponent of President Donald Trump since his firing in May 2017, and began using Twitter this year to express his outrage at what he sees as a presidency being run off the rails.

'FBI families will spend Christmas without a paycheck,' he tweeted. 'This president promised Mexico would pay for the wall but innocent people are now paying the price for another lie. Our thoughts are with hardworking public servants and their families.'

Trump initiated a longstanding feud with Warren during his presidential campaign, mocking her as 'Pocahontas' for her decades-long claim that she is part American Indian. Warren acknowledged this month that she is not 'a person of color.'

The battle between the two is expected to heat up if Warren enters the Democratic Party's presidential primary race in 2019.

Dan Pfieffer, a former senior aid to President Barack Obama who now co-hosts the 'Pod Save America' podcast, tweeted that news media have written few stories 'about the government workers who won't get a paycheck over the holidays.'

The most visible government closures this week include national parks like the Joshua Tree National Park. It was was open but its visitors center and other facilities were closed

The White House's official shutdown guidance specifies that pay scheduled for December 28 and the days immediately following will be 'issued at the normal time'

The federal government's pay calendar calls for checks on December 28 for work done between December 9 and December 22

Civilian federal employees are paid every two weeks for work ending a week or more earlier.

The last full pay period of 2018 ended Saturday, and Congress had already budgeted for that money. Workers at the FBI and other agencies will be paid as usual, despite the shutdown, beginning on Friday, December 28.

OMB sent guidance to all federal Cabinet agencies last week, including the Justice Department.

'Saturday, December 22, is the last day of the December 9-22 biweekly pay period. ... Paychecks for that pay period should be issued at the normal time (generally, in the December 28 to January 3 time range),' it read.

One exception the White House agency spelled out applies to a small number of employees who worked on Satutrday, the day the shutdown began. That day's work won't be reflected in their pay until the government is reopened at full strength.

If federal employees are denied paychecks in mid-January, they will be repaid what the federal treasury owes them as soon as the shuttered segments of the government are re-opened.

Donald Trump (pictured) cancelled his own plans to travel to Mar-a-Lago for Christmas as the government readied for a shutdown; unlike the independently wealthy president, most federal workers will feel the bite of missing paychecks if the shutdown lasts to January 11

It's unclear how long the stalemate between the White House and Senate Democrats might last.

President Donald Trump is holding out for billions of dollars in funding to fulfill his campaign promise to build a wall between the U.S. and Mexico.

Democrats will take over the House of Representatives on January 3. The impasse could last well into the month if it isn't resolved by then.

Mick Mulvaney, the acting White House chief of staff who ran OMB until two weeks ago, said Sunday: 'I don't think things are going to move very quickly here the next couple of days.'

'It's very possible that the shutdown will go beyond the 28th and into the new Congress,' he said on the Fox News Sunday program.

The shutdown affects about 25 per cent of the federal budget covering nine agencies: the Departments of Agriculture, Commerce, Homeland Security, Housing and Urban Development, Interior, Justice, State, Transportation and Treasury.

Congress exempted itself this year by voting to fund its own operations until the fall of 2019."
411,daily mail online,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-6526221/Mattis-leaving-Pentagon-sooner-planned-Shanahan-tapped.html,"WASHINGTON (AP) - The sooner-than-expected departure of Defense Secretary Jim Mattis shifts the focus to President Donald Trump's appointment of an acting Pentagon chief and plans for a permanent replacement.

It also signals an acrimonious end to a tense relationship between Trump and Mattis that had eroded in recent months. A fracture developed last week over Trump's decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria and worsened after Mattis' public disagreement with Trump, aired in his resignation letter.

Deputy Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan will take over as acting secretary on Jan. 1, Trump announced in a tweet Sunday. He had worked for more than three decades at Boeing Co. and was a senior vice president when he became Pentagon deputy in July 2017.

In the new year Trump wants to focus on streamlining purchases at the Pentagon, an issue on which Shanahan has already been working, a White House official said. The official asked not to be identified publicly discussing personnel matters.

U.S. officials said they didn't know if Shanahan would be Trump's nominee to replace Mattis. During a lunch with conservative lawmakers Saturday at the White House, Trump discussed his options. They were ""not all military,"" said Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., who was among those attending.

Shanahan's biography on the Pentagon's website does not list military experience for the longtime Boeing executive. He earned a bachelor's degree in mechanical engineering from the University of Washington, then a master's degree in mechanical engineering as well as an MBA from the Sloan School of Management at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

In addition to work in Boeing's commercial airplanes programs, Shanahan was vice president and general manager of Boeing Missile Defense Systems and of Boeing Rotorcraft Systems. In a March 2016 report, the Puget Sound Business Journal called Shanahan a Boeing ""fix-it"" man who was central to getting the 787 Dreamliner on track after production problems in the program's early years.

An acting defense secretary is highly unusual. Historically when a secretary has resigned, he has stayed on until a successor is confirmed. For example, when Chuck Hagel was told to resign in November 2014, he stayed in office until Ash Carter was confirmed the following February.

Mattis, a retired Marine Corps general, had been expected to retain his position as Pentagon chief through February. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, not the president, notified Mattis of Trump's decision to put in place Shanahan, said a senior administration official who insisted on anonymity to discuss personnel issues.

The sudden change stripped Mattis of any chance to further frame national security policy or smooth rattled relations with allies over the next two months. But U.S. officials said the reaction to Mattis' decision to leave - it sparked shock and dismay on Capitol Hill - annoyed Trump and likely led to pushing Mattis out.

""When President Obama ingloriously fired Jim Mattis, I gave him a second chance. Some thought I shouldn't, I thought I should,"" Trump tweeted Saturday, foreshadowing his displeasure and the Sunday announcement. He also fumed over the media coverage of his Syria withdrawal order, suggesting he should be popular for bringing troops home.

""With me, hit hard instead by the Fake News Media. Crazy!"" Trump tweeted.

A White House official said Trump decided Mattis should leave the administration earlier than planned to avoid a drawn-out transition when someone on hand whom they consider a qualified deputy capable of running the Pentagon in an acting capacity. The official asked not to be identified publicly discussing personnel matters.

While Mattis' resignation followed Trump's announcement that he would soon pull all of the approximately 2,000 U.S. troops out of Syria, officials said that the decision was the result of an accumulation of disagreements.

In a stunning resignation letter, Mattis made clear he did not see eye to eye with a president who has expressed disdain for NATO and doubts about keeping troops in Asia. Mattis was also unhappy with Trump's order to develop plans to pull out up to half of the 14,000 U.S. forces in Afghanistan.

Earlier Sunday, Trump's acting chief of staff said that Trump had known for ""quite some time now"" that he and Mattis ""did not share some of the same philosophies ... have the same world view.""

Mick Mulvaney told ABC's ""This Week"" that the president and his defense chief ""just could never get on the same page"" on Syria, adding that Trump had said since his presidential campaign that ""he wanted to get out of Syria."" Mulvaney said the president ""is entitled to have a secretary of defense who is committed to that same end.""

Asked whether Trump wanted a Pentagon leader willing to challenge him or someone in lock step with his views, Mulvaney said ""a little bit of both.""

""I've encouraged him to find people who have some overlap with him but don't see the world in lockstep with him,"" Mulvaney said.

Meanwhile, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., joined leading Republicans on foreign affairs in urging Trump to reconsider his decision to withdraw American forces from Syria and called it ""a premature and costly mistake."" They asked Trump to withhold a final decision for 90 days to allow time to study the impact of the decision, but Mulvaney told ABC that Trump wouldn't change his mind.

Just after tweeting the announcement about Shanahan, Trump said he had had ""a long and productive call"" with Turkey's president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Trump said they discussed IS, ""our mutual involvement in Syria, & the slow & highly coordinated pullout of U.S. troops from the area. After many years they are coming home.""

412,daily mail online,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-6517723/Health-laws-fines-not-big-stick-everybody-thought.html,"WASHINGTON (AP) - There was one thing that supporters and detractors of former President Barack Obama's health care overhaul agreed on for years: unpopular fines on Americans forgoing coverage were essential for the plan to work because they nudged healthy people to get insured, helping check premiums.

Now it turns out that might not be so.

Numbers released this week by the government show just a slight dip in the number of people enrolled in Affordable Care Act coverage next year through HealthCare.gov. That's the case even though the Republican-led Congress repealed fines for being uninsured effective Jan. 1. The drop - from 8.8 million to 8.5 million - was far less than experts forecast.

The numbers are likely to change policymakers' understanding of how the law actually works. That may affect the government's stewardship of its health insurance marketplaces for people not covered on their jobs. It could also undercut a Texas federal court case in which a Republican-appointed judge recently declared the Affordable Care Act unconstitutional since the fines no longer exist.

A look at why the long-debated penalties might not matter so much and how that could affect the future of the law:

CARROTS MORE IMPORTANT

(AP Photo/Pablo Martinez Monsivais)

""The law originally took a carrot-and-stick approach, and it's pretty clear the carrots had a lot more power than the stick,"" said Larry Levitt of the nonpartisan Kaiser Family Foundation, who has followed ""Obamacare"" since the congressional debate leading to its passage in 2010.

The individual mandate and its enforcement fines were the ""stick"" behind the law. Taxpayer-provided subsidies to help pay premiums and cover deductibles and copays were the ""carrots,"" along with legal protections so people with pre-existing medical problems could not be turned away.

Economist Joe Antos of the business-oriented American Enterprise Institute said the fines were more important at the beginning of the program because ""the mandate initially got people to take a look."" But now ""Obamacare"" is a mature program and consumers who stick with it see its value.

""Anybody who realizes this is not for them is out,"" Antos said. ""Everybody who identifies it as precisely what they want, they're going to stay in. This is probably the way it's going to look for the foreseeable future.""

INSURERS REASSESS

Justine Handelman, top Washington lobbyist for the Blue Cross Blue Shield Association, says she initially thought the coverage requirement and fines were critical for getting the health law to work. That was the approach successfully taken in Massachusetts, which passed a state program that served as a prototype for Obama's effort.

The insurance industry, the Obama administration and the law's supporters all argued that the mandate was crucial in the 2012 Supreme Court case upholding it as a constitutional exercise of the congressional power to impose taxes.

Without fines to put teeth in the mandate, ""we have to look at the whole of what is doable,"" Handelman said. Premiums remain too high for solid middle-class people who don't qualify for subsidies, she said.

Another approach insurers favor involves government-sponsored pools of financing that individual carriers can tap to help pay claims for the sickest patients. Several states have set up such pools and seen premiums drop. There's bipartisan support in Congress, but proponents have not been able to overcome the divisive politics of health care.

Stepped-up advertising could also get more healthy people into the marketplace. A Kaiser Foundation analysis estimates that 8.2 million uninsured Americans, more than 1 in 4, would be eligible for financial assistance to pay their premiums.

RULING UNDERCUT

The recent ruling that Obamacare is unconstitutional by U.S. District Judge Reed O'Connor in Fort Worth, Texas, rests on a legal analysis that the coverage requirement and its fines remain central to the law.

O'Connor noted that the Supreme Court upheld the law in 2012 because the mandate was enforced through fines that passed constitutional muster, since they were levied as taxes.

With the fines gone, the coverage requirement can no longer be considered constitutional, he reasoned. And the entire health law is defective because it can't be separated from the coverage requirement.

But steady sign-up numbers are factual evidence that in the real world the coverage mandate doesn't drive the health care law.

""The argument that it's somehow inseparable from protections for pre-existing conditions is a lot weaker,"" Levitt said."

Award-winning German journalist, Claas Relotius, fabricated an article about pro-Trump reporters in a small Minnesota town, and it cost him his job.

Germany's respected news weekly Der Spiegel stunned the media world on Wednesday by revealing that Relotius had for years falsified stories.

Relotius 'made up stories and invented protagonists' in at least 14 out of 60 articles that appeared in the magazine's print and online editions, Spiegel wrote, warning that other outlets could also be affected.

One of the stories that brought Relotius down was the one he wrote about residents of Fergus Falls, Minnesota, a town that overwhelmingly voted for President Donald Trump in the 2016 election.

Award-winning German journalist, Claas Relotius (pictured in March 2017), fabricated an article about pro-Trump reporters in a small Minnesota town, and it cost him his job

His dishonesty was uncovered by his colleague Juan Moreno after he worked with Relotius on the story 'Jaegers Grenze' (pictured)

Spiegel wrote that it was in March 2017 when an article headlined 'In a Small Town,' a snapshot of Fergus Falls, Minnesota, appeared in Der Spiegel.

According to the news outlet, 'the plan was for Relotius to rent an apartment in Fergus Falls, meet people, listen to what they had to say, and produce a snapshot that would allow readers to gain a slightly better understanding of the Americans'.

However, like many reporters, Relotius realized he didn't have a story.

Relotius (pictured in 2014), 33, resigned from Der Spiegel after admitting falsifying stories

'DER SPIEGEL gives its reporters a very free hand in situations like these. No staff member -- especially not one that had published the kind of stories Relotius had -- has to worry about getting into hot water for failing to bring home a story,' the magazine said.

The magazine said that Relotius 'simply refused to accept those realities' and wrote a tall tale about Fergus Falls.

Relotius lied about seeing a hand-painted welcome sign that read 'Mexicans Keep Out', that he claimed was sitting at the edge of the town.

But the sign didn't exist and never had.

'He passed on his creation as fact to hundreds of thousands of readers -- and insulted the inhabitants of Fergus Falls in the process,' Spiegel said.

'Relotius gave the inhabitants of Fergus Falls made-up biographies to suit his needs, as if he were a puppeteer.

'He invented grotesque lies and reported, for example, that the students at the John F. Kennedy high school drew their role models for the American dream as follows: ""They did not draw a single picture of a woman,"" Relotius wrote. ""One class drew Barack Obama, two drew John D. Rockefeller. Most of them drew Donald Trump.""'

According to the magazine, it was all 'pure fiction. Every single bit is concocted bunk'.

Relotius, 33, resigned after admitting to the scam.

He had written for the magazine for seven years and won numerous awards for his investigative journalism, including CNN Journalist of the Year in 2014.

Earlier this month, he was named German Reporter of the Year for a story about a young Syrian boy.

The cheating came to light after a colleague who worked with him on a story along the US-Mexican border raised suspicions about some of the details in Relotius' reporting.

The headquarters of German weekly news magazine Der Spiegel in Hamburg, Germany

The colleague eventually tracked down two alleged sources quoted extensively by Relotius in the article, which was published in November.

Both said they had never met Relotius.

Other fraudulent stories included one about a Yemeni prisoner in Guantanamo Bay, and one about NFL star Colin Kaepernick.

In a lengthy article, Spiegel said it was 'shocked' by the discovery and apologized to its readers as well as to anyone who may have been the subject of 'fraudulent quotes, made up personal details or invented scenes at fictitious places'.

The Hamburg-based magazine, renowned for its in-depth investigative pieces, described the episode as 'a low point in Spiegel's 70-year history'.

An in-house commission has been set up to pore over all of Relotius' work for the weekly.

The reporter also wrote for a string of other well-known outlets, including German newspapers taz, Welt and the Frankfurter Allgemeine's Sunday edition.

Relotius told Spiegel he regretted his actions and was deeply ashamed, the magazine said.

'I am sick and I need to get help,' he was quoted as saying."

John William King will face lethal injection on April 24, 2019 at 6pm after District Judge Craig Mixson signed the execution order on Friday.

In October, the US Supreme Court denied King's appeal, which suggested he had ineffective lawyers during his capital murder trial.

King - along with Lawrence Russell Brewer and Shawn Berry - was convicted in 1999 for killing of James Byrd Jr in Jasper, which is about 125 miles northeast of Houston.

On June 7, Byrd accepted a ride home from Berry, whom he was acquainted with.

King and Brewer were also in the truck.

The three men drove Byrd to a deserted road where they severely beat him, urinated and defecated on him and chained him to the pickup truck by his ankles.

They then preceded to drag him for three miles. Byrd was alive for the majority of the dragging.

He died about halfway through after his body hit a culvert, which severed his right arm and head, CNN reported at the time.

Byrd's remains were dumped in front of an African-American church before the men drove off to a barbecue, according to the Texas Observer.

He claimed during his trial that he had been gang-raped by several black inmates during a prior sentence.

Both King and Brewer were sentenced to death while Berry was given life in prison.

Brewer, 44, was executed in September 2011 in the Huntsville Unit Prison after exhausting his appeals.

For his last meal he ordered: two chicken-fried steaks smothered in gravy with sliced onions; a triple-patty bacon cheeseburger; a cheese omelet with ground beef, tomatoes, onions, bell peppers and jalapeños; a bowl of fried okra with ketchup; one pound of barbecued meat with half a loaf of white bread; three fully loaded fajitas; a meat-lover's pizza; one pint of Blue Bell vanilla Ice Cream; a slab of peanut-butter fudge with crushed peanuts; and three root beers.

State Senator John Whitmire, a Houston Democrat, was outraged and penned a letter to the prison agency's executive director, Brad Livingston, asking for the practice of last meals to end.

Within hours, Livingston replied that the practice was terminated efffectively immediately, reported The New York Times.

'So hard to believe that Lindsey Graham would be against saving soldier lives & billions of $$$. Why are we fighting for our enemy, Syria, by staying & killing ISIS for them, Russia, Iran & other locals? Time to focus on our Country & bring our youth back home where they belong!' he tweeted.

Sen. Lindsey Graham has grown close to Trump, but on foreign policy they continue to have sharp differences.

Graham angrily called the pull-out an 'Obama-like mistake' and said that lawmakers should have been consulted.

'I don't know how this decision was made, it literally came out of left field,' he told Capitol Hill reporters on Thursday. 'It has rattled the world.'

President Donald Trump harangued the Republican senator leading the charge against his Syria withdraw in a tweet on Thursday in which he suggested the defense hawk is against saving soldiers' lives

Sen. Lindsey Graham has grown close to Trump, but on foreign policy they continue to have sharp differences

The senator who sits on the Armed Services Committee in the United States Senate said that Secretary of Defense James Mattis told him on Wednesday when they spoke that 'the time was not right to leave' the war-torn country, where forces are still fighting fundamentalists.

He said in a floor speech that Trump's claims that ISIS has been defeated are the definition of 'fake news' - borrowing on a term that Trump loves to use to bash negative coverage of his policies.

'This is a stain on the honor of the United States,' Graham said in charged language. 'I hope and pray the president will reconsider this. I know that every national security adviser understands that the time is not right to withdraw.'

The senator from South Carolina said Thursday in a direct appeal to the nation's commander-in-chief 'I will help you any way I can' but 'I'm not going to ignore what I believe.'

'I'm going to give you an honest evaluation. I was willing to support a Democrat if he followed sound military advice. I'm willing to fight a Republican if you don't,' he cautioned.

The president on Twitter on Thursday morning had defended his sudden announcement to pull U.S. troops out of Syria. He warned ISIS it was 'doomed!' if the terror group hit at the U.S.

Trump issued the warning just hours after proclaiming 'we have defeated ISIS in Syria.' He also said Russian, Iranian, and Turkish forces who remain would continue to battle ISIS. Despite the president's claim the military assesses thousands of ISIS fighters remain.

In a barrage of tweets Trump also said the U.S. was getting 'NOTHING' out of being in Syria, where last year the president ordered air strikes to respond to President Bashar al-Assad's use of chemical weapons.

The president's pushback against critics comes after members of his own party blasted the sudden announcement he made Wednesday morning, disputed his claims that the U.S. had defeated ISIS, and warned regional powers Russia, Iran, and Turkey stood to gain at U.S. expense.

'Getting out of Syria was no surprise. I've been campaigning on it for years, and six months ago, when I very publicly wanted to do it, I agreed to stay longer,' Trump wrote.

'Does the USA want to be the Policeman of the Middle East, getting NOTHING but spending precious lives and trillions of dollars protecting others who, in almost all cases, do not appreciate what we are doing?' Trump asked while defending his Syria pullout Thursday

'Russia, Iran, Syria & others are the local enemy of ISIS. We were doing there work. Time to come home & rebuild.' He completed his tweet on the withdrawal of U.S. forces with his '#MAGA' slogan and hashtag.

Trump has called for getting out of Syria, including last spring, but his sudden Twitter announcement caught senior Pentagon officials off guard, along with senior lawmakers who are accustomed to getting briefed on major policy decisions and changes in the nation's strategic posture and who must be consulted when troops are deployed.

The foreign ministry of Russia, a rival to U.S. interests in a number of troubled areas, praised the pullout decision, and Russia is proceeding to make its own presence there permanent.

Russian President Vladimir Putin said Thursday the U.S. decision to pull out was 'correct'

Trump declared victory in Syria over ISIS on Wednesday morning in a surprise announcement that the U.S. was pulling troops out of the region

After declaring victory on Twitter, President Trump, who had no public schedule Wednesday, released a video from the White House where he said: 'We have beaten them and we've beaten them badly. We've taken back the land.'

The president also wrote in a pair of tweets: 'Does the USA want to be the Policeman of the Middle East, getting NOTHING but spending precious lives and trillions of dollars protecting others who, in almost all cases, do not appreciate what we are doing? Do we want to be there forever? Time for others to finally fight....Russia, Iran, Syria & many others are not happy about the U.S. leaving, despite what the Fake News says, because now they will have to fight ISIS and others, who they hate, without us.'

The Pentagon says 30,000 ISIS forces remain in Iraq and Syria, with 17,000 in Syria proper.

GOP Rep. Adam Kinzinger disputed the president's claim that ISIS had been defeated

'I am building by far the most powerful military in the world. ISIS hits us they are doomed!' the president warned.

Lawmakers slammed Trump's decision, although the president tweeted out support from Sen. Mike Lee of Utah.

Senate Foreign Relations Chairman Bob Corker said Wednesday: 'It doesn't feel to me there was any inter-agency process, adding, 'I'm not sure even the principles knew.'

Corker suggested that Trump just 'woke up' and decided to make the policy announcement.

The Tennessee Republican is leaving Congress for good at the end of this year and is effectively a lame duck. His complaints were shared by other lawmakers, however, who begged Trump to rethink his position.

Texas Sen. John Cornyn, the GOP whip, asaid it was a 'mistake' to leave Syria and the matter would most certainly be investigated by the upper chamber.

'I think the first mistake was to surprise Members of Congress. Nobody likes to be surprised,' he told CNN.

Graham also chided Trump for announcing the withdrawal on Twitter. 'Withdrawal of this small American force in Syria would be a huge Obama-like mistake,' he tweeted.

Sen. Marco Rubio likewise said the withdrawal is a 'great disservice' to the nation and a 'big mistake' that invites 'America's adversaries America is an unreliable partner.'

'Today's decision will lead to grave consequences in the months and years to come,' the Republican senator cautioned.

Illinois Rep. Adam Kinzinger meanwhile disputed the president's claim that ISIS had been defeated.

'This is simply not true,' Kinzinger wrote. 'Iran is rejoicing right now. We left Iraq, and had to come back. I would sure hope the President and his advisers are smarter than this.'

Kinzinger said on CNN later that he was 'speechless' and that terrorists would be 'emboldened' by the withdrawal. 'This makes no sense to me,' he said. 'I don't get it.'

Responding directly to complaints that legislators were informed after the fact, a senior administration official told reporters on a call on Wednesday afternoon, 'The president's views have been well known, so I really don't see this as a surprise.'

The official said that the comparison that Graham and others were making to Obama's withdrawal of U.S. troop from Iraq in 2011 was 'apples to oranges,' because the drawdown was much larger and came about as a result of a failure to come to an agreement with the Iraqi government about leaving troops in the country.

'The president has judged that the purpose for which those troops have been put into Syria has been accomplished to the point where they can reposition,' the person said.

As for Sen. Graham, the senior official said, 'He is entitled to his opinion' but it's unreasonable to think that the U.S. is going to turn 'Syria into a utopian democracy' nor is that the goal of the president.'"

Policies including swapping fizzy drinks for water, sending children home with nutritional newsletters and not rewarding them with treats led to good eating habits.

In schools which used a nutritional programme pupils were less likely to see increases in body mass index (BMI).

With obesity a rising health threat in Western countries, the researchers said such interventions could lower young people's weights and avoid disease later in life.

As many as one in two US teenagers and one in three UK teenagers are overweight or obese.

Ensuring healthy school dinners and lessons for children and parents reduces obesity, a five-year study in New Haven, Connecticut found

The study enrolled 600 pupils across 12 schools in New Haven, Connecticut, with children an average age of 11 years old at the beginning.

The schools were divided into four groups of interventions: nutrition only, physical activity only, nutrition and physical activity (dual), or delayed.

In delayed interventions no health-focused messages related to obesity prevention were used.

Each school had a wellness team to watch over the interventions which were measured for their effectiveness.

In schools with more detailed nutrition policies and programmes, students had healthier BMIs - a measure of someone's weight relative to their height - over time.

OBESITY ON THE RISE IN AMERICA'S YOUNGEST CHILDREN

The rate of childhood obesity has tripled since the 1970s, affecting one in five children in the US and 14 percent of those between ages two and four years old, according to CDC data released in February.

Childhood obesity is now the number one health concern among parents in the US, topping drug abuse and smoking.

Obesity continues to plague more than one-third of adults in the US, and experts have warned that that proportion will only grow as younger generations do.

Over the last two decades, the US has implemented countless awareness programs to try to combat the obesity epidemic.

Former first lady Michelle Obama became a mascot for healthier children while her husband was in office, spearheading the 'Let's Move' campaign, designed to motivate children to eat healthier and stay active in an effort to promote overall health.

But in December of last year, the US Department of Agriculture announced that it would relax the school lunch guidelines she championed - requiring more fresh fruits and vegetables and low-sugar dining options - in favor of new rules that would allow sweetened milk and sodium rich entrees.

They had a BMI increase of less than one per cent, whereas students in schools without the programmes showed increases of three to four per cent.

'By the end of the study they reported healthier behaviours than their peers in schools without the nutrition policies and programmes,' the authors, at Yale School of Public Health, said.

'At the end of the study, these students reported lower consumption of unhealthy foods and sugar-sweetened beverages, although there was no effect on consumption of healthy foods and beverages.

'The magnitude of effects of the nutrition intervention was stronger over time.'

The interventions tried included encouraging healthy food choices in cafeterias, providing alternatives to unhealthy food during celebrations, and taste-testing new foods.

Physical activity interventions included promoting walking or cycling to school, integrating physical activity into classroom lessons and fitness challenges.

Exercise policies alone had little or no impact on BMI, the research, published in the American Journal of Preventive Medicine, found.

Lead author Professor Jeannette Ickovics said: 'These findings can guide future school and community interventions.

'Childhood obesity is a serious health threat, and schools are a vital way to reach children and their families to reduce risks and promote health.

'These findings strongly support previous administration policies that provided healthier food for all children in public schools.'

The authors suggest 'prevention may be better than cure' when it comes to obesity.

And other studies show teenagers of a healthy weight are more likely than other students to remain healthy into adulthood.

'Students who are already overweight or obese likely need more tailored, intensive interventions,' the authors said.

Being overweight or obese early in life affects health across someone's life, they said.

It contributes to a range of chronic diseases such as high blood pressure, diabetes, and depression which can cut lives short.

The study is one of the first school-based intervention studies to follow students through middle school - an age at which healthy habits are formed and can be sustained, the authors said.

Senior study author Professor Dr Marlene Schwartz added: 'This is some of the strongest evidence we have to date that nutrition education and promoting healthy eating behaviours in the classroom and cafeteria can have a meaningful impact on children's health.

'These findings can inform how we approach federal wellness policy requirements and implementation in schools to help mitigate childhood obesity.'

The UK Government's childhood obesity strategy, revealed in June this year, asked stores to not display unhealthy food at checkouts or buy-one-get-one-free deals.

It will also consult on introducing calorie labelling on menus in restaurants, cafes and takeaways, so families are clear about what they are consuming."
417,daily mail online,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-6534807/In-Iowa-Democrats-2020-head-vs-heart-moment.html,"DES MOINES, Iowa (AP) - The romance of Barack Obama's surprise victory in Iowa hangs like a championship banner in the minds of Democrats in the state more than a decade after they set him on the road to being the nation's first African- American president.

But as they begin to think about Iowa's 2020 presidential caucuses - in which as many as two dozen Democratic candidates may seek their support - the wistfulness is fading fast. The same early Obama supporters who admit to being swept off their feet by the then-Illinois senator are now looking steely-eyed for someone who can simply seize the presidency from Donald Trump.

""We've got to go for the greater good of winning this election, no matter what,"" said Nancy Bobo, an early Iowa Obama backer who attended a 10-year commemoration of the 2008 campaign at a Des Moines bar this year. ""We need to learn to compromise in a way that moves us ahead, and not keep looking back.""

More than a year away, the 2020 caucuses are already shaping up for many of Obama's earliest supporters to be more about their heads than their hearts.

""The innocence in us wants to fall in love,"" said Niki Neems, an Iowa City Democratic activist who pledged herself to Obama before he even announced his candidacy. ""But whoever we all think stands the best chance, then let's get out there and start door-knocking. So, for me, it's OK to just fall in like.""

The shift among Obama's devout supporters reflects the baggage many of them are carrying into the next caucus campaign. For one, Iowa Democrats uniformly criticize Trump as uniquely harmful to U.S. institutions and the nation's international standing. But there's also a sense that Hillary Clinton's doomed bid for the presidency began in Iowa, where Democrats didn't warm to her in the same way they did to Obama.

Hong, File)

Neems and others said that lack of an emotional connection contributed to Clinton only narrowly beating Bernie Sanders in Iowa in 2016, foreshadowing the trouble she'd face in taking on Trump.

Now, some Democrats say they want to pay less attention to their feelings and focus more on a candidate with a serious plan to reverse Trump's actions.

""People can connect with someone as long as they have a vision, have big ideas, and can express them,"" said Tricia Zebrowski, a retired University of Iowa professor who was among the first to pledge her support for Obama. ""That's the kind of person who can wrest the presidency from Trump.""

In fact, she speaks highly of Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, hardly a dynamic speaker on par with Obama. But Zebrowski said Klobuchar has impressed her as embodying common sense and projecting little of the ego that Trump exudes.

More than a dozen Democrats weighing 2020 presidential campaigns have already begun testing their ability to connect with Iowans. Notably, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker paced the stage at an Iowa Democratic Party fall banquet, repeatedly quoting Martin Luther King in a sermon-like speech to 1,200 of the state's most influential party activists, officials and donors in October.

There's a recognition among many of Obama's early supporters that his rise in Iowa was a unique moment in American politics, attributable in part to his own personal strengths at retail politics, his soaring oratory and his familiarity with street-level political organizing, which is key to delivering support for the caucuses.

The combination elevated the African American in the vastly white state over not just the establishment favorite, Clinton, but also former North Carolina Sen. John Edwards, who had spent nearly six years building goodwill, especially among rural Iowa Democrats.

Obama seemed right for the times, offering hope first during the divisive Iraq war and then a devastating financial collapse. In 2020, Democrats will look to someone matched specifically to contrast with Trump, said Dale Todd, one of Obama's earliest activists in the Cedar Rapids area.

""If you try to replicate it, it ends up being false,"" said Todd, who also attended the commemoration this year. ""The intangible was Obama.""

And while they are older and wiser, some of Obama's first devotees say change, as it was in 2008, will again be the winning message.

""We'd be kidding ourselves if we kept looking for Obama in every single presidential hopeful,"" said Deidre DeJear, Iowa Democrats' 2018 candidate for Iowa secretary of state who worked on Obama's 2008 campaign as a college student. ""But people are ready for change. They don't know what change looks like. But when it shows up, they know what it feels like.""

418,daily mail online,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6520321/Trump-call-Turkish-leader-led-US-pullout-Syria.html,"By Geoff Earle, Deputy U.s. Political Editor For Dailymail.com and Associated Press

President Donald Trump's sudden decision to yank U.S. forces out of Syria came after a private call with the hard-line president of Turkey where the president ditched a script crafted by his aides and was told allies fighting alongside the U.S. were terrorists.

The fateful call occurred Friday, according to multiple press accounts, just as Turkey's President Recep Erdogan publicly saber-rattling about a campaign to wipe out U.S.-allied Turkish forces in northeastern Syria.

The U.S. has relied on Kurdish fighters in Iraq and Syria to take out ISIS elements in a multi-year military campaign that Trump cheered on Twitter Friday.

'Why are you still there?' Turkish President Recep Erdogan asked President Trump during a call where Trump ditched a script and ended up promising a withdrawal from Syria

Trump's national security aides prepared a script for the call, which the president abandoned during his chat. Rather than pushing Erdogan, a NATO ally, to hold off on military action, the Turkish leader seized control of the phone call and declared the U.S. Syria mission virtually completed, even as he went after the United States' kurdish allies.

He told Trump 'that the U.S. must stop aiding terrorists in the region and do this as soon as possible,' reported the pro-government Turkish paper Daily Sabah.

According to Turkey's communications directorate, Erdogan was threatening to move military 'at any moment.'

'We talked to Trump. These terrorists have to leave areas east of the Euphrates. If they do not leave, we will dispatch them. Because they are disturbing us,' he said.

The US-backed Syrian Democratic Forces began an operation to capture Raqa from fighters of the Islamic State group last year, and finally entered the city earlier this month

On the call, Erdogan was able to seize control of the conversation by pointing to U.S. military success, saying the U.S. had already defeated 99 per cent of ISIS.

When he asked Trump 'Why are you still there?', it prompted Trump to pass on the query to his own security advisor, John Bolton, who was monitoring the call.

Sources on the call said Trump 'quickly capitulated' and yielded to Erdogan's withdrawal demand, the Associated Press reported.

Critical to the U.S.-led anti-ISIS campaign have been Syrian Democratic Forces, or SDF, consisting of arabs and kurds in Syria. The U.S. also backs People's Protection Units, or YPG, which consists mostly of Kurds but who Turkey considers to close to the Kurdistan Workers' Party, or PKK, as Military Times reported.

Adding further intrigue to how the decision came about is the State Department's approval, announced Tuesday, of Turkey's decision to spend $3.5 billion purchasing U.S.-made Patriot missile defense systems.

It came amid U.S. concerns Turkey might go with the Russian-made S-400 system, which in turn could allow the Russians to spy on NATO activities.

Trump's decision to withdraw American troops from Syria was made hastily, without consulting his national security team or allies, and over strong objections from virtually everyone involved in the fight against the Islamic State group, according to U.S. and Turkish officials.

The Washington Post reported Thursday that the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, Joseph Dunford, wasn't present at a Tuesday White House meeting where the final decision ultimately got made.

'We've been thinking that as the walls close in around Trump, we would have a 'Wag the Dog' scenario where he starts to lash out,' Obama administration Pentagon official Derek Chollet told the New York Times. 'But it won't be getting us into wars -- it will be the opposite.'

Adding to the intrigue, Israeli President Benjamin Netanyahu tweeted that he has spoken to Trump Monday and Secretary of State Mike Pompeo on Tuesday and had been told of the U.S. plan - indicating that two foreign leaders may have been in the know before senior military and civilian officials did.

""In no uncertain terms, reporting throughout this story is not true,' National Security Council spokesman Garrett Marquis told DailyMail.com, responding to questions about the call and accounts that emerged in AP reporting and Turkish media sources.

'In no uncertain terms, reporting throughout this story is not true. It is clear from the context that this false version of events is from sources who lack authority on the subject, possibly from unnamed sources in Turkey,' he added.

Trump stunned his Cabinet, lawmakers and much of the world with the move by rejecting the advice of his top aides and agreeing to a withdrawal in a phone call with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan last week, two officials briefed on the matter told The Associated Press.

The Dec. 14 call, described by officials who were not authorized to discuss the decision-making process publicly and spoke on condition of anonymity, provides insight into a consequential Trump decision that prompted the resignation of widely respected Defense Secretary Jim Mattis. It also set off a frantic, four-day scramble to convince the president either to reverse or delay the decision.

The White House, State Department and Pentagon all declined to comment on the account of the decision to withdraw the troops, which have been in Syria to fight the Islamic State since 2015.

Despite losing the physical caliphate, thousands of IS fighters remain in Iraq and Syria, and the group continues to carry out insurgent attacks and could easily move back into territory it once held if American forces withdraw.

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo arranged the Dec. 14 call a day after he had unsuccessfully sought clarity from Turkish counterpart Mevlut Cavusoglu about Erdogan's threats to launch a military operation against U.S.-backed Kurdish rebels in northeast Syria, where American forces are based.

Pompeo, Mattis and other members of the national security team prepared a list of talking points for Trump to tell Erdogan to back off, the officials said.

But the officials said Trump, who had previously accepted such advice and convinced the Turkish leader not to attack the Kurds and put U.S. troops at risk, ignored the script. Instead, the president sided with Erdogan.

In the following days, Trump remained unmoved by those scrambling to convince him to reverse or at least delay the decision to give the military and Kurdish forces time to prepare for an orderly withdrawal.

'The talking points were very firm,' said one of the officials, explaining that Trump was advised to clearly oppose a Turkish incursion into northern Syria and suggest the U.S. and Turkey work together to address security concerns. 'Everybody said push back and try to offer (Turkey) something that's a small win, possibly holding territory on the border, something like that.'

Erdogan, though, quickly put Trump on the defensive, reminding him that he had repeatedly said the only reason for U.S. troops to be in Syria was to defeat the Islamic State and that the group had been 99 percent defeated. 'Why are you still there?' the second official said Erdogan asked Trump, telling him that the Turks could deal with the remaining IS militants.

With Erdogan on the line, Trump asked national security adviser John Bolton, who was listening in, why American troops remained in Syria if what the Turkish president was saying was true, according to the officials. Erdogan's point, Bolton was forced to admit, had been backed up by Mattis, Pompeo, U.S. special envoy for Syria Jim Jeffrey andspecial envoy for the anti-ISIS coalition Brett McGurk, who have said that IS retains only 1 percent of its territory, the officials said.

Bolton stressed, however, that the entire national security team agreed that victory over IS had to be enduring, which means more than taking away its territory.

Trump was not dissuaded, according to the officials, who said the president quickly capitulated by pledging to withdraw, shocking both Bolton and Erdogan.

Caught off guard, Erdogan cautioned Trump against a hasty withdrawal, according to one official. While Turkey has made incursions into Syria in the past, it does not have the necessary forces mobilized on the border to move in and hold the large swaths of northeastern Syria where U.S. troops are positioned, the official said.

The call ended with Trump repeating to Erdogan that the U.S. would pull out, but offering no specifics on how it would be done, the officials said.

Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan addresses a business meeting in Istanbul Friday, Dec. 21, 2018, a week after he held a call with President Trump where according to the Turkish government he called U.S. allies terrorists

Over the weekend, the national security team raced to come up with a plan that would reverse, delay or somehow limit effects of the withdrawal, the officials said.

On Monday, Bolton, Mattis and Pompeo met at the White House to try to plot a middle course. But they were told by outgoing chief of staff John Kelly and his soon-to-be successor Mick Mulvaney that Trump was determined to pull out and was not to be delayed or denied, according to the officials. The trio met again on Tuesday morning to try to salvage things, but were again rebuffed, the officials said.

The White House had wanted to announce the decision on Tuesday - and press secretary Sarah Sanders scheduled a rare briefing specifically to announce it. But the Pentagon convinced Trump to hold off because the withdrawal plans weren't complete and allies and Congress had not yet been notified, according to the officials. The first country aside from Turkey to be told of the impending pull-out was Israel, the officials said.

Word of the imminent withdrawal began to seep out early Wednesday after U.S. Central Command chief Gen. Joseph Votel started to inform his commanders on the ground and the Kurds of the decision.

Following the official announcement the White House emphasized that the U.S. will continue to support the fight against IS and remains ready to 're-engage' when needed. But in a tweet, the president said U.S. troops would no longer be fighting IS on behalf of others.

'Time to focus on our Country & bring our youth back home where they belong!'"
419,daily mail online,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-6513509/A-look-US-involvement-Syrias-civil-war.html,"WASHINGTON (AP) - Here, at a glance, is a look at U.S. involvement in Syria:

HOW IT STARTED

In September 2014, then-President Barack Obama launched a U.S. air campaign against the Islamic State in Syria, one month after starting airstrikes in neighboring Iraq. The Islamic State had built substantial military firepower in Syria, which it used to sweep across western and northern Iraq earlier in 2014.

In late 2015 the first American ground troops entered Syria - initially 50, growing to the current official total of about 2,000. They recruited, organized and advised thousands of Syrian Kurdish and Arab fighters, dubbed the Syrian Democratic Forces, and pushed IS out of most of its strongholds.

MILITARY OPERATIONS

To date, the U.S.-led coalition has launched airstrikes on at least 17,000 locations in Syria since the start of the operation. Last week, there were strikes on 208 locations, largely on Islamic State fighters and facilities in the Middle Euphrates River Valley, according to the U.S. military.

Thousands of IS fighters have been killed or captured, but U.S. military officials say there are still as many at 2,000 insurgents still in the MERV, and a number of others who have escaped to various locations around the country.

COMPLICATIONS

Russia joined the big-power entanglement in Syria in the fall of 2015. Moscow said it was there to defeat terrorists, but Washington objected, saying the Russian military was propping up Syrian President Bashar Assad and making it more difficult to eliminate IS. To avoid aerial confrontations and accidents, U.S. and Russian military officials set up a telephone ""deconfliction line,"" which remains in effect.

Turkey's concern about links between the U.S.-supported Syrian Kurdish militias and Kurdish insurgents inside Turkey added a further complication for Washington. The Turkish military intervened in northern Syria, prompting the Syrian Kurds to temporarily abandon the fight against IS.

Iran has also maintained a presence in the country, supporting Assad and supplying weapons, the U.S. has asserted.

THE U.S. PULLOUT

President Donald Trump said his administration had continued the Syria fight only because of the IS threat. On Wednesday the president tweeted, ""We have defeated ISIS in Syria,"" and later U.S. officials said he had ordered a full withdrawal of U.S. forces there.

The Pentagon said in a prepared statement that IS-held territory had been ""liberated,"" but added that the U.S. would continue ""working with our partners and allies to defeat ISIS wherever it operates."" Officials refused to say when all U.S. troops would be out of Syria.

REACTION TO THE DECISION: OPPPONENTS

The decision has been met with widespread condemnation and only a smattering of support.

Pentagon leaders were largely mum on Wednesday, adhering to the mandate that U.S. civilian leaders make policy and the military salutes and moves forward. But top defense officials have been blunt in recent assessments that the fight against the Islamic State is not over.

Brett McGurk, the administration's envoy for the fight against IS, said on Dec. 11: ""It would be reckless if we were just to say, well, the physical caliphate is defeated, so we can just leave now. I think anyone who's looked at a conflict like this would agree with that.""

Sen. Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican, called the pullout ""catastrophic,"" and Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., deemed it a ""disaster in the making.""

Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., said an ill-informed and hasty withdrawal may breathe new life into ISIS and other insurgent groups, and ""will also cede America's hard-fought gains in the region to Russia, Iran and Assad.""

REACTION TO THE DECISION: SUPPORTERS

Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., said he was ""very supportive"" of the decision. ""For the first time in my lifetime we have a president with the courage to declare victory and bring the troops home. We haven't had a president in 20 or 30 years who can figure out how to declare victory,"" he said.

Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., said Americans don't want troops in Syria in perpetuity. ""We brought them there to crush ISIS. We've crushed ISIS. We have troops in Iraq who can spring over there (to Syria) to do something"" if needed."

The Trump administration has placed most of the 14,300 migrant toddlers, children and teens who crossed the border on their own, or who were separated from their parents, in mass detention centers crowded with hundreds, or thousands, of kids, it was revealed.

According to confidential government data obtained and cross-checked by the Associated Press, some 5,400 detained migrant children in the US are currently sleeping in shelters with more than 1,000 other children.

Some 9,800 are in facilities of varying quality of care with more than 100 total kids.

That's a dramatic change from the beginning of Donald Trump's presidential term in early 2017, when the same federal program had 2,720 migrant children, most of them being held in shelters with a few dozen kids or in foster programs.

Also, it has been taking at least twice as long, on average two months rather than one, for migrant held inside the system to get out, in part because the Trump administration added more restrictive screening measures for parents and relatives in the US who would take them in.

The Tornillo detention camp in the remote Tornillo, Texas, is one of three facilities of its kind that house more than 1,000 migrant teenagers

The Trump administration announced in June 2018 that it would open the temporary shelter in Texas for up to 360 migrant children

That changed Tuesday when the administration ended a policy requiring every adult in households where migrant children will live to provide the government with fingerprints.

All still must submit to background checks, and parents themselves still need to be fingerprinted. Nonetheless, officials said they could now process some children more rapidly, and hoped to shorten shelter stays that had dragged on so long kids sometimes wondered if their parents had abandoned them for good.

KEY INSIGHTS FROM DATA ON MIGRANT CHILDREN: As of December 17, some 9,800 children were in facilities housing more than 100 kids; 5,405 of those were in three facilities with more than 1,000 youths - two in Texas and one in Florida.Texas had the most growth over the last 20 months in the number of kids under ORR custody. In April 2017, there were 1,368 migrant children in facilities or foster care in Texas. As of December 17, the number was about 8,700.New York had the second-highest number of children: 1,653, up from 210 in April 2017. Cayuga Centers grew from about 40 kids to close to 900; all are in foster homes.The five largest providers, in order, are Austin, Texas-based Southwest Key; San Antonio-based BCFS Health and Human Services; Comprehensive Health Services Inc., based in Cape Canaveral, Florida; Cayuga Centers in Auburn, New York; and Chicago-based Heartland Alliance. Together they had about 11,600 children - or more than 80 percent of the 14,314 migrant youth in ORR custody as of December 17. The states with children in care are: Arizona, California, Connecticut, Florida, Illinois, Kansas, Massachusetts, Maryland, Michigan, New Jersey, New York, Oregon, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Texas, Virginia and Washington state.

Until now, public information has been limited about the number of youths held at each facility overseen by the Office of Refugee Resettlement, even for attorneys representing the kids.

But the AP obtained data showing the number of children in individual detention centers, shelters and foster care programs for nearly every week over the past 20 months, revealing in detail the expanse of a program at the center of the Trump administration's immigration crackdown.

The data shows the degree to which the government's approach to migrant youth has hardened, marking a new phase in a federal program originally intended to offer safe haven to vulnerable children fleeing danger across the globe.

'It's a pain we will never get through,' said Cecilio Ramirez Castaneda, a Salvadoran whose 12-year-old son, Omar, was taken from him when they were apprehended in June under the administration's 'zero tolerance' policy, which led to nearly 3,000 children being separated from their families.

Omar feared his father had given up on him during the five months he spent in a Southwest Key shelter in Brownsville, Texas, with dozens of kids.

Ramirez was reunited with Omar last month only to learn that his son had been hospitalized for depression and medicated for unclear reasons and suffered a broken arm while in government custody.

'It's a system that causes irreparable damage,' he said. 'My son says they would tell him that because he wasn't from here, he had no rights.'

Experts say the deep anxiety and distrust children suffer when they're institutionalized away from loved ones can cause long-lasting mental and physical health problems.

It's dangerous for all but worse for younger children, those who stay more than a few days and those who are in larger facilities with less personal care.

'This is not a perplexing scientific puzzle. This is a moral disaster,' said Dr. Jack Shonkoff, who heads Harvard University's Center on the Developing Child. 'There has to be some way to communicate, in unequivocal terms, that we are inflicting punishments on innocent children that will have lifelong consequences.

'No matter how a person feels about immigration policy, very few people hate children - and yet we are passively allowing bad things to happen to them.'

Administration officials said increased need has driven them to expand the number of beds available for migrant children from 6,500 last fall to 16,000 today.

A lawsuit filed earlier this year alleged that Latino youths at the Shenandoah Valley Juvenile Center in Virginia were beaten while handcuffed, locked up in solitary confinement, left nude and shivering in concrete cells

Migrant teens gather at the Homestead Temporary Shelter for Unaccompanied Children, in Homestead, Florida - one of 150 facilities spread over 17 states housing migrant youths

Some of the facilities housing children and teens from Central America resemble boarding school campuses, while others, like the Shenandoah Valley Juvenile Center, look like jails

Mark Weber, a spokesman for the US Department of Health and Human Services, which oversees ORR, said sheltering children in large facilities, while not preferable, is a better alternative than holding them for long periods at Border Patrol stations ill-suited to care for them.

'This is an amazing program with incredibly dedicated people who are working to take care of these kids,' he said. 'There are a large number of children and it's a difficult situation, and we are just working hard to make sure they are taken care of and placed responsibly.'

The kids in government care range in age from toddlers to 17. The vast majority crossed the border without their parents, escaping violence and corruption in Central America, but some were separated from their families at the border earlier this year.

The care they receive varies greatly in the opaque network, which has encompassed 150 different programs over the last 20 months in 17 states. Some children live with foster families and are treated to Broadway shows, while others sleep in canvas tents exposed to the elements amid the Texas desert.

This 18-year-old Honduran said he suffered abuse inside a Virginia immigration detention facility

At this unlicensed tent city in the Texas desert that is housing children who are closest to being released, the population dipped down to just over 1,000 children in late October, when human rights groups toured the camp. By Dec. 17, the population reached 2,745

Kids continue to enter the system, though dozens of the care providers have been sued or disciplined before for mistreating children in their care. Now new litigation is piling up as attorneys fight to get migrant children released.

Staff members at a Southwest Key shelter in Phoenix allegedly physically abused three children this year, leading to the closure of the shelter in October, federal officials said.

And a lawsuit filed earlier this year alleged that Latino youths at the Shenandoah Valley Juvenile Center in Virginia were beaten while handcuffed and locked up for long periods in solitary confinement, left nude and shivering in concrete cells.

The American Academy of Pediatrics and many experts warn against institutionalizing children in large groups. Dr. Ryan Matlow, a Stanford clinical psychologist whose work addresses the impact of early life stress, said best practices minimize the number of children in any one shelter.

'Children are being treated as cogs in a machine, and their individual backgrounds, interests and unique identities are devalued as they are lost amongst the masses. This experience then becomes internalized, with significant psychological consequences,' said Matlow, who recently met with migrant children in custody.

'There is no way in which a mass detention setting can replicate the experience and support that comes from family and community.'

The number of migrant children caught by immigration officials and then turned over to the Office of Refugee Resettlement has dropped under Trump: there were 49,100 in fiscal year 2018 compared to a high of 59,170 in fiscal year 2016, when a surge of youth crossing the border prompted the Obama administration to open emergency shelters at military bases.

The average length of stay has increased, however, from about 34 days in January 2016 to around 60 days , according to government reports. In October, the average length of stay reached 89 days, according to data HHS provided to members of Congress, who shared it with AP.

Earlier this year, the Trump administration added new screening requirements that made it harder for parents and other relatives to get approved to take custody of the migrant children - including the fingerprint policy. That information has been shared with Immigration and Customs Enforcement, resulting in the arrests of dozens of would-be sponsors.

Under this week's change, only a parent or individual directly responsible for a child will have to submit fingerprints.

HHS spokesman Weber said some fingerprinting requirements were necessary to ensure children are released to a safe environment: 'Given the multitude of bad actors around the children, you really have to be careful.'

The ORR migrant children's program has already cost taxpayers more than $1.5billion, according to federal grant disclosures. Another $1.1billion has been requested as part of the 2019 budget.

The facilities housing these children range from bucolic to jail-like.

In a Baltimore suburb, Board of Child Care shelters about 50 migrant children amid 28-acres of cottages and grassy lawns; Rite of Passage in Arizona has about 100 kids sheltered at facilities that look like posh, private schools surrounded by trees and fields.

Youth for Tomorrow, founded in Bristow, Virginia, by former Washington Redskins coach Joe Gibbs to serve troubled teens, is housing about 110 migrant kids on its 215-acre campus with soccer fields and volleyball courts, music and art therapy.

Suspected gang members can be sent to several high-security facilities. An attorney for a Guatemalan teen held in the Yolo County, California, juvenile detention center for 11 months said his client was locked in restraints when he acted out and stung with pepper spray.

Attorney Travis Silva convinced a judge to release the boy in November to his mother in Ohio. He's now being treated for trauma and mental illness, said Silva, and shelter statistics show 14 other teens remain locked inside.

'He was locked in a cell, allowed one hour a day outside,' said Silva. 'And outdoor time was anxiety-provoking, because that's when there could be fights.'

At Tornillo, Texas - the largest of all the facilities - some 2,745 teens are held in massive tents. Staff aren't allowed to touch them, except for fist bumps. They can't hug.

'The programs vary wildly from place to place,' said Shana Tabak, who directs the Atlanta office of the Tahirih Justice Center, which represents immigrant women and girls. 'The federal government has taken a haphazard approach to caring for these human beings.'

Republican Congressman Will Hurd, whose district includes Tornillo, demanded that the government reunite the children with their families and shut down the detention camp by the end of the year, when the contract expires.

'Unnecessarily holding children for prolonged periods of time is no deterrent to illegal immigration,' he said. 'All of this is a symptom of a broader problem, and that is that we're not doing enough to address root causes of migration. We are the United States. We are better than this.'

Every kid comes with their own set of needs, many severe.

'We mostly have housed teenagers, some with their babies, and some sibling pairs whose parents have been murdered,' said Regina Moller, executive director of Noank Community Support Services in Groton, Connecticut.

Noank can house up to 12 of the kids at a time and has been at or near capacity for weeks now.

Abbott House in Irvington, New York, takes kids with medical needs such as diabetes, cerebral palsy, depression and anxiety. It is housing 51 migrant boys and girls; the youngest is 3 years old, said medical director Dr. Luis Rodriguez.

A handful of boys are getting therapeutic intervention for sexual behavior or mental health issues at Friends of Youth in Seattle.

Manuel Marcelino Tzah, right, is a Guatemalan father whose 12-year-old daughter, Manuela, left, was taken from him and held in a Southwest Key facility in Houston for nearly two months

'Most of these children are coming from great trauma and really terrible things have happened to them in their short lives,' said president Terry Pottmeyer. 'They respond so positively, we see incredible results.'

This December, many will be enduring their first holidays without family.

Manuel Marcelino Tzah, a Guatemalan father whose 12-year-old daughter, Manuela, was taken from him and held in a Southwest Key facility in Houston for nearly two months, said his family is still processing the pain of separation and detention.

'She's doing OK now; she is going to school and learning some English,' said Marcelino, whose immigration case is pending in a New York court near his new home in Brooklyn.

'We really went through some difficult times, and sometimes she remembers it and is hit with the sadness of it. I tell her what happened, happened, and now we are here and struggling for a better life.'"
421,bbc news,https://www.bbc.com/news/entertainment-arts-42347243,"It's full of synthetic hip-hop music and naff choreography. There's nothing to it. You'd be better off spending the evening in the pub.

You will know by now this is not a commonly held view of Lin-Manuel Miranda's all-conquering musical about America's all-conquering Founding Fathers.

But it is valid.

It is the opinion of a rock musician, who saw the show on Wednesday night. The fella loathed it so much he left at half-time, and sat the evening out on his own in a local boozer.

I tell you this, because it is worth acknowledging amid all the hype and hysteria that Hamilton is not for everyone. For some it will be simply the latest irritating American theatrical import to roll off the transatlantic conveyor belt, jazz hands and all.

Not me.

To say Hamilton is just another transfer from Broadway would be like saying the Sex Pistols were just another boy band. It is a ground-breaking, game-changing, epoch-defining musical.

It is... a masterpiece.

I get what the rock guy was saying about the music feeling more anodyne than the sort of thing you'd find at a downtown hip-hop gig, or a rap night in a subterranean club.

He's right, it doesn't have that sense of barely contained anger or raw energy. But that's because it's a musical in a theatre, which is several stops along on the entertainment express from a sweaty night in a mosh pit.

The way in which it goes about its business of telling the story of Alexander Hamilton, a largely unknown figure in America's fight for independence (although he is the face of the $10), is unprecedented, compelling, and important.

We meet our man and hear of his demise in the opening scene and first song of the show, in which its principles and premises are established:

Spot in the Caribbean by providence, impoverished, in squalor

Grow up to be a hero and a scholar?

This is to be a tale as much about immigration, class, and race as it is about politics, war, and love.

In a casting move that echoes the revolution being played out on stage, the Founding Fathers are all non-white.

Their struggle is mirrored in the music, which comes from the African-American canon (hip-hop, rap, jazz, R&B, and soul). The old establishment figures (George III and his army) on the other hand, are white, pompous and detached.

The message is clear: this is a story about the movers and shakers of the past, who changed America, told by the movers and shakers of today, who are undertaking the same task.

Barack Obama, who has been to the show several times, loves it.

President Trump, who has not seen it, called it ""highly overrated"".

I feared, having seen the show in New York, that it would lose some of its magic crossing the Pond.

The songs, the music, the book, the acting, the singing, the choreography, the staging, the costumes, the lighting, the sound, and the newly refurbished theatre - are all five-star.

Jamael Westman, a RADA-trained rookie, plays Alexander Hamilton with the skill and charisma of an established star. The transformation his character has to make from a naïve, orphaned, teenage revolutionary to a political heavyweight helping shape a newly independent America, is not easy.

Westman makes it look a cinch.

Alongside him is the more experienced Giles Terera playing Aaron Burr, Hamilton's friend and fatal foe, in a combined role of both narrator and protagonist; a structural task he lands with the easy authority and perfect timing of Mohammad Ali in his pomp.

The knock-out punches though, are delivered by Michael Jibson's George III.

The King might have lost America, but he steals this show every night with three fabulously camp entrances, in which he asks America if going it alone is really that good an idea (You'll Be Back):

I will send a fully armed battalion to remind you of my love!

In New York the audience whooped, then laughed at a song that is right up there with Carly Simon's You're So Vain, as one of the most bitter and sarcastic break-up numbers ever written.

The London audience reacted slightly differently. Before the laugh is an anxious pause, as they quickly recognised the Brexit connotations, albeit with a Hammond not a Hamilton in charge of the Exchequer.

The singing is terrific throughout, but special mention has to be given to Rachelle Ann Go as Hamilton's wife Eliza, and Rachel John who plays her sister, Angelica Schuyler. They sing with a soulfulness and musicality that has the audience rapt, most particularly in the Act I numbers, Helpless and Satisfied.

A musical like Hamilton comes along once in a generation. Showboat (1927), West Side Story (1957), Sweeney Todd (1979), Rent (1996); it belongs among them as one of the finest works to be created in the genre.

It is timely, intelligent, and irresistibly entertaining from the first note to the last. And also surprisingly scholarly.

Lin-Manuel Miranda, a one-time teacher, read Ron Chernow's epic 800+ page 2004 biography of Alexander Hamilton while on holiday, and pitched to the now 68-year old historian that it would make the perfect subject for a hip-hop musical.

After some persuasion Chernow agreed, Miranda then performed the opening number at a White House poetry jam in 2009 and the rest, as they say, is history."
422,daily mail online,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-6503001/AP-FACT-CHECK-Trumps-distorted-reality-expanding-probes.html,"WASHINGTON (AP) - President Donald Trump keeps changing his story in the swirling investigations into Russia election interference and hush money payments to women who say they had affairs with him.

He insists that payments to porn actress Stormy Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal during the 2016 campaign were ""private transactions"" and that any crime committed would be the fault of his former personal attorney, Michael Cohen, not him. That's a change from what the president said before. Trump previously had denied knowledge of payments and dismissed any hint of a crime.

In the special counsel's probe into contacts between Russia and the Trump campaign, Trump tried to cast doubt on whether his former national security adviser, Michael Flynn, had lied to the FBI. Flynn in fact pleaded guilty to doing just that.

Over the past week, Trump also made a flurry of false or unsupported statements about immigration. He said, with no evidence, that migrants are plagued with disease. He asserted that Mexico has in effect agreed to pay for his border wall, even as he threatens a partial government shutdown if Congress doesn't approve billions of dollars to build it. He twisted federal statistics to claim the recent arrest of 10 terrorists who don't exist.

A look at the claims:

COHEN

TRUMP: ""Remember, Michael Cohen only became a 'Rat' after the FBI did something which was absolutely unthinkable & unheard of until the Witch Hunt was illegally started. They BROKE INTO AN ATTORNEY'S OFFICE!"" - tweet Sunday.

THE FACTS: It was not a break-in. The FBI executed a search warrant obtained from a judge in conducting the raid and seizing records on a variety of matters, among them a $130,000 payment made to porn actress Stormy Daniels by Trump's lawyer, Cohen. The application for the warrant was approved high in the Justice Department.

Former FBI director James Comey tweeted in response Sunday that Trump is ""lying about the lawful execution of a search warrant issued by a federal judge.""

TRUMP: ""I never directed him to do anything wrong. Whatever he did, he did on his own."" - interview Thursday with Fox News.

TRUMP: ""I never directed Michael Cohen to break the law ... many campaign finance lawyers have strongly stated that I did nothing wrong with respect to campaign finance laws, if they even apply, because this was not campaign finance."" - tweets Thursday.

TRUMP: ""So now the Dems go to a simple private transaction, wrongly call it a campaign contribution,...which it was not (but even if it was, it is only a CIVIL CASE, like Obama's - but it was done correctly by a lawyer and there would not even be a fine. Lawyer's liability if he made a mistake, not me). Cohen just trying to get his sentence reduced."" - tweets Dec. 10.

THE FACTS: Whatever the truth, his account is evolving. Trump's description of the payments as a ""simple private transaction"" - which he couples with his insistence that ""did nothing wrong"" with respect to campaign finance laws - is not how he explained it just a few months ago.

In April, Trump issued a blanket denial that he knew anything about reports of $130,000 in hush-money paid to Daniels, saying reporters would ""have to ask Michael Cohen."" A month later, he then acknowledged the payments as a ""private contract."" Trump is now saying if something criminal happened, it would be solely Cohen's fault as his former attorney.

Both Cohen and American Media Inc., the company that owns the National Enquirer tabloid, say they made hush-money payments to Daniels and McDougal for the purpose of helping Trump's 2016 White House bid, a campaign finance violation. Both women alleged they had extramarital affairs with Trump, which the White House denies. Federal prosecutors say the payments were made at Trump's direction.

For the payments themselves to be a crime rather than a civil infraction, prosecutors would need to show that Trump knew that what he was doing was wrong when he directed Cohen to pay the women and that he did so with the goal of benefiting his campaign.

It's unclear what federal prosecutors in New York will decide to do if they conclude that there is evidence that Trump himself committed a crime. In the meantime, Trump's changing version of the truth is running head-on into facts agreed to by prosecutors.

RUSSIA INVESTIGATION

TRUMP: ""Wow, 19,000 Texts between Lisa Page and her lover, Peter S of the FBI, in charge of the Russia Hoax, were just reported as being wiped clean and gone. Such a big story that will never be covered by the Fake News. Witch Hunt!"" - tweet Saturday.

THE FACTS: The Justice Department's watchdog, in a report released Thursday, found no evidence the FBI intentionally destroyed text messages of former FBI agent Peter Strzok and former FBI lawyer Lisa Page, who were involved in the Hillary Clinton email investigation when they worked for the bureau.

The inspector general faulted an FBI-wide software failure that has resulted in large portions of FBI text messages not being archived.

The report examined a gap in messages from December 2016 through May 2017 from the phones of Strzok and Page. The FBI ultimately managed to recover thousands of the messages.

Some congressional Republicans had suggested the messages were intentionally deleted. The inspector general report said there was no evidence Strzok and Page circumvented protocol. Strzok was removed from special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation after anti-Trump texts were discovered. He has since been fired. Page resigned.

TRUMP: ""Well the FBI said Michael Flynn, a general and a great person, they said he didn't lie. And Mueller said: 'Well, maybe he did.' And now they're all having a big dispute, so I think it's a great thing that the judge is looking into that situation. It's an honor for a lot of terrific people."" - remarks Thursday.

THE FACTS: That's not what the FBI said. And Flynn, Trump's former national security adviser, has agreed that he lied to the FBI. He pleaded guilty to it and is to be sentenced this week - the first White House official punished as part of special counsel Robert Mueller's ongoing Russia investigation.

The idea that Flynn didn't lie to the FBI picked up steam after Republicans on the House intelligence committee issued a report this year that said ex-FBI director James Comey, in a private briefing, told lawmakers that agents who interviewed Flynn ""discerned no physical indications of deception"" and saw ""nothing that indicated to them that he knew he was lying to them."" But Comey called that description ""garble"" in a private interview with House lawmakers this month.

Comey, in essence, said Flynn was a good liar, having a ""natural conversation"" with agents, ""answered fully their questions, didn't avoid. That notwithstanding, they concluded he was lying.""

As for Trump's comment that the judge is looking into the matter, it's true U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan has asked for documents related to the agents who interviewed Flynn. It's not clear from Sullivan's order whether he considers there to be a dispute to resolve or if he just wants to see the underlying documents as he decides Flynn's sentence.

BORDER SECURITY

TRUMP: ""The Democrats policy of Child Seperation (sic) on the Border during the Obama Administration was far worse than the way we handle it now. Remember the 2014 picture of children in cages - the Obama years."" - tweet Sunday.

THE FACTS: Democratic President Barack Obama did not have a separation policy. The Trump administration didn't, explicitly, either, but that was the effect of his zero tolerance policy, which meant that anyone caught crossing the border illegally was to be criminally prosecuted, even those with few or no previous offences.

The policy meant adults were taken to court for criminal proceedings and their children were separated. In most cases, if the charge took longer than 72 hours to process, which is the longest time that children can be held by Customs and Border Protection, children were sent into the care of the Health and Human Services Department. Zero tolerance remains in effect, but Trump signed an executive order June 20 that stopped separations.

Trump also misrepresents 2014 photos of children in holding cells. They did not involve family separation.

The photos, taken by The Associated Press during the Obama administration, showed children who came to the border without their parents and were being housed at a Customs and Border Protection center in Nogales, Arizona. The photos were identified as such but wrongly described online as illustrating imprisonment under Trump.

TRUMP: ""People with tremendous medical difficulty and medical problems are pouring in, and in many - in many cases it's contagious. They're pouring into our country. We have to have border security."" - statement in Oval Office meeting Tuesday with Democratic leaders, Rep. Nancy Pelosi and Sen. Chuck Schumer.

THE FACTS: Trump provided no evidence that people coming into the country, including the caravan at the U.S.-Mexico border, are carrying contagious diseases at a higher rate than the U.S. population. Medical screening is part of the process for vetting people who seek asylum.

A study published this month by the UCL-Lancet Commission on Migration and Health called scares about contagion one of the most pervasive myths about migrants. The study found no evidence that migrants pose a significant public health risk to countries such as the U.S. that have good health systems. In fact, migrants themselves face health threats from arduous journeys, violence along the way, or overcrowding in shelters or camps, the Lancet commission said. While some may come from regions where certain diseases are common, the report noted that international tourism and movement of animals spread illness, too.

As for the caravan and other migrants from the south, World Bank statistics show Mexico and Central America vaccinate most children against measles, sometimes at a bit higher rate than the U.S. Along the border between Mexico and California, public health departments have long had a system in place to watch for signs of outbreaks of a variety of illnesses, whether they're immigration-related or not.

TRUMP: ""Our Southern Border is now Secure and will remain that way."" - tweet Tuesday.

TRUMP: ""We need border security. People are pouring into our country, including terrorists. We have terrorists. But we caught 10 terrorists. These are over the last very short period of time - 10. These are very serious people."" - statement in Oval Office meeting.

THE FACTS: Trump contradicted himself, declaring the border secure and insecure on the same day. And Trump is wrong about the government recently catching 10 terrorists.

His statement is a mangling of federal statistics showing that U.S. Customs and Border Protection stopped an average of seven to 10 people a day in the 2017 budget year who were denied entry to the U.S. because they were on a watch list. That average applied to all points of entry, and overwhelmingly from airports, and was not specific to the southern border. The standard for placing someone on the list is reasonable suspicion, a lower bar than the probable cause needed to arrest someone for an alleged crime. The statistics do not show how many might have been arrested or charged with anything.

In any event, Trump rendered a daily average as 10 recently captured terrorists in the flesh.

As for border security, U.S. arrests on the Mexican border jumped 78 percent in November from a year earlier to the highest level in Trump's presidency. Increased arrests indicate that more people are trying to cross the border illegally.

JOBS

PELOSI: ""We came at a place to say, 'How do we meet the needs of American people who have needs?' The economy has - people are losing their jobs."" - Oval Office meeting.

TRUMP: ""Well, we have the lowest unemployment that we've had in 50 years."" - Oval Office meeting.

THE FACTS: Trump is correct about jobs.

There may always be some layoffs even if the economy is strong. General Motors, for instance, said last month it would cut as many as 14,000 workers in North America in a restructuring aimed at generating cash to spend on innovation, even though U.S. auto sales are near historic highs.

But the U.S. economy has now added jobs for a record 98 straight months, dating to October 2010, during the Obama administration.

The Labor Department reported the unemployment rate in November stayed at 3.7 percent, a five-decade low, for the third straight month.

The job gains are pushing down unemployment rates to historically low levels for a variety of groups. The unemployment rate for men aged 20 and above fell last month to 3.3 percent, the lowest in 18 years. The rate for Americans with just high school diplomas dropped to 3.5 percent, the lowest since December 2000. The African-American jobless rate declined to 5.9 percent, matching May's figure as the lowest on record.

That's making it more challenging for businesses to find the workers they need. Employers have posted 7 million open jobs, outnumbering the ranks of the unemployed, which fell last month to just under 6 million.

THE WALL

TRUMP: ""I often stated, 'One way or the other, Mexico is going to pay for the Wall.' This has never changed. Our new deal with Mexico (and Canada), the USMCA, is so much better than the old, very costly & anti-USA NAFTA deal, that just by the money we save, MEXICO IS PAYING FOR THE WALL!"" - tweet Thursday.

THE FACTS: This is a face-saving statement to mask the fact that Mexico refused to pay for a U.S. border wall, Trump gave up trying to make it do so and U.S. taxpayers are on the hook for it.

In essence, Trump is arguing that new terms of trade with Mexico will increase economic growth in the U.S. and produce more tax revenue. That's what everyone hopes trade agreements will do. As part of that, he hopes for a lower trade deficit with Mexico. Neither outcome is assured.

The deal negotiated with Mexico and Canada is an update of the North American Free Trade Agreement he railed against, not a transformative pact. The three countries will continue trading in an environment of mainly low or no tariffs, with improvements here and there for all three partners. There is no credible way for Trump to forecast additional growth covering costs that are being charged to U.S. taxpayers if the wall is built. Trade balances depend on too many factors - consumer tastes, exchange rates, overall economic performance, and the choices of thousands of companies among them - and some are well outside any government's control.

Trump specifically promised in the campaign that Mexico would pay for the wall. That is not the same as trying to reduce the U.S. trade deficit, which is about the exchange of goods and services among private entities rather than payments between governments. Nor is a trade deficit necessarily a penalty on consumers. It is the result of consumers buying things made in another country.

He wants some $25 billion from Congress for wall construction over five years and promises a partial government shutdown if he does not get a $5 billion or so portion in the next week. Congress may or may not give him that. If it does, it will not be because lawmakers expect a refund to the treasury in future years from extra growth produced by a trade deal.

TRUMP: ""Tremendous amounts of wall have already been built."" - statement in meeting Tuesday with Pelosi and Schumer.

TRUMP: ""People do not yet realize how much of the Wall, including really effective renovation, has already been built."" ''We have already built large new sections & fully renovated others, making them like new."" - tweets.

THE FACTS: Tremendous portions of the wall have not been built. Yes, some barrier renovation has happened, but little wall construction has been completed under Trump.

Congress allocated roughly $1.4 billion in the spring - a bit more than 5 percent of what Trump wanted - for border security and specified that the money was not to be used for construction of the prototype wall sections that stand near San Diego. Instead, the money is to strengthen or replace existing fencing with more secure fencing.

Altogether, Trump promised in the campaign that he'd build a 1,000-mile (1,600 kilometer-) wall, as high as 40 feet or 12 meters (and have Mexico pay for it, which isn't happening). If some 650 miles (1,050 km) of existing fencing are considered in the equation, that leaves him with about 350 miles (560 km) of wall to build.

423,bbc news,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-46739444,"Donald Trump has shrugged off a stinging personal attack on his presidency from senior fellow Republican Mitt Romney.

Mr Romney, who stood and lost for the Republicans against Barack Obama in 2012, suggested in an article that Mr Trump was not fit to be president.

Mr Trump had not ""risen to the mantle"", he wrote in the Washington Post.

The winner of the 2016 presidential election hit back by tweeting, ""I won big and he didn't.""

Mr Trump drew a comparison with Jeff Flake, an outgoing Republican senator who also attacked him last year.

But the president sounded conciliatory, calling for Mr Romney to be a ""team player"".

The timing of the article, just two days before Mr Romney is sworn in as senator for Utah, has prompted some to speculate he is positioning himself as a challenger to Mr Trump for the Republican presidential nomination.

In the article, Mr Romney praised many of Mr Trump's policies, such as his tax reforms and appointment of conservative judges, and his crackdown on ""China's unfair trade practices"" - polices which he said ""mainstream Republicans"" had promoted for years.

But he went on to say: ""With the nation so divided, resentful and angry, presidential leadership in qualities of character is indispensable. And it is in this province where the incumbent's shortfall has been most glaring.""

Mr Romney said he would support the president in policies he thought were in the best interests of Utah or the US but speak out against actions ""that are divisive, racist, sexist, anti-immigrant, dishonest or destructive to democratic institutions"".

""The appointment of senior persons of lesser experience, the abandonment of allies who fight beside us, and the president's thoughtless claim that America has long been a 'sucker' in world affairs all defined his presidency down,"" he wrote.

""Trump's words and actions have caused dismay around the world.""

The world ""needs American leadership"", he argued, and ""the alternative... offered by China and Russia is autocratic, corrupt and brutal"".

Mr Romney's article has been widely discussed and covered across US media. Several outlets suggested that Mr Romney was positioning himself to be Mr Trump's leading critic in Congress.

The New York Times said much of the essay ""sounded like the makings of a primary challenge against Mr. Trump from Mr. Romney"".

Mr Trump's manager for the 2020 presidential campaign accused Mr Romney of jealousy.

Some have praised Mr Romney, others said he should have gone further. Conservative commentators and pro-Trump writers have accused him of duplicity and opportunism.

A complicated one. During the 2016 campaign, Mr Romney said Mr Trump had neither ""the temperament nor the judgement to be president"" while Mr Trump called Mr Romney a ""choke artist"" and called his bid for the presidency in 2012 ""the worst ever"".

The same year though, the pair met for dinner amid reports Mr Trump was mulling appointing Mr Romney as his secretary of state.

Mr Romney has also taken issue with Mr Trump labelling the press the ""enemy of the people"" as well as his response to a violent far-right rally in Charlottesville.

When the US Congress reconvenes on Thursday, Mr Trump faces a new challenge on the domestic front - in November's mid-terms the Republicans strengthened their hold of the Senate but lost the House of Representatives."
424,the huffington post,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/opinion-warren-2020-presidential-run-beto-biden-bernie_us_5c2a9683e4b08aaf7a93090f,"Welcome to 2019. There's a government shutdown going on, and federal employees -- from cafeteria workers to janitors to research scientists -- are cut off from their income for a second week. The resolution of this dispute depends on hundreds of representatives and senators and a recalcitrant, rageful president agreeing on funding for a wall, or perhaps, according to The New York Times, on what the definition of a ""wall"" even is.

Amid this profoundly dysfunctional existential wrangling over the fulfillment of a campaign slogan, speculation about the 2020 presidential election has begun in earnest.

There's already polling on potential Democratic candidates. Elizabeth Warren announced the formation of an exploratory committee for the presidency in a fiery, graph-laden video. A sour if somewhat half-hearted factional dispute has already begun between those who have pledged their allegiance to Beto O'Rourke and those who are ready to tender fealty to Bernie Sanders. Joe Biden keeps making irascible, avuncular statements about his own credentials, which he deems impeccable.

But perhaps most strikingly, 60 percent of those surveyed said they preferred ""someone entirely new"" to take up the blue banner in the new decade.

It's possible that the prospect of well-worn faces duking it out in the extended, wrenching cable-news kayfabe that is a U.S. presidential election campaign merely induces fatigue in would-be voters. It's also possible, though, that the desire for someone entirely new represents a desire for new and more nimble tactics or a way to cut through the greasy film of grim spectacle extruding from the White House at all times.

It's possible that the desire for someone entirely new represents a desire for new and more nimble tactics.

To the potential Democratic candidates of 2020 and their army of political strategists and consultants, I offer a humble, four-letter suggestion of which tactic to employ: rage.

There's a lot for a liberal to be angry about in the Trump era. There's a blizzard of offenses, both the brazen and the subtle, all going on at once, a kind of acid snow of bewildering, anger-inducing initiatives that bombards anyone who seeks to stay informed. There's the quiet rollback of environmental regulations at dizzying scale, which is slowly sickening entire populations. There are the party rental tents at Mar-a-Lago for which taxpayers are footing the $54,000 bill. There are children dying in the custody of Border Patrol and a sprawling camp for teenage migrants hastily assembled in the Texas desert. And far more. And it's constant.

Trump induces visceral reactions in many, but the causes for rage extend beyond him, and even beyond the damage his administration is actively doing. There are preconditions that allowed him to rise, that allowed the Republican Party to lie supine before him and to embrace him so fully. There is a sickness in this country that allowed this carbuncular president to swell to the surface, and it calls for more than the Democrats' signature bloodless, incremental technocracy to fix.

The plain fact of the matter is that for a lot of Americans, life simply sucks and isn't getting better.

The plain fact of the matter is that for a lot of Americans, life simply sucks and isn't getting better.

It's measurable: Our life expectancy has shortened for the second year in a row, the first multiyear drop since 1963. The top 1 percent of Americans haven't controlled this much wealth since the 1920s, after decades of increasingly dramatic stratification. Nearly half the country would find its finances crippled by a $400 emergency expense. Some 72,000 Americans died of drug overdoses in 2017, amid a doubling of such deaths over the past decade; graphs of the trend soar sharply up, like a tilted needle.

In this environment of despair and stagnation, Republicans have taken full advantage of the power of rage. Trump's campaign and his presidency have sought to shunt American rage outward, blaming other nations all over the globe for the precipitous decline in American fortunes, and straining alliances with bellicose rhetoric. More viscerally, his campaign and those of Republicans in the 2018 midterms took advantage of a tried and tested means of eliciting fear and anger: stoking the flames of xenophobia and racism. It sufficed to hold the Senate.

Blaming a dark-skinned other for one's misfortune is an old and redoubtable tactic in American politicking, but the current administration has embraced it with passion. The wall that caused the government shutdown embodies this well: As a promise, it's a baldly phallic, ultimately grotesque monument to the desire to close America off to its southern neighbors. The crude prototype the president posted to Twitter is spiky, dense and, in its crude way, potently symbolic.

The Trump-led There are over a migrant caravan that formed a superheated prelude to the midterm elections was an expression of visceral rage, of fear, of a terrible anger to which Trump's supporters have responded eagerly at his legions of rallies. A DHS memo on the Christmas Eve death of a Guatemalan 8-year-old in custody that used the word ""illegal"" five separate times offered more of the same fear-mongering rhetoric, claiming that migrants are ""harboring illness.""

All over the government, all throughout the conservative movement, rage and the fulfillment of its impulses peals like a cracked, sick bell, tolling a note that resonates profoundly with its adherents.

The truth is that being angry often feels good. It's a release, a molten carapace to put up against the continual indignities of lives lived paycheck-to-paycheck or in the shadow of old age or even merely in the knowledge that others are richer and stronger than you are. It's easy, then, to turn on others who are poorer and weaker, or who are unfamiliar, who can be turned into dangerous specters whose banishment would change your life completely for the better.

But this kind of rage is a bad pill, a fleeting tonic against deeper ills, like an Oxycontin dropped into a life devoid of hope. It isn't working because it doesn't work. No wall can protect from despair or a dropping bank balance or a sick kid or a lost job.

There are other kinds of rage, though, and other uses for it. ""Anger is loaded with information and energy,"" wrote Audre Lorde in a 1981 address titled ""The Uses of Anger."" ""I have suckled the wolf's lip of anger and I have used it for illumination, laughter, protection, fire in places where there was no light, no food, no sisters, no quarter.""

Lorde's speech eloquently addresses how anger can be used to fight back against racism, how anger is a means of survival. While her speech is drawn from a profoundly personal experience of marginalization, the notion of anger as a survival tactic -- as a source of power that can be harnessed for good purpose and to great ends -- is a useful guiding principle for those who desperately seek progress in their lives and in the world around them.

The uses of rage have been eloquently addressed in three separate books by female authors this year: Rebecca Traister, Soraya Chemaly and Brittney Cooper, in their works lauding the fearsome power of rage among women, tapped the seething seam of anger that is echoing through the electorate on all sides of the aisle.

The notion of anger as a survival tactic -- as a source of power that can be harnessed for good purpose and to great ends -- is a useful guiding principle.

The core promise of a political campaign -- often betrayed, sometimes ignored -- is the simple idea that your life doesn't have to be like this. Things are bad and they don't have to be. Barack Obama's tremendously galvanizing 2008 campaign was premised around a core of hope, the hope for transformative change that could erase smallness and stagnation and travail. In these uglier times, rage may be a better motivator.

The world, after all, doesn't have to be like this, and our lives don't have to be so cramped and so fearful. All but the very richest of us know that one bad biopsy could shatter any hope of financial security we have. This year we have been ravaged as a country by fire and flood, and such events are set only to escalate, jeopardizing a future for our children and theirs. 113 million Americans have a loved one who is incarcerated; every day, 118 of us die of a drug overdose; every day, the CEO of Goldman Sachs makes $65,000; over 30,000 of us die of gun violence annually; and while we live, most of us are treading water so hard we don't have time to draw breath.

There is a kind of holy rage, a rage at what is and its profound paucities, that can lead to visionary ideas. This is a rage that can be channeled into a yearning to break open stagnant and foul systems and replace them with better ones, a rage born of pain and empathetic pain, a rage at the suffering of the world -- the terrible things happening around us that Fyodor Dostoevsky once called ""unavenged tears.""

To build greatly in America, one must recognize with the appropriate and unsparing fury the quiet horrors unfolding in suburban houses and on street corners and apartment buildings and rural towns within it. To build greatly, one must bank a great reserve of rage in one's chest, ready to harness it to break what must be broken, and to build good out of the wreck.

When Americans say they are ready for someone new in 2020, perhaps what they need, what they want, is someone capable of inspiring a new and necessary fire in their bellies. Perhaps there is someone capable of surveying the sagging, leech-coated mass of government as it is and imagining what it could be instead. And not the small, petty and ineffectual rage of racism, whose cynical uses improve not a single life, but the bigger and more powerful rage that can carry a polity from sorrow to something better, something entirely new.

425,daily mail online,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6545969/Elizabeth-Warren-slammed-social-media-live-Instagram-video-chugs-beer.html,"Warren announced she was formed an 'exploratory committee' and released a video highlighting family ties to Oklahoma

Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts is being widely criticized on Tuesday for transparently pandering to millennials by posting a live video Q&A on Instagram while chugging on a beer.

The 69-year-old Warren cracked open a beer on-camera on an Instagram livestream on New Year's Eve, and took questions from followers.

The seemingly-spontaneous video channeled similar social-media efforts by former Texas Senate candidate Beto O'Rourke and incoming New York Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, following Warren's announcement Monday that she is forming an exploratory committee for a 2020 run.

Sen. Warren said she and her husband watch Casablanca together every New Year's Eve

The Instagram livestream echoed similar down-the-lens efforts by O'Rouke and Ocasio-Cortez

After taking questions for a while the Senator said: 'Hold on a second -- I'm gonna get me a beer,' before walked out of view of the camera and returning bottle in hand

'I'm here in my kitchen, uh, and um, I thought maybe we'd just take some questions and I'd see what I can do,' Warren began as she looked into a camera apparently set up on a countertop.

She continued: 'It's been kind of an amazing day. So, today, I, um, got up early this morning, and, uh, talked to a bunch of folks on the phone, and then went outside and talked to the press -- and this is our house, and has been for a long time, and there are all these reporters, and trucks, and everybody outside the house.'

Shortly afterwards she said: 'Hold on a second -- I'm gonna get me a beer,' and walked out of view of the camera.

Warren, who has a proven track record as a small-dollar fundraiser, announced upon returning that she has already received donations from individuals in all 50 states, the District, and Puerto Rico, adding: 'It really has been an exciting day,' she said.

She told followers she and her husband would be following their usual New Year's Eve routine: 'We watch Casablanca, we get some good food ... and, um, we sit there upstairs and we watch Casablanca.'

She added the movie fills her with hope.

Ocasio-Cortez, 29, used Instagram stories and livestreams during her run last year to connect with her supporters. O'Rourke often broadcast himself cooking at home during his failed bid to unseat Ted Cruz in Texas.

'Looks like we have candidates shamelessly copying [Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez] by doing kitchen Instagram videos,' tweeted Laura Wilson

'Either Democrats think 12-year-olds vote or they realize their base is stupid and votes for style over substance,' tweeted one Twitter user

'It's impossible to take Elizabeth Warren seriously,' tweeted Lee Border. 'What a joke!'

'Elizabeth Warren took a moment out of her ""I'm just a regular gal"" video to go get a beer, crack it open and drink it...The hypocrisy is astounding,' tweeted a Twitter user

Warren was mocked for trying to appeal to younger voters with her Instagram video

Trump supporters on Twitter hit out at Warren for 'not [setting] good examples for them'

Other Twitter users said Warren drinking beer was ironic given that Democrats thought Brett Kavanaugh wasn't fit to be a Supreme Court Justice

Kavanaugh was confirmed to the Supreme Court after a bitter battle in which his drinking habits and an alleged rape were at the center of the debate

Journalist Michael Tracey tweeted: 'Oh my god every 2020 presidential candidate is going to livestream their personal lives non-stop like insecure teens. Happy frickin new year.'

But Warren's appeal to young voters struck many as inauthentic given her personality.

'Elizabeth Warren seems more like a chardonnay senator than a beer senator,' Boston University politics professor Tobe Berkovitz told The Boston Herald.

'It's just sort of trying too hard ... and people have pretty good radar for that sort of thing.'

Ryan Williams, a Republican strategist, said: 'She's never really made this type of appeal.

'She's nervous about newer younger faces in the Democratic party.

'She's making a pretty desperate attempt to make it look like she's cool.'

The reaction on social media was similarly critical.

'Looks like we have candidates shamelessly copying [Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez] by doing kitchen Instagram videos,' tweeted Laura Wilson.

'Either Democrats think 12-year-olds vote or they realize their base is stupid and votes for style over substance,' tweeted another Twitter user.

'It's impossible to take Elizabeth Warren seriously,' tweeted Lee Border. 'What a joke!'

'Elizabeth Warren took a moment out of her ""I'm just a regular gal"" video to go get a beer, crack it open and drink it...The hypocrisy is astounding,' tweeted a Twitter user.

Other Twitter users said Warren drinking beer was ironic given that Democrats thought Brett Kavanaugh wasn't fit to be a Supreme Court Justice.

Kavanaugh was confirmed to the bench after a bitter battle during which a woman came forward to accuse him of attempted rape during a high school party more than 30 years ago.

Journalist Michael Tracey tweeted: 'Oh my god every 2020 presidential candidate is going to livestream their personal lives non-stop like insecure teens. Happy frickin new year.'

Warren is the first candidate to take the major step toward a run in what is expected to be a crowded field.

Tonight's Instagram effort by Senator Warren may have been inspired by social media videos by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez

Ocasio-Cortez's communications director told Rolling Stone his candidate thought social media had 'more capacity for transparency and just to be herself'.

President Donald Trump said on Monday that he would 'love to run' against Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, though one would have to 'ask her psychiatrist' if she has a chance to win.

It was unclear what Trump meant by the comment, which he made during an interview on the Fox News Channel on Monday.

'I wish her well, I'd love to run against her,' the President told Fox News after Warren announced that she was forming an exploratory committee - the first step which indicates a plan to eventually run for the White House.

Trump then mentioned the controversy over a DNA test which Warren took to prove that she is of Native American origin.

'She did very badly in proving that she was of Indian heritage,' Trump said.

'That didn't work out too well. I think [Fox News reporter Pete Hegseth] ha[s] more than she does, and maybe I do too, and I have nothing.

'So we'll see how she does.'

When Trump was asked if she can win, he replied: 'Well, I don't know, you'd have to ask her psychiatrist.'

Warren dodged questions on Monday about her biggest political liabilities as she jumped headfirst into the 2020 Democratic presidential primary process.

In announcing the formation of a presidential exploratory committee, Warren staked out the first significant territory in what will likely be a crowded field of Democrats itching for a swing at Trump.

President Donald Trump said on Monday that he would 'love to run' against Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, though one would have to 'ask her psychiatrist' if she has a chance to win

But she showed no sign she's ready to overcome the self-inflected scandal that has dogged her for years: her questionable claim of American Indian ancestry.

The result was an unsteady performance that none of the three major cable news networks broadcast live from beginning to end.

Asked in her first question as a candidate-in-waiting how she will respond to Democrats who worry that her slow-motion ancestry gaffe had left her too vulnerable to be electable, Warren defaulted to talking points.

'I'm in this fight because I understand what's happening to working families,' she said outside her home near Boston, standing alongside her husband Bruce Mann.

Warren spoke to reporters with her husband Bruce (left) at her side, after announcing she has formed an exploratory committee to run for president in 2020

The first question from a reporter as she entered the 2020 fray was about her electability given her Native American DNA scandal - and she avoided answering it

Trump has long been critical of Warren for claiming to have Cherokee ancestry, a move the president claims gave her preferential treatment in university hiring at Harvard and the University of Pennsylvania.

Warren conceded this month that she is 'not a person of color,' following her embarrassing October release of DNA test data that concluded her proportion of American Indian blood might be as small as 1 part in 1,024 - lower than average European-Americans.

She sidestepped a separate question on Monday about whether her far-left brand of populism will polarize American voters, denying her meaningful support outside the liberal northeast U.S. and California.

Instead she acknowledged only that CEOs and investment bankers won't like her.

'The problem we've got right now in Washington is that it works great for those who have money, to buy influence,' said Warren, 69. 'And I'm fighting against that, and you bet it's going to make a lot of people unhappy.'

The 69-year-old Democrat would not, however, rule out accepting help from super PACs built with their political contributions.

'Would you take support from super PACs,' a reporter asked.

Despite a crush of TV cameras covering Warren's announcement and her short Q&A with reporters, none of the three big cable TV news networks broadcast the entire event live

Warren, pictured walking away after the short press availability, said she's no fan of super PACs or the billionaire who fund them, but didn't rule out accepting their help in 2020

How she announced: Elizabeth Warren used New Year's Eve morning to make her presidential move in a video recorded in her kitchen but slickly produced

A flustered Warren said only that 'I don't think we ought to be running campaigns that are funded by billionaires, whether it goes through super PACs or their own money that they're spending.'

That fell short of a pledge to shun their help as she runs for the White House.

'I've already received donations from all 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico,' she boasted, before revealing that she would spend New Year's Eve with her husband doing what they always do: watching the 1942 film 'Casablanca.'

Trump aides licked their chops and laughed as they anticipated a battle between the president and the ultra-liberal swashbuckler he regularly mocks as 'Pocahontas.'

A Trump administration official with knowledge of the president's thinking said Monday that Warren 'will go down in flames,' and cracked a subtle Native American joke.

'She's going to somehow ride her far-left platform into the White House?' the official asked.

'How?'

'It's a dream come true,' said a second official, adding a fond hope that Connecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal would follow Warren into the race.

'Can we get Blumenthal to run too? More phony Democrats, please,' said that official.

She's (almost) running: Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren used New Year's Eve to announce she is setting up an exploratory committee for a 2020 bid

President Donald Trump has said he would love to face Warren, and has already spent two years publicly mocking her to soften the ground

Trump has similarly weaponized Blumenthal's past missteps, turning his military career into a case of stolen valor because he has falsely claimed to have fought in Vietnam.

Blumenthal served in uniform as a U.S. Marine reservist for six years but spent the war thousands of miles from harm's way.

Warren's New Year's Eve launch guaranteed she had the nation's political spotlight largely to herself.

'America's middle class is under attack,' the 69-year-old Massachusetts Democrat said in a launch video.

'How did we get here? Billionaires and big corporations decided they wanted more of the pie. And they enlisted politicians to cut them a bigger slice.'

She tried to strike a uniting tone, declaring that 'no matter what our differences, most of us want the same thing: 'to be able to work hard, play by the same set of rules and take care of the people we love. That's what I'm fighting for.'

The Republican National Committee blasted out a scathing reply.

Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said that Warren 'couldn't be more out of touch. With her lack of support from voters - including in her home state - on top of her phony claim to minority status, now that she is formally running Americans will see her for what she is: another extreme far-left obstructionist and a total fraud.'

Connecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal is another liberal Democrat who Trump aides would like to see enter the 2020 contest, because of his false claims to have fought in Vietnam

On the blocks: In an email to supporters, Warren said she'd more formally announce a campaign plan early in 2019. She can now raise money for a run

Warren burst onto the national scene a decade ago during the financial crisis with calls for greater consumer protections.

She quickly became one of the party's more prominent liberals even as she sometimes fought with Obama administration officials over their response to the market turmoil.

Now, as a likely presidential contender, she is making an appeal to the party's base. Her video notes the economic challenges facing people of color along with images of a women's march and Warren's participation at an LGBT event.

In an email to supporters, Warren said she'd more formally announce a campaign plan early in 2019.

Warren is the most prominent Democrat yet to make a move toward a presidential bid and has long been a favorite target of President Donald Trump.

In mid-December, former Obama housing chief Julian Castro also announced a presidential exploratory committee, which legally allows potential candidates to begin raising money. Outgoing Maryland Rep. John Delaney is the only Democrat so far to have formally announced a presidential campaign.

But that's likely to change quickly in the new year as other leading Democrats take steps toward White House runs.

Greatest hits: Trump is likely to make use of his previous assault on Elizabeth Warren's claims of Native American roots, which he stepped up in the wake of her DNA test

Warren enters a Democratic field that's shaping up as the most crowded in decades, with many of her Senate colleagues openly weighing their own campaigns, as well as governors, mayors and other prominent citizens.

One of her most significant competitors could be Sen. Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent who is eyeing another presidential run harnessing the same populist rhetoric.

She must also move past the widely panned October DNA test stunt meant to bolster her claim to Native American heritage. Instead, the use of a genetic test to prove her ethnicity emboldened Trump's taunts of her as 'Pocahontas.'

There was no direct mention of the controversy, or of Trump, in Monday's video. It did include images of the president and his inner-circle current and former aides who her base most loves to hate: Kellyanne Conway, Stephen Miller and Steve Bannon.

Warren has the benefit of higher name recognition than many others in the Democratic mix for 2020, thanks to her years as a prominent critic of Wall Street who originally conceived of what became the government's Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

She now faces an arduous battle to raise money and capture Democratic primary voters' attention before Iowa casts its first vote in more than a year.

She has an advantage in the $12.5 million left over from her 2018 re-election campaign that she could use for a presidential run.

Warren's campaign is likely to revolve around the same theme she's woven into speeches and policy proposals in recent years: battling special interests, paying mind to the nexus between racial and economic inequities.

'America's middle class is under attack,' Warren said in the video.

'How did we get here? Billionaires and big corporations decided they wanted more of the pie. And they enlisted politicians to cut them a fatter slice.'

426,daily mail online,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6496973/Trump-admits-trade-war-China-takes-credit-economic-slowdown.html,"President Donald Trump took credit for China's economic slowdown on Friday after Beijing acknowledged that retail sales and industrial production were down for the month.

The data is putting a squeeze on China, the president asserted, and Beijing is eager to make a deal.

'China just announced that their economy is growing much slower than anticipated because of our Trade War with them. They have just suspended U.S. Tariff Hikes. U.S. is doing very well. China wants to make a big and very comprehensive deal. It could happen, and rather soon!' Trump tweeted, admitting that he's in a trade war with the nation.

The president boasted on Thursday about $11 billion in tax penalties that the U.S. has raked in since he decided to start a trade fight with Beijing.

Beijing is struggling under the weight of his tariffs, Trump said, which have brought in billions in the four months since he imposed them.

'China's economy if it's in trouble, it's only in trouble because of me,' he contended in a Thursday interview.

However China is also the third largest export market for the U.S., so a slow-down there could take a toll on U.S. businesses and export-related jobs, or contribute to a global financial cooling which could harm the nation's economic expansion.

Trump said the spat is not hurting the United States, using low inflation as a marker, even as he acknowledged that the Dow had totally lost the gains he took credit for in 2017.

'Now let's take a little bit off the table and fix it because we cannot continue to lose $500 billion a year to China,' he said on Fox News.

President Donald Trump boasted about $11 billion in tax penalties that the U.S. has raked in since he decided to start a trade fight with Beijing

It took Trump two tries to get his message out as he wanted to, however. The president's initial tweet said China 'just announce the there economy,' an incorrect use of the word 'their,' along with another error.

Ten minutes later, he deleted it and sent out another tweet that 'China just announced that their economy' is growing. However he still capitalized 'Trade War' and 'Tariff Hikes' for unknown reasons.

The Dow was up slightly on Thursday at roughly 60 points, but had stabilized from the dips it took amid discord at the White House over a 90-day trade truce.

'Our economy is soaring. Our jobs are soaring, our businesses are doing tremendously. Apple just announced they're going to be investing billions of dollars in this country. That just happened,' Trump told Fox News host Harris Faulkner.

Trump said his trade war with China is 'not even affecting' the United States as he implored the Federal Reserve to stop raising rates. 'President Obama, he had zero interest rates. Anybody can make money with zero interest rates, he asserted.

The president maintained that he and Chinese President Xi Jinping had a 'fantastic dinner' and said that he has great respect for the authoritarian leader who is 'not a capitulator.'

'Very productive conversations going on with China! Watch for some important announcements!' he tweeted earlier in the week

But Trump also declared himself this month to be a 'tariffs man' and said he'd be just fine doubling or even quadrupling $200 billion in penalties on imports from China at the end of a three-month window for talks.

He later insisted that he was sincere in his interest in striking a trade accord with Beijing, just as he believes that Xi genuinely wants to broker one.

Senior White House officials meanwhile shared differing messages on the cable news networks about what Trump would do at the end of the three-month period if he and Xi had not reached a deal.

Larry Kudlow, director of the National Economic Council, said the president could grant China an extension if talks were headed in the right direction.

White House Trade Council head Peter Navarro said the same day that Trump would immediately resume a hefty tariffs schedule, if China balks at an agreement that protects American interests.

Trump has repeatedly reassured investors that he is smoothing things over with China

Beijing is struggling under the weight of his tariffs, Trump said, which have brought in billions in the four months since he imposed them

Trump said the spat is not using low inflation as a marker, even as he acknowledged that the Dow had totally lost the gains he took credit for in 2017

Conflicting claims among Trump's chief economic advisers have sent shivers through the business world.

The arrest of the heiress to a top Chinese telecommunications firm last week further intensified concerns that the ceasefire would be short-lived.

A weaker than expected November jobs report was also a factor in the market's performance. Analysts had hoped for 200,000 or more new jobs heading into the holiday season, but the Labor Department put the monthly number at 155,000.

The news wasn't entirely bad for Trump, as the Chinese confirmed a trade agreement was in the works.

'The teams of both sides are now having smooth communications and good cooperation with each other. We are full of confidence that an agreement can be reached within the next 90 days,' they said.

Authorities arrested Huawei heiress Meng Wanzhou at the Vancouver airport on Dec. 1 on undisclosed charges that are said to relate to a violation of United States sanctions against Iran.

Chinese state media characterized the arrest as profit-motivated, and indemnified the move as a 'despicable' abuse of international law.

China is expressing confidence that it will strike a trade deal with the U.S. after Xi Jinping (left) and Donald Trump (right) met in Argentina

'Obviously, Washington is resorting to a despicable rogue's approach as it cannot stop Huawei's 5G advance in the market, an editorial in the sate-run Global Times said.

The arrest was linked to the negotiations with China to reform intellectual property rules and open up the technology sector in China to American-made goods, however the White House claims they are unrelated.

'The two issues are totally separate,' Navarro, the chairman of the president's trade council, told CNN.

National Security Advisor John Bolton admitted that alleged intellectual property theft is one of the United States' chief complaints about China.

'You should not turn a blind eye when states, as a matter of national policy, are stealing intellectual property from their competitors,' Bolton said.

Trump tried to calm markets on Wednesday, saying he believed Xi's reassurances that a trad edeal was coming

He admitted during the interview with NPR, 'Huawei is one company we've been concerned about. There are others, as well.'

Trump said last week that he and Xi would 'probably' have a deal at the end of a 90-day timetable for talks that began at the G20 as he unexpectedly declared himself against free trade.

'Unless extended, they will end 90 days from the date of our wonderful and very warm dinner with President Xi in Argentina,' Trump asserted. 'China is supposed to start buying Agricultural product and more immediately. President Xi and I want this deal to happen, and it probably will.'

He then proclaimed himself to be a 'tariffs man' in direct contradiction to his own White House's assertions that Trump is a free-trader.

'We are right now taking in $billions in Tariffs. MAKE AMERICA RICH AGAIN,' Trump said in messages. 'Let the negotiations begin. MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!'

A series of laws gives extraordinary emergency powers to the president -- in a true emergency. Who decides what's a true emergency? In the first instance, the president does. In the end, the courts do.

Traditionally, the courts have cut the president a wide berth when it comes to allowing extra-legal powers during a genuine national emergency. Lincoln suspended habeas corpus during the Civil War, when the South had invaded parts of the Union. Roosevelt, with no justification, was able to incarcerate patriotic Japanese-American citizens during World War II.

Courts upheld both. In a less urgent circumstance, when Truman tried to seize the steel mills to avert a strike in 1952 during the Korean War, the Supreme Court overruled him.

If you want a chilling account of the kinds of executive power that a president can lawfully wield during an emergency, have a look at Liza Goitein's authoritative piece in The Atlantic. To some extent, Congress has been willing to rein in a president's use of emergency powers, but only rarely.

Trump, presumably, could declare a national security emergency, reprogram money already appropriated, and order the Pentagon or the DHS to build the wall. Of course, it's wildly far-fetched to characterize Mexican immigration as a national emergency warranting this sort of extraordinary authority. Illegal cross-border immigration has been declining. The real crisis is Trump's failure to have of any sort of reasonable refugee policy.

Should Trump attempt to order a wall built based on his emergency powers, he would immediately be sued by members of Congress. The Democratic House would surely pass a law or a resolution of disapproval while the Republican Senate would be inclined to back the president. However, Trump's move would be massively unpopular, both as policy and as an extra-legal power grab. That might give some Republican senators pause. It's not hard to imagine the defection of several Republican senators, and a joint resolution blocking the wall. Whether Trump has to obey that resolution would also end up in court.

And here's where the story gets really interesting. Any normal Supreme Court would find, as the 1952 Court did in the Youngstown Sheet and Tube case, that the president had exceeded his authority.

But this Supreme Court is far from normal. It has been a toady for far-right ideology and Republican policies. While lower courts overruled Trump's orders limiting migration from predominantly Muslim countries as a patent violation of the First Amendment's ban on religious discrimination, the Supreme Court upheld it by a 5-4 vote.

However, there are growing signs that Chief Justice Roberts has had a bellyful of Trump's antics, and that he is looking to salvage the reputation of one of the few institutions of government that retains a semblance of legitimacy.

Even before Trump, Roberts voted with the court's four liberals to uphold most of the Affordable Care Act. When Trump referred sneeringly last year to an ""Obama Judge,"" Roberts declared indignantly (and somewhat disingenuously), ""We do not have Obama judges or Trump judges, Bush judges or Clinton judges ... What we have is an extraordinary group of dedicated judges doing their level best to do equal right to those appearing before them.""

If only. Trump shot right back:

Since then, Roberts sided with the court's liberals on two occasions in December. He refused to allow High Court review of a lower court decision blocking state efforts to ban Planned Parenthood from Medicaid.

He also voted with the liberals to deny review of an appellate court decision that had blocked Trump's effort to deny asylum reviews to refugees who cross the border illegally and then turn themselves in.

What would Roberts do if Trump spuriously asserted emergency powers to order the building of a wall in defiance of the usual legislative and budgetary progress?

This has little to do with ideology (where Roberts is a faithful conservative) and everything to do with incipient autocracy -- an area where Roberts has been discovering his inner constitutionalist."

'Facebook, Twitter and Google are so biased toward the Dems it is ridiculous!,' he tweeted. 'Twitter, in fact, has made it much more difficult for people to join @realDonaldTrump. They have removed many names & greatly slowed the level and speed of increase. They have acknowledged-done NOTHING!,' he tweeted.

The presidency's litany of complaints comes in the wake of an intelligence report to the Senate that outlined some of the ways Russians used social media to boost Trump's candidacy during the 2016 election.

President Donald Trump slammed Facebook, Twitter and Google with a complaint that they are 'so biased toward the Dems it is ridiculous'

Trump went on to complain - without proof - Twitter limits his followers

It's unclear what the president meant by his accusation that Twitter has made it harder for him to gain followers.

His account has more than 56 million people following it. A chart from trackalytics shows the trend line on his followers going upward and that the president gained 10 million new followers this year alone.

Twitter has moved to remove so-called 'bots' - fake accounts some people and organizations purchase to make it look like they have huge followings - from its platform.

Shortly before the midterm election, the social media company deleted more than 10,000 bot accounts that were masquerading as Democrats.

But Trump and fellow Republicans have complained for months about tech companies, particularly that google search results are biased against conservatives.

Google chief executive Sundar Pichai defended his company's search practices when he testified before Congress earlier this month.

'Our algorithms have no notion of political sentiment,' Pichai said in defense of Google's search engine, which is the most used in the world.

'We approach our work without any political bias,' he noted.

Trump's tweet comes as a new report on Russian social media tactics to sow discord in the U.S. before and after the elections reveals efforts to stir up sentiment among African American voters was Moscow's leading tactic.

The Russian Internet Research Agency purchased a total of 1,087 ads targeting African American politic and culture and black identity and nationalism during the campaign, according to a bombshell analysis of the Russian influence operation that investigators have yet to fully examine.

Trump has over 6 million followers on Twitter

Charts show how his number of followers has risen

Facebook's ad program allowed purchasers to select users with certain interests, like Malcolm X - a capability the St. Petersburg-based outfit relied on to slice up the American electorate.

The Kremlin-linked Internet Research Agency, which has been charged with interfering in the elections, relied on Facebook, Google and Twitter and other platforms for targeted messaging, according to the report for the Senate Intelligence Committee.

It used words, videos and images to persuade voters to back Trump, according to a report by Oxford University's Computational Propaganda Project and network analysis company Graphika.

It outlines repeated Russian efforts to divide and target black voters - and even a program to set up hotlines to get people to confess problems that could be potential fodder for blackmail.

The tactics reached tens of millions of Americans during the multi-year durations, and targeted key interest groups known to impact U.S. elections.

U.S. intelligence assessed and prosecutors have charged that the outfit was financed by a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin. Many of the ad purchases were in rubles. Early posts before 2014 were in Russian, but English language social media activity jumped that year, and continued even into 2017.

The report identifies a Russian focus on targeting black voters

Online activity focused on police violence against blacks

Russians tried ginning up support online using multiple campaigns, including Blacktivist

Other ads targeted conservatives and particular regions

The Russians sought to boost Trump and drive down turnout among potential Hillary Clinton supporters

The Russians set up 30 Facebook pages on black Americans, while another 10 YouTube channels focused on police violence against blacks and put out 571 videos on the subject.

The efforts to target African Americans and suppress the black vote came during a 2016 election where Hillary Clinton won an overwhelming share of support among African American vote.

According to the report: 'Messaging to African Americans sought to divert their political energy away from established political institutions by preying on anger with structural inequalities faced by African Americans, including police violence, poverty, and disproportionate levels of incarceration.'

It continued: 'These campaigns pushed a message that the best way to advance the cause of the African American community was to boycott the election and focus on other issues instead. This often happened through the use of repetitive slogans. This accounts for the majority of content in the dataset that targeted this group.'

The Russians also went after other demographic slices: Muslims, southerners, Texans, and more.

The campaign didn't stop after the trolls got caught, and in fact peaked in 2017, according to the report.

In one notably callous tactics, Russians set up hotlines to get people to call in and talk about their sex problems and other personal issues - a source for possible blackmail material, NBC reported.

Other trickery enticed Americans to take political actions.

On Twitter, English-language posts from Russia shot up in late 2015.

After a Russian 'Black Matters' Facebook page got shut down, the IRA simply created new renamed campaigns to push its message. 'Cops kill black kids. Are you sure that your son won't be the next?' went one aimed at African Americans.

Activity spiked around major political debates between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton.

Broken down by state, a leading 265 ads targeted Missouri.

Researchers even found that racial geography, more than the the Electoral College, was a driver in ad purchases.

'We believe the targeting had more to do with race than a state's role in the Electoral College or status as a swing state. For example, African Americans in Ferguson, MO were targeted for the 'Black Matters' campaign. African Americans in Baltimore, MD and Oakland, CA were targeted for the 'Blacktivist' campaign. Texan cities were targeted for campaigns focusing on patriotism and pro-gun politics,' according to the report.

Russia used nearly every social media platform to drum up support for Donald Trump in the 2016 election, the report has found.

'What is clear is that all of the messaging clearly sought to benefit the Republican Party - and specifically Donald Trump,' the report says.

'Trump is mentioned most in campaigns targeting conservatives and right-wing voters, where the messaging encouraged these groups to support his campaign. The main groups that could challenge Trump were then provided messaging that sought to confuse, distract and ultimately discourage members from voting.'

The report was presented to the Senate Intelligence Committee. The bipartisan panel released it publicly on Monday morning.

It tracks observations like an increase in activity on election day in 2016 and during general election debates between Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton. Activity by the group spiked the most at the end of the year when Barack Obama announced that he was opening up probes into Russia's attempt to hack the election.

Among its findings were that conservative users 'were actively encouraged to get behind Trump's campaign' while other users were 'encouraged to boycott the election, abstain from voting for Clinton, or to spread cynicism about participating in the election in general.'

Committee chairman Richard Burr, a North Carolina Republican, said the data 'demonstrates how aggressively Russia sought to divide Americans by race, religion and ideology, and how the IRA actively worked to erode trust in our democratic institutions.'

'Most troublingly, it shows that these activities have not stopped,' he assessed. 'As we work to address these threats, these reports are proof positive that one of the most important things we can do is increase information sharing between the social media companies who can identify disinformation campaigns and the third-party experts who can analyze them.'

The committee's vice chair, Mark Warner, a Virginia Democrat, likewise said the report revealed that Russian election meddling was worse than previously revealed.

'This should stand as a wake up call to us all that none of us are immune from this threat, and it is time to get serious in addressing this challenge,' he said. 'That is going to require some much-needed and long-overdue guardrails when it comes to social media. I hope these reports will spur legislative action in the Congress and provide additional clarity to the American public about Russia's assault on our democracy.'

Researchers also noted that the data includes evidence of sloppiness by the Russians that could have led to earlier detection, including the use of Russia's currency, the ruble, to buy ads.

House Intelligence ranking member Adam Schiff, a California Democrat, said in a statement after the release of the report that social media companies share in the blame and must be held accountable.

'Their reluctance to conduct and publish such deep analysis themselves, to actively and meaningfully collaborate with one another to compare and publicize data and information to build out the extent of the IRA's efforts, and to otherwise make available to outside research groups comprehensive, uniform access to the data, have made our task far more difficult than it should have been,' he scolded.

Schiff said the companies, which he did not call out by name, should be doing more to keep their users and the public aware of disinformation operations.

It comes after President Trump and his attorney unleashed a fresh series of attacks people investigating him, questioning their integrity while categorically ruling out the possibility of a presidential interview with the special counsel for the Department of Justice's probe into Russia.

Trump and lawyer Rudy Giuliani used Twitter and television interviews Sunday to deliver a series of broadsides against special counsel Robert Mueller and federal prosecutors in New York.

Giuliani said he was 'disgusted' by the tactics used by Mueller in his probe into Russian election interference, including in securing guilty pleas from the president's former national security adviser Michael Flynn on a charge of lying to federal investigators.

Trump, Giuliani said, would not submit to an interview by Mueller's team.

'They're a joke,' Giuliani told 'Fox News Sunday. 'Over my dead body, but, you know, I could be dead.'

The special counsel, who is investigating possible ties between the Trump campaign and Russia, has continued to request an interview with the president.

Last month, the White House sent written answers in response to the special counsel's questions about possible collusion. The White House has resisted answering questions on possible obstruction of justice.

Giuliani sarcastically said that the only thing left to ask the president was about 'several unpaid parking tickets that night, back in 1986, '87 that haven't been explained.'

If the president officially refuses an interview request, the special counsel's team could theoretically seek to subpoena him to compel his testimony. Such a move would almost certainly trigger an immediate court fight.

The Supreme Court has never directly ruled on whether a president can be subpoenaed for testimony in a criminal investigation, though the justices have said that a president can be forced to turn over records that have been subpoenaed and can be forced to answer questions as part of a lawsuit.

The special counsel's investigation has spun out charges and strong-armed guilty pleas from Trump underlings while keeping in suspense whether the president - 'Individual-1,' in Mueller's coded legalese - will end up accused of criminal behavior himself.

This past week, his legal exposure grew as his former personal attorney, Michael Cohen, was sentenced to three years in prison after admitting he issued hush-money payments to women who alleged sexual trysts with Trump. Prosecutors and Cohen say he acted at the president's direction, which Trump and Giuliani deny.

Trump and Giuliani have repeatedly tried to paint Cohen as untrustworthy, with the former New York City mayor calling him a 'pathological liar.'

'Which is the truth?' Giuliani said of the competing stories from Trump and Cohen. 'I think I know what the truth is. Unless you're God, you'll never know what the truth is.'

Trump and Giuliani have also accused prosecutors of intimidating the president's associates into making false claims.

'Remember, Michael Cohen only became a 'Rat' after the FBI did something which was absolutely unthinkable & unheard of until the Witch Hunt was illegally started,' Trump tweeted. 'They BROKE INTO AN ATTORNEY'S OFFICE!'

It comes after President Trump and his attorney (pictured) unleashed a fresh series of attacks people investigating him, questioning their integrity while categorically ruling out the possibility of a presidential interview with the special counsel

It was not a break-in. The FBI executed a search warrant obtained from a judge in conducting a raid in April on Cohen's home, office and hotel room and seizing records on a variety of matters, among them a $130,000 payment made to porn actress Stormy Daniels by Cohen. The application for the warrant was approved high in the Justice Department.

In response to Trump's tweet, former FBI Director James Comey tweeted, 'This is from the President of our country, lying about the lawful execution of a search warrant issued by a federal judge. Shame on Republicans who don't speak up at this moment - for the FBI, the rule of law, and the truth.

Prosecutors have said Trump directed Cohen to arrange the payments to buy the silence of Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal in the run-up to the 2016 campaign. Federal prosecutors in New York say the payments amounted to illegal campaign contributions because they were made at the height of election season to keep voters from learning of Trump's alleged infidelities.

Giuliani has argued the payments were made to protect Trump's family, not to influence the election.

'If there's another purpose, it's not a campaign contribution,' Giuliani told ABC. 'Suppose he tried to use campaign funds to pay Stormy Daniels. It wouldn't be illegal. These are not campaign contributions.'

The hush money wasn't initially reported on campaign finance documents and, in any case, far exceeded the legally acceptable amount for in-kind contributions. The federal limit on individual contributions is $2,700.

Trump (pictured) and Rudy Giuliani used Twitter and television interviews Sunday to deliver a series of broadsides against special counsel Robert Mueller and federal prosecutors in New York

Cohen also pleaded guilty to lying to investigators about the Trump Organization's goals to build a tower in Moscow. His representative, Lanny Davis, told CBS' 'Face the Nation' on Sunday that his written statement to Congress, which contained the lie, was published ahead of his testimony and Cohen then spoke to the White House.

'Not one person from the White House ever said, 'Don't lie,'' Davis said.

Rep. Elijah Cummings, the top Democrat on the House oversight committee and the likely chairman come January, said he wanted Cohen to testify before Congress about what he told prosecutors. Meanwhile, Trump's fellow Republican, Sen. Susan Collins of Maine, acknowledged on CNN that 'it was not a good week for President Trump' and urged 'that the special counsel be allowed to complete his investigation unimpeded.'

Trump compared his situation to one involving President Barack Obama's 2008 campaign. The Federal Election Commission docked the Obama campaign $375,000 for regulatory civil violations. The fines stemmed from the campaign's failure to report a batch of contributions, totaling nearly $1.9 million, on time in the final days of the campaign.

But legal analysts said the accusations against Trump could amount to a felony because they revolve around an alleged conspiracy to conceal payments from campaign contribution reports - and from voters.

It's unclear what federal prosecutors in New York will decide to do if they conclude that there is evidence that Trump himself committed a crime.

Trump has not yet laid out a detailed defense, though he could conceivably argue that the payments were made not for the purposes of advancing his campaign but rather to prevent salacious stories from emerging that would be personally humiliating to him and harm his marriage.

That argument was advanced by former Sen. John Edwards, a North Carolina Democrat, in a similar campaign finance case that went to trial in 2012. But that may be tougher for Trump than it was for Edwards given the proximity of the president's payment to the election - timing that, on its face, suggests a link between the money and his political ambitions.

Edwards was acquitted on one count of accepting illegal campaign contributions, but jurors couldn't reach a verdict on the five remaining counts, including conspiracy and making false statements."
429,daily mail online,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-6566149/Can-Trump-use-emergency-powers-build-border-wall.html,"A section of the steel wall on the US - Mexico border near San Diego, California

Facing stiff resistance from Congress, President Donald Trump has said he might use his emergency powers to construct hundreds of miles of wall on the southern border to prevent migrants from crossing into the United States illegally from Mexico.

Trump could indeed declare a national emergency, citing what the administration calls a ""crisis"" at the border, after nearly 103,000 people were detained in October and November after entering the country illegally.

But trying to build a wall in this way would face significant legal barriers.

- Trump does have emergency powers -

US President Donald Trump has hinted he could use his emergency powers to move ahead with construction of a wall on the US-Mexico border if Congress will not fund it

The National Emergencies Act allows the president to declare a national emergency, providing a specific reason for it.

That then allows the mobilization of hundreds of dormant emergency powers under other laws. Those can permit the White House to declare martial law, suspend civil liberties, expand the military, seize property, and restrict trade, communications and financial transactions.

But the powers are not unlimited, and can be blocked by Congress and the courts. During the Korean War in 1952, President Harry Truman sought to take over US steel factories to keep them producing in the face of a planned national strike by industry workers.

Steel companies took the case to the Supreme Court, which ruled in their favor, saying the president's emergency powers did not allow him to seize privately-owned plants to avert a strike.

- All presidents use the National Emergencies Act -

Central American migrants climb the US-Mexico border fence to take a look before trying to cross from Tijuana to San Diego on New Year's Eve

Every recent president has used the NEA, and more than two dozen states of emergency are currently active, renewed annually.

President George W. Bush invoked it after the September 11, 2001 Al-Qaeda attacks to be able to expand and ready the military beyond what was budgeted, and to undertake secret surveillance and employ interrogation methods on detainees widely denounced as torture.

President Barack Obama tapped the NEA to declare an emergency in 2009 over the swine flu threat, giving authorities and hospitals extra powers to act quickly against the outbreak.

Most often, the NEA has been used in actions against other countries.

One NEA emergency in place since 1979 has restricted trade with Iran. Another, dating to 2006, blocks property of people who were deemed to be undermining democracy in Belarus.

- Powers, funds limited -

If Trump declares a national emergency, he could deploy more manpower to the border. But to build a wall, he would still have to find billions of dollars to fund it.

One emergency law permits the president to order ""military construction projects"" using funds already available in the military budget.

But could the wall be called a ""military"" project? There are strong restrictions on the US military and its funding being deployed for domestic, non-defense purposes, though emergency laws sometimes permit it.

Moreover, building the wall will require taking control of privately owned land that abuts much of the border, which could force years-long legal battles with landowners.

- Challenge from Congress -

The NEA gives Congress the right to immediately challenge a presidential emergency declaration.

Given that Congress has already declined to fund the wall, a challenge would likely quickly pass the Democratic House. Then the Republican-controlled Senate would have to decide whether they agree with the president's invocation of emergency powers to build a wall they haven't given him money for.

""That's a non-starter,"" senior Democratic Congressman Adam Schiff said Sunday.

""If Harry Truman couldn't nationalize the steel industry during wartime, this president doesn't have the power to declare an emergency and build a multibillion-dollar wall on the border."""

Special Counsel Robert Mueller on Tuesday asked a federal judge for more time before sentencing former Trump campaign aide Rick Gates because of his ongoing cooperation, suggesting the probe into Russian interference may still have a ways to go.

The latest request for more time before sentencing came in a joint filing by Mueller's office and Gates' lawyers to U.S. District Judge Amy Berman Jackson in Washington, who is overseeing the case.

In a request similar to one made to the judge in November, they cited Gates' cooperation with 'several ongoing investigations' in asking for another 60 days before they update the judge again about the case and whether it was time to move to sentencing.

Mueller's star witness: The special counsel says he does not want Rick Gates to be sentenced for at least another 60 days because he is co-operating with 'several ongoing investigations'

Heart of power: Rick Gates (second left) was deputy to Paul Manafort (right) when he ran the Trump campaign at the time of the 2016 Republican National Convention in Cleveland

The request to push the Gates' case into at least mid-March came amid a flurry of recent news reports suggesting that Mueller may be winding down his investigation, with a final report possibly being submitted in the coming weeks.

It was not clear which probes Gates is helping with, but he was deeply involved in running the Trump campaign's day-to-day operations and played a key role at the Republican National Convention where Donald Trump became the party's nominee.

Gates, a former business partner of Trump's former campaign chairman, Paul Manafort, stayed on in the campaign even after Manafort resigned in August 2016 over a controversy about cash payments from Ukraine, and also served on the presidential transition team.

Gates was a star witness over the summer in a high-profile trial of Manafort, after he had pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI and conspiracy against the United States in Mueller's probe in exchange for agreeing to cooperate with prosecutors under a deal that could lead to a reduced sentence.

Mueller is investigating whether there was collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia. U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that Moscow interfered in the 2016 presidential election.

Russia has denied it meddled. Trump has denied there was any collusion, and has called the special counsel's investigation a witch hunt.

ROBERT MUELLER'S PROBE SO FAR: EIGHT CONVICTIONS - INCLUDING THREE TOP TRUMP AIDES, A JAILED ATTORNEY AND 25 RUSSIANS ACCUSED

GUILTY: MICHAEL FLYNN

Pleaded guilty to making false statements in December 2017. Awaiting sentence

Flynn was President Trump's former National Security Advisor and Robert Mueller's most senior scalp to date. He previously served when he was a three star general as President Obama's director of the Defense Intelligence Agency but was fired.

He admitted to lying to special counsel investigators about his conversations with a Russian ambassador in December 2016. He has agreed to cooperate with the special counsel investigation.

GUILTY: MICHAEL COHEN

Pleaded guilty to eight counts including fraud and two campaign finance violations in August 2018. Pleaded guilty to further count of lying to Congress in November 2018. Sentenced to three years in prison and $2 million in fines and forfeitures in December 2018

Cohen was Trump's longtime personal attorney, starting working for him and the Trump Organization in 2007. He is the longest-serving member of Trump's inner circle to be implicated by Mueller. Cohen professed unswerving devotion to Trump - and organized payments to silence two women who alleged they had sex with the-then candidate: porn star Stormy Daniels and Playboy model Karen McDougal. He admitted that payments to both women were felony campaign finance violations - and admitted that he acted at the 'direction' of 'Candidate-1': Donald Trump.

He also admitted tax fraud by lying about his income from loans he made, money from taxi medallions he owned, and other sources of income, at a cost to the Treasury of $1.3 million.

And he admitted lying to Congress in a rare use of the offense. The judge in his case let him report for prison on March 6 and recommended he serve it in a medium-security facility close to New York City.

GUILTY: PAUL MANAFORT

Found guilty of eight charges of bank and tax fraud in August 2018. Pleaded guilty to two further charges. Awaiting sentence

Manafort worked for Trump's campaign from March 2016 and chaired it from June to August 2016, overseeing Trump being adopted as Republican candidate at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland. He is the most senior campaign official to be implicated by Mueller. Manafort was one of Washington D.C.'s longest-term and most influential lobbyists but in 2015, his money dried up and the next year he turned to Trump for help, offering to be his campaign chairman for free - in the hope of making more money afterwards. But Mueller unwound his previous finances and discovered years of tax and bank fraud as he coined in cash from pro-Russia political parties and oligarchs in Ukraine.

Manafort pleaded not guilty to 18 charges of tax and bank fraud but was convicted of eight counts. The jury was deadlocked on the other 10 charges. A second trial on charges of failing to register as a foreign agent is due in September.

GUILTY: RICK GATES

Pleaded guilty to conspiracy against the United States and making false statements in February 2018. Awaiting sentence

Gates was Manafort's former deputy at political consulting firm DMP International. He admitted to conspiring to defraud the U.S. government on financial activity, and to lying to investigators about a meeting Manafort had with a member of congress in 2013. As a result of his guilty plea and promise of cooperation, prosecutors vacated charges against Gates on bank fraud, bank fraud conspiracy, failure to disclose foreign bank accounts, filing false tax returns, helping prepare false tax filings, and falsely amending tax returns.

GUILTY AND JAILED: GEORGE PAPADOPOLOUS

Pleaded guilty to making false statements in October 2017. Sentenced to 14 days in September 2018, and reported to prison in November. Served 12 days and released on December 7, 2018

Papadopoulos was a member of Donald Trump's campaign foreign policy advisory committee. He admitted to lying to special counsel investigators about his contacts with London professor Josef Mifsud and Ivan Timofeev, the director of a Russian government-funded think tank.

He has agreed to cooperate with the special counsel investigation.

GUILTY AND JAILED: RICHARD PINEDO

Pleaded guilty to identity fraud in February 2018. Sentenced to a year in prison

Pinedo is a 28-year-old computer specialist from Santa Paula, California. He admitted to selling bank account numbers to Russian nationals over the internet that he had obtained using stolen identities.

He has agreed to cooperate with the special counsel investigation.

GUILTY AND JAILED: ALEX VAN DER ZWAAN

Pleaded guilty to making false statements in February 2018. He served a 30-day prison sentence earlier this year and was deported to the Netherlands on his release

Van der Zwaan is a Dutch attorney for Skadden Arps who worked on a Ukrainian political analysis report for Paul Manafort in 2012.

He admitted to lying to special counsel investigators about when he last spoke with Rick Gates and Konstantin Kilimnik.

GUILTY: W. SAMUEL PATTEN

Pleaded guilty in August 2018 to failing to register as a lobbyist while doing work for a Ukrainian political party. Awaiting sentence

Patten, a long-time D.C. lobbyist was a business partner of Paul Manafort. He pleaded guilty to admitting to arranging an illegal $50,000 donation to Trump's inauguration.

He arranged for an American 'straw donor' to pay $50,000 to the inaugural committee, knowing that it was actually for a Ukrainian businessman.

Neither the American or the Ukrainian have been named.

CHARGED: KONSTANTIN KILIMNIK

Indicted for obstruction of justice and conspiracy to obstruct justice. At large, probably in Russia

Kilimnik is a former employee of Manafort's political consulting firm and helped him with lobbying work in Ukraine. He is accused of witness tampering, after he allegedly contacted individuals who had worked with Manafort to remind them that Manafort only performed lobbying work for them outside of the U.S.

He has been linked to Russian intelligence and is currently thought to be in Russia - effectively beyond the reach of extradition by Mueller's team.

INDICTED: THE RUSSIANS

Twenty-five Russian nationals and three Russian entities have been indicted for conspiracy to defraud the United States. They remain at large in Russia

Two of these Russian nationals were also indicted for conspiracy to commit wire fraud and 11 were indicted for conspiracy to launder money. Fifteen of them were also indicted for identity fraud.

Vladimir Putin has ridiculed the charges. Russia effectively bars extradition of its nationals. The only prospect Mueller has of bringing any in front of a U.S. jury is if Interpol has their names on an international stop list - which is not made public - and they set foot in a territory which extradites to the U.S.

INDICTED: MICHAEL FLYNN'S BUSINESS PARTNERS

Bijan Kian (left), number two in now disgraced former national security adviser Mike Flynn's lobbying company, and the two's business partner Ekim Alptekin (right) were indicted for conspiracy to lobby illegally. Kian is awaiting trial, Alptekin is still to appear in court

Kian, an Iranian-American was arrested and appeared in court charged with a conspiracy to illegally lobby the U.S government without registering as a foreign agent. Their co-conspirator was Flynn, who is called 'Person A' in the indictment and is not charged, offering some insight into what charges he escaped with his plea deal.

Kian, vice-president of Flynn's former lobbying firm, is alleged to have plotted with Alptekin to try to change U.S. policy on an exiled Turkish cleric, Fethullah Gulen, who lives in Pennsylvania and who is accused by Turkey's strongman president Recep Tayyip Erdogan, of trying to depose him.

Erdogan's government wanted him extradited from the U.S. and paid Flynn's firm through Alptekin for lobbying, including an op-ed in The Hill calling for Gulen to be ejected. Flynn and Kian both lied that the op-ed was not paid for by the Turkish government.

The aggressive push by the Trump administration to tighten immigration policy has shown a significant increase in arrests and deportations in 2018, according to the latest data from U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

More than 256,000 people were deported from the U.S. in 2018, and ICE Deputy Director Ronald D. Vitiello announced that the agency detained 'a record number' of people in the country illegally, the Washington Post reported.

While up significantly, the figure still falls short of ICE's Enforcement and Removal Operations reporting 409,849 deported in 2012 at the peak of removals under the Obama administration.

In the past fiscal year ending in September, ICE reports the number of deported rose approximately 13 percent since 2017, with over half the number of individuals being convicted criminals and or awaiting criminal charges.

President Trump promised earlier this week that he would do 'whatever it takes' to improve security at the southern border. Deportation numbers are rising but they're still not at the high level of almost 410,000 removals in 2012 under President Obama

The agency additionally claimed 5,872 of those deported were confirmed or suspected gang members and 42 terrorism suspects.

The increases are a result of Trump's executive order to rescind previous immigration policy prioritizing deportations of those with criminal records or who pose a public safety threat, ICE officials claim according to the New York Times.

'It used to be that there was a sense that they were looking for people who had committed serious crimes,' Mary Bauer, deputy legal director for the Southern Poverty Law Center told the Post.

In fact, according to the agency's report, 54,000 DUIs were the largest number of criminal convictions of the more than 158,000 arrested. This was followed by 'dangerous drugs,' other traffic violations and immigration infractions.

Trump's push on border security includes a series of recent executive orders calling for family separation and detention and limiting asylum eligibility, along with his often promised wall. He vowed to do 'whatever it takes' regarding the issue on Thursday.

It was the following day that Jackeline Caal, 7, was identified as the Guatemalan girl who died of dehydration and shock while in Border Patrol custody.

Bauer notes that Trump has 'created a society of fear and terror' in immigrant communities during his crackdowns.

The agency's report also showed that the number of families and unaccompanied minors who were deported also increased with 2,711 traveling in families and 5,571 children removed from the U.S..

For ICE's part, Vitiello made a point that despite the increased numbers of deportations being produced by his agency, he would still welcome additional funding.

'With the continued surge and without congressional action to fund the agency at adequate levels, ICE may be forced to make difficult choices that could hamper our ability to fulfill our public safety or national security mission,' the deputy director stated."
432,daily mail online,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6544125/Elizabeth-Warren-cracks-open-beer-takes-questions-Presidential-run-video.html,"Monday Warren announced she was formed an 'exploratory committee' and released a video highlighting family ties to Oklahoma in an attempt to surmount her east-coast-elite image

Massachusetts Democratic Senator Elizabeth Warren cracked open a beer on-camera on an Instagram livestream on New Year's Eve, and took questions from followers.

The seemingly-spontaneous video channeled similar social-media efforts by former Texas Senate candidate Beto O'Rourke and incoming New York Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, following Warren's announcement Monday that she is forming an exploratory committee for a 2020 run.

She is the first candidate to take the major step toward a run in what is expected to be a crowded field.

'I'm here in my kitchen, uh, and um, I thought maybe we'd just take some questions and I'd see what I can do,' Warren, 69, began as she looked into a camera apparently set up on a countertop.

After taking questions for a while the Senator said: 'Hold on a second -- I'm gonna get me a beer,' before walked out of view of the camera and returning bottle in hand

The Instagram livestream echoed similar down-the-lens efforts by O'Rouke and Ocasio-Cortez

Sen. Warren said she and her husband watch Casablanca together every New Year's Eve

She continued: 'It's been kind of an amazing day. So, today, I, um, got up early this morning, and, uh, talked to a bunch of folks on the phone, and then went outside and talked to the press -- and this is our house, and has been for a long time, and there are all these reporters, and trucks, and everybody outside the house.'

Shortly afterwards she said: 'Hold on a second -- I'm gonna get me a beer,' and walked out of view of the camera.

Warren, who has a proven track record as a small-dollar fundraiser, announced upon returning that she has already received donations from individuals in all 50 states, the District, and Puerto Rico, adding: 'It really has been an exciting day,' she said.

She told followers she and her husband would be following their usual New Year's Eve routine: 'We watch Casablanca, we get some good food ... and, um, we sit there upstairs and we watch Casablanca.'

She added the movie fills her with hope.

Incoming New York Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, 29, used Instagram stories and livestreams during her run last year to connect with her supporters. Beto O'Rourke often broadcast himself cooking at home during his failed bid to unseat Ted Cruz in Texas.

Tonight's Instagram effort by Senator Warren may have been inspired by social media videos by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez

Ocasio-Cortez's communications director told Rolling Stone his candidate thought social media had 'more capacity for transparency and just to be herself'.

President Donald Trump said on Monday that he would 'love to run' against Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, though one would have to 'ask her psychiatrist' if she has a chance to win.

It was unclear what Trump meant by the comment, which he made during an interview on the Fox News Channel on Monday.

'I wish her well, I'd love to run against her,' the President told Fox News after Warren announced that she was forming an exploratory committee - the first step which indicates a plan to eventually run for the White House.

Trump then mentioned the controversy over a DNA test which Warren took to prove that she is of Native American origin.

'She did very badly in proving that she was of Indian heritage,' Trump said.

'That didn't work out too well. I think [Fox News reporter Pete Hegseth] ha[s] more than she does, and maybe I do too, and I have nothing.

'So we'll see how she does.'

When Trump was asked if she can win, he replied: 'Well, I don't know, you'd have to ask her psychiatrist.'

Warren dodged questions on Monday about her biggest political liabilities as she jumped headfirst into the 2020 Democratic presidential primary process.

In announcing the formation of a presidential exploratory committee, Warren staked out the first significant territory in what will likely be a crowded field of Democrats itching for a swing at Trump.

President Donald Trump said on Monday that he would 'love to run' against Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, though one would have to 'ask her psychiatrist' if she has a chance to win

But she showed no sign she's ready to overcome the self-inflected scandal that has dogged her for years: her questionable claim of American Indian ancestry.

The result was an unsteady performance that none of the three major cable news networks broadcast live from beginning to end.

Asked in her first question as a candidate-in-waiting how she will respond to Democrats who worry that her slow-motion ancestry gaffe had left her too vulnerable to be electable, Warren defaulted to talking points.

'I'm in this fight because I understand what's happening to working families,' she said outside her home near Boston, standing alongside her husband Bruce Mann.

Warren spoke to reporters with her husband Bruce (left) at her side, after announcing she has formed an exploratory committee to run for president in 2020

The first question from a reporter as she entered the 2020 fray was about her electability given her Native American DNA scandal - and she avoided answering it

Trump has long been critical of Warren for claiming to have Cherokee ancestry, a move the president claims gave her preferential treatment in university hiring at Harvard and the University of Pennsylvania.

Warren conceded this month that she is 'not a person of color,' following her embarrassing October release of DNA test data that concluded her proportion of American Indian blood might be as small as 1 part in 1,024 - lower than average European-Americans.

She sidestepped a separate question on Monday about whether her far-left brand of populism will polarize American voters, denying her meaningful support outside the liberal northeast U.S. and California.

Instead she acknowledged only that CEOs and investment bankers won't like her.

'The problem we've got right now in Washington is that it works great for those who have money, to buy influence,' said Warren, 69. 'And I'm fighting against that, and you bet it's going to make a lot of people unhappy.'

The 69-year-old Democrat would not, however, rule out accepting help from super PACs built with their political contributions.

'Would you take support from super PACs,' a reporter asked.

Despite a crush of TV cameras covering Warren's announcement and her short Q&A with reporters, none of the three big cable TV news networks broadcast the entire event live

Warren, pictured walking away after the short press availability, said she's no fan of super PACs or the billionaire who fund them, but didn't rule out accepting their help in 2020

How she announced: Elizabeth Warren used New Year's Eve morning to make her presidential move in a video recorded in her kitchen but slickly produced

A flustered Warren said only that 'I don't think we ought to be running campaigns that are funded by billionaires, whether it goes through super PACs or their own money that they're spending.'

That fell short of a pledge to shun their help as she runs for the White House.

'I've already received donations from all 50 states, the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico,' she boasted, before revealing that she would spend New Year's Eve with her husband doing what they always do: watching the 1942 film 'Casablanca.'

Trump aides licked their chops and laughed as they anticipated a battle between the president and the ultra-liberal swashbuckler he regularly mocks as 'Pocahontas.'

A Trump administration official with knowledge of the president's thinking said Monday that Warren 'will go down in flames,' and cracked a subtle Native American joke.

'She's going to somehow ride her far-left platform into the White House?' the official asked.

'How?'

'It's a dream come true,' said a second official, adding a fond hope that Connecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal would follow Warren into the race.

'Can we get Blumenthal to run too? More phony Democrats, please,' said that official.

She's (almost) running: Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren used New Year's Eve to announce she is setting up an exploratory committee for a 2020 bid

President Donald Trump has said he would love to face Warren, and has already spent two years publicly mocking her to soften the ground

Trump has similarly weaponized Blumenthal's past missteps, turning his military career into a case of stolen valor because he has falsely claimed to have fought in Vietnam.

Blumenthal served in uniform as a U.S. Marine reservist for six years but spent the war thousands of miles from harm's way.

Warren's New Year's Eve launch guaranteed she had the nation's political spotlight largely to herself.

'America's middle class is under attack,' the 69-year-old Massachusetts Democrat said in a launch video.

'How did we get here? Billionaires and big corporations decided they wanted more of the pie. And they enlisted politicians to cut them a bigger slice.'

She tried to strike a uniting tone, declaring that 'no matter what our differences, most of us want the same thing: 'to be able to work hard, play by the same set of rules and take care of the people we love. That's what I'm fighting for.'

The Republican National Committee blasted out a scathing reply.

Chairwoman Ronna McDaniel said that Warren 'couldn't be more out of touch. With her lack of support from voters - including in her home state - on top of her phony claim to minority status, now that she is formally running Americans will see her for what she is: another extreme far-left obstructionist and a total fraud.'

Connecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal is another liberal Democrat who Trump aides would like to see enter the 2020 contest, because of his false claims to have fought in Vietnam

On the blocks: In an email to supporters, Warren said she'd more formally announce a campaign plan early in 2019. She can now raise money for a run

Warren burst onto the national scene a decade ago during the financial crisis with calls for greater consumer protections.

She quickly became one of the party's more prominent liberals even as she sometimes fought with Obama administration officials over their response to the market turmoil.

Now, as a likely presidential contender, she is making an appeal to the party's base. Her video notes the economic challenges facing people of color along with images of a women's march and Warren's participation at an LGBT event.

In an email to supporters, Warren said she'd more formally announce a campaign plan early in 2019.

Warren is the most prominent Democrat yet to make a move toward a presidential bid and has long been a favorite target of President Donald Trump.

In mid-December, former Obama housing chief Julian Castro also announced a presidential exploratory committee, which legally allows potential candidates to begin raising money. Outgoing Maryland Rep. John Delaney is the only Democrat so far to have formally announced a presidential campaign.

But that's likely to change quickly in the new year as other leading Democrats take steps toward White House runs.

Greatest hits: Trump is likely to make use of his previous assault on Elizabeth Warren's claims of Native American roots, which he stepped up in the wake of her DNA test

Warren enters a Democratic field that's shaping up as the most crowded in decades, with many of her Senate colleagues openly weighing their own campaigns, as well as governors, mayors and other prominent citizens.

One of her most significant competitors could be Sen. Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent who is eyeing another presidential run harnessing the same populist rhetoric.

She must also move past the widely panned October DNA test stunt meant to bolster her claim to Native American heritage. Instead, the use of a genetic test to prove her ethnicity emboldened Trump's taunts of her as 'Pocahontas.'

There was no direct mention of the controversy, or of Trump, in Monday's video. It did include images of the president and his inner-circle current and former aides who her base most loves to hate: Kellyanne Conway, Stephen Miller and Steve Bannon.

Warren has the benefit of higher name recognition than many others in the Democratic mix for 2020, thanks to her years as a prominent critic of Wall Street who originally conceived of what became the government's Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

She now faces an arduous battle to raise money and capture Democratic primary voters' attention before Iowa casts its first vote in more than a year.

She has an advantage in the $12.5 million left over from her 2018 re-election campaign that she could use for a presidential run.

Warren's campaign is likely to revolve around the same theme she's woven into speeches and policy proposals in recent years: battling special interests, paying mind to the nexus between racial and economic inequities.

'America's middle class is under attack,' Warren said in the video.

'How did we get here? Billionaires and big corporations decided they wanted more of the pie. And they enlisted politicians to cut them a fatter slice.'

And these incredible pictures show the entire transformation over 75 years.

One of the earliest images shows a pair of the US Air Force B-26 Marauders preparing to take off from Stansted during the Second World War.

While pictures taken during the 1960s and 70s show how the hub welcomed in the jet age and thousands in 1983 swarming around the space shuttle Enterprise, which visited on the back of a 747.

In 1991, the airport received a royal seal of approval when the Queen officially opened the new Lord Norman Foster terminal while in recent times Stansted has welcomed Air Force One and presidents Barack Obama and Donald Trump.

Scroll down for the fascinating past, present and future of the airport.

London Stansted Airport started life as an air force base during the Second World War. The runway was built in 1942 by the Americans. Pictured is the airfield in 1943

On D-Day in 1944 bombers from Stansted led more than 600 aircraft over the beaches of occupied France. Pictured is a map of the airfield in 1943

At the end of the war, the base was handed back to the Civil Aviation Authority and became home to many of Britain's charter airlines

A converted wartime Nissen hut (a tunnel-shaped hut made of corrugated iron) served as the terminal building in the 50s and 60s. At this time, the airport was beginning to welcome more and more travellers

The first jet arrived in March 1961 after the runway was lengthened - this is the first picture. It's the inaugural flight of Dutch carrier KLM's new service to New York Idlewild Airport (now JFK Airport)

KLM Royal Dutch Airlines was founded in 1919. The carrier no longer serves Stansted Airport

434,daily mail online,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6559249/Grand-jury-extended-U-S-special-counsels-Trump-Russia-probe.html,"By Geoff Earle, Deputy U.s. Political Editor For Dailymail.com and Reuters

A federal judge has consented to extending a grand jury so that Special Counsel Robert Mueller can continue to bring evidence and seek indictments in the Russia probe.

A grand jury was first impaneled in July of 2017 to consider evidence in the investigation. Mueller was given a broad mandate to investigate any collusion between the Trump campaign and Russians as well as related matters.

He has obtained eight convictions so far including three Trump aides: former National Security Advisor Mike Flynn, former longtime lawyer Michael Cohen, and former Campaign Chair Paul Manafort.

The 18-month extension was set to expire, and now will continue through the summer with a six-month extension.

Special Counsel Robert Mueller has obtained an extension for the federal grand jury hearing evidence in the Russia probe

The grand jury has been meeting in secret in Washington, D.C. per regulations for such investigations.

According to CNN, they last met December 21 for two hours.

The extension was confirmed by an aide to the judge overseeing it said on Friday who declined to be identified by name.

The extension is a sign that Mueller is not done presenting evidence before the grand jury in his investigation of U.S. allegations of Russian interference in the election and any possible coordination between Moscow and Trump's campaign.

It comes amid continued signals that longtime Trump informal advisor Roger Stone is under scrutiny. Stone himself has said he expects to be indicted.

Trump on Friday repeated his denial of any collusion

The move allows to present evidence and seek further indictments. He ultimately must file a report with the attorney general, in this case Trump-named Acting Attorney General Matt Whitake

Former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn arrives for his sentencing hearing for lying to the FBI at the US Federal Court in Washington, DC, USA, 18 December 2018. Flynn, who has cooperated with Special Counsel Robert Mueller's probe, pleaded guilty last year to lying about meetings with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak

Conservative political activist and conspiracy theorist Jerome Corsi. speaks outside the US Federal District Courthouse in Washington on January 3, 2019, after a hearing in his lawsuit against Russia collusion investigation chief Robert Mueller. Corsi, is suspected of having had advance knowledge that WikiLeaks would, in the summer of 2016, publish a trove of hacked Democratic emails that would prove damaging to Trump's presidential rival, Hillary Clinton

Chief U.S. District Judge for the District of Columbia Beryl A. Howell allowed the extension of the grand jury panel

The president brought up 'collusion' on Friday at a press conference when he got asked about a Democrat's profane call for his impeachment.

'You don't impeach people when they're doing a good job,' Trump said.

'And you don't impeach people when there was no collusion because there was no collusion,' he added.

The grand jury was impaneled by the U.S. District Court in Washington in July 2017 for an 18-month term, the limit under federal rules. The term can be extended if the court determines it to be in the public interest to do so.

'The Chief Judge has confirmed that the term of Grand Jury 17-01 has been extended,' Lisa Klem, special assistant to Chief Judge Beryl Howell said in a statement.

Howell did not confirm any length of the extension, Klem said.

A spokesman for Mueller declined to comment.

A number of Trump's allies, including his lawyer Rudy Giuliani, have repeatedly called on Mueller to wrap up his investigation.

Trump has repeatedly railed against the probe as a 'witch hunt.'

But after repeated calls for it to end by Trump and his associates, Democrats who took control of Congress Thursday have vowed not to let it be shut down.

House Judiciary Chairman Rep. Jerold Nadler told CNN that he intends to make Mueller's final report public. Under regulations Mueller must submit his report in secret to the attorney general, but Nadler said he can use a subpoena to force its release.

Russia has denied meddling in the election, contrary to the conclusion of U.S. intelligence agencies that have said Moscow used hacking and propaganda to try to sow discord in the United States and boost Republican Trump's chances against Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton.

Mueller's investigation and other inquiries have clouded Trump's two years in office. Mueller has secured more than 30 indictments and guilty pleas and has spawned at least four federal probes.

Flynn was President Trump's former National Security Advisor and Robert Mueller's most senior scalp to date. He previously served when he was a three star general as President Obama's director of the Defense Intelligence Agency but was fired.

He admitted to lying to special counsel investigators about his conversations with a Russian ambassador in December 2016. He has agreed to cooperate with the special counsel investigation.

Pleaded guilty to eight counts including fraud and two campaign finance violations in August 2018. Pleaded guilty to further count of lying to Congress in November 2018. Sentenced to three years in prison and $2 million in fines and forfeitures in December 2018

Cohen was Trump's longtime personal attorney, starting working for him and the Trump Organization in 2007. He is the longest-serving member of Trump's inner circle to be implicated by Mueller. Cohen professed unswerving devotion to Trump - and organized payments to silence two women who alleged they had sex with the-then candidate: porn star Stormy Daniels and Playboy model Karen McDougal. He admitted that payments to both women were felony campaign finance violations - and admitted that he acted at the 'direction' of 'Candidate-1': Donald Trump.

He also admitted tax fraud by lying about his income from loans he made, money from taxi medallions he owned, and other sources of income, at a cost to the Treasury of $1.3 million.

And he admitted lying to Congress in a rare use of the offense. The judge in his case let him report for prison on March 6 and recommended he serve it in a medium-security facility close to New York City.

GUILTY: PAUL MANAFORT

Found guilty of eight charges of bank and tax fraud in August 2018. Pleaded guilty to two further charges. Awaiting sentence

Manafort worked for Trump's campaign from March 2016 and chaired it from June to August 2016, overseeing Trump being adopted as Republican candidate at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland. He is the most senior campaign official to be implicated by Mueller. Manafort was one of Washington D.C.'s longest-term and most influential lobbyists but in 2015, his money dried up and the next year he turned to Trump for help, offering to be his campaign chairman for free - in the hope of making more money afterwards. But Mueller unwound his previous finances and discovered years of tax and bank fraud as he coined in cash from pro-Russia political parties and oligarchs in Ukraine.

Manafort pleaded not guilty to 18 charges of tax and bank fraud but was convicted of eight counts. The jury was deadlocked on the other 10 charges. A second trial on charges of failing to register as a foreign agent is due in September.

GUILTY: RICK GATES

Pleaded guilty to conspiracy against the United States and making false statements in February 2018. Awaiting sentence

Gates was Manafort's former deputy at political consulting firm DMP International. He admitted to conspiring to defraud the U.S. government on financial activity, and to lying to investigators about a meeting Manafort had with a member of congress in 2013. As a result of his guilty plea and promise of cooperation, prosecutors vacated charges against Gates on bank fraud, bank fraud conspiracy, failure to disclose foreign bank accounts, filing false tax returns, helping prepare false tax filings, and falsely amending tax returns.

GUILTY AND JAILED: GEORGE PAPADOPOLOUS

Pleaded guilty to making false statements in October 2017. Sentenced to 14 days in September 2018, and reported to prison in November. Served 12 days and released on December 7, 2018

Papadopoulos was a member of Donald Trump's campaign foreign policy advisory committee. He admitted to lying to special counsel investigators about his contacts with London professor Josef Mifsud and Ivan Timofeev, the director of a Russian government-funded think tank.

He has agreed to cooperate with the special counsel investigation.

GUILTY AND JAILED: RICHARD PINEDO

Pleaded guilty to identity fraud in February 2018. Sentenced to a year in prison

Pinedo is a 28-year-old computer specialist from Santa Paula, California. He admitted to selling bank account numbers to Russian nationals over the internet that he had obtained using stolen identities.

He has agreed to cooperate with the special counsel investigation.

GUILTY AND JAILED: ALEX VAN DER ZWAAN

Pleaded guilty to making false statements in February 2018. He served a 30-day prison sentence earlier this year and was deported to the Netherlands on his release

Van der Zwaan is a Dutch attorney for Skadden Arps who worked on a Ukrainian political analysis report for Paul Manafort in 2012.

He admitted to lying to special counsel investigators about when he last spoke with Rick Gates and Konstantin Kilimnik.

GUILTY: W. SAMUEL PATTEN

Pleaded guilty in August 2018 to failing to register as a lobbyist while doing work for a Ukrainian political party. Awaiting sentence

Patten, a long-time D.C. lobbyist was a business partner of Paul Manafort. He pleaded guilty to admitting to arranging an illegal $50,000 donation to Trump's inauguration.

He arranged for an American 'straw donor' to pay $50,000 to the inaugural committee, knowing that it was actually for a Ukrainian businessman.

Neither the American or the Ukrainian have been named.

CHARGED: KONSTANTIN KILIMNIK

Indicted for obstruction of justice and conspiracy to obstruct justice. At large, probably in Russia

Kilimnik is a former employee of Manafort's political consulting firm and helped him with lobbying work in Ukraine. He is accused of witness tampering, after he allegedly contacted individuals who had worked with Manafort to remind them that Manafort only performed lobbying work for them outside of the U.S.

He has been linked to Russian intelligence and is currently thought to be in Russia - effectively beyond the reach of extradition by Mueller's team.

INDICTED: THE RUSSIANS

Twenty-five Russian nationals and three Russian entities have been indicted for conspiracy to defraud the United States. They remain at large in Russia

Two of these Russian nationals were also indicted for conspiracy to commit wire fraud and 11 were indicted for conspiracy to launder money. Fifteen of them were also indicted for identity fraud.

Vladimir Putin has ridiculed the charges. Russia effectively bars extradition of its nationals. The only prospect Mueller has of bringing any in front of a U.S. jury is if Interpol has their names on an international stop list - which is not made public - and they set foot in a territory which extradites to the U.S.

INDICTED: MICHAEL FLYNN'S BUSINESS PARTNERS

Bijan Kian (left), number two in now disgraced former national security adviser Mike Flynn's lobbying company, and the two's business partner Ekim Alptekin (right) were indicted for conspiracy to lobby illegally. Kian is awaiting trial, Alptekin is still to appear in court

Kian, an Iranian-American was arrested and appeared in court charged with a conspiracy to illegally lobby the U.S government without registering as a foreign agent. Their co-conspirator was Flynn, who is called 'Person A' in the indictment and is not charged, offering some insight into what charges he escaped with his plea deal.

Kian, vice-president of Flynn's former lobbying firm, is alleged to have plotted with Alptekin to try to change U.S. policy on an exiled Turkish cleric, Fethullah Gulen, who lives in Pennsylvania and who is accused by Turkey's strongman president Recep Tayyip Erdogan, of trying to depose him.

Erdogan's government wanted him extradited from the U.S. and paid Flynn's firm through Alptekin for lobbying, including an op-ed in The Hill calling for Gulen to be ejected. Flynn and Kian both lied that the op-ed was not paid for by the Turkish government.

The indictment is a sign of how Mueller is taking an interest in more than just Russian involvement in the 2016 election."
435,daily mail online,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-6525149/Trump-Mattis-Jan-1-deputy-acting-chief.html,"WASHINGTON (AP) - Irritated with the criticism and fallout from Defense Secretary Jim Mattis' resignation, President Donald Trump on Sunday pushed the Pentagon chief out the door two months earlier than planned, an acrimonious end to a tense relationship that had been eroding in recent months.

In a series of tweets, Trump appeared to question why he had put Mattis in his Cabinet in the first place, and said deputy defense secretary Patrick Shanahan will take over as acting secretary on Jan. 1 to cover the accelerated departure.

The sudden change strips Mattis of any chance to further frame national security policy or smooth rattled relations with allies through the originally planned transition at the end of February. And it reflects White House displeasure with the retired Marine Corps general's blistering resignation letter, which he delivered to Trump on Thursday.

Mattis resigned in protest over Trump's decision to pull all U.S. troops out of Syria. U.S. officials, however, said that the reaction to his decision to leave - including the shock and dismay expressed on Capitol Hill - annoyed Trump and likely led to Mattis leaving earlier than planned.

""When President Obama ingloriously fired Jim Mattis, I gave him a second chance. Some thought I shouldn't, I thought I should,"" Trump tweeted Saturday, foreshadowing his displeasure and the Sunday announcement. He also fumed over the media coverage of his Syria withdrawal order, suggesting he should be popular for bringing troops home.

""With me, hit hard instead by the Fake News Media. Crazy!"" Trump tweeted.

A White House official said Trump decided Mattis should leave the administration earlier than planned to avoid a drawn-out transition when someone on hand whom they consider a qualified deputy capable of running the Pentagon in an acting capacity. The official, who asked not to be identified publicly discussing personnel matters, said it made sense to have a quicker transition and not create problems.

The official said Mattis was notified of Trump's wishes prior to today's tweeted announcement.

Lt. Col. Joseph Buccino, a spokesman for Shanahan, said the former Boeing Co. executive will accept the appointment as acting secretary.

""Deputy Secretary will continue to serve as directed by the president, and the Department of Defense will remain focused on the defense of the nation,"" Buccino said on Sunday.

It is unusual for the Pentagon to have an acting secretary of defense. Historically when a secretary has resigned, he has stayed on until a successor is confirmed. For example, when Chuck Hagel was told to resign in November 2014, he stayed in office until Ash Carter was confirmed the following February.

While Mattis' resignation followed Trump's announcement that he would soon pull all of the approximately 2,000 U.S. troops out of Syria, officials said that the decision was the result of an accumulation of disagreements.

In a stunning resignation letter, Mattis made clear he did not see eye to eye with a president who has expressed disdain for NATO and doubts about keeping troops in Asia. Mattis was also unhappy with Trump's order to develop plans to pull out up to half of the 14,000 U.S. forces in Afghanistan.

Earlier Sunday, Trump's acting chief of staff said that Trump had known for ""quite some time now"" that he and Mattis ""did not share some of the same philosophies ... have the same world view.""

Mick Mulvaney told ABC's ""This Week"" that the president and his defense chief ""just could never get on the same page"" on Syria, adding that Trump had said since his presidential campaign that ""he wanted to get out of Syria."" Mulvaney said the president ""is entitled to have a secretary of defense who is committed to that same end.""

Asked whether Trump wanted a Pentagon leader willing to challenge him or someone in lock step with his views, Mulvaney said ""a little bit of both.""

""I've encouraged him to find people who have some overlap with him but don't see the world in lockstep with him,"" Mulvaney said.

The Pentagon on Sunday would only say that Mattis serves at the pleasure of the president.

Other officials said it wasn't clear whether Mattis had spoken directly to Trump about the accelerated departure. Mattis had been at work on Friday, and defense officials had insisted he was planning to stay through February, when he would attend a NATO defense ministers meeting.

Meanwhile, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., joined leading Republicans on foreign affairs in urging Trump to reconsider his decision to withdraw American forces from Syria.

""We believe that such action at this time is a premature and costly mistake that not only threatens the safety and security of the United States but also emboldens"" the Islamic State group, President Bashar Assad's government, Iran and Russia, according to the letter, signed by McConnell and eight other senators, including Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., who organized it.

They asked Trump to ""not make any final decision for 90 days to allow time to adequately study the impacts of this decision on our partners, our allies and the re-emergence of ISIS and other terror groups, to ensure our nation's strategic interests are secured.""

But Mulvaney, asked on ABC whether there was any chance the president might change his mind on Syria decision, said: ""No. I think the president has told people from the very beginning that he doesn't want us to stay in Syria forever. You're seeing the end result now of two years' worth of work. But keep in mind it's not unusual for a president to lose members of the Cabinet over these types of disagreements.""

Just after tweeting the announcement about Shanahan, Trump said he had had ""a long and productive call"" with Turkey's president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Trump said they discussed IS, ""our mutual involvement in Syria, & the slow & highly coordinated pullout of U.S. troops from the area. After many years they are coming home.""

Shanahan, a longtime Boeing Co. executive, was nominated for the deputy job in early 2017.

He moved up through the management ranks at Boeing over a career that began in 1986. The Puget Sound Business Journal called him a Boeing ""fix-it"" man in a March 2016 report. He oversaw the company's global supply chain strategies and use of advanced manufacturing technologies. Shanahan was central to getting the 787 Dreamliner on track after production problems in the program's early years, the report said.

Associated Press writers Robert Burns and Darlene Superville contributed to this report.

Oh Michelle.

Not you, too?

Just when I thought there was one person in public life that soared effortlessly and admirably above the incessantly ugly partisan trash-talk that pervades every second of American airspace these days, Mrs Obama has let me down.

And frankly, she has let herself down too.

Appearing on last night's Jimmy Fallon show, Michelle inexplicably decided to plunge the bitchy knife firmly into the back of her successor as First Lady, Melania Trump.

Michelle Obama appeared on last night's Jimmy Fallon and inexplicably decided to plunge the bitchy knife firmly into the back of Melania Trump, snipping 'Bye Felicia'

The attack came after Fallon showed her a photo of her and husband Barack boarding Air Force One for the last time after Donald Trump's inauguration in January 2017.

'Can you just walk me through...,' said Fallon.

But before he could even finish the question, Michelle interrupted with a sneering: 'Bye Felicia!'

Fallon collapsed with laughter and the audience whooped with joy.

And wherever she was, Melania Trump must have winced with anger and humiliation.

The phrase 'Bye Felicia' is an intensely derogatory one.

It was first coined by rapper Ice Cube's character Craig in the 1995 cult stoner comedy movie, Friday.

A local girl named Felicia who annoys the neighbourhood with her constant begging, and shameless attempts to live off others, annoys Craig.

When she asks if she can borrow his car, and a marijuana joint, he point blank refuses, then looks away and says simply 'Bye, Felicia' in a dismissive tone.

The phrase is now widely used, especially on social media, as an ice cold 'kiss off' for unpleasant people who you want to avoid.

It means, depending on which dictionary you refer to, a variant on: 'I'm done with you, I have no interest in you, or anything you have to say.'

It's specifically designed to cause hurt to the recipient.

Michelle Obama likes to pride herself as being street-wise and down with the kids, so will have known all this when she said it.

She is a very smart woman too, so she will have also known that 'Felicia' is a very similar phonetic name to 'Melania', so it would be very obvious to whom she was referring.

This slur would be bad enough, but Michelle wasn't finished there.

Talking of the stress of that Inauguration day, she said: 'Then the Tiffany's box..' and crunched her face into an expression of withering theatrical bemusement.

She was referring to the expensive picture frame gift that Melania gave her outside the White House.

Melania had given her a Tiffany box containing a 'beautiful frame' - which she received in front of the cameras, pulling a face indicating it had caught her off guard

Fallon laughed and the audience cheered as Mrs Obama pulled a face recounting the gift

Fallon laughed again, as the audience cheered.

And for a second time, Melania was being humiliated on national television, for the apparent crime of giving her predecessor as First Lady a nice gift.

A similar gift, incidentally, to the one Michelle Obama handed Laura Bush on the same steps on Barack's inauguration day, so why all the faux surprise and 'confusion' when Melania did the same to her?

By the way, Michelle brought Laura Bush a gift, topped with a red bow, the day of Barack's inauguration, so why the faux surprise and confusion when Melania did the same?

I've met Michelle Obama, once, and found her a delightful person - warm, friendly and highly personable.

I've also met Melania Trump, many more times, and always found her exactly the same.

They're two very different women, but they have shared the rare experience of being First Lady.

And I think most dispassionate observers would say that they have both been excellent at executing one of the world's most difficult, goldfish bowl roles.

Every move they make, every word they speak, every dress they wear, is exposed to intense global scrutiny, comment and criticism.

Melania Trump is a warm, friendly, delightful woman. As is Michelle Obama. And they share the very rare, fishbowl experience of being First Lady. Hate their husbands all you want, but you can still admire each woman for how she has conducted herself in the stressful role

It must be a relentlessly intrusive and stressful existence, and I applaud them both for doing it with a touch of class, elegance and dignity.

You can hate Barack Obama, but still admire the way his wife Michelle conducted herself during her time at the White House.

Just as you can hate Donald Trump and still admire his wife Melania for the way she is conducting herself, perhaps even more so given she has had to endure massively more scorn, ridicule and shame over all her husband's scandals.

What I find far harder to admire is Michelle Obama's decision to now publicly mock, denigrate and ridicule her successor.

And I find it even more unpalatable to admire that she did it whilst flogging her new best-selling autobiography. (It's a great book, by the way).

There's always been an unwritten rule that First Ladies don't whack each other. Not least because they all know how tough the gig is, so why pour yet more fuel on the already ferocious fire?

It's no secret that Michelle and Melania don't get on, but there is no reason they have to.

Their apparent mutual dislike doesn't mean they should openly criticise each other, particularly as a tool to sell books and make money.

It's no secret the two women don't get on, but there is no reason they have to. That doesn't mean they should openly criticise each other, particularly as a tool to sell books and cash in

Yet Michelle hasn't stopped sniping at Melania for the past few weeks during her huge media tour.

In November, when asked if she could empathise with Melania's claim to be one of 'the world's most bullied women', Michelle snapped: 'I can't.' Then she pointedly said she learned 'not to take myself so seriously in this role' by meeting with military families.

The message was clear: 'Stop being so self-obsessed Melania.'

Michelle also revealed in another interview that Melania hadn't reached out to her for any advice - another unnecessary revelation that she knew would attract huge headlines and provide further great publicity for her book.

Melania did finally respond to that last dig, getting her spokesman to say: 'Mrs Trump is a strong and independent woman who has been navigating her role as First Lady in her own way. When she needs advice on any issue, she seeks it from her professional team within the White House.'

I didn't blame her for saying this. Why should she bother calling up a woman who seems to delight in mocking her in public?

A while ago, Michelle Obama told the world her mantra was: 'When they go low, we go high.'

How sad to now see the same Michelle Obama, a woman I greatly admire, now herself go so low simply to belittle her successor, flog a few more books and further line her already bulging pockets."
437,daily mail online,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6512333/Trump-declares-victory-ISIS-Syria-military-prepare-withdrawal-civil-war.html,"By Geoff Earle, Deputy Political Editor and Francesca Chambers, White House Correspondent For Dailymail.com and Reuters

President Donald Trump declared victory over ISIS in Syria on Wednesday, as the Pentagon prepares for an immediate troop withdrawal.

'We have defeated ISIS in Syria, my only reason for being there during the Trump Presidency,' the president wrote on Twitter.

His declaration came after the Wall Street Journal and other outlets quoted Pentagon officials saying the U.S. would soon begin pulling out remaining forces, which number about 2,000.

'The Pentagon has an order to get to move troops out of Syria as quickly as possible,' a U.S. official told the paper.

The announcement came under immediate scrutiny, including from allies of the president such as Sen. Lindsey Graham, who called it a 'huge Obama-like mistake,' and Rep. Adam Kinzinger, who said he would 'sure hope the President and his advisers are smarter than this.'

President Donald Trump declared a victory in Syria in the U.S. campaign against ISIS as the military prepares for a total pullout

Trump declared victory in Syria over ISIS on Wednesday morning in a surprise announcement that the U.S. was pulling troops out of the region

The White House said in a statement following Trump's announcement that troops have 'started returning' home and a transition has begun.

'Five years ago, ISIS was a very powerful and dangerous force in the Middle East, and now the United States has defeated the territorial caliphate. These victories over ISIS in Syria do not signal the end of the Global Coalition or its campaign,' White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said in a statement. 'We have started returning United States troops home as we transition to the next phase of this campaign.'

She added, 'The United States and our allies stand ready to re-engage at all levels to defend American interests whenever necessary, and we will continue to work together to deny radical Islamist terrorists territory, funding, support, and any means of infiltrating our borders.'

The move is likely to please Turkish president Recep Erdogan, who wants to counter U.S. allied Kurdish forces in Syria and who spoke with Trump by telephone last week. He has been threatening an assault on U.S. allied Kurdish forces, who have been effective in helping to combat ISIS.

But as the U.S. is preparing to pack up, Russia is moving in. After carrying out a fight in Syria billed as an anti-terror campaign but also buttressing Assad, Russia has begun building a permanent military presence, Reuters reported, quoting the Russian defense minister. The Russian parliament ratified a deal with Damascus on the permanent presence, the RIA news agency reported.

The deal would expand the Tartus naval facility, Russia's only naval foothold in the Mediterranean, and grant Russian warships access to Syrian waters and ports, Viktor Bondarev, head of the upper house security and defense committee, told RIA.

Defense Secretary Jim Mattis has pushed for a longer-term presence to make sure ISIS does not return to its former power, having been rolled back from its sprawling geographic base in Iraq and Syria.

The move drew immediate criticism from Trump ally Lindsey Graham, in language that seemed designed to appeal to Trump's loathing of his predecessor.

'Withdrawal of this small American force in Syria would be a huge Obama-like mistake,' Graham tweeted.

GOP Rep. Adam Kinzinger disputed the president's claim that ISIS had been defeated.

'This is simply not true,' Kinzinger wrote, after retweeting the president.

Retired Gen. Mark Hertling turned in a devastating review in an appearance on CNN, saying the move appeared to be 'transactional' in nature, having to do with an arrangement with Turkey and Russia.

'This was very surprising to me -- not only the announcement but the timing. I don't understand why it is happening now,' he told the network.

'The U.S. Forces have just started an offensive with the Syrian defense forces and the Kurds against the town of Hajin, which is considered an ISIS stronghold... You're talking about making both the Russians, the Syrian Bashar Al Assad, the Iranians and the Turks very happy about this move because the Kurdish forces are going to see this as us turning against them one more time.'

Hertling added: 'What is interesting that has not been brought up yet is there seems to be a transactional element to this, too,' Raw Story reported. 'Over the last days the U.S. Has sealed the deal with Turkey for $3.5 billion worth of Patriot missile systems that were signed yesterday by our State Department. I'm sure that played a role, a little bit, in this.'

The State Department subsequently cancelled its daily briefing with reporters.

The U.S. first became involved in Syria by providing covert aide to rebels who rose up against the government of Bashar al-Assad, who U.S. government officials soon identified as a brutal dictator who would ultimately use chemical weapons against Syrian opposition groups and people living in rebel-held areas.

Trump ordered a missile strike in 2017 intended to respond to a Syrian use of chemical weapons.

Russia built up its own forces in Syria to prop up the Assad regime, and during the Obama administration top diplomats had to negotiate protocols to avoid unplanned encounters between U.S. and Russian forces.

With a total U.S. pullout, Russian forces would remain as the dominant air power in Syria.

Erdogan has repeatedly balked at the U.S. military's decision to partner with Kurdish forces who have proved capable of fighting against ISIS, swayed by domestic concerns about Kurds living inside Turkey seeking more independence. Turkey is a key NATO ally.

Complicating relations, the Trump administration has declined to move against Saudi Crown Prince Mohammad bin Salman, despite the murder of dissident Jamal Khashoggi inside the Saudi consulate in Istanbul - a killing that infuriated the Turkish government.

Trump campaigned on pulling back the U.S. from its overseas commitments, but the U.S. continues to maintain a heavy troop presence in Afghanistan despite a drawdown and continued attacks by Taliban forces on government and U.S. targets.

In Syria, Trump said this spring he wanted to 'get out.'

'I want to bring our troops back home,' Trump said.

The timing of the troop withdrawal was not immediately clear and U.S. officials who spoke to Reuters on condition of anonymity did not disclose details about the deliberations. But one official told Reuters that partners and allies had been consulted.

Two U.S. officials said a decision to withdraw had already been reached but that could not be immediately confirmed. It was unclear how soon a decision detailing any withdrawal plans might be announced.

The Pentagon declined to comment, saying only that it continued to work with partners in the region.

The United States still has about 2,000 troops in Syria, many of them special operations forces working closely with an alliance of Kurdish and Arab militias known as the Syrian Democratic Forces, or SDF.

The partnership with the SDF over the past several years has led to the defeat of ISIS in Syria but outraged NATO ally Turkey, which views Kurdish YPG forces in the alliance as an extension of a militant group fighting inside Turkey.

The deliberations on U.S. troops come as Ankara threatens a new offensive in Syria. To date, U.S. forces in Syria have been seen as a stabilizing factor in the country and have somewhat restrained Turkey's actions against the SDF.

A complete withdrawal of U.S. troops from Syria would still leave a sizeable U.S. military presence in the region, including about 5,200 troops across the border in Iraq.

Much of the U.S. campaign in Syria has been waged by warplanes flying out of Qatar and other locations in the Middle East.

Still, Mattis and U.S. State Department officials have long fretted about leaving Syria before a peace agreement can be reached to end that country's brutal civil war, which has killed hundreds of thousands of people and displaced around half of Syria´s pre-war population of about 22 million.

In April, Mattis said: 'We do not want to simply pull out before the diplomats have won the peace. You win the fight - and then you win the peace.'

ISIS is also widely expected to revert to guerilla tactics once it no longer holds territory.

A U.S. withdrawal could open Trump up to criticism if ISIS reemerged.

Trump has previously lambasted his predecessor, Barack Obama, for the withdrawal of U.S. forces from Iraq that preceded an unraveling of the Iraqi armed forces. Iraqi forces collapsed in the face of ISIS advance into the country in 2014.

ISIS declared its so-called 'caliphate' in 2014 after seizing large swathes of Syria and Iraq. The hardline Islamist group established its de facto capital in the Syrian city of Raqqa, using it as a base to plot attacks in Europe.

According to U.S. estimates, the group oversaw about 100,000 square kilometers (39,000 square miles) of territory, with about 8 million people under ISIS control. It had estimated revenues of nearly one billion dollars a year.

Brett McGurk, the U.S. special envoy for the global coalition to defeat ISIS, said last week that the group was down to its last 1 percent of the territory it once held in its self-styled 'caliphate.' The group has no remaining territory in Iraq.

Hajin, the group's last major stronghold in Syria, is close to being seized by U.S.-backed SDF forces.

After losing Hajin, ISIS will control a diminishing strip of territory along the eastern bank of the Euphrates River in the area where U.S.-backed operations are focused. The militants also control some desert terrain west of the river in territory otherwise controlled by the Damascus government and its allies.

But U.S. officials have warned that taking back the group's territory would not be the same as defeating it.

'Even as the end of the physical caliphate is clearly now coming into sight, the end of ISIS will be a much more long-term initiative,' McGurk told a State Department briefing on Dec. 11.

U.S. Marine General Joseph Dunford, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, cautioned earlier in December that the United States had trained only about 20 percent of Syrian forces required to stabilize areas captured from ISIS."

President Donald Trump's former national security advisor Michael Flynn admitted in open court Tuesday that he was 'guilty' of lying to the FBI and was excoriated by a federal judge for 'selling out' his country.

Flynn faced the real possibility of jail time following after Judge Emmet Sullivan repeatedly dressed-down the three-star general and former top Trump advisor in court.

'I cannot assure you, if you proceed today, you will not receive a sentence of incarceration, Sullivan told him. 'I'm not hiding my disgust, my disdain for this criminal offense,' he fumed.

Flynn sought a 30-minute break following his guilty plea after Sullivan told him he sold out his country by lying about his Russia contacts from inside the White House - and asked prosecutors why they hadn't charged Flynn with treason.

Sullivan tied together both of the crimes Flynn admitted to committing: lying to cover up his Russia contacts, and lobbying on behalf of Turkey without disclosing his activities - and banking hundreds of thousands of dollars in the process.

President Donald Trump's former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn, his attorney Robert Kelner and his wife Lori Andrade arrive at federal court in Washington, Tuesday, Dec. 18, 2018 for Flynn to receive sentencing following his guilty plea

'All along, you were an unregistered agent of a foreign country while serving as the National Security Advisor to the President of the United States. That undermines everything this flag over here stands for,' Sullivan thundered.

'Arguably you sold your country out.'

During the hearing, Flynn also told Sullivan knew that doing so was a crime when he met with investigators in 2016.

Flynn arrived in federal court for sentencing Tuesday following his guilty plea hours after getting 'good luck' wishes from his former boss.

During conversations with Sullivan in court, Flynn's team backed off it's claim that the FBI lead him into lying.

Asked if Flynn had been 'entrapped by the FBI, lawyer Stephen Anthony replied, 'No, your Honor.'

Judge Emmet Sullivan tore into Mike Flynn at his sentencing hearing

That comment by Flynn's team was directly contradicted by the White House, where press secretary Sarah Sanders said Flynn was 'ambushed' by FBI agents.

Sullivan asked Flynn if he wanted to go ahead with his hearing because he was guilty. 'Yes, your honor,' Flynn replied. He declined an opportunity to withdraw his guilty plea.

Judge Sullivan told Flynn he would consider the 'substantial assistance' he has given the Mueller probe as well as his '33 years of military service and sacrifice'.

Flynn also said he was 'aware' that lying to FBI investigators was a crime.

Flynn was hoping to avoid jail time after prosecutors vouched for his extensive cooperation with Special Counsel Robert Mueller, including 17 interviews.

Asked if Flynn was still assisting prosecutors, the government was coy. 'It remains a possibility,' a prosecutor said.

'The more you assist the government, the more you arguably help yourself at the time of sentencing,' Sullivan responded.

Sullivan lectured Flynn about what he admitted he did, calling it a 'very serious offense,' noting that it involved a senior official lying to the FBI 'while on the physical premises of the White House.'

'It's a very serious offense. You can't minimize that,' said the judge.

'Arguably, you sold your country out,' said Sullivan.

At one point, Sullivan asked prosecutor Brandon Van Grack whether what Flynn did 'rises to the level of treasonous activity?'

Van Grack said prosecutors did not consider charging him with Treason - which carries the death penalty as a possible punishment.

It was 'not something they had considered,' Van Grack responded.

'Could he have been charged with treason?' the judge asked.

Flynn came in for even more criticism over his admitted big bucks representation of Turkey without disclosing it.

Flynn, who received the unusual boost from the president's Twitter account, arrived amid a smattering of protesters, including one calling him Vladimir Putin's puppet' and another calling him innocent and a 'great patriot.'

He was in the fortuitous position of having both the prosecution and the defense recommend he not face jail time, after special counsel Robert Mueller's prosecutors cited his extensive prosecution with the Russia probe and other investigations.

Flynn, who was accompanied by his wife Lori on Tuesday, has pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his conversations with former Russian ambassador to the US, Sergey Kislyak.

Interview notes by the FBI released Monday night reveal Flynn had numerous conversations and contacts with Kislyak, but denied a substantive conversation about lifting U.S. sanctions on Russia.

In a tweet Tuesday morning, Trump also denied collusion with Russia during his election campaign.

He wrote: 'Good luck today in court to General Michael Flynn.'

The president also wrote: 'Will be interesting to see what he has to say, despite tremendous pressure being put on him, about Russian Collusion in our great and, obviously, highly successful political campaign. There was no Collusion!'

Former National Security Advisor Michael Flynn arrives for his sentencing hearing for lying to the FBI at the US Federal Court in Washington, DC, USA, 18 December 2018

It comes after Special Counsel Robert Mueller released a memo about the January 2017 interview in which Michael Flynn lied to the FBI about his contacts with the Russian government.

Sullivan, who received federal appointments from Presidents Reagan, George H.W. Bush, and Clinton, had ordered the special counsel to provide more documents, after Flynn's lawyers argued he was railroaded into giving an interview just days after starting work at the White House without benefit of having a lawyer present. The government argued that Flynn had long government service and should have known it was a crime not to be truthful with investigators.

At the interview, Flynn told investigators, among them now-former FBI agent Peter Strzok, about his conversations with Kislyak.

According to the 302 notes, when asked whether he pushed Russia for a particular position, 'FLYNN answered, 'No.'

Flynn 'stated the conversations were along the lines of where do you stand, and what's your position,' according to the 302.

The memo indicates that Flynn denied asking the Russian government for political favors, according to CNN.

The agents who interviewed him, meanwhile, kept pressing President Donald Trump's former National Security Adviser for more specifics.

It was that interview in which Flynn told investigators, among them now-former FBI agent Peter Strzok (above), about his conversations with then-Russian ambassador to the United States, Sergey Kislyak

Flynn told Strzok and other FBI agents who interviewed him that he and Kislyak did not discuss U.S. sanctions against Russia.

The memo also describes how Flynn played down his attempts to lobby Russia to oppose a United Nations Security Council resolution to condemn Israeli settlements.

Flynn initially told agents that he did not try to convince Russia to vote against the resolution.

'The interviewing agents asked Flynn if he recalled any discussions with Kislyak about a United Nations vote surrounding the issue of Israeli settlements,' the memo said.

'Flynn quickly responded, 'Yes, good reminder'.'

He was also asked by the agents whether he tried to encourage Kislyak and his government not to retaliate to the Obama administration's decision to expel Russian diplomats.

'Flynn responded, 'Not really. I don't remember.' It wasn't, 'Don't do anything.'

Liar, liar: Flynn will be sentenced for admitting lying to the FBI about his contact before the 2016 election with Kislyak, then Putin's ambassador to Washington D.C.

But the FBI knew Flynn asked Russia not to retaliate strongly to the expulsions, and had the benefit of monitoring of Kislyak's communications.

When Flynn pleaded guilty last year, he admitted that he did do just that.

The Special Counsel's office said in the memo that Flynn did ask Russia to 'refrain from escalating the situation.'

The memo was released after Flynn's lawyers suggested that investigators discouraged him from having an attorney present during the interview and never informed him it was a crime to lie.

Prosecutors shot back: 'He does not need to be warned it is a crime to lie to federal agents to know the importance of telling them the truth.'

The mere insinuation of underhanded tactics was startling given the seemingly productive relationship between the two sides, and it was especially striking since prosecutors with Mueller's office have praised Flynn's cooperation and recommended against prison time.

The defense arguments spurred speculation that Flynn, 59, may be trying to get sympathy from President Donald Trump or may be playing to a judge known for a zero-tolerance view of government misconduct.

At his side: Flynn became a vocal supporter of Trump and spoke at campaign rallies such as this one in Grand Junction, CO, and the Republican national convention in Cleveland, OH, where he led chants of 'lock her up'

Notorious meeting: Flynn traveled to Moscow in December 2015 and dined with Vladimir Putin to celebrate the 10th anniversary of RT, the Russian English-language propaganda channel

What a change of tone: In the run-up to his former aide's sentencing, Trump has turned from portraying him as a liar to saying that he did not, as the president steps up his attacks on the Mueller probe

'It's an attempt, I think, to perhaps characterize Flynn as a victim or perhaps to make him look sympathetic in the eyes of a judge - and, at the same time, to portray the special counsel in a negative light,' said former federal prosecutor Jimmy Gurule, a University of Notre Dame law school professor.

Until the dueling memos were filed last week, the sentencing hearing for Flynn - who pleaded guilty to lying about a conversation during the transition period with the then-Russian ambassador - was expected to be devoid of the drama characterizing other of Mueller's cases.

Prosecutors, for instance, have accused former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort of lying to them even after he agreed to cooperate.

Another potential target, Jerome Corsi, leaked draft court documents and accused Mueller's team of bullying him.

And George Papadopoulos, a Trump campaign adviser recently released from a two-week prison sentence, has lambasted the investigation and publicly claimed that he was set up.

Flynn, by contrast, has been notably silent even as his supporters advocated a more combative stance. He met privately with investigators 19 times and provided cooperation so extensive that prosecutors said he was entitled to avoid prison altogether.

Then came his sentencing memo.

Although Flynn and his attorneys stopped short of any direct accusations of wrongdoing, they took pains to note that Flynn, unlike other defendants in Mueller's investigation, was not informed that it was against the law to lie to the FBI.

They suggest the FBI, which approached Flynn at the White House just days after Trump's inauguration, played to his desire to keep the encounter quiet by telling him the quickest way to get the interview done was for him to be alone with the agents - rather than involve lawyers.

They also insinuate that Flynn, of Middletown, Rhode Island, deserves credit for not publicly seizing on the fact that FBI officials involved in the investigation later came under scrutiny themselves.

Former Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, who contacted Flynn to arrange the interview, was fired this year for what the Justice Department said was a lack of candor over a news media leak.

Strzok, one of the two agents who interviewed Flynn, was removed from Mueller's team and later fired for trading anti-Trump texts with another FBI official.

Tarnished: Flynn (left) became a three-star general while his brother Charlie (right) became a two-star general. Now one brother's service is overshadowed by his guilt. His mother Helen (center) had nine children with the Flynn's later father, Charles

Sentenced: Flynn will join his former cohort Michael Cohen - Trump's fixer - in having been sentenced. Cohen is due to report to federal prison in March

Business partners: Flynn was in business with Bijan Kian (second left). Kian, an Iranian-American, is now indicted on charges of lobbying illegally along with Flynn, who appears to have flipped on him. Flynn's wife Lori is expected at his sentencing

Mueller's team has sharply pushed back at any suggestion that Flynn was duped, with prosecutors responding in their own sentencing memo Friday that there was no obligation to warn Flynn against lying.

'A sitting National Security (Adviser), former head of an intelligence agency, retired Lieutenant General, and 33-year veteran of the armed forces knows he should not lie to federal agents,' prosecutors wrote.

Former FBI Director James Comey criticized the broadsides on the Flynn investigation during a Monday appearance on Capitol Hill, saying, 'They're up here attacking the FBI's investigation of a guy who pled guilty to lying to the FBI.'

Trump has made no secret that he sees Mueller's investigation as a 'witch hunt' and has continued to lash out at prosecutors he sees as biased against him and those who help them.

He's shown continued sympathy for Flynn, though, calling him a 'great person' and asserting - erroneously - that the FBI has said he didn't lie.

Flynn has not tried to retract his guilty plea, and there's every indication the sentencing will proceed as scheduled.

Arun Rao, a former Justice Department prosecutor in Maryland, said the defense memo is striking because it's 'inconsistent' with Flynn's cooperative stance so far.

'You also wonder in this very unusual situation,' he said, 'whether it is a play for a pardon.'

It's also possible that at least some of the defense arguments may resonate with U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan, who directed prosecutors to produce FBI records related to Flynn's interview.

Scalp: Flynn will become the fourth of Robert Mueller's targets to be sentenced

Sullivan was the judge in the Justice Department's botched prosecution of now-deceased Republican Sen. Ted Stevens of Alaska.

He dismissed the case after prosecutors admitted that they withheld exculpatory evidence, prompting the judge to say that in nearly 25 years on the bench, 'I've never seen anything approaching the mishandling and misconduct that I've seen in this case.'

In an opinion piece for The Wall Street Journal last year, Sullivan said the case inspired him to explicitly remind prosecutors in every criminal case before him of their obligation to provide defendants with favorable evidence. He says he has encouraged colleagues to do the same.

But while Sullivan has proved especially sensitive to hints of government overreach, nothing about the Flynn case comes close, said Gurule, the law professor.

'To portray him as somehow an innocent dupe, as somehow just this innocent victim in the process, this suggestion that there was a perjury trap - it's an absurd allegation,' he said.

But the sentencing also comes the day after a dramatic move by Mueller to arrest Flynn's former business partner and reveal that Flynn had been part of an effort to lobby illegally.

Bijan Kian, an Iranian-American who was number two to Flynn was arrested and appeared in federal court in Washington D.C. before being freed on bail.

He is charged with a plot to lobby for Turkey without declaring that he and Flynn's firm was working for the Turkish government, breaking the Foreign Agent Registration Act which makes it illegal to lobby for foreign governments without registering with the State Department. Kian has yet to enter a plea.

Also indicted was the business partner who worked with him and Flynn, Turkish-Dutch dual national Ekim Alpetkin, who is the subject of an arrest warrant and thought to be in Turkey.

Kian and Alpetkin are accused in court papers of a plot to convince the U.S. government to extradite or otherwise expel Fethullah Gulen, a Turkish cleric who is a deadly rival of the country's strongman president Recep Tayyip Erdogan.

Mueller says in the court papers that with Flynn, who is referred to a 'Person A' they placed an op-ed in The Hill newspaper without acknowledging that it was at the prompting of the Turkish government.

Flynn wrote the op-ed and his firm, The Flynn Intel Group, was paid $600,000 for their lobbying campaign - but he is not indicted himself in what appears to be a sign that he flipped on his former associates.

The special counsel has praised the former Trump administration official for his 'substantial help' in several investigations. It is believed this is one of them.

ROBERT MUELLER'S PROBE SO FAR: EIGHT CONVICTIONS - INCLUDING THREE TOP TRUMP AIDES, A JAILED ATTORNEY AND 25 RUSSIANS ACCUSED

GUILTY: MICHAEL FLYNN

Pleaded guilty to making false statements in December 2017. Awaiting sentence

Flynn was President Trump's former National Security Advisor and Robert Mueller's most senior scalp to date. He previously served when he was a three star general as President Obama's director of the Defense Intelligence Agency but was fired.

He admitted to lying to special counsel investigators about his conversations with a Russian ambassador in December 2016. He has agreed to cooperate with the special counsel investigation.

GUILTY: MICHAEL COHEN

Pleaded guilty to eight counts including fraud and two campaign finance violations in August 2018. Pleaded guilty to further count of lying to Congress in November 2018. Sentenced to three years in prison and $2 million in fines and forfeitures in December 2018

Cohen was Trump's longtime personal attorney, starting working for him and the Trump Organization in 2007. He is the longest-serving member of Trump's inner circle to be implicated by Mueller. Cohen professed unswerving devotion to Trump - and organized payments to silence two women who alleged they had sex with the-then candidate: porn star Stormy Daniels and Playboy model Karen McDougal. He admitted that payments to both women were felony campaign finance violations - and admitted that he acted at the 'direction' of 'Candidate-1': Donald Trump.

He also admitted tax fraud by lying about his income from loans he made, money from taxi medallions he owned, and other sources of income, at a cost to the Treasury of $1.3 million.

And he admitted lying to Congress in a rare use of the offense. The judge in his case let him report for prison on March 6 and recommended he serve it in a medium-security facility close to New York City.

GUILTY: PAUL MANAFORT

Found guilty of eight charges of bank and tax fraud in August 2018. Pleaded guilty to two further charges. Awaiting sentence

Manafort worked for Trump's campaign from March 2016 and chaired it from June to August 2016, overseeing Trump being adopted as Republican candidate at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland. He is the most senior campaign official to be implicated by Mueller. Manafort was one of Washington D.C.'s longest-term and most influential lobbyists but in 2015, his money dried up and the next year he turned to Trump for help, offering to be his campaign chairman for free - in the hope of making more money afterwards. But Mueller unwound his previous finances and discovered years of tax and bank fraud as he coined in cash from pro-Russia political parties and oligarchs in Ukraine.

Manafort pleaded not guilty to 18 charges of tax and bank fraud but was convicted of eight counts. The jury was deadlocked on the other 10 charges. A second trial on charges of failing to register as a foreign agent is due in September.

GUILTY: RICK GATES

Pleaded guilty to conspiracy against the United States and making false statements in February 2018. Awaiting sentence

Gates was Manafort's former deputy at political consulting firm DMP International. He admitted to conspiring to defraud the U.S. government on financial activity, and to lying to investigators about a meeting Manafort had with a member of congress in 2013. As a result of his guilty plea and promise of cooperation, prosecutors vacated charges against Gates on bank fraud, bank fraud conspiracy, failure to disclose foreign bank accounts, filing false tax returns, helping prepare false tax filings, and falsely amending tax returns.

GUILTY AND JAILED: GEORGE PAPADOPOLOUS

Pleaded guilty to making false statements in October 2017. Sentenced to 14 days in September 2018, and reported to prison in November. Served 12 days and released on December 7, 2018

Papadopoulos was a member of Donald Trump's campaign foreign policy advisory committee. He admitted to lying to special counsel investigators about his contacts with London professor Josef Mifsud and Ivan Timofeev, the director of a Russian government-funded think tank.

He has agreed to cooperate with the special counsel investigation.

GUILTY AND JAILED: RICHARD PINEDO

Pleaded guilty to identity fraud in February 2018. Sentenced to a year in prison

Pinedo is a 28-year-old computer specialist from Santa Paula, California. He admitted to selling bank account numbers to Russian nationals over the internet that he had obtained using stolen identities.

He has agreed to cooperate with the special counsel investigation.

GUILTY AND JAILED: ALEX VAN DER ZWAAN

Pleaded guilty to making false statements in February 2018. He served a 30-day prison sentence earlier this year and was deported to the Netherlands on his release

Van der Zwaan is a Dutch attorney for Skadden Arps who worked on a Ukrainian political analysis report for Paul Manafort in 2012.

He admitted to lying to special counsel investigators about when he last spoke with Rick Gates and Konstantin Kilimnik.

GUILTY: W. SAMUEL PATTEN

Pleaded guilty in August 2018 to failing to register as a lobbyist while doing work for a Ukrainian political party. Awaiting sentence

Patten, a long-time D.C. lobbyist was a business partner of Paul Manafort. He pleaded guilty to admitting to arranging an illegal $50,000 donation to Trump's inauguration.

He arranged for an American 'straw donor' to pay $50,000 to the inaugural committee, knowing that it was actually for a Ukrainian businessman.

Neither the American or the Ukrainian have been named.

CHARGED: KONSTANTIN KILIMNIK

Indicted for obstruction of justice and conspiracy to obstruct justice. At large, probably in Russia

Kilimnik is a former employee of Manafort's political consulting firm and helped him with lobbying work in Ukraine. He is accused of witness tampering, after he allegedly contacted individuals who had worked with Manafort to remind them that Manafort only performed lobbying work for them outside of the U.S.

He has been linked to Russian intelligence and is currently thought to be in Russia - effectively beyond the reach of extradition by Mueller's team.

INDICTED: THE RUSSIANS

Twenty-five Russian nationals and three Russian entities have been indicted for conspiracy to defraud the United States. They remain at large in Russia

Two of these Russian nationals were also indicted for conspiracy to commit wire fraud and 11 were indicted for conspiracy to launder money. Fifteen of them were also indicted for identity fraud.

Vladimir Putin has ridiculed the charges. Russia effectively bars extradition of its nationals. The only prospect Mueller has of bringing any in front of a U.S. jury is if Interpol has their names on an international stop list - which is not made public - and they set foot in a territory which extradites to the U.S.

INDICTED: MICHAEL FLYNN'S BUSINESS PARTNERS

Bijan Kian (left), number two in now disgraced former national security adviser Mike Flynn's lobbying company, and the two's business partner Ekim Alptekin (right) were indicted for conspiracy to lobby illegally. Kian is awaiting trial, Alptekin is still to appear in court

Kian, an Iranian-American was arrested and appeared in court charged with a conspiracy to illegally lobby the U.S government without registering as a foreign agent. Their co-conspirator was Flynn, who is called 'Person A' in the indictment and is not charged, offering some insight into what charges he escaped with his plea deal.

Kian, vice-president of Flynn's former lobbying firm, is alleged to have plotted with Alptekin to try to change U.S. policy on an exiled Turkish cleric, Fethullah Gulen, who lives in Pennsylvania and who is accused by Turkey's strongman president Recep Tayyip Erdogan, of trying to depose him.

Erdogan's government wanted him extradited from the U.S. and paid Flynn's firm through Alptekin for lobbying, including an op-ed in The Hill calling for Gulen to be ejected. Flynn and Kian both lied that the op-ed was not paid for by the Turkish government.

The indictment is a sign of how Mueller is taking an interest in more than just Russian involvement in the 2016 election."
439,daily mail online,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6596317/New-York-Sen-Kirsten-Gillibrand-launches-exploratory-committee-crowd-grows-Democratic-field.html,"By Emily Goodin, U.s. Political Reporter For Dailymail.com and Associated Press

New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand announced Tuesday that she's forming an exploratory committee for president of the United States.

She made her announcement on CBS' 'The Late Show with Stephen Colbert,' which released a clip of her decision.

Gillibrand clasped host Stephen Colbert's hands in excitement and took a deep breathe before she declared her intentions.

'I'm filing an exploratory committee for president of the United States. Tonight,' she told him as the crowd roared.

Gillibrand is a longtime advocate for women and has been a leader in the #metoo movement against sexual assault.

'I'm going to run for president of the United States because as a young mom I'm going to fight for other people's kids as hard as I fight for my own, which is why I believe healthcare should be a right, not a privilege. It's why I believe we should we have better public schools for our kids because it shouldn't matter what block you grow up on. And I believe anybody that works hard enough should be able to get whatever job training they need to earn their way into the middle class,' she said.

She added: 'But you are never going to accomplish any of these things if you don't take on the systems of power which make all of that impossible, which is taking on institutional racism, it's taking on the corruption and greed in Washington, it's taking on the special interests which write legislation in the dead night and I know that I have compassion, the courage and the fearless determination to get that done.'

She will head to Iowa, an early caucus state in the 2020 nomination process, this weekend.

On Friday, Gillibrand will be in Sioux City and then head to Ames, Des Moines and Cedar Rapids throughout the weekend.

She joins a crowded Democratic field that includes several women.

Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Gillibrand's Senate colleague, launched an exploratory committee in December, while former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Julian Castro also tossed his hat in.

Fellow Sens. Kamala Harris and Amy Klobuchar are also considering bids.

Gillibrand was appointed to the Senate in 2009 to succeed Hillary Clinton, who became secretary of state. She easily won re-election in November and has $10.6 million in her campaign fund, which can be used to jump-start a presidential bid.

Her move comes as, after months of speculation and secrecy, the 2020 presidential primary season is about to explode.

With several Democrats already in the race, a half dozen more are locking down final travel, staffing and strategy to launch White House bids in the coming weeks.

Looks like a runner: Kirsten Gillibrand, the junior senator from New York, could announce as early as this week that she is mounting a White House run

Joining up: Cory Booker, the junior New Jersey senator, and Kamala Harris, the junior California senator, are both expected to announce White House runs soon

While plans may change, the announcements are expected to come in waves, the first featuring a group of ambitious Senate Democrats including Gillibrand, California Sen. Kamala Harris and New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, who face pressure to join the race after Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren's entrance two weeks ago.

The second wave will likely feature political heavyweights like former Vice President Joe Biden, Vermont Sen.

Bernie Sanders, New York billionaire Michael Bloomberg and former Texas Congressman Beto O'Rourke, whose advisers believe they have sufficient financial backing and name recognition to join the crowded field on their terms later in the first quarter should they decide to run.

'It is really starting to heat up,' said Deidre DeJear, who lost her bid for Iowa secretary of state last fall, but remains an influential figure in the state's first-in-the-nation Democratic caucuses. She was among a group of Iowa Democratic women who sat down with Warren last week in suburban Des Moines.

'I feel like Warren put people in a place as if to say 'come on, step up,'' DeJear said in a subsequent interview. 'If you're in it, you're in it. No reason to wait now.'

Interviews with senior aides for several top Democratic prospects, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal planning, indicate the waiting game is almost over.

Former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper, who left office last week, added foreign policy adviser Jeremy Rosner, finance director Dan Sorenson and a senior communications adviser Marie Logsden to his political action committee in recent days, according to an aide. Hickenlooper is traveling to Los Angeles this week to meet with donors and has scheduled visits to early voting states later in the month.

The 66-year-old term-limited governor and former businessman, who remains largely unknown to many primary voters, does not plan to launch his campaign before March.

Sanders, the lone 2020 prospect who ran in 2016, has interviewed close to 20 people to fill senior positions such as campaign manager and directors of policy, communications and his field program.

A senior aide said the hiring process has been particularly focused on adding diversity - in both gender and race - that didn't exist in his last presidential campaign.

The aide said allegations of sexual harassment between Sanders' former campaign staff had no impact on the timeline of an announcement, which is not expected before the end of the month.

Despite his challenges, Sanders is sitting on a war chest of roughly $15 million and an active nationwide network. In a show of early force, liberal activists hosted hundreds of house parties across the nation on Saturday to cheer on a second Sanders run.

Meanwhile, O'Rourke, 46, is taking steps toward a run, but an aide said he's not expected to announce until next month at the earliest.

However, he's traveling outside Texas to introduce himself to voters in the coming weeks. Oprah is scheduled to interview him in New York City next month.

The first states on the primary calendar are not on O'Rourke's immediate itinerary, but that's not stopping supporters in Iowa and South Carolina from launching draft efforts.

A leader of South Carolina's 'Draft Beto' movement, former Democratic National Committee member Boyd Brown, said he's having conversations with Democratic donors, local officials and potential staffers, to help stave off commitments to other candidates as the field starts to take shape.

Is he in? Beto O'Rourke, who ran Ted Cruz into the margin of error in Texas but was still defeated, is at the center of widespread speculation

What about Bernie: The socialist who took on Hillary Clinton has been hit by revelations of sexual harassment claims inside his 2016 campaign but could still run

'We might be taking a shot in the dark, but we're building an apparatus that we can hand off to an actual campaign should he run,' Brown said in an interview. 'We're treating this like a presidential campaign until told otherwise.'

A more seasoned political star, Biden remains silent about his plans. The 76-year-old Democrat has done little to build teams on the ground in key states, instead sticking to the schedule of huddling with aides while he moves closer to a decision.

While it may seem early, the sheer size of the likely field makes it difficult for some candidates to wait much longer.

Upward of two dozen high-profile Democrats could run for a chance to deny President Donald Trump a second term.

The first Democratic primary debate will take place in June, while the first primary contest is likely a year away. With a field this big, there's only so many donors and top staffers to go around.

'At this point the cycle, it's a race for money and talent, and unless your name is Joe Biden or Beto O'Rourke, you've gotta get in soon if you want attract either one of those things,' said former Obama strategist Stephanie Cutter, who has been offering advice to some contenders.

Gillibrand, 52, joins some of her Senate colleagues on a more aggressive timeline. She's already identified a likely location for a campaign headquarters, added staff and planned trips to key states.

The Democratic senator is eying a headquarters in Troy, New York, a small upstate city on the Hudson River.

Gillibrand, who has made headlines with her work against sexual violence - and occasional profanity in public speeches - is scheduled to make her Iowa debut this weekend.

Booker is expected to run his campaign from Newark, where he lives and served as mayor.

The 49-year-old Democrat has identified a likely campaign manager, Addisu Demissee.

The Democratic operative previously managed Booker's special election campaign in 2013 and subsequently worked for Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign and most recently led California Gov. Gavin Newsome's successful gubernatorial bid.

Like Gillibrand and Booker, Harris is expected to join the race in the coming weeks.

The first-term senator and former California attorney general has broadened her national profile in recent days by launching a tour to promote her book, 'The Truths We Hold.'

Like her would-be competitors, the 54-year-old Democrat has not publicly committed to running, but she has said repeatedly that the country needs a leader who 'provides a vision of the future of the country in which everyone can see themselves.'

A handful of lesser-known candidates have already entered the race.

Hawaii Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard, 37, announced her intention to run in a CNN interview that aired on Saturday.

That same day, former Obama housing chief Julian Castro formally kicked off his campaign Saturday in his San Antonio hometown.

Not to be forgotten, Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar are openly considering joining the 2020 contest, although neither is as far along in preparations as their potential rivals.

Meanwhile, Washington state Gov. Jay Inslee is scheduled to make his first New Hampshire appearance next week.

He talked up his liberal record and willingness to take on Trump during a weekend appearance in Nevada.

'He cannot stop us,' Inslee said of the president. 'He has not stopped me, either.'

In September 2016, Rapert tweeted an image of the Twin Towers to then-president Barack Obama with the question, ""how could you embrace Islam & open our borders to Muslims when you know they are responsible for 9/11?"" That same month, Rapert again tweeted, ""as I listen to testimonies about 9/11 & the innocent people killed by Muslims, I'm angered that @BarackObama has embraced Islam #NeverForget."" Obama is not a Muslim -- a conspiracy touted since 2004 to discredit him. But even if he was, many have argued that the conspiracy implies that being Muslim and being American are incompatible."
441,daily mail online,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/debate/article-6529243/SARAH-VINE-learned-REALLY-matters-Christmas.html,"Potatoes. Every year I forget something crucial, so it was that on Christmas Eve, when most sane people are settling into their third eggnog, I was shoulder-to-shoulder with all the other Yuletide inadequates, frantically scrabbling for the last bag of King Edwards in Waitrose.

I had just secured my bounty when the mobile rang. It was my 14-year-old son. 'Hello,' I said cheerily. 'How are things?'

He replied with a howl of anguish. It took me several minutes to establish the precise details of his predicament, but in essence it appeared he had tripped over the Christmas tree and fallen through the plate glass French windows.

I asked him to switch his phone to FaceTime and was confronted with a white-faced child with a huge gash on his shoulder -- about 10cm long and deep enough so you could see the bone and tissues. On the same arm, a strip of flesh was hanging, like something out of a horror movie.

It took me several minutes to establish the precise details of his predicament, but in essence it appeared he had tripped over the Christmas tree and fallen through the plate glass French windows (stock image)

I put down the spuds and ran. It took me about ten minutes to get home, by which time he was sitting on the stairs with the front door open, shaking and covered in bloodied kitchen towels.

His lips were blue, and the hall was looking distinctly Quentin Tarantino. Both French door windowpanes were jagged, gaping holes. Carpet, presents, tree were all covered in a fine spattering of blood.

On my dash back I'd managed to call an ambulance. While waiting for it, I remembered a distant first-aid course and did my best to apply pressure to the gaping wounds.

His main concern, bless him, was that I would be cross because of the broken windows and ruined carpet. By the time the ambulance crew arrived the situation was a little more under control. My daughter had mopped up a lot of the blood and Will had calmed down considerably.

In fact, the crew seemed more concerned for my husband, who was gasping for air having sprinted back from the Tube station. Not until they saw the lacerations did they realise we weren't time-wasters. Their eyes widened, the nurse visibly gagged and not long after we were on our way to A&E.

I won't bore you with the details of the next seven hours, save to say that we were looked after brilliantly at the hospital by staff who stitched the boy up a treat.

We emerged late into a cold, crisp Christmas Eve, my son excited at the prospect of some thrilling scars with which to wow the girls, already sharing the gruesome pictures on Snapchat.

This time of year seems to always go hand-in-hand with disaster, from exploding ovens to explosive rows (I remember one Vine family Christmas when relations were so bad I actually had to put my father on a plane back to Italy). But even by our standards, this has been rather a shocker.

SARAH VINE: Had Will's Guardian Angel not been paying close attention this Christmas Eve, I could have been facing a very different Christmas from the one I've just enjoyed

It's not just the what-ifs that haunt me. That, had he fallen an inch to the side either way, he could easily have severed a ligament or, much worse, an artery. Or if had I missed his call -- as I often do -- I might not have got home in time. It's the fact that, when it comes to Christmas, we really have lost the plot. It has become such a silly, stressful, over-hyped time of year.

We agonise over finding just the right present, sourcing the perfect turkey (bankrupting ourselves in the process), over-eat, over-drink, over-think the whole damn thing.

But at the end of the day, none of it really matters. What's important are the ones you love, and their health and happiness.

In striving so hard for the material things it becomes all too easy to overlook what's really important. To take for granted the things that are truly precious.

And life -- the life of those we love -- is so fragile. It can turn on a sixpence, whether by natural disaster (the terrible tsunami that has claimed so many lives in Indonesia) -- or simple accident (tripping over the Christmas tree).

Had Will's Guardian Angel not been paying close attention this Christmas Eve, I could have been facing a very different Christmas from the one I've just enjoyed.

Instead, I had the pleasure of being dragged out of bed at silly o'clock by him as usual, of seeing the smile on his face as he unwrapped his presents, of making him pigs in blankets and scrambled eggs for breakfast.

I even rather enjoyed the traditional row between him and his sister over Monopoly.

In fact, I've had the best present of all. A truly special Christmas Day, one with real meaning -- and full of gratitude for my great good fortune in life.

A transgender Bond? It's a mission too far

Caroline Cossey, pictured, born male, memorably appeared in For Your Eyes Only in 1981

Actor Dominic West, in a barely concealed bid no doubt to ingratiate himself with the new Equality mafia in Hollywood, has suggested that the next James Bond should be transgender.

I have no problem whatsoever with the notion of a transgender spy (or indeed Bond girl -- Caroline Cossey, pictured, born male, memorably appeared in For Your Eyes Only in 1981).

But what I don't understand is why there's so much fuss over James Bond. 007 is the literary creation of one man, Ian Fleming. His personality is that of an unreconstructed post-war male, a womanising, show-off daredevil with more than a streak of chauvinism about him.

Yes, he's a relic of a bygone age, but so are countless much-loved literary characters. You can't suddenly reinvent them all for these post-PC times.

What next, Lady Macbeth re-cast as a #MeToo campaigner, or Heathcliff as a stay-at-home dad?

By all means let's create new icons that better reflect our times. But can we please leave the classics alone, and enjoy them for what they are, rather than what we think they ought to be?

What bargains did Kate buy?

It's a question that threatens to divide the nation almost as much as Leave or Remain. In the great War of the Windsors, are you Team Kate or Team Meghan?

I wasn't quite sure, to begin with. After all, I love an outsider and Meghan has come an impressively long way from her American roots. But there has always been something just a little too perfect about her that makes me wonder how much is engineered for the cameras.

That is definitely not true of Kate. What you see is what you get with the Duchess of Cambridge. Witness her last-minute, Christmas shopping trip to budget superstore The Range, just outside King's Lynn, Norfolk, to stock up on cheap and cheerful stocking fillers. The future Queen, queueing at the tills like anyone else.

I wonder what she bought. A Grumpy In A Jumpy knitted bear cushion (£7.99) for Prince Philip? A Fairytale Princess Classic Doll and Horse Playset (£10.99) for Anne? The Balmoral Cushion (£6.99) for the Queen?

And for her beloved brother-in-law Harry and his lovely bride? No better gift, surely, than the Warm Happy Ending Plaque with the charming message: 'Christmas is the warm happy ending to our family's story each year.' A snip at £1.13 -- now reduced to 76p. It's the thought that counts.

Michelle, the First Lady of glam rock

While her husband was the President of the U.S., Michelle Obama (pictured) was the model of the dutiful political wife. But now that she is once again a free woman, we are starting to see a glimpse of the real Michelle -- and it's rather outrageous, thigh-high glittery Balenciaga boots and all.

Makes you wonder what other political spouses would be like if unshackled from the constraints of power. Philip May in leather trousers, anyone?

While her husband was the President of the U.S., Michelle Obama (pictured) was the model of the dutiful political wife

Keira Knightley has detailed how she was diagnosed with PTSD at the age of 22 as a result of her early rise to fame and the accompanying Press attention.

Tough, I'll grant you; but however much of a double-edged sword fame can be, surely in the long run it's better than stacking shelves in a supermarket?

Today is officially my favourite day of the entire year: presents done, food cooked and eaten, family comatose -- and best of all a full 364 days until I have to do it all over again!"

443,daily mail online,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6542905/White-House-swears-Trump-Oval-marines-guard-West-Wing-missing.html,"The White House slapped back at suggestions on Monday that the president was not in the Oval Office working when he said that he was in a morning tweet.

The Marine sentry who stands guard outside the West Wing whenever the president is in it was not as his post, suggesting the president was elsewhere.

Deputy press secretary Hogan Gidley said in an afternoon tweet that Trump was, in fact, in the Oval Office, even though a Marine was not standing guard outside.

'I just looked into the Oval Office myself, and @POTUS was in fact sitting behind the Resolute Desk working,' he said.

The White House slapped back at suggestions on Monday that the president was not in the Oval Office working when he said that he was in a tweet

The Marine sentry who stands guard outside the West Wing whenever the president is in it was not as his post, suggesting the president was elsewhere

Trump has not been seen in the Oval Office by reporters since Christmas Day

Sources inside and outside the White House have been unable to explain to DailyMail.com where the Marine, who is on a four-man rotation, has been over the past week.

On several occasions over the holidays when Trump claimed to within, the Marine was not standing outside, including on Monday morning when Trump tweeted to say he was 'in the Oval Office' waiting for Democrats to approve the funding for his border wall.

A 10:37 am tweet said: 'I'm in the Oval Office. Democrats, come back from vacation now and give us the votes necessary for Border Security, including the Wall. You voted yes in 2006 and 2013. One more yes, but with me in office, I'll get it built, and Fast!'

White House reporters posted photos of the West Wing entrance and noted that the Marine was missing.

Marine sentries guarding the West Wing normally rotate through their shifts every half-hour when Trump is his office and have done so for the last decade. No one could explain to DailyMail.com on Monday why they have not been seen at their posts for more than a week.

The Pentagon directed a request for comment to the White House. The White House suggested calling the Pentagon for up-to-date information.

Marine sentries act as the doorman for the president and a symbol of his presence 'whenever he is in the West Wing working,' a December 2009 video released by Barack Obama's White House explains.

They are responsible for opening the door for guests and staffers who enter and exit the West Wing, as well. Secret Service alerts them to movements by the president and approaching guests with a buzzer.

Four sentries working 30-minute shifts guard the West Wing from the time the president enters until he departs.

Reporters use the West Wing Marine to track the president's comings and goings from the Oval Office to the residence and other locations on and off the White House grounds.

Last week, when the Marine was not at his post all morning, journalists suspected the president had made a covert trip to an American outpost overseas.

The president and his wife were in Iraq on a secret visit to Al Asad Airbase.

Trump's deputy spokesman insisted on Monday that Trump was not only in the United States but at his desk working. He said he'd seen the president with his own eyes in a 12:50 pm tweet bashing reporters who did not inquire to the press office about the president's whereabouts.

President Trump has not been out in public since he dined at the vice president's residence on Friday night. The last time he was seen in the Oval Office by journalists was on Christmas Day.

Last week, when the Marine was not at his post all morning, journalists suspected the president had made a covert trip to an American outpost overseas. He did - he was in Iraq

Twice on Christmas Eve the president claimed he was in the Oval, even though the West Wing Marine was not outside at the time of his tweets.

He claimed in one that he was was receiving a briefing on North Korea, as he sent out a photo of himself and two specialists in the administration who work on that issue area.

Another tweet said: 'I am in the Oval Office & just gave out a 115 mile long contract for another large section of the Wall in Texas. We are already building and renovating many miles of Wall, some complete. Democrats must end Shutdown and finish funding. Billions of Dollars, & lives, will be saved!'

The president claimed in a Saturday morning tweet that he was 'in the White House waiting for the Democrats to come on over and make a deal on Border Security' as he mocked reports describing them as giddy to investigate him.

That tweet notably stated that he was at the White House complex and did not claim that he was in the Oval Office."
444,daily mail online,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6506495/Mueller-releases-Flynns-fateful-FBI-interview-infamous-agent-Peter-Strzok.html,"Special Counsel Robert Mueller released a memo about the January 2017 interview in which Michael Flynn lied to the FBI about his contacts with the Russian government.

It was that interview in which Flynn told investigators, among them now-former FBI agent Peter Strzok, about his conversations with then-Russian ambassador to the United States, Sergey Kislyak.

The memo indicates that Flynn denied asking the Russian government for political favors, according to CNN.

The agents who interviewed him, meanwhile, kept pressing President Donald Trump's former National Security Adviser for more specifics.

Last year, Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI about his conversations with Kislyak.

He is scheduled to be sentenced on Tuesday.

Special Counsel Robert Mueller (left) released a memo about the January 2017 interview in which Michael Flynn (right) lied to the FBI about his contacts with the Russian government

It was that interview in which Flynn told investigators, among them now-former FBI agent Peter Strzok (above), about his conversations with then-Russian ambassador to the United States, Sergey Kislyak

Flynn told Strzok and other FBI agents who interviewed him that he and Kislyak did not discuss U.S. sanctions against Russia.

The memo also describes how Flynn played down his attempts to lobby Russia to oppose a United Nations Security Council resolution to condemn Israeli settlements.

Flynn initially told agents that he did not try to convince Russia to vote against the resolution.

'The interviewing agents asked Flynn if he recalled any discussions with Kislyak about a United Nations vote surrounding the issue of Israeli settlements,' the memo said.

'Flynn quickly responded, ""Yes, good reminder"".'

He was also asked by the agents whether he tried to encourage Kislyak and his government not to retaliate to the Obama administration's decision to expel Russian diplomats.

'Flynn responded, ""Not really. I don't remember.""

Liar, liar: Flynn will be sentenced for admitting lying to the FBI about his contact before the 2016 election with Kislyak, then Putin's ambassador to Washington D.C.

'It wasn't, ""Don't do anything"",' the memo said.

But the FBI knew Flynn asked Russia not to retaliate strongly to the expulsions.

When Flynn pleaded guilty last year, he admitted that he did do just that.

The Special Counsel's office said in the memo that Flynn did ask Russia to 'refrain from escalating the situation.'

The memo was released after Flynn's lawyers suggested that investigators discouraged him from having an attorney present during the interview and never informed him it was a crime to lie.

Prosecutors shot back: 'He does not need to be warned it is a crime to lie to federal agents to know the importance of telling them the truth.'

The mere insinuation of underhanded tactics was startling given the seemingly productive relationship between the two sides, and it was especially striking since prosecutors with Mueller's office have praised Flynn's cooperation and recommended against prison time.

The defense arguments spurred speculation that Flynn, 59, may be trying to get sympathy from President Donald Trump or may be playing to a judge known for a zero-tolerance view of government misconduct.

At his side: Flynn became a vocal supporter of Trump and spoke at campaign rallies such as this one in Grand Junction, CO, and the Republican national convention in Cleveland, OH, where he led chants of 'lock her up'

Notorious meeting: Flynn traveled to Moscow in December 2015 and dined with Vladimir Putin to celebrate the 10th anniversary of RT, the Russian English-language propaganda channel

What a change of tone: In the run-up to his former aide's sentencing, Trump has turned from portraying him as a liar to saying that he did not, as the president steps up his attacks on the Mueller probe

'It's an attempt, I think, to perhaps characterize Flynn as a victim or perhaps to make him look sympathetic in the eyes of a judge - and, at the same time, to portray the special counsel in a negative light,' said former federal prosecutor Jimmy Gurule, a University of Notre Dame law school professor.

Until the dueling memos were filed last week, the sentencing hearing for Flynn - who pleaded guilty to lying about a conversation during the transition period with the then-Russian ambassador - was expected to be devoid of the drama characterizing other of Mueller's cases.

Prosecutors, for instance, have accused former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort of lying to them even after he agreed to cooperate.

Another potential target, Jerome Corsi, leaked draft court documents and accused Mueller's team of bullying him.

And George Papadopoulos, a Trump campaign adviser recently released from a two-week prison sentence, has lambasted the investigation and publicly claimed that he was set up.

Flynn, by contrast, has been notably silent even as his supporters advocated a more combative stance. He met privately with investigators 19 times and provided cooperation so extensive that prosecutors said he was entitled to avoid prison altogether.

Then came his sentencing memo.

Although Flynn and his attorneys stopped short of any direct accusations of wrongdoing, they took pains to note that Flynn, unlike other defendants in Mueller's investigation, was not informed that it was against the law to lie to the FBI.

They suggest the FBI, which approached Flynn at the White House just days after Trump's inauguration, played to his desire to keep the encounter quiet by telling him the quickest way to get the interview done was for him to be alone with the agents - rather than involve lawyers.

They also insinuate that Flynn, of Middletown, Rhode Island, deserves credit for not publicly seizing on the fact that FBI officials involved in the investigation later came under scrutiny themselves.

Former Deputy Director Andrew McCabe, who contacted Flynn to arrange the interview, was fired this year for what the Justice Department said was a lack of candor over a news media leak.

Strzok, one of the two agents who interviewed Flynn, was removed from Mueller's team and later fired for trading anti-Trump texts with another FBI official.

Tarnished: Flynn (left) became a three-star general while his brother Charlie (right) became a two-star general. Now one brother's service is overshadowed by his guilt. His mother Helen (center) had nine children with the Flynn's later father, Charles

Sentenced: Flynn will join his former cohort Michael Cohen - Trump's fixer - in having been sentenced. Cohen is due to report to federal prison in March

Business partners: Flynn was in business with Bijan Kian (second left). Kian, an Iranian-American, is now indicted on charges of lobbying illegally along with Flynn, who appears to have flipped on him. Flynn's wife Lori is expected at his sentencing

Mueller's team has sharply pushed back at any suggestion that Flynn was duped, with prosecutors responding in their own sentencing memo Friday that there was no obligation to warn Flynn against lying.

'A sitting National Security (Adviser), former head of an intelligence agency, retired Lieutenant General, and 33-year veteran of the armed forces knows he should not lie to federal agents,' prosecutors wrote.

Former FBI Director James Comey criticized the broadsides on the Flynn investigation during a Monday appearance on Capitol Hill, saying, 'They're up here attacking the FBI's investigation of a guy who pled guilty to lying to the FBI.'

Trump has made no secret that he sees Mueller's investigation as a 'witch hunt' and has continued to lash out at prosecutors he sees as biased against him and those who help them.

He's shown continued sympathy for Flynn, though, calling him a 'great person' and asserting - erroneously - that the FBI has said he didn't lie.

Flynn has not tried to retract his guilty plea, and there's every indication the sentencing will proceed as scheduled.

Arun Rao, a former Justice Department prosecutor in Maryland, said the defense memo is striking because it's 'inconsistent' with Flynn's cooperative stance so far.

'You also wonder in this very unusual situation,' he said, 'whether it is a play for a pardon.'

It's also possible that at least some of the defense arguments may resonate with U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan, who directed prosecutors to produce FBI records related to Flynn's interview.

Scalp: Flynn will become the fourth of Robert Mueller's targets to be sentenced

Sullivan was the judge in the Justice Department's botched prosecution of now-deceased Republican Sen. Ted Stevens of Alaska.

He dismissed the case after prosecutors admitted that they withheld exculpatory evidence, prompting the judge to say that in nearly 25 years on the bench, 'I've never seen anything approaching the mishandling and misconduct that I've seen in this case.'

In an opinion piece for The Wall Street Journal last year, Sullivan said the case inspired him to explicitly remind prosecutors in every criminal case before him of their obligation to provide defendants with favorable evidence. He says he has encouraged colleagues to do the same.

But while Sullivan has proved especially sensitive to hints of government overreach, nothing about the Flynn case comes close, said Gurule, the law professor.

'To portray him as somehow an innocent dupe, as somehow just this innocent victim in the process, this suggestion that there was a perjury trap - it's an absurd allegation,' he said.

But the sentencing also comes the day after a dramatic move by Mueller to arrest Flynn's former business partner and reveal that Flynn had been part of an effort to lobby illegally.

Bijan Kian, an Iranian-American who was number two to Flynn was arrested and appeared in federal court in Washington D.C. before being freed on bail.

He is charged with a plot to lobby for Turkey without declaring that he and Flynn's firm was working for the Turkish government, breaking the Foreign Agent Registration Act which makes it illegal to lobby for foreign governments without registering with the State Department. Kian has yet to enter a plea.

Also indicted was the business partner who worked with him and Flynn, Turkish-Dutch dual national Ekim Alpetkin, who is the subject of an arrest warrant and thought to be in Turkey.

Kian and Alpetkin are accused in court papers of a plot to convince the U.S. government to extradite or otherwise expel Fethullah Gulen, a Turkish cleric who is a deadly rival of the country's strongman president Recep Tayyip Erdogan.

Mueller says in the court papers that with Flynn, who is referred to a 'Person A' they placed an op-ed in The Hill newspaper without acknowledging that it was at the prompting of the Turkish government.

Flynn wrote the op-ed and his firm, The Flynn Intel Group, was paid $600,000 for their lobbying campaign - but he is not indicted himself in what appears to be a sign that he flipped on his former associates.

The special counsel has praised the former Trump administration official for his 'substantial help' in several investigations. It is believed this is one of them.

ROBERT MUELLER'S PROBE SO FAR: EIGHT CONVICTIONS - INCLUDING THREE TOP TRUMP AIDES, A JAILED ATTORNEY AND 25 RUSSIANS ACCUSED

GUILTY: MICHAEL FLYNN

Pleaded guilty to making false statements in December 2017. Awaiting sentence

Flynn was President Trump's former National Security Advisor and Robert Mueller's most senior scalp to date. He previously served when he was a three star general as President Obama's director of the Defense Intelligence Agency but was fired.

He admitted to lying to special counsel investigators about his conversations with a Russian ambassador in December 2016. He has agreed to cooperate with the special counsel investigation.

GUILTY: MICHAEL COHEN

Pleaded guilty to eight counts including fraud and two campaign finance violations in August 2018. Pleaded guilty to further count of lying to Congress in November 2018. Sentenced to three years in prison and $2 million in fines and forfeitures in December 2018

Cohen was Trump's longtime personal attorney, starting working for him and the Trump Organization in 2007. He is the longest-serving member of Trump's inner circle to be implicated by Mueller. Cohen professed unswerving devotion to Trump - and organized payments to silence two women who alleged they had sex with the-then candidate: porn star Stormy Daniels and Playboy model Karen McDougal. He admitted that payments to both women were felony campaign finance violations - and admitted that he acted at the 'direction' of 'Candidate-1': Donald Trump.

He also admitted tax fraud by lying about his income from loans he made, money from taxi medallions he owned, and other sources of income, at a cost to the Treasury of $1.3 million.

And he admitted lying to Congress in a rare use of the offense. The judge in his case let him report for prison on March 6 and recommended he serve it in a medium-security facility close to New York City.

GUILTY: PAUL MANAFORT

Found guilty of eight charges of bank and tax fraud in August 2018. Pleaded guilty to two further charges. Awaiting sentence

Manafort worked for Trump's campaign from March 2016 and chaired it from June to August 2016, overseeing Trump being adopted as Republican candidate at the Republican National Convention in Cleveland. He is the most senior campaign official to be implicated by Mueller. Manafort was one of Washington D.C.'s longest-term and most influential lobbyists but in 2015, his money dried up and the next year he turned to Trump for help, offering to be his campaign chairman for free - in the hope of making more money afterwards. But Mueller unwound his previous finances and discovered years of tax and bank fraud as he coined in cash from pro-Russia political parties and oligarchs in Ukraine.

Manafort pleaded not guilty to 18 charges of tax and bank fraud but was convicted of eight counts. The jury was deadlocked on the other 10 charges. A second trial on charges of failing to register as a foreign agent is due in September.

GUILTY: RICK GATES

Pleaded guilty to conspiracy against the United States and making false statements in February 2018. Awaiting sentence

Gates was Manafort's former deputy at political consulting firm DMP International. He admitted to conspiring to defraud the U.S. government on financial activity, and to lying to investigators about a meeting Manafort had with a member of congress in 2013. As a result of his guilty plea and promise of cooperation, prosecutors vacated charges against Gates on bank fraud, bank fraud conspiracy, failure to disclose foreign bank accounts, filing false tax returns, helping prepare false tax filings, and falsely amending tax returns.

GUILTY AND JAILED: GEORGE PAPADOPOLOUS

Pleaded guilty to making false statements in October 2017. Sentenced to 14 days in September 2018, and reported to prison in November. Served 12 days and released on December 7, 2018

Papadopoulos was a member of Donald Trump's campaign foreign policy advisory committee. He admitted to lying to special counsel investigators about his contacts with London professor Josef Mifsud and Ivan Timofeev, the director of a Russian government-funded think tank.

He has agreed to cooperate with the special counsel investigation.

GUILTY AND JAILED: RICHARD PINEDO

Pleaded guilty to identity fraud in February 2018. Sentenced to a year in prison

Pinedo is a 28-year-old computer specialist from Santa Paula, California. He admitted to selling bank account numbers to Russian nationals over the internet that he had obtained using stolen identities.

He has agreed to cooperate with the special counsel investigation.

GUILTY AND JAILED: ALEX VAN DER ZWAAN

Pleaded guilty to making false statements in February 2018. He served a 30-day prison sentence earlier this year and was deported to the Netherlands on his release

Van der Zwaan is a Dutch attorney for Skadden Arps who worked on a Ukrainian political analysis report for Paul Manafort in 2012.

He admitted to lying to special counsel investigators about when he last spoke with Rick Gates and Konstantin Kilimnik.

GUILTY: W. SAMUEL PATTEN

Pleaded guilty in August 2018 to failing to register as a lobbyist while doing work for a Ukrainian political party. Awaiting sentence

Patten, a long-time D.C. lobbyist was a business partner of Paul Manafort. He pleaded guilty to admitting to arranging an illegal $50,000 donation to Trump's inauguration.

He arranged for an American 'straw donor' to pay $50,000 to the inaugural committee, knowing that it was actually for a Ukrainian businessman.

Neither the American or the Ukrainian have been named.

CHARGED: KONSTANTIN KILIMNIK

Indicted for obstruction of justice and conspiracy to obstruct justice. At large, probably in Russia

Kilimnik is a former employee of Manafort's political consulting firm and helped him with lobbying work in Ukraine. He is accused of witness tampering, after he allegedly contacted individuals who had worked with Manafort to remind them that Manafort only performed lobbying work for them outside of the U.S.

He has been linked to Russian intelligence and is currently thought to be in Russia - effectively beyond the reach of extradition by Mueller's team.

INDICTED: THE RUSSIANS

Twenty-five Russian nationals and three Russian entities have been indicted for conspiracy to defraud the United States. They remain at large in Russia

Two of these Russian nationals were also indicted for conspiracy to commit wire fraud and 11 were indicted for conspiracy to launder money. Fifteen of them were also indicted for identity fraud.

Vladimir Putin has ridiculed the charges. Russia effectively bars extradition of its nationals. The only prospect Mueller has of bringing any in front of a U.S. jury is if Interpol has their names on an international stop list - which is not made public - and they set foot in a territory which extradites to the U.S.

INDICTED: MICHAEL FLYNN'S BUSINESS PARTNERS

Bijan Kian (left), number two in now disgraced former national security adviser Mike Flynn's lobbying company, and the two's business partner Ekim Alptekin (right) were indicted for conspiracy to lobby illegally. Kian is awaiting trial, Alptekin is still to appear in court

Kian, an Iranian-American was arrested and appeared in court charged with a conspiracy to illegally lobby the U.S government without registering as a foreign agent. Their co-conspirator was Flynn, who is called 'Person A' in the indictment and is not charged, offering some insight into what charges he escaped with his plea deal.

Kian, vice-president of Flynn's former lobbying firm, is alleged to have plotted with Alptekin to try to change U.S. policy on an exiled Turkish cleric, Fethullah Gulen, who lives in Pennsylvania and who is accused by Turkey's strongman president Recep Tayyip Erdogan, of trying to depose him.

Erdogan's government wanted him extradited from the U.S. and paid Flynn's firm through Alptekin for lobbying, including an op-ed in The Hill calling for Gulen to be ejected. Flynn and Kian both lied that the op-ed was not paid for by the Turkish government.

The indictment is a sign of how Mueller is taking an interest in more than just Russian involvement in the 2016 election."
445,daily mail online,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6591461/Gillibrand-moving-2020-bid-coming-days.html,"The 52-year-old will head for Iowa this weekend where Democratic big-hitters are arriving in droves already

Several people familiar with Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand's plans say the New York Democrat is expected to take steps toward launching a presidential campaign in the coming days by forming an exploratory committee.

One person says Gillibrand will likely announce her intentions ahead of a trip to Iowa this weekend. She will be a guest Tuesday night on CBS' 'The Late Show with Stephen Colbert.'

The people spoke on condition of anonymity because they weren't authorized to speak on Gillibrand's timing. Gillibrand's representatives didn't comment Monday on her plans.

Gillibrand was appointed to the Senate in 2009 to succeed Hillary Clinton, who became secretary of state. She easily won re-election in November and has $10.6 million in her campaign fund, which can be used to jump-start a presidential bid.

Her move comes as, after months of speculation and secrecy, the 2020 presidential primary season is about to explode.

With several Democrats already in the race, a half dozen more are locking down final travel, staffing and strategy to launch White House bids in the coming weeks.

Looks like a runner: Kirsten Gillibrand, the junior senator from New York, could announce as early as this week that she is mounting a White House run

While plans may change, the announcements are expected to come in waves, the first featuring a group of ambitious Senate Democrats including Gillibrand, California Sen. Kamala Harris and New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, who face pressure to join the race after Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren's entrance two weeks ago.

The second wave will likely feature political heavyweights like former Vice President Joe Biden, Vermont Sen.

Bernie Sanders, New York billionaire Michael Bloomberg and former Texas Congressman Beto O'Rourke, whose advisers believe they have sufficient financial backing and name recognition to join the crowded field on their terms later in the first quarter should they decide to run.

'It is really starting to heat up,' said Deidre DeJear, who lost her bid for Iowa secretary of state last fall, but remains an influential figure in the state's first-in-the-nation Democratic caucuses. She was among a group of Iowa Democratic women who sat down with Warren last week in suburban Des Moines.

'I feel like Warren put people in a place as if to say 'come on, step up,'' DeJear said in a subsequent interview. 'If you're in it, you're in it. No reason to wait now.'

Interviews with senior aides for several top Democratic prospects, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal planning, indicate the waiting game is almost over.

Former Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper, who left office last week, added foreign policy adviser Jeremy Rosner, finance director Dan Sorenson and a senior communications adviser Marie Logsden to his political action committee in recent days, according to an aide. Hickenlooper is traveling to Los Angeles this week to meet with donors and has scheduled visits to early voting states later in the month.

The 66-year-old term-limited governor and former businessman, who remains largely unknown to many primary voters, does not plan to launch his campaign before March.

Sanders, the lone 2020 prospect who ran in 2016, has interviewed close to 20 people to fill senior positions such as campaign manager and directors of policy, communications and his field program.

A senior aide said the hiring process has been particularly focused on adding diversity - in both gender and race - that didn't exist in his last presidential campaign.

The aide said allegations of sexual harassment between Sanders' former campaign staff had no impact on the timeline of an announcement, which is not expected before the end of the month.

Despite his challenges, Sanders is sitting on a war chest of roughly $15 million and an active nationwide network. In a show of early force, liberal activists hosted hundreds of house parties across the nation on Saturday to cheer on a second Sanders run.

Meanwhile, O'Rourke, 46, is taking steps toward a run, but an aide said he's not expected to announce until next month at the earliest.

However, he's traveling outside Texas to introduce himself to voters in the coming weeks. Oprah is scheduled to interview him in New York City next month.

The first states on the primary calendar are not on O'Rourke's immediate itinerary, but that's not stopping supporters in Iowa and South Carolina from launching draft efforts.

A leader of South Carolina's 'Draft Beto' movement, former Democratic National Committee member Boyd Brown, said he's having conversations with Democratic donors, local officials and potential staffers, to help stave off commitments to other candidates as the field starts to take shape.

'We might be taking a shot in the dark, but we're building an apparatus that we can hand off to an actual campaign should he run,' Brown said in an interview. 'We're treating this like a presidential campaign until told otherwise.'

A more seasoned political star, Biden remains silent about his plans. The 76-year-old Democrat has done little to build teams on the ground in key states, instead sticking to the schedule of huddling with aides while he moves closer to a decision.

While it may seem early, the sheer size of the likely field makes it difficult for some candidates to wait much longer.

Upward of two dozen high-profile Democrats could run for a chance to deny President Donald Trump a second term.

The first Democratic primary debate will take place in June, while the first primary contest is likely a year away. With a field this big, there's only so many donors and top staffers to go around.

'At this point the cycle, it's a race for money and talent, and unless your name is Joe Biden or Beto O'Rourke, you've gotta get in soon if you want attract either one of those things,' said former Obama strategist Stephanie Cutter, who has been offering advice to some contenders.

Gillibrand, 52, joins some of her Senate colleagues on a more aggressive timeline. She's already identified a likely location for a campaign headquarters, added staff and planned trips to key states.

The Democratic senator is eying a headquarters in Troy, New York, a small upstate city on the Hudson River.

Gillibrand, who has made headlines with her work against sexual violence - and occasional profanity in public speeches - is scheduled to make her Iowa debut this weekend.

Booker is expected to run his campaign from Newark, where he lives and served as mayor.

The 49-year-old Democrat has identified a likely campaign manager, Addisu Demissee.

The Democratic operative previously managed Booker's special election campaign in 2013 and subsequently worked for Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign and most recently led California Gov. Gavin Newsome's successful gubernatorial bid.

Like Gillibrand and Booker, Harris is expected to join the race in the coming weeks.

The first-term senator and former California attorney general has broadened her national profile in recent days by launching a tour to promote her book, 'The Truths We Hold.'

Like her would-be competitors, the 54-year-old Democrat has not publicly committed to running, but she has said repeatedly that the country needs a leader who 'provides a vision of the future of the country in which everyone can see themselves.'

A handful of lesser-known candidates have already entered the race.

Hawaii Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard, 37, announced her intention to run in a CNN interview that aired on Saturday.

That same day, former Obama housing chief Julian Castro formally kicked off his campaign Saturday in his San Antonio hometown.

Not to be forgotten, Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown and Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar are openly considering joining the 2020 contest, although neither is as far along in preparations as their potential rivals.

Meanwhile, Washington state Gov. Jay Inslee is scheduled to make his first New Hampshire appearance next week.

He talked up his liberal record and willingness to take on Trump during a weekend appearance in Nevada.

'He cannot stop us,' Inslee said of the president. 'He has not stopped me, either.'

Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin and acting Chief of Staff Mulvaney asked Trump, who serves as an adviser in the White House, to lead the internal search for the job.

'Secretary Mnuchin and Chief of Staff Mulvaney have asked Ivanka Trump to help manage the U.S. nomination process as she's worked closely with the World Bank's leadership for the past two years - however, reports that she is under consideration are false,' said White House Deputy Director of Communications Jessica Ditto in a statement.

World Bank President Jim Yong Kim announced last week he would step down in February. There were reports the first daughter was under consideration for the job.

Other possible candidates mentioned are David Malpass, a Treasury Department official; former U.N. Ambassador Nikki Haley; and Mark Green, head of the US Agency for International Development, the Financial Times reported.

It's not the first time Ivanka Trump has been considered for a promotion in her father's administration.

She was reportedly under consideration to replace Nikki Haley as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. And she sat in for President Donald Trump at the G20 summit in Hamburg in July 2017, which lead to widespread condemnation.

Nomination to the World Bank job would also have likely caused an uproar.

447,daily mail online,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6530411/Blind-mystic-predicted-9-11-Brexit-says-2019-bad-news-Putin-Trump-Europe.html,"The famous blind Bulgarian mystic Baba Vanga, who 'predicted' 9/11, Brexit and the rise of ISIS despite having been dead for over twelve years, has revealed her predictions for 2019.

According to Baba, two of the most prominent world leaders will be in trouble this year, with Russian President Vladimir Putin facing an assassination attempt from somebody inside his security team and U.S President Donald Trump losing his hearing to a mysterious illness.

Baba, who has become cult figure among conspiracy theorists, has also predicted a massive earthquake-tsunami will wipe out large parts of Asia, and Europe will buckle under a disastrous economic crash.

The famous blind Bulgarian mystic Baba Vanga has revealed her predictions for 2019, and Trump, Putin and most of Europe will suffer next year

So could any of these actually come true?

Putin has already survived at least one major assassination attempt, which was foiled in the run up to the 2012 presidential election.

Now the Russian president has surrounded himself with a highly-trained sniper squad whose only task is to keep him alive, so perhaps he agrees with Baba that another attempt on his life is a possibility in 2019.

Putin should also prepare for a giant meteorite to hit Russia, according to Baba.

As for Donald Trump, the U.S President is predicted to have a disastrous 2019, as not only might he succumb to an unexplained illness that will cause him nausea, tinnitus, brain trauma, and hearing loss, but a member of his family will be involved in a car crash.

This year it was reported that American diplomats in Cuba and China were suffering from mysterious hearing loss and tinnitus, which is believed to have been a caused by overexposure to pulsed radiofrequency/microwave electromagnetic radiation from bugging or surveillance.

U.S President Donald Trump (left) will suffer a mysterious illness and hearing loss, Baba says, while Russia's Vladimir Putin (right) will face an assassination attempt and a meteorite striking his country

Whether Trump will fall victim to the same ailment remains to be seen however.

Next Baba predicted that Europe will suffer from a massive economic collapse, which some will say could easily happen when Britain exits the European Union on March 29 219.

And she thinks another devastating tsunami is on the horizon next year, one that could wipe out parts of several Asian countries including Pakistan, India, China, Japan and Indonesia.

It has already been a bad tsunami year for Indonesia, which has suffered its worst annual death toll from disasters in more than a decade.

In September, a tsunami triggered by a 7.5 magnitude earthquake flattened an Indonesian island of Sulawesi, killing 2,100 people.

And last Saturday huge waves crashed into coastal towns on the islands of Sumatra and Java, with at least 430 people confirmed dead and 159 still missing.

Having already predicted Brexit by saying Europe as it is is know would 'cease to exist' by the end of 2016, Baba now says the continent will plummet into a massive economic crisis in 2019

Bulgarian Baba, who died at the age of 85 in 1996, was also known as the 'Nostradamus of the Balkans.'

She mysteriously lost her eyesight at the age of 12 during a massive storm.

Her family allegedly found her several days later on death's door - with her eyes sealed shut and covered with dirt.

She later claimed to have experienced her first vision when she was missing and believed she had been given the power to predict the future and heal others.

In 1979, Vanga - who reportedly had an 85 per cent success rate with her predictions - told writer Valentin Sidorov that Russia would become 'lord of the world' after Europe became a 'wasteland.'

'All will thaw, as if ice, only one remain untouched - Vladimir's glory, glory of Russia,' she reportedly said.

The mystic is also said to have prophesied Brexit by saying Europe as it is is know would 'cease to exist' by the end of 2016 and that an extremist army that would invade Europe, thought to be proliferation of ISIS in Syria and Iraq.

Bulgarian Baba, who died at the age of 85 in 1996, was also known as the 'Nostradamus of the Balkans'

Believers say Baba even foretold the 9/11 attacks in 2001, saying 'two steel birds' would attack 'American brethren'.

She said: 'Horror, horror! The American brethren will fall after being attacked by the steel birds. The wolves will be howling in a bush, and innocent blood will be gushing.'

But she did claim that Barack Obama would be the 'last American president', leading some to believe that Donald Trump would never be sworn in before his inauguration earlier this year, which turned out to be false.

Other events she warned of include an end to world hunger by 2028, Mars colonies acquiring nuclear weapons by 2256 and Earth becoming uninhabitable by 2341."
448,daily mail online,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-6509921/Kushner-credited-pushing-rare-bipartisan-bill.html,"WASHINGTON (AP) - It was the first time many liberal advocates had set foot inside President Donald Trump's White House.

And they came at the invitation of presidential son-in-law Jared Kushner - a top White House adviser whom many liberal and good-government groups have criticized, questioning his lack of experience in government, potential conflicts of interest and cozy relationship with foreign leaders, including Saudi Arabia's crown prince.

But in White House conference rooms and lobbying trips to Capitol Hill, Kushner worked with advocates, legislators and others on both sides of the aisle to try to craft a deal to make the nation's criminal justice system fairer. Now Kushner, the likely subject of new investigations when Democrats take control of the House next year, is getting credit for helping to spearhead what could be the first major bipartisan legislative success of the Trump era: a first-in-a-generation criminal justice overhaul that is expected to pass Congress as soon as this week.

""I don't think this would have happened without him,"" said Sen. Corey Booker of New Jersey, a potential 2020 Democratic presidential contender, adding that the bill would have ""a profound effect on thousands of families who have been suffering as a result of this broken system.""

Inimai Chettiar, director of the Justice Program at the Brennan Center for Justice, who attended multiple meetings at the White House and lobbied with Kushner on the Hill, said that while the center's policies are generally ""very oppositional"" to the Trump agenda, criminal justice offered a rare opportunity for cooperation. Kushner ""understands why this is a very important issue and the effect that it could have,"" she said.

For Kushner, the criminal justice issue has long been deeply personal.

Jim DeMint of the Heritage Foundation, left, applauds as President Donald Trump recognizes Kushner as he speaks about H. R. 5682, the ""First Step Act"" in the Roosevelt Room of the White House in Washington, which would reform America's criminal justice system. Kushner is being credited for helping to spearhead what could be the first major bipartisan legislative success of the Trump era: a first-in-a-generation criminal justice reform bill that is expected to pass as soon as this week. (AP Photo/Andrew Harnik, File)

Kushner was in his early 20s and a law and business school student in the mid-2000s when his father was sentenced to federal prison on charges of tax evasion, witness tampering and illegal campaign donations.

""When you're on the other side of the system, you feel so helpless,"" Kushner told The Associated Press in a recent interview. ""I felt like, I was on this side of the system, so how can I try to do whatever I can do to try to be helpful to the people who are going through it"" and deserve a second chance.

While the issue was never part of Trump's campaign message, within months of his father-in-law taking office, Kushner was spotted in the hallways of Congress, coming and going from meetings on the subject. He worked with groups including the ACLU, Brennan Center, and the conservative Koch brothers' network, along with Republican governors, law enforcement groups, former Obama special adviser Van Jones and reality star Kim Kardashian West. Trump supports the measure.

Even before the bill comes up for a vote, though, some of the unlikely allies who successfully worked with Kushner on criminal justice are skeptical the working relationships built in recent months will translate into further bipartisan successes. The Trump administration enters a new era in January, when Democrats take control of the House.

Democrats have made clear that they intend to use their subpoena power to investigate the administration, including Kushner, who is expected to face an onslaught of inquiries digging into everything from his businesses, to his security clearance, to his relationship with the man accused of ordering the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi.

Revamping criminal justice, they say, was a unique and rare area of consensus.

""The fact of the matter is that many of the policies of the Trump administration are squarely at odds with ACLU principles. And it's lovely to have a rapport on an issue you can agree with,"" said Anthony Romero, executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union. ""It might be much harder to find common ground on any other issue.""

Kushner declined to comment on the record about the expected inquiries, and what the new reality might mean for his father-in-law and the White House.

He also faced opposition from within the administration, including former Attorney General Jeff Sessions, who was deeply opposed to the sentencing changes that helped to bring Senate Democrats on board. Even on Tuesday, critics of the bill, including Republican Sen. Tom Cotton, were making a final push to amend the legislation, which gives judges more discretion when sentencing some drug offenders and boosts prisoner rehabilitation efforts, in a way that would likely kill its prospects.

But Romero, whose ACLU has filed 107 lawsuits against the Trump administration so far, most challenging its immigration policies, said that Kushner's role in working with Sens. Dick Durbin, D-Ill., and Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, was ""critical to getting us to this point.""

He praised Kushner's ""tenacity"" and ""doggedness,"" pointing to repeated phone calls and weekend text messages to trade ideas and status reports, even after an initial summer meeting at the White House when Romero told Kushner a previous version of the bill was ""anemic.""

""Though we have many areas of disagreement with the White House, it was refreshing to find one area where we could work together,"" Romero said, adding that, Kushner's personal commitment to the issue ""allowed us to break through.""

Holly Harris, a conservative strategist and executive director of the Justice Action Network, credited Kushner's efforts to put Republican governors supportive of the legislation in front of the president to share their experiences about how similar efforts in their states had helped reduce crime.

""Their voices were critical in showing another side of reform to the president,"" she said of Trump.

""He never quit. He never slowed down. He kept moving things,"" added Grover Norquist, an advocate for lower taxes, who also worked with Kushner.

449,the huffington post,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/climate-change-refugees-broken-world-change-communities_us_5c1fafcce4b0407e907c1ad2,"A seven-year-old girl and her father travel hundreds of miles, fleeing violence, hoping for refuge, and now Jakelin Caal Maquin is dead. Late on Christmas eve, Felipe Gomez Alonzo, age 8, also from Guatemala, died in custody at the border.

That journey of two indigenous Guatemalans looking for peace on a December night was just one story, among so many, highlighting what was broken about 2018. But there are signs that 2019 could be very different because of what is happening in communities across the United States.

This year was tough. A nation that once prided itself on liberating Nazi prison camps instead built up detention camps for refugee children and turned a caravan of desperate asylum-seekers into a political propaganda tool.

Gun deaths hit their highest level in at least 50 years, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, with nearly two-thirds a result of suicide.

Law enforcement failed to take violent white supremacists seriously, revealing huge institutional failures. And police forces continued their practice of disproportionately killing people of color, especially those of black, Latino and Native American backgrounds

It was a year when the federal government, instead of protecting our national treasures, opened land that had been part of the Grand Escalante and Bears Ears monuments to mining claims.

Drug companies stood accused of using shady tactics to increase opioid use, thereby contributing to the addiction epidemic.

Americans went deeper into debt as wages remained low. And the number of homeless people in the U.S. increased for the second year in a row.

At the foundation of all this brokenness is a form of predatory capitalism that trades in the lives of underpaid workers, exploited children and the living fabric of life itself. This year that system was on view for all to see. Not surprisingly, then, this year more young people reported a favorable view of socialism than capitalism, according to a Gallup poll.

The good news is that powerful movements arising from the grassroots are now working to make real change. This activism is largely overlooked by the media, which remains mesmerized by the brinksmanship of Trump administration antics. Nonetheless, people are coming together and taking action, and that's what gives me hope for 2019 and beyond.

Take the climate crisis. Even under President Barack Obama, the United States was a laggard in responding to what is now a global emergency. Climate deniers and fossil fuel lobbyists prevented much needed action.

Still, communities across the U.S. and around the world are organizing to protect their land and water. Indigenous tribes are often at the forefront of these movements to fight fracking, pipelines and oil terminals. Cities and states are turning toward renewable energy.

Insurgent Democrats who won House seats this November via powerful grassroots mobilization are pressing for a Green New Deal, an ambitious investment in renewable energy and job creation. The suite of policies that constitute the Green New Deal have the support of more than 80 percent of Americans, including a majority of Republicans.

Our broken election system -- in which democracy is hobbled by voter suppression, gerrymandering, Russian interference and corruption -- is another place where local and statewide action is finally having a positive impact. Across the U.S., voters adopted ballot measures in the midterm elections to make voting more accessible, combat gerrymandering and allow former felons to vote.

Access to the internet, too, is being protected at the state level after the Federal Communications Commission eliminated net neutrality. More than half of U.S. states have introduced laws upholding net neutrality principles.

There is a different tone in much of this organizing. People are recognizing how deeply our society is broken and how deeply the change and the healing must go. We now understand that we can't outsource our activism to a national organization by just sending a donation or signing a petition.

Likewise, we can't just fix ourselves. Self-help culture teaches that it's all on us and that we can go it alone with affirmations, mindfulness trainings and books like Unfu*k Yourself. The message is often one of shame: If you aren't healthy and happy, you are to blame, and you can alleviate the pain by buying this shiny object or new experience.

Quick fixes ... distract us from the real work of step-by-step change that begins where we live.

The truth is that there's a limit to what we can do by ourselves to heal and to thrive in a broken world. And alone we can do little to change the circumstances that create so much suffering.

But together, in communities, we have power. In communities, we can choose to create liberating practices and institutions, to fight oppression, and to reinforce values that protect our water, air and sources of food.

Working locally doesn't mean we neglect national and international priorities. It means we start where we are, experimenting, sharing innovations that help everyone, and building support for real solutions at the regional and national levels.

In a culture with a short attention span, quick fixes are appealing -- like the miracle presidential candidate who has the shiny new ideas or the latest technology that will solve the climate crisis and everything else. Those fantasies distract us from the real work of step-by-step change that begins where we live.

Maybe it sounds overwhelming to take on all this brokenness ourselves, but here's the thing: When we're working together on problems, we're also learning to nourish and sustain each other. The energy we get from having a community -- the friendships, the inclusiveness, the personal growth -- keeps bringing us back to make our world better.

Grassroots action is both a powerful driver of change and its own reward. A new, more just world doesn't happen sometime in the future. It's something we can create and enjoy every day, beginning by working together now, where we live.

A safety panel set up by US President Donald Trump in the wake of numerous school shootings recommended Tuesday that schools consider arming staff, using veterans as guards and reversing Obama-era guidelines.

The Federal Commission on School Safety panel, led by Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, was set up after the February massacre in Parkland, Florida, when a former student shot dead 17 people, sparking mass gun control protests.

The commission rejected calls to increase the minimum age required for gun purchases, arguing in its 180-page report that most school shooters obtain their weapons from family members or friends.

Instead it suggested arming staff -- even teachers in some circumstances -- ""for the sake of effectively and immediately responding to violence.""

School districts where police responses could be slower, such as rural districts, may benefit in particular, the commission said.

It also recommended education authorities hiring military veterans and former police officers who ""can also serve as highly effective educators.""

The report pushes for a review of disciplinary guidelines introduced in 2014 under former president Barack Obama, which suggested alternatives to suspension and explusion to tackle discrimination against black and Latino students.

The commission's report said the measure has had ""a strong negative impact on school discipline and safety.""

The American Civil Liberties Union condemned that proposition.

US President Donald Trump, speaking during a roundtable discussion about school safety at the White House, is seen next to Education Secretary Betsy DeVos who led a federal commission on the topic

""The Trump administration is exploiting tragedies to justify rolling back school children's civil rights protections, despite the lack of any evidence linking school discipline reform to school shootings,"" it said in a statement.

Over 219,000 US students have been involved in a school shooting since the April 1999 Columbine High School massacre, according to figures collated by the Washington Post."
451,daily mail online,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6557771/Roger-Stone-says-harassed-investigators-Mueller-probe.html,"Trump confidant Roger Stone (pictured last month during a House Judiciary Committee hearing) says he does not expect to be indicted because Mueller 'has nothing on him,' he told DailyMail.com

Trump confidant Roger Stone says he is being harassed by investigators who he claims have interviewed 19 of his friends and even tracked down his temporary maid to question her over his alleged ties to Russian operatives.

In an exclusive interview with DailyMail.com, Stone reveals agents working for Special Counsel Robert Mueller's office also showed witnesses photos of a two-year-old child they believed he may have fathered with infamous Manhattan Madam Kristin Davis.

'And that's when they aren't pulling my garbage,' Stone said in a far-reaching, exclusive interview Thursday night in Florida.

Stone, 66, touched on a variety of topics, from Melania Trump's style to his relationship with the far-right, violence-prone Proud Boys, and his ability to raise money for his legal fund through autographed rocks.

Oblivious to the political storms he usually kicks up, Stone spent the evening entertaining members of the tiny Republican Club of Indian River in a golf clubhouse in Vero Beach, Florida.

He is a draw in an area where aging voters cast ballots for the GOP two to one, even if the Republican Club had to pony up $3,000 and a half gallon of Russian Standard Platinum vodka to lure Stone two hours north of his Fort Lauderdale home.

The Trump campaign operative spoke at the Republican Club of Indian River in a golf clubhouse in Vero Beach, Florida, on Thursday where he signed books and sold 'Roger Stones'

Stone was dragged into Mueller's probe after he was suspected to have been in contact with Russian operatives during the 2016 presidential campaign. He invoked his Fifth Amendment right during a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing last month

'There are 130 people here to meet Roger who paid between $65 and $90 each to hear things from the horse's mouth,' said Florida political consultant Bill Lewis.

'Roger's a celebrity and, let's face it, there's not a whole lot of things going on in Vero Beach.'

Despite the fact he has not been arrested or indicted by the Mueller commission investigating collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia, the former Richard Nixon campaign advisor has been portrayed as a central figure in the election interference scandal.

He testified before the U.S. House of Representatives Intelligence Committee for four and half hours in September 2017 and recently refused to testify before the U.S. Senate's Judiciary Committee.

He's also been under FBI investigation, and Mueller last month asked for a transcript of his House testimony.

Still, Stone says he doesn't expect to be indicted.

'They got nothing,' he said of the special counsel's investigation.

'They've tried hard, but I didn't do anything illegal. That's why I'm not worried and I'll do a public appearance like tonight's without a problem.'

For sale: Stone admitted that he is strapped for cash after shelling out more than $1m in legal fees. He is now selling autographed stones (pictured) at $10 each to make ends meet

Stone accused Mueller of harassment after the counsel's sleuths tracked down and interviewed 19 of his friends and business associates.

'My cleaning lady had to go back to Cuba for a while, so I hired a temp,' Stone said.

'The temp spoke only Spanish. I never knew her name or anything. Yet, government agents found her in Miami. They asked her if I was meeting with Russians at home.

'Now, how they found her when I didn't even know her name, I can only guess. I know she had nothing to say to them.'

He claims agents showed some of Stone's friends a photo of the two-year-old boy born to Kristin Davis, the infamous Manhattan Madam whose prostitution service was used by disgraced former New York Governor Eliot Spitzer and, allegedly, the likes of retired baseball slugger Alex Rodriguez.

'They kept asking if the baby was mine,' the married Stone said. 'What does that have to do with Russian collusion? The baby is not mine, I'm the godfather. But that's an invasion of privacy if I've ever seen one.'

Being at the forefront of this political scandal has been 'financially debilitating, to say the least,' he says.

He's been involved in a half dozen lawsuits that have resulted in up to $200,000 each in legal bills. Preparing for his 2017 House testimony also cost him $400,000, he said.

He claims agents showed some of Stone's friends a photo of the two-year-old boy born to Kristin Davis (pictured with Stone in 2017) the infamous Manhattan Madam whose prostitution service was used by disgraced former New York Governor Eliot Spitzer and, allegedly, the likes of retired baseball slugger Alex Rodriguez.

'I used to have a pretty successful consulting business,' Stone says.

'I used to offer political advice to blue chip corporations, and I made a good living. I've lost most of that because corporations don't like controversy.'

Stone has been crowdfunding online for his legal bills, and most recently, he began selling autographed rocks which he calls 'Roger Stones' at $10 each.

'I've sold 1,000 of them so far,' he says. 'But it's not making up for all my losses. I can't even buy a house. I'm a renter.'

Stone says he expects to be asked back to the House Intelligence Committee now that the balance of power in the legislative body tilted to the Democratic Party side.

Trump critic U.S. Rep. Adam Schiff from California was named chairman this week.

If he is asked back, Stone says he expects to plead the Fifth Amendment against self-incrimination again, but would be willing to propose the body a deal when it comes to whether Stone had advance knowledge that the whistleblowing website Wikileaks had information damaging to Trump opponent Hillary Clinton.

'I'll testify if Schiff and the rest of them agree to give up their congressional immunity,' Stone said.

'That way, I would then sue them for defamation. Schiff has said he believes I was more involved with Wikileaks that I testified. He calls me a liar.

'Yet, he can't prove it. That's defamation. Congressman, ""Schiff"" or get off the pot,' Stone joked.

As for his friend Donald Trump, Stone said he foresees him finishing his term in 2020, despite all the scandal surrounding the president.

'Donald Trump doesn't quit,' Stone said. 'He'll be there to the end. I believe the House will file articles of impeachment, but the Senate will refuse to move the process forward.'

Stone was also asked about his relationship with the political fringe group Proud Boys, a far-right movement that supports Donald Trump and has been known to resort to violence. The Proud Boys have been deemed a 'hate group' by the Southern Poverty Law Center.

Stone has been a longtime political strategist for the GOP and previously served on Trump's presidential campaign. He said he expects the house to file articles of impeachment on the president but believes he will finish his term

In October, members of the Miami-based chapter heckled House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat from California, at a campaign appearance.

Although he didn't have any of the group's members with him Thursday, Stone has been known to make public appearance with a half dozen or more members for protection.

'I don't control those guys,' Stone said. 'Sometimes, they just show up at events that I happen to be at and they offer protection.

'But in general terms, they're not a hate group. They're a group of red-blooded American men who are very patriotic and happen to believe that men in this country are being robbed of their manhood.'

Stone fancies himself as a man of impeccable style. He often wears overly large pin-striped suits adorned with bright pocket handkerchiefs and black-and-white wing-tipped zoot shoes.

And despite the turmoil, Stone now puts out his own best and worst dressed list. One of his favorites on the just-published 219 list? Melania Trump.

'The First Lady is probably the most chic since Nancy Reagan,' Stone said. 'She is evocative of Jackie Onassis. The Timberland boots Melania wore when she visited Iraq are definitely classier than the hooker boots that Michelle Obama has been wearing.'"
452,daily mail online,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-6521761/Mattis-resignation-letter-lays-challenges-successor.html,"WASHINGTON (AP) - The extraordinary resignation letter that Defense Secretary Jim Mattis handed to a surprised President Donald Trump was not just a product of two years of accumulating frustration with an impulsive boss, but an outline of the strategic hazards facing the next Pentagon chief.

Mattis, who was quietly back at work Friday while stunned Pentagon staff soldiered on around him, implicitly warned in his letter to the president of the threat to the U.S. from allowing alliances to fray and of the risk that disrespecting allies will undermine U.S. credibility.

It was an outline of the challenges facing the nation and whoever takes over as defense secretary when Mattis leaves Feb. 28.

""As this Administration continues to implode, Secretary Mattis' extraordinary resignation is a significant loss and a real indication that President Trump's foreign policy agenda has failed and continues to spiral into chaos,"" said Sen. Bob Menendez, the ranking Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee.

Mattis announced on Thursday his plan to resign, a move prompted by the decision by the president to pull all of the approximately 2,000 U.S. troops from the fight against the Islamic State group in northeastern Syria.

Mattis also was dismayed by plans under consideration to cut the number of U.S. troops in Afghanistan and, as his letter made clear, did not see eye to eye with a president who has expressed disdain for NATO and doubts about keeping troops in Asia.

The person nominated to succeed Mattis will face a Senate likely to probe for evidence of new strategic direction in hotspots like Syria, Afghanistan and the Korean peninsula.

In making clear that he could no longer tolerate Trump's approach to American foreign policy, Mattis appeared to fashion a resignation letter that not only expressed his reasons for leaving but also sounded an alarm. He implicitly criticized the president's unwillingness to stand up to Russia or take a stronger stance against Chinese assertiveness.

""I believe we must be resolute and unambiguous in our approach to those countries whose strategic interests are increasingly in tension with ours,"" Mattis wrote. ""It is clear that China and Russia, for example, want to shape a world consistent with their authoritative model ... to promote their own interests at the expense of their neighbors, America and our allies.""

Nurturing and extending U.S. alliances was a pillar of Mattis' approach to his job, which means he was at odds with Trump on that score from the earliest months of his tenure.

""While the U.S. remains the indispensable nation in the free world, we cannot protect our interests or serve that role effectively without maintaining strong alliances and showing respect to those allies,"" Mattis wrote.

William Cohen, a former defense secretary and long-time friend of Mattis, put a finer point on this Mattis assertion by saying in response to his resignation, ""He cannot be expected to stand behind a president who disrespects our allies and ingratiates himself to our adversaries.""

In addition to the frayed state of U.S. relations with NATO, Mattis' successor also is likely to face other hazards hinted at in his resignation letter. These include preserving and rationalizing a strategy for ensuring a lasting defeat of the Islamic State group by the dozens of nations that had backed the U.S. after it entered Syria in 2014.

German officials expressed polite irritation that Washington had not consulted them on the Trump decision to pull out of Syria.

""As an ally and member of the anti-IS coalition we would have considered prior consultation by the U.S. government about the withdrawal of U.S. troops helpful,"" government spokeswoman Ulrike Demmer said.

The Pentagon was still reeling Friday from the news that Mattis was leaving.

Inside what is normally a very orderly building, military members who are trained to take orders, salute and move ahead were stunned and a bit shaken.

Military missions in Syria and Afghanistan that just a week ago seemed clear and mapped out, were now thrown into chaos. Deep in the bowels of the Pentagon, planners scrambled to pull together a troop withdrawal strategy for Syria that the White House would accept, all while knowing that their boss a few floors above them quit over that order.

Mattis, 68, is the first Pentagon chief to resign in protest over a president's foreign policy in many decades. In fact, there may be no historical equivalent to the circumstances of Mattis' departure. The last defense secretary to resign was Chuck Hagel in November 2014, and although he had expressed differences with President Barack Obama over Syria policy, Hagel was essentially pushed out by an administration that viewed him as ineffective.

Robert McNamara, who served as defense secretary for seven years over two Democratic administrations, left the Pentagon in February 1968, three months after President Lyndon Johnson announced McNamara was resigning to become president of the World Bank. McNamara differed with Johnson and the military over Vietnam war policy amid an escalating anti-war movement, but his departure was not an explicit rejection of Johnson's policies.

453,daily mail online,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-6509923/Judge-delays-Flynn-sentencing-not-hiding-disgust-crime.html,"WASHINGTON (AP) - A federal judge Tuesday abruptly postponed the sentencing of President Donald Trump's first national security adviser, Michael Flynn, declaring himself disgusted and disdainful of Flynn's crime of lying to the FBI and raising the unexpected prospect of sending the retired Army lieutenant general to prison.

Lawyers for Flynn, who admitted lying to the FBI about his Russian contacts, requested the delay during the stunning hearing in which U.S. District Judge Emmet Sullivan told the former Trump aide in a blistering rebuke that ""arguably you sold your country out.""

""I can't make any guarantees, but I'm not hiding my disgust, my disdain for this criminal offense,"" Sullivan said.

The postponement gives Flynn a chance to continue cooperating with the government in hopes of staving off prison and proving his value as a witness, including in a foreign lobbying prosecution brought this week. The possibility of prison had seemed remote for Flynn, who was smiling and upbeat as he entered the courtroom, since prosecutors had praised his extensive cooperation and didn't recommend any time behind bars.

But the judge's upbraiding suggested otherwise and made clear that even defendants like Flynn who have cooperated in special counsel Robert Mueller's Russia investigation may nonetheless be shadowed by the crimes that brought them into court in the first place. The hearing upset what had been a carefully crafted agreement and pushed months into the future a resolution of one of Mueller's signature prosecutions.

""This is a very serious offense. A high-ranking senior official of the government making false statements to the Federal Bureau of Investigation while on the physical premises of the White House,"" Sullivan said.

He later softened his tone, apologizing for suggesting that Flynn had worked as a foreign agent, ""undermining everything this flag over here stands for"" while in the White House when that other work had actually already ended. He also backpedaled on an earlier question on whether Flynn's transgressions amounted to treason, saying he didn't mean to suggest they did.

Flynn was to have been the first White House official sentenced in Mueller's ongoing investigation into possible coordination between the Trump presidential campaign and Russia.

The hearing, though incomplete, marked a remarkable fall after a three-decade military career that included Flynn's tours in Iraq and Afghanistan and oversight of the Defense Intelligence Agency during the Obama administration. Though he served only briefly in Trump's White House, he campaigned vigorously before the election and attracted attention for memorably leading a Republican National Convention crowd in a ""Lock Her Up"" chant about Hillary Clinton.

It all comes amid escalating legal peril for Trump, who was implicated by federal prosecutors in New York this month in hush-money payments involving his former lawyer to cover up extramarital affairs. Nearly a half-dozen former aides and advisers have pleaded guilty or agreed to cooperate with prosecutors. Some, like Flynn, have been tripped up by concealing Russian contacts.

Flynn's help in the probes, including 19 meetings with investigators, has been especially notable. Yet he's nonetheless enjoyed Trump's continued sympathy, thanks in part to a sentencing memo last week that tapped into the president's suspicion of law enforcement and took aim at the FBI's conduct during the investigation.

Trump tweeted ""good luck"" to his first national security adviser hours before the sentencing and said: ""Will be interesting to see what he has to say, despite tremendous pressure being put on him, about Russian Collusion in our great and, obviously, highly successful political campaign. There was no Collusion!""

At the White House afterward, press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders was asked if the administration had changed its stance on Flynn or the FBI after his admissions and guilty plea.

""Maybe he did do those things, but it doesn't have anything to do with the president,"" she said. ""It's perfectly acceptable for the president to make a positive comment about somebody while we wait to see what the court's determination is.""

Sanders repeated her allegation that the FBI ""ambushed"" Flynn in an interview in which he lied. Of Trump's earlier criticism of the agency, she said, ""We don't have any reason to want to walk that back.""

Flynn's legal woes stem from transition-period calls with then-Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak that raised intelligence community alarms even before Trump took office.

During those conversations, Flynn urged against a strong Russian response to Obama administration sanctions for Russian election interference and also encouraged Russia's opposition to a U.N. resolution on Israeli settlements.

But when FBI agents approached him in the White House on Jan. 24, 2017, Flynn lied about those conversations, prosecutors said.

Flynn has never said why he lied, but Sullivan nonetheless castigated him for a deception that was then parroted by other senior administration officials.

The tone of Tuesday's hearing startled Flynn supporters who hoped his lawyers' arguments about the FBI's conduct - they suggested he was discouraged from having a lawyer present and wasn't informed it was a crime to lie - to resonate more than it did with Sullivan, who a decade ago tossed out the prosecution of a U.S. senator over government misconduct.

But while Sullivan tested those arguments, he was ultimately unmoved and Flynn mostly walked them back. He acknowledged that he indeed knew that lying to the FBI was a crime. Neither he nor his lawyers disputed that he had lied to agents.

Flynn attorney Robert Kelner asked Sullivan not to penalize Flynn for the sentencing memo arguments, saying they were mostly intended to differentiate Flynn from other defendants in Mueller's investigation who'd received prison sentences for lying. Though Sullivan said none of the other defendants was a White House official, Kelner suggested none had been as cooperative.

""He made the decision publicly and clearly and completely and utterly to cooperate with this investigation, knowing that because of his high rank, that was going to send a signal to every other potential cooperator and witness in this investigation,"" he added.

After a prosecutor raised the prospect of Flynn's continued cooperation with other investigations in the future, Sullivan warned Flynn that he might not get the full credit for his assistance to the government if he were sentenced as scheduled.

Sullivan gave a visibly shaken Flynn a chance to discuss a delay of the hearing with his lawyers. The court briefly recessed.

When they returned, Kelner requested a postponement to allow for Flynn to keep cooperating. Kelner said he expected Flynn would have to testify in a related trial in Virginia involving Flynn's former business associates, and the defense wanted to ""eke out the last modicum of cooperation"" so he could get credit.

The judge set a new hearing date for March. Flynn left the courthouse hand-in-hand with his wife, climbing into a large SUV as protesters heckled and supporters chanted ""USA!""

Bill Clinton was blasted by British officials for letting Gerry Adams visit the US in 1994.

The Sinn Fein president was controversially granted a headline-grabbing visit to New York to speak at a conference on Northern Ireland between January 31 and February 2 in 1994.

A blistering note from then prime minister John Major's private secretary Roderic Lyne sent to US national security adviser Tony Lake is part of around 500 Cabinet Office files released by the National Archives in Kew, west London.

It reads: 'The movement in which Gerry Adams has long been a leading figure has murdered not only thousands of its own countrymen, but also one member of our Royal Family, one Cabinet Minister's wife, two close advisers to Margaret Thatcher and Members of Parliament, two British ambassadors - and small children in our shopping centres.'

Gerry Adams is pictured addressing the Special Conference on Northern Ireland in New York in 1994 (left), and is also shown meeting Mr Clinton in Belfast in 2000 (right)

Mr Clinton, who had been president around a year, took 'full responsibility' for the decision which was described as a 'difficult matter of judgment' in another file.

Mr Major wrote to Mr Clinton expressing dismay before the visit, according to a draft letter, he said: 'Tony Lake will, I am sure, have told you how strongly we disagree with the decision to admit Gerry Adams to the United States.

'He has been closely associated with terrorism for two decades. In the Joint Declaration, he was offered a route into the democratic process, and into negotiations with us and with the Irish Government. He and his movement have not taken it.

'As you will know the evidence is that the IRA intend to continue their strategy of terrorism, and do not have courage to make peace and compete in the democratic arena.'

Mr Clinton was under pressure from influential Irish-American politicians in the US, most notably senator Edward 'Ted' Kennedy, who was named in multiple files as instrumental in pushing for Mr Adams's admission.

In a letter to the president in January, senators Kennedy, John F Kerry - later Barack Obama's secretary of state - Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Christopher J Dodd, make the case for the visit.

The letter said: 'While no one can be certain that a visa for Mr Adams will result in the IRA's accepting the condition established by Ireland and Great Britain for participation in the peace process, the United States cannot afford to ignore this possibility and miss this rare opportunity for our country to contribute to peace in Northern Ireland.'

The note from Mr Lyne to Mr Lake added: 'It is sad, paradoxical, and misguided of the Kennedys, having lost two brothers to acts of terror, to be pressing you to admit a terrorist leader without an end to terrorism or even a commitment to end terrorism'.

A cable dated February 10 from Peter Westmacott, then a British diplomat in Washington, adds details garnered from Jane Holl, then of the US National Security Council, who had been present during a subsequent phonecall between Mr Major and Mr Clinton.

It reads: 'Dr Holl said that the discussion on Northern Ireland was very brief. The President had raised the subject. He had taken full responsibility for the decision to give Adams a visa.

Mr Major (shown in 1992) wrote to Mr Clinton expressing dismay before the visit, according to a draft letter

'It had been a difficult matter of judgment on which the two governments had evidently differed'.

Also attached to the bundle was a missive from Canberra suggesting that a potential visit by Mr Adams to Australia may go ahead in light of the US decision.

Mr Lyne has scrawled on the typed document: 'I hope the Aussies realise this would be the end of Anglo/Australian relations!'

Mr Adams was denied entry to Australia in 1996 but later visited in 1999 following the Good Friday Agreement a year earlier.

The row over Gerry Adams came after Sir John apologised to Mr Clinton in 1992, following Home Office inquiries into whether he applied for UK citizenship while at Oxford University to dodge the draft in Vietnam.

The then Prime Minister said sorry for any 'mischief' caused after a press report cast the matter as the British government searching for 'potentially damaging information' about Mr Clinton during the US presidential campaign.

On December 6, 1992, Mr Major wrote the following to president-elect Clinton: 'I am disturbed by the reports which have appeared about enquiries by our Home Office relating back to your time at Oxford.

'What happened, as I hope Robin Renwick will have explained to your people, is that during the campaign our Home Office were asked a number of questions by journalists about whether you had applied for British citizenship while in this country.

'In accordance with their normal practice, they refused to make any on-the-record comment but, having checked the facts, they sought to guide the press on a background basis that there was absolutely nothing in the story.

During his stay in New York, Mr Adams attending several meetings and fundraisers, including this Friends of Sinn Fein public event

'I am only sorry that it has been played up now in a mischievous way. I hope the mischief will be short-lived.'

The same day a story had appeared in the Washington Post headlined: 'Critics blast Major on file search.'

It read: 'Opposition leaders today sharply criticised the government's search of Home Office files during the US presidential campaign for potentially damaging information about Democratic candidate Bill Clinton, saying the episode might cast a chill over relations between the president-elect and Prime Minister John Major.'

A Government document from the released files explains the background to the issue, showing queries were first raised by a lobby reporter from a British newspaper.

It states: 'The story was regarded as rather silly but it could have led to unfair speculation if left unanswered.

'A simple ""no comment"" or ""we do not discuss individual cases"" would have fuelled the unfair speculation.

'For this reason, it was decided by press office and agreed with the FCO to brief The Standard that the story was not worth following up. The story was not covered by the UK press.'

It adds that the same guidance was later issued to the Washington Post.

The Home Office search found 'No record of an application ... in Mr Clinton's name'."

An A-list party planner has shared his secrets after working for a host of top celebrities, including Beyonce and Madonna.

Bronson van Wyck, who is based in New York, revealed how P Diddy asked for fake snow just 45 minutes before his 40th birthday bash began - in order to make the 'whole thing over the top'.

He also said Beyonce is 'fantastic' and 'insanely professional' to work with, while describing Gwyneth Paltrow as having an 'easy elegance'.

While van Wyck has enjoyed working for the past three US presidents and their wives during their time in the White House, he said he would not work for President Donald Trump if asked.

Van Wyck's A-list clients have included Madonna, who asked him to plan her gypsy-themed 57th birthday party in 2015 (above, with daughter Lourdes at the party)

Speaking to The Times about planning P Diddy's 40th birthday bash, van Wyck explained how the rapper had asked if he could 'make it snow' at the party - less than an hour before it began.

He recalled: 'It was 45 minutes till the party started, but we found a guy in New Jersey who had the key to the tech closet at the Metropolitan Opera and we got that snow machine.

'Puffy came to the party at midnight and we waited till he was in the middle of the room before we pushed the button and the snow started coming down. The look on his face was like a child on Christmas morning.'

van Wyck also revealed what it was like to work on events with the past three US Presidents and their wives during their time in the White House, which included planning the inauguration for George W Bush.

He said Bill Clinton was 'always very curious about what was going to come out of the kitchen', Laura Bush could make someone 'feel like they were the only person in the room', while Michelle Obama 'had dynamism' and 'wanted to have fun'.

While describing other lavish bashes he has planned, van Wyck revealed that he managed to get the 1965 silver Aston Martin DB5 from Skyfall for one client.

The party planner was also behind Madonna's gypsy-themed party for her 47th birthday, as well as Beyonce's perfume launches.

He recently celebrated his own birthday with an extravagant Dionysus-themed party in Mykonos, which included performances from Flo Rida and Duran Duran.

Meanwhile, the party planner said Beyonce is 'fantastic' and 'insanely professional' to work with, after planning her perfume launch parties. Above is Beyonce at the launch of her Pulse fragrance in 2011

Glamorous guests at the party included the likes of Paris Hilton, Vanessa Getty and Indre Rockfeller.

van Wyck, who graduated from Yale, began his career while working for US Embassy in Paris, where he organised nightly diplomatic receptions.

After that, he worked in the set department for film company Paramount in Hollywood, before eventually going on to set up his company Van Wyck & Van Wyck with mother Mary Lynn.

As well as working for a host of A-list names, he has also designed opening night for the San Francisco Opera and has produced exhibitions at the Whitney Museum of American Art."
456,bbc news,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-46723603,"US President Donald Trump has now said the abrupt withdrawal of US troops from Syria he announced earlier this month will be carried out ""slowly"".

""We're slowly sending our troops back home to be with their families, while at the same time fighting Isis [Islamic State] remnants,"" he tweeted on Monday.

His clarification confirmed remarks by Republican Senator Lindsey Graham.

When Mr Trump first announced the move, he had said: ""They're all coming back and they're coming back now.""

The development had shocked US allies and American defence officials alike, with Defence Secretary Jim Mattis and a top US official in the fight against the Islamic State (IS) group, Brett McGurk, resigning soon after.

America's Kurdish allies on the ground in north-east Syria have been left feeling exposed as Turkey, which regards them as terrorists, appears poised to move against them.

The Kurds have appealed to Syrian government forces for help to secure a key northern city, Manbij, to guard against any Turkish offensive.

Syrian government forces could be seen taking up position near the city on Sunday, while US forces could also be seen in Kurdish-controlled areas.

Some 2,000 US military personnel are believed to be in Syria although the real numbers could be higher.

After the president made his announcement on 19 December, US officials said American forces had been given 30 days to leave Syria.

In his announcement, Mr Trump had also declared that IS had been ""defeated"".

However, on Monday, he said troops were being pulled out ""slowly"" and that they would be fighting remaining IS militants at the same time.

IS remains in pockets of north-eastern Syria and the group says it has launched a series of small-scale but deadly attacks on the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces in recent days, in claims that could not be independently verified.

Without giving names, he referred to complaints about his tactics from ""failed generals who were unable to do the job"" before he had taken over in the White House.

And he boasted about achieving ""far better results"" in stopping America's foreign wars than even he had promised himself.

Sen Graham, who had sharply criticised Mr Trump's withdrawal plans, held talks with the president on Sunday and later spoke of a ""pause situation"" regarding operations in Syria.

""We're re-evaluating what's the best way to achieve the president's objective,"" the senator said.

The New York Times reported that he might be referring to assurances given to military officials that they could have longer than 30 days to ensure an orderly withdrawal of troops.

US ground troops first became involved in Syria in autumn 2015 when then-President Barack Obama sent in a small number of special forces to train and advise local Kurdish fighters who were fighting IS.

The US did this reluctantly after several attempts at arming anti-IS groups had descended into chaos.

Over the intervening years the numbers of US troops in Syria increased, and a network of bases and airstrips has been established in an arc across the north-eastern part of the country.

The US has also been part of an international coalition conducting air strikes against IS, while also targeting Syrian government bases in retaliation for suspected war crimes involving chemical weapons.

BBC defence correspondent Jonathan Marcus says Mr Trump appears to be washing his hands of Syria and handing the job over to Russia, Turkey and Iran."
457,daily mail online,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6542267/Elizabeth-Warren-takes-big-2020-presidential-run.html,"Elizabeth Warren on Monday took the first major step toward launching a widely anticipated campaign for the presidency, hoping her reputation as a populist fighter can help her navigate a Democratic field that could include nearly two dozen candidates.

'No matter what our differences, most of us want the same thing,' the 69-year-old Massachusetts Democrat said in a video that highlights her family's history in Oklahoma.

'To be able to work hard, play by the same set of rules and take care of the people we love. That's what I'm fighting for and that's why today I'm launching an exploratory committee for president.'

Warren burst onto the national scene a decade ago during the financial crisis with calls for greater consumer protections.

How she announced: Elizabeth Warren used New Year's Eve morning to make her presidential move in a video recorded in her kitchen but slickly produced

Shes (almost) running: Massachusetts senator Elizabeth Warren used New Year's Eve to announce she is setting up an exploratory committee for a 2020 bid

On the blocks: In an email to supporters, Warren said she'd more formally announce a campaign plan early in 2019. She can now raise money for a run

She quickly became one of the party's more prominent liberals even as she sometimes fought with Obama administration officials over their response to the market turmoil.

Now, as a likely presidential contender, she is making an appeal to the party's base. Her video notes the economic challenges facing people of color along with images of a women's march and Warren's participation at an LGBT event.

In an email to supporters, Warren said she'd more formally announce a campaign plan early in 2019.

Warren is the most prominent Democrat yet to make a move toward a presidential bid and has long been a favorite target of President Donald Trump.

In mid-December, former Obama housing chief Julian Castro also announced a presidential exploratory committee, which legally allows potential candidates to begin raising money. Outgoing Maryland Rep. John Delaney is the only Democrat so far to have formally announced a presidential campaign.

But that's likely to change quickly in the new year as other leading Democrats take steps toward White House runs.

Warren enters a Democratic field that's shaping up as the most crowded in decades, with many of her Senate colleagues openly weighing their own campaigns, as well as governors, mayors and other prominent citizens.

One of her most significant competitors could be Sen. Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent who is eyeing another presidential run harnessing the same populist rhetoric.

She must also move past a widely panned October release of a DNA test meant to bolster her claim to Native American heritage.

The move was intended to rebut Trump's taunts of Warren as 'Pocahontas.' Instead, her use of a genetic test to prove ethnicity spurred controversy that seemed to blunt any argument she sought to make.

There was no direct mention of it in the video released Monday.

Target: Donald Trump hit Elizabeth Warren repeatedly as a fake Native American and nicknamed her Pocahontas

Greatest hits: Trump is likely to make use of his previous assault on Elizabeth Warren's claims of Native American roots, which he stepped up in the wake of her DNA test

Warren has the benefit of higher name recognition than many others in the Democratic mix for 2020, thanks to her years as a prominent critic of Wall Street who originally conceived of what became the government's Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

She now faces an arduous battle to raise money and capture Democratic primary voters' attention before Iowa casts its first vote in more than a year.

She has an advantage in the $12.5 million left over from her 2018 re-election campaign that she could use for a presidential run.

Warren's campaign is likely to revolve around the same theme she's woven into speeches and policy proposals in recent years: battling special interests, paying mind to the nexus between racial and economic inequities.

'America's middle class is under attack,' Warren said in the video.

'How did we get here? Billionaires and big corporations decided they wanted more of the pie. And they enlisted politicians to cut them a fatter slice.'

458,daily mail online,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6567071/SECOND-man-dies-apparent-overdose-apartment-prominent-white-Democratic-donor-Ed-Buck.html,"By Ryan Parry West Coast Editor For Dailymail.com and Josh Boswell For Dailymail.com and Ariel Zilber For Dailymail.com

Police have reopened an investigation into a drug overdose death at a wealthy Democratic donor's home in West Hollywood after a second man died on the premises early Monday morning.

Edward Buck, a regular donor to democratic campaigns including Hillary Clinton's presidential bid, was investigated for a suspected murder when Gemmel Moore, 26, was found dead of a meth overdose in July 2017.

The case was closed after the Los Angeles District Attorney found insufficient evidence to prosecute, sparking controversy from local campaign groups.

Now a second man has been found dead in Buck's apartment. The LA Sheriff's Department said the cause of death is 'unknown at this time'.

The retired donor and political activist has been interviewed by police.

According to police Buck was present for both deaths and both men were black.

An African-American man was found dead in the Los Angeles apartment of a prominent Democratic Party donor - the second time a black man died in the home in the past 18 months. The coroner is seen with the body in West Hollywood on Monday

Los Angeles County Sheriff's Deputies found the body of the man in the early morning hours Monday at the West Hollywood home of Ed Buck (seen right alongside Hillary Clinton in this undated file photo)

Buck's attorney, Seymour Amster, said the man was a long-time friend of Bucks in his 50s, and had lived in West Hollywood for 25 years. Amster claimed that the man had 'a history of substance abuse'.

'Unfortunately in the early hours this morning, a good friend of Ed's reached out to him. Ed was reluctant to have him over but he was insistent. He had him come over and come into his apartment,' Amster told DailyMail.com.

'Ed had just gotten out of the shower, so he went to get himself more appropriately attired. He came back into his living room and his friend was acting with bizarre behavior. Shortly thereafter it was obvious his friend needed medical assistance. Ed called paramedics. They arrived, they were unable to revive him, and unfortunately he died in the apartment.

This is the same apartment where in July 2017, Gemmel Moore, 26, was found dead of an apparent overdose of methamphetamine

'It seems the individual came over already having consumed controlled substances. There were no controlled substances ingested in the presence of Ed, nor did Ed give any to his friend.'

The attorney said Buck was initially interviewed by officers who arrived on the scene, but has declined further interviews with homicide detectives.

'On Monday, January 7, 2019, at 1.05am, West Hollywood Station deputies responded to the 1200 block of Laurel Ave in the City of West Hollywood regarding a person not breathing,' the LA Sheriff's Department said in a statement.

'The informant performed cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and called 9-1-1. Los Angeles County Fire responded to the location and pronounced a male adult deceased. The cause of death is unknown at this time and will be determined by the Los Angeles County Medical Examiner-Coroner Office.

'On July 27, 2017 there was a death investigation of a male adult, Gemmel Moore, who was determined to have overdosed at the same location. Mr. Edward Buck was present during both incidents.

'The Los Angeles County Sheriff's Homicide Bureau has responded to the location and Investigators are conducting a thorough investigation, which includes follow up interviews and a secondary review of the July 27, 2017 incident.'

Emergency crews at the scene tried to revive the man, who has yet to be identified, but were unsuccessful. Buck's West Hollywood apartment on Laurel Avenue is seen in the above file photo

At the time of Moore's death the Los Angeles County District Attorney's Office decided not to prosecute Buck, saying there was 'insufficient [evidence] to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that [Buck] is responsible for the death of Gemmel Moore.'

The DA's Office said: 'Likewise, the admissible evidence is insufficient to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that suspect Buck furnished drugs to Gemmel Moore or that suspect Buck possessed drugs.'

In February of last year Moore's family published pages from his diary in which he alleged that it was Buck who first introduced him to narcotics.

These revelations prompted the LASD to reopen its investigation into Buck.

Since the investigation was launched, a number of other men of color have come forward to claim political power player Buck, who is single and came out as gay at 16, paid them to take drugs.

The coroner's report, from July 31, 2017, noted that investigators spoke with a woman who knew Moore, who said that the prostitute had told her about another man he knew that had been tied up by Buck 'over a year ago', who then 'held him against his will at the residence in West Hollywood.'

The report also stated that Buck's apartment was full of drug paraphernalia including dozens of syringes containing brown residue, five glass pipes with white residue, several baggies of white power, and a bag of a 'crystal-like' substance, such as crystal meth.

Moore's mother, LaTisha Nixon, said that her son had been involved with sex-work in the years leading up to his death.

'I called one of my son's friends and was like, ""who the hell is Edward Buck?'"" Nixon said, speaking from her home in Spring Texas. 'And my son's friend was like, ""oh my God, that's that white guy, that wealthy white politician guy... he was like ""oh my God...'""

During Nixon's conversation with her son's friend, a darker picture of Moore's life began to emerge, with Buck allegedly playing a role.

'When he calmed down, he told me that Ed Buck was one of my son's clients and that Ed Buck was one of his clients as well,' Nixon said.

'[Buck] would have my son to go out to... Santa Monica Boulevard looking for young gay black guys so he could inject them with drugs, see their reaction and how [they] would react and take pictures of them.'

Buck was reportedly present in his home during both deaths, but has not been charged

The apartment is a one-bedroom, one-bathroom home located at 1234 North Laurel Avenue

According to Zillow, it was last available for rent at a monthly cost of $1,650

Pages from Moore's personal journal allege that Buck had a strange fascination with watching others take drugs, and had even supplied him his first hit of crystal meth.

'I honestly don't know what to do,' he wrote in the excerpt from December 2016, published by the family, and advocate Jasmyne Cannick.

'I've become addicted to drugs and the worst one at that.

'Ed Buck is the one to thank. He gave me my first injection of crystal meth it was very painful, but after all the troubles, I became addicted to the pain and fetish/fantasy.'

'My life is at an alltime [sic] high right now & I mean that from all ways. I ended up back at Buck [sic] house again and got munipulated [sic] into slamming (injecting drugs) again. I even went to the point where I was forced to doing 4 within a 2day [sic] period. This man is crazy and its [sic] sad. Will I ever get help?'

His final entry, dated December 3, 2016, read: 'If it didn't hurt so bad, I'd kill myself, but I'll let Ed Buck do it for now.'

Buck is an active donor who supports the Democratic Party. He is seen above with former California Governor Jerry Brown in this undated file photo

Cannick says she has spoken to a number of other gay black men who claim Buck would invite them to his house, then pay them several hundred dollars to take drugs.

She shares reports from at least three men, under pseudonyms, who alleged that Buck would pay them between $100 and $1,000 to 'Party n Play', meaning to get high with them, and perform sexual acts.

Buck's lawyer has said that his client is innocent and that Moore died of an accidental overdose.

Buck has given $47,427.50 to Democrat campaigns, according to Federal Election Commission figures, including Clinton, Barack Obama, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti and many others.

He has been photographed with Hillary Clinton and former California Governor Jerry Brown.

The 64-year-old became a successful businessman, pioneering in computer technology, specifically in electronic information services, in Arizona before moving to Los Angeles.

A one-time registered Republican, Buck began getting involved in Southern California politics in the early 1990s.

After news broke of the second death at Buck's home, Cannick announced on Monday that there would be a rally in front of his home calling on the LASD to arrest Buck.

Cannick is also demanding that the DA's Office, headed by Jackie Lacey, 'prosecute him for murder after another young black gay man was found dead in his West Hollywood apartment of an apparent overdose.'"

After President Donald Trump withdrew the US from the TPP on just his third day in the White House in 2017, the States will be left on the sidelines when the re-shaped TPP-11 comes into effect 12am on Sunday AEDT.

Australia, Canada, Japan, Mexico, New Zealand and Singapore were the first nations to ratify the agreement, formally titled the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement. Vietnam, Chile, Brunei, Peru and Malaysia are set to follow in coming months

US farmers, already hit hard by Trump's tariff battle with China and the lack of a free trade agreement with Japan, are bracing to immediately lose market share.

American wheat and beef producers have been particularly vocal.

They expect Australian farmers to use their TPP advantage to sell more to Japan.

""Japan is generally a market where we seek to maintain our strong 53 per cent market share, but today we face an imminent collapse,"" US Wheat Associates President Vince Peterson told a public hearing held by the US Trade Representative earlier this month.

""Frankly, this is because of provisions negotiated by (former US president Barack Obama's administration) for our benefit under the Trans-Pacific Partnership.

""Our competitors in Australia and Canada will now benefit from those provisions, as US farmers watch helplessly.""

Peterson said Australian and Canadian wheat producers will enjoy an immediate seven per cent drop in tariffs selling to Japan because of the TPP-11.

""By April it will have gone down by 12 per cent,"" he said.

""In very real terms, as of April 1, 2019, US wheat will face a 40 cent per bushel, or $US14 per metric tonne, resale price disadvantage to Australia and Canada.

""After nine years the US will face an automatic premium of $US70 per tonne.

""But by that time most of the market will be long gone.""

The National Cattlemen's Beef Association says exports to Japan, the top market for US beef with nearly $US2 billion in sales in 2017, could be eroded by Australian beef exporters enjoying tariff reductions to Japan under TPP-11.

The beef tariff in Japan will be cut by 27.5 per cent for Australian producers in the first year of the agreement for fresh and frozen products.

The NCBA said in most cases TPP-11 countries will see their tariff rates for beef exports to Japan fall nine per cent over the next 15 years.

""NCBA strongly supports prioritising and expediting negotiations for a US-Japan Trade Agreement,"" NCBA President Kevin Kester told a public hearing earlier this month.

""The US beef industry is at risk of losing significant market share in Japan unless immediate action is taken to level the playing field."""

It's been nearly two years since Barack Obama retired from public office, but it looks like he hasn't forgotten the skills you pick up on the campaign trail.

Such as kissing babies.

The president was golfing in Hawaii recently when he came across young mother Chelcie Edwards, who was holding her baby daughter Paisley.

Obama took Paisley into his arms and held her like a man who remembers the early days of fatherhood.

Paisley probably won't remember the experience -- how was your long-term memory at 7 weeks? -- but her mother will likely never forget. Edwards spoke to Because of Them We Can, a site that focuses on the black community.

""To have the First Black President ever to initiate holding our daughter, let alone kissing her on the forehead, has to be one of the most pivotal moments of any [parent's] life,"" Edwards told the website in a post published Monday.

""For our little girl to be in the hands of a man that is so influential, yet still so humble, and allowing her to experience something many will never get to experience is a blessing from God within itself,"" she said. ""It's just one of those things that's just indescribable.""

The former president also shared this piece of wisdom with Paisley's dad, Joseph Edwards: ""You can't beat having daughters!""

Of course, ""baby kissing"" has been a time-honored tradition for presidents and presidential hopefuls since the 1830s, when Andrew Jackson was in office -- it even has its own Wikipedia entry.

A story printed in 1888 claims the custom started in 1833 when Jackson took a ""dirty-faced infant"" from his mother's arms and declared him ""a fine specimen of American childhood.""

Here's a video of the president with Paisley and -- spoiler alert -- it's pretty cute."

A California cop who was shot dead by an illegal immigrant hours after Christmas is pictured in a newly-released photo smiling next to his loved ones in front of a holiday tree.

Newman Police Department Corporal Ronil Singh, 33, was making a traffic stop as part of a DUI investigation in the town of Newman early Wednesday when he called 'shots fired' over his radio, the Stanislaus County Sheriff's Department said. That's when he was tragically killed.

Police have not yet tracked down the suspect, who Stanislaus County Sheriff Adam Christianson confirmed was in the United States illegally.

Singh is seen in the photo posing next to his wife, Anamika, their five-month-old son and his dog.

The department said Thursday evening that detectives performed a search warrant at a property in El Nido of Merced County, but had no luck.

'The suspect was not located at the property and the investigation remains fluid. We will have no details at this time regarding the search warrant,' the department said.

Christianson said the suspect 'doesn't belong here' and that 'he is a criminal'.

President Donald Trump on Thursday seized on the case of the illegal immigrant cop-killer to renew his argument that the U.S. should erect a wall on its southern border.

'There is right now a full scale manhunt going on in California for an illegal immigrant accused of shooting and killing a police officer during a traffic stop,' Trump tweeted.

'Time to get tough on Border Security. Build the Wall!'

Singh had pulled over a gray pickup truck in the small town 100 miles south of San Francisco, after noticing it had no license plate.

Signh fired back to defend himself, Christianson said.

Trump also quoted a 2011 tweet from former President Barack Obama, who was repeating a line from his State of the Union address when he wrote: 'I strongly believe that we should take on, once and for all, the issue of illegal immigration.'

'I totally agree!' Trump added Thursday, before tying Singh's murder to the hot-button issue.

Singh was killed by an unidentified suspect. The Stanislaus County Sheriff's Department said Singh was conducting a traffic stop early Wednesday in the town of Newman, California when he called out 'shots fired' over his radio

Christianson has flown in Trump's orbit before. He sat next to the president during a May 16 event at the White House focused on opposition to 'sanctuary city' policies that prohibit law enforcement agencies from cooperating with federal immigration authorities.

'There shouldn't be anybody interfering with a sheriff's ability, a chief's ability, or anybody in this room at this table today from defending people against those who exploit and victimize them,' he said then.

'There should be no interference in our ability to protect our communities, to protect our national security.'

Authorities in California's central valley have found the truck believed to belong to the unnamed suspect who remains at large.

The vehicle, believed to have been the one stopped by Singh, was found in a garage in a mobile home park about four miles away from the scene of the shooting.

The silver extended-cab Dodge Ram 1500 pickup truck was seen in the area at the time of the shooting, and had paper plates on the vehicle, which read 'AR Auto.'

The president is facing a short window of time to secure border wall funding before the next Congress is seated and Democrats take over the House of Representatives on January 3

Working from several tips from the public, police discovered it about 13 hours after the shooting at a River Road mobile home park just south of Azevedo Road, where law enforcement officers were serving a search warrant.

Police confirmed the pickup was the one believed to have been driven by the suspect.

Crime scene tape was seen inside the mobile home park, where several media outlets from surrounding counties converged late Wednesday afternoon.

'There's lots of potential evidence,' a police spokesperson said. 'Fingerprints, DNA, gunshot residue and physical evidence. We'll be processing the truck to get any evidence to help in the prosecution.'

The unidentified suspect, who was pictured on security camera footage entering a store shortly before the fatal shots were fired, remains a fugutive.

Singh was found with multiple bullet wounds, and was taken to a local hospital where he was pronounced dead.

The sheriff's office released surveillance stills of the suspect and the gray pickup truck found near the location of the shooting.

The suspected gunman appears in the images in an unzipped hooded sweatshirt and wearing a gold chain while purchasing items in a store.

Singh was a native of Fiji and the father of an infant son. He joined the Newman police force in 2011.

Earlier in his career, Singh worked as a deputy with the Merced County Sheriff's Department.

'He was living the American dream,' said Stanislaus County Sheriff's Deputy Royjinder Singh, who is not related to the slain officer but knew him.

'He loved camping, loved hunting, loved fishing, loved his family,' the deputy said.

On his Facebook page, Singh posted Christmas Eve pictures from a deep-sea fishing trip that produced a big haul of crabs and fish.

The profile picture shows him smiling as he stands at a patrol car with a dog - the same photograph of the officer released by the sheriff's department.

The slain officer lived in Modesto. He's survived by his wife, Anamika, their son, his parents and brother.

Outgoing California Gov. Jerry Brown offered condolences to Singh's family and said flags at the state Capitol would fly at half staff in his honor.

'Our hearts are with the entire community of Newman and law enforcement officers across the state who risk their lives every day to protect and serve the people of California,' Brown said."
462,daily mail online,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6499649/Ivanka-Trump-involved-negotiations-Trump-International-Hotel-inaugural-committee.html,"Leaked emails have linked Ivanka Trump to negotiations between the Trump Organization and the presidential inaugural committee, which paid to use the Trump International Hotel in Washington DC.

The negotiations, which saw the Trump Organization take a slice of the inaugural's record-busting $107 million in donated funds, took place in mid-December of 2016, a new investigation by WNYC and ProPublica reveals.

The revelation comes as federal prosecutors probe the finances of President Donald Trump's inaugural committee and whether foreigners contributed to its events using straw donors.

A spokeswoman for the inaugural committee said its finances 'were fully audited internally and independently and are fully accounted. ... These were funds raised from private individuals and were then spent in accordance with the law and the expectations of the donors.'

Leaked emails have linked Ivanka Trump (above) to negotiations between the Trump Organization and the presidential inaugural committee

Ivanka Trump's role in the inaugural planning negotiations was previously unknown.

At the time, she was an executive vice president at the Trump Organization. After Trump took office, she left the company to serve as a senior advisor in the White House.

Prior to Trump's inauguration, massive donations flowed into his inaugural fund, which pays for the events and festivities surrounding the swearing-in ceremony.

The $107 million raised was almost double President Obama's 2009 inauguration, which was the most expensive in history at the time. At least some of the money went to the Trump Organization.

The newly leaked emails show that Ivanka Trump, the president's eldest daughter, was involved in negotiating the prices Trump International Hotel charged the inauguration.

In one email, a top inauguration planner, Stephanie Winston Wolkoff, emailed Ivanka Trump and inaugural committee deputy chairman Rick Gates expressing 'concern' that the hotel was overcharging them and worry about public reaction 'when this is audited.'

She asked that the price of renting a ballroom and meeting rooms for four days be further lowered from $175,000 per day to $85,000 per day, after hotel proposed a reduction to the $175,000 rate.

It's not clear what the original proposed fee or the final agreed price were from the leaked emails.

If the Trump Organization were found to have charged the inaugural committee above market rates for the rental, it could trigger heavy fines from the IRS.

Peter Mirijanian, a spokesman for Abbe Lowell, Ivanka Trump's ethics lawyers, said the first daughter's role was minimal.

'When contacted by someone working on the inauguration, Ms. Trump passed the inquiry on to a hotel official and said only that any resulting discussions should be at a 'fair market rate,' he said in a statement. 'Ms. Trump was not involved in any additional discussions.'

White House spokesman Hogan Gidley was asked by reporters Friday prior to the ProPublica/WNYC report if there were any 'improprieties' with the inauguration funding.

'The president of the United States has one job at the inauguration. It's to show up, to thank everyone for the service to get him elected, and then also dance with the first lady,' Gidley said in response. 'He did all of those things. This charge has nothing to do with the president of the United States, and it has nothing to do with this administration.'

The White House did not immediately respond to a subsequent request for comment.

Separately, the Wall Street Journal reported Thursday that prosecutors in New York are investigating whether some of the committee's donors made contributions in exchange for political favors and access to the Trump administration- a potential violation of federal corruption laws.

Trump and Ivanka are seen in October. She left the Trump Organization to become a senior advisor in the White House following his inauguration

The inquiry, which the newspaper said is in its early stages, is also focused on whether the inauguration committee misspent some of the $107 million it raised to stage events celebrating Trump's inauguration.

As well, the New York Times reported that prosecutors are examining whether people from Qatar, Saudi Arabia and other Middle Eastern countries made illegal payments to the committee and a pro-Trump super political action committee in a bid to influence American policy. Foreign contributions to inaugural funds and PACs are prohibited under federal law.

Both newspapers cited anonymous sources familiar with the inquiry.

The U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan did not respond to a request for comment Friday.

The inaugural committee said it has not been contacted by federal prosecutors and is not aware of any investigations.

The committee 'staged a celebration of our democratic processes and did so in full compliance with all applicable laws and disclosure obligations,' it said Friday in a statement.

'The inauguration's accounting was provided both to the Federal Election Commission and the IRS in compliance with all laws and regulations,' it said. 'These were funds raised from private individuals and were then spent in accordance with the law and the expectations of the donors.'

It added that the names of donors were given to the election commission and have been public for nearly two years. It said the donors were vetted and no improprieties were found.

It comes as Ivanka's husband Jared Kushner faces scrutiny as well, after it was claimed that he was the primary point of contact between Donald Trump and National Enquirer boss David Pecker after the 2016 presidential election.

Kushner's role, reported by the Daily Beast, is gaining exposure just as Pecker's participation in a 'catch-and-kill' arrangement to bury negative stories about Trump is being examined as a potential criminal liability for the president."

WASHINGTON (AP) - The partial government shutdown will almost certainly be handed off to a divided government to solve in the new year, as President Donald Trump sought to raise the stakes Friday and both parties traded blame in the weeklong impasse.

Agreement eludes Washington in the waning days of the Republican monopoly on power, and that sets up the first big confrontation between Trump and newly empowered Democrats. Trump is sticking with his demand for money to build a wall along the southern border, and Democrats, who take control of the House on Jan. 3, are refusing to give him what he wants.

Trump worked to escalate the showdown Friday, reissuing threats to close the U.S.-Mexico border to pressure Congress to fund the wall and to shut off aid to three Central American countries from which many migrants have fled.

""We will be forced to close the Southern Border entirely if the Obstructionist Democrats do not give us the money to finish the Wall & also change the ridiculous immigration laws that our Country is saddled with,"" he wrote in one of a series of tweets.

The president also signaled he was in no rush to seek a resolution, welcoming the fight as he heads toward his own bid for re-election in 2020. He tweeted Thursday evening that Democrats may be able to block him now, ""but we have the issue, Border Security. 2020!""

Lawyer: McCarrick repeatedly touched youth during confession

VATICAN CITY (AP) - The Vatican's sexual abuse case against ex-Cardinal Theodore McCarrick has expanded significantly after a man testified that the retired American archbishop sexually abused him for years starting when he was 11, including during confession.

James Grein testified Thursday in New York before the judicial vicar for the New York City archdiocese, who was asked by the Holy See to take his statement for the Vatican's canonical case, said Grein's attorney Patrick Noaker.

The testimony, which lasted about an hour, was difficult and stressful but Grein was proud to have done it, Noaker said.

""He wants his church back. He felt that in order to accomplish that end, he had to go in and testify here and tell them what happened, and give the church itself the chance to do the right thing,"" Noaker said in a telephone interview Friday.

Grein initially came forward in July after the New York archdiocese announced that a church investigation determined an allegation that McCarrick had groped another teenage altar boy in the 1970s was credible.

Wall Street faces annual losses despite solid gains for week

Wall Street capped a week of volatile trading Friday with an uneven finish and the market's first weekly gain since November.

Losses in technology, energy and industrial stocks outweighed gains in retailers and other consumer-focused companies. Stocks spent much of the day wavering between small gains and losses, ultimately unable to maintain the momentum from a two-day winning streak.

Even so, the major stock indexes closed with their first weekly gain in what's been an otherwise painful last month of the year. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and S&P 500 rose more than 2 percent for the week, while the Nasdaq added nearly 4 percent. The indexes are still all down around 10 percent for the month and on track for their worst December since 1931.

""It seems like convulsions in either direction have been the real norm for much of December and that's certainly been the case this week,"" said Eric Wiegand senior portfolio manager for Private Wealth Management at U.S. Bank. ""The initial push higher and then seeing it subside a little bit is perhaps getting back to a little bit more of a normal environment, reflecting the reality that we have still a number of issues overhanging the market.""

The market's sharp downturn since October has intensified this month, erasing all its 2018 gains and nudging the S&P 500 closer to its worst year since 2008.

Trump and China loom over a tumultuous year in Asia

SEOUL, South Korea (AP) - To judge by the stream of extraordinary images on the Korean Peninsula, you might think 2018 marked the beginning of an elusive peace in one of the world's last vestiges of the Cold War.

Just months after a barrage of threats of missile strikes and personal insults had many fearing the worst, President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un strode toward each other on a sultry June day in Singapore and grasped hands, vowing to upend decades of animosity and pursue a nuclear settlement. About a month earlier, Kim walked across the cracked concrete block that marks the Korean border, the world's most heavily armed, and then, with a grin, guided a delighted South Korean President Moon Jae-in back into northern territory for a quick photo-op. Moon later flew into Pyongyang for a triumphant tour that saw him address a stadium of 150,000 North Koreans.

And yet, despite all the jaw-dropping images, any one of which would have stood out in sharp relief in an ordinary year, a sense of unease has taken hold in South Korea. There has been no substantial disarmament by the North, no grand peace deals, and many have the same old fears that North Korea will never give up its nuclear arsenal.

As 2018 draws to a close, the Korean Peninsula is not the only place in Asia looking ahead with apprehension.

Across the region, there are pockets of optimism but also a pervasive feeling of disquiet, a lot of which is linked to the twin political behemoths whose presence has been felt this year in every corner of Asia: China and Trump. That's especially true of a Trump-China trade war that has caused fears of a global economic slowdown.

Sheriff blames sanctuary law for California officer's death

SAN FRANCISCO (AP) - A suspected drunken driver accused of killing a California police officer who pulled him over was captured Friday as he tried to flee back to Mexico, where he lived before illegally crossing into the U.S., authorities said.

The sheriff leading the investigation blamed California's sanctuary law for preventing local authorities from reporting Gustavo Perez Arriaga to U.S. immigration officials for two previous drunken driving arrests. If he had been deported, the sheriff said, Cpl. Ronil Singh of the tiny Newman Police Department would still be alive.

""We can't ignore the fact that this could have been preventable,"" Stanislaus County Sheriff Adam Christianson told reporters, asking why the state was ""providing sanctuary for criminals (and) gang members. It's a conversation we need to have.""

Following a statewide manhunt, Perez Arriaga was arrested on a murder warrant in a house near Bakersfield, about 200 miles (320 kilometers) southeast of where Singh was shot Wednesday.

As a SWAT team prepared to raid the house, Perez Arriaga came out with his hands up and surrendered. He was sent north in the slain officer's handcuffs, Kern County Sheriff Donny Youngblood said.

EPA targets Obama crackdown on mercury from coal plants

WASHINGTON (AP) - The Trump administration on Friday targeted an Obama-era regulation credited with helping dramatically reduce toxic mercury pollution from coal-fired power plants, saying the benefits to human health and the environment may not be worth the cost of the regulation.

The 2011 Obama administration rule, called the Mercury and Air Toxics Standards, led to what electric utilities say was an $18 billion clean-up of mercury and other toxins from the smokestacks of coal-fired power plants.

Overall, environmental groups say, federal and state efforts have cut mercury emissions from coal-fired power plants by 85 percent in roughly the last decade.

Mercury causes brain damage, learning disabilities and other birth defects in children, among other harm. Coal power plants in this country are the largest single manmade source of mercury pollutants, which enters the food chain through fish and other items that people consume.

A proposal Friday from the Environmental Protection Agency challenges the basis for the Obama regulation. It calculates that the crackdown on mercury and other toxins from coal plants produced only a few million dollars a year in measurable health benefits and was not ""appropriate and necessary"" - a legal benchmark under the country's landmark Clean Air Act.

UK honors cave rescue divers, Twiggy, Monty Python's Palin

LONDON (AP) - British divers who rescued young soccer players trapped in a flooded cave in Thailand are among those being recognized in Britain's New Year's Honors List, along with 1960s model Twiggy and Monty Python star Michael Palin.

Twiggy, a model who shot to stardom during the Beatles era, will become a ""dame"" - the female equivalent of a knight - while Palin, whose second career has seen him become an acclaimed travel documentary maker, receives a knighthood.

Jim Carter, who played the acerbic Mr. Carson in ""Downton Abbey,"" was also recognized, as was filmmaker Christopher Nolan, director of ""Inception"" and ""Dunkirk,"" and best-selling author Philip Pullman, creator of the Dark Materials trilogy.

The list released Friday also named 43 people who responded quickly to the extremist attacks in Manchester and London in 2017.

The honors process starts with nominations from the public, which are winnowed down by committees and sent to the prime minister before the various honors are bestowed by Queen Elizabeth II or senior royals next year.

Supreme Court keeps a lower profile, but for how long?

WASHINGTON (AP) - The Supreme Court began its term with the tumultuous confirmation of Justice Brett Kavanaugh, followed by a studied avoidance of drama on the high court bench - especially anything that would divide the five conservatives and four liberals.

The justices have been unusually solicitous of each other in the courtroom since Kavanaugh's confirmation, and several have voiced concern that the public perceives the court as merely a political institution. Chief Justice John Roberts seems determined to lead the one Washington institution that stays above the political fray. Even Roberts' rebuke of President Donald Trump, after the president criticized a federal judge, was in defense of an independent, apolitical judiciary.

The next few weeks will test whether the calm can last.

When they gather in private on Jan. 4 to consider new cases for arguments in April and into next term, the justices will confront a raft of high-profile appeals.

Abortion restrictions, workplace discrimination against LGBT people and partisan gerrymandering are on the agenda. Close behind are appeals from the Trump administration seeking to have the court allow it to end an Obama-era program that shields young immigrants from deportation and to put in place restrictive rules for transgender troops.

Snyder signs bill to make Michigan ballot drives tougher

LANSING, Mich. (AP) - Republican Gov. Rick Snyder on Friday signed a law making it harder for groups to put proposals on the Michigan ballot, imposing a geographical-based requirement that may prevent them from gathering signatures for petitions mainly from the most populated areas.

The move followed voters' passage of three Democratic-backed proposals last month and Republicans' unprecedented tactic - enacted by the term-limited governor two weeks ago - to weaken minimum wage and paid sick time laws that began as ballot initiatives. Legal challenges are expected in Michigan and neighboring Wisconsin, where the GOP recently passed more sweeping laws to curtail incoming Democrats.

Also Friday, Snyder vetoed a bill that would have automatically empowered the Republican-led Legislature to intervene in certain lawsuits, which had been seen by critics as an attempt to especially hamstring incoming Democratic Attorney General-elect Dana Nessel but also Democratic Gov.-elect Gretchen Whitmer. He also vetoed a measure that would have blocked future attempts to force the disclosure of donors to nonprofits, including political groups whose sway has grown in elections.

He signed a law requiring his successor's administration and future governors to have a ""clear and convincing"" need to adopt environmental and other state regulations that are tougher than federal standards, despite Whitmer's objections.

Snyder finished acting on bills days before he leaves office after a frenetic lame-duck session in which GOP lawmakers passed some measures criticized as power grabs.

Nielsen visits Texas border after second child's death

EL PASO, Texas (AP) - Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen on Friday visited the Texas border city where an 8-year-old Guatemalan boy was detained with his father before dying in government custody .

DHS spokeswoman Katie Waldman said earlier in the week that Nielsen was scheduled to tour multiple stations and substations, and was also scheduled to meet with emergency medical technicians and medical professionals, as well as local officials.

Nielsen then was scheduled to go to Yuma, Arizona, on Saturday.

DHS did not immediately release more details on the trip or who Nielsen met, saying it was closed to the press. Late Friday, El Paso Mayor Dee Margo confirmed he was among those who met with Nielsen, saying they discussed ""our immigration needs on the border."" The statement from Margo, a Republican, did not mention the boy's death or whether it was discussed.

The trip came four days after the death of 8-year-old Felipe Gomez Alonzo. Felipe was the second Guatemalan child to die in government custody in three weeks."
464,daily mail online,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-6498795/Russia-claims-US-ignoring-outreach-nuclear-disagreement.html,"MOSCOW (AP) - Russia wants to sit down with Pentagon officials for ""open and specific"" talks on alleged violations of the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces treaty, the Russian Defense Ministry said Saturday.

The U.S. claims Russia is violating the INF treaty, and on Dec. 4 issued an ultimatum that Moscow come into compliance with the accord in 60 days, or else Washington will withdraw. Russia denies it's in breach of the treaty.

Russian Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu sent his counterpart, U.S. Defense Secretary James Mattis, a proposal for launching a dialogue three days ago, according to a statement Saturday.

But Russia says it hasn't received any official reply from the Pentagon, which spokesman Maj. Gen. Igor Konashenkov said proves that the U.S. is unwilling to maintain professional dialogue with Moscow on security issues.

On Friday, the Russian mission to the U.N. submitted a draft resolution calling for the international community to support the INF treaty against Washington's threat of withdrawal, warning that a collapse of the treaty could undermine nuclear arms control across the board.

Washington began sounding off on a potential Russian violation of the INF treaty under President Barack Obama.

Under President Donald Trump, those allegations have been specified and coupled with threats of unilateral withdrawal from the landmark 1987 arms agreement, which banned an entire class of ground-launched missiles with ranges between 500 and 5,000 kilometers (310-3,100 miles).

The U.S. claims that a new Russian missile, designated by NATO as the SSC-8, operates in ranges forbidden by the INF treaty. Russia has strongly and routinely denied the claim, at times throwing accusations of non-compliance back at Washington.

These claims have, at times, focused on U.S. deployment of anti-missile systems in Romania and Poland. Moscow takes specific issue with the U.S. Mk-41 vertical launching system used by these missile defense installations.

The Mk-41, derived from the U.S. Navy's Aegis missile system, can launch a variety of American missiles - including the sea-launched Tomahawk cruise missile, a weapon that would be banned by INF were it deployed on a ground-based launcher.

INF not only bans ground-based intermediate-range missiles, but their launchers too. And Moscow has seized on this point to claim the U.S. is responsible for destabilizing the INF treaty."

(AP Photo/J. David Ake, File)

However, the EPA said it will seek comment during a 60-day public-review period on whether ""we would be obligated to rescind"" the Obama-era rule if the agency adopts Friday's finding that the regulation was not appropriate and necessary. Any such change would trigger new rounds in what have already been years of court battles over regulating mercury pollution from coal plants.

This move is the latest by the Trump administration that changes estimates of the costs and payoffs of regulations as part of an overhaul of Obama-era environmental protections.

It's also the administration's latest proposed move on behalf of the U.S. coal industry, which has been struggling in the face of competition from natural gas and other cheaper, cleaner forms of energy. The Trump administration in August proposed an overhaul for another Obama-era regulation that would have prodded electricity providers to get less of their energy from dirtier-burning coal plants.

In a statement, the EPA said Friday the administration was ""providing regulatory certainty"" by more accurately estimating the costs and benefits of the Obama administration crackdown on mercury and other toxic emissions from smokestacks.

Hal Quinn, head of the National Mining Association, charged in a statement Friday that the Obama administration had carried out ""perhaps the largest regulatory accounting fraud perpetrated on American consumers"" when it calculated that the broad health benefits to Americans would outweigh the cost of equipment upgrades by power providers.

Sen. Tom Carper of Delaware, the top Democrat on the Senate's Environment and Public Works Committee, condemned the Trump administration's move.

The EPA has ""decided to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory"" after the successful clean-up of toxins from the country's coal-plant smokestacks, Carper said.

He and other opponents of the move said the Trump administration was playing with numbers, ignoring what Carper said were clear health, environmental and economic benefits to come up with a bottom line that suited the administration's deregulatory aims.

Janet McCabe, a former air-quality official in the Obama administration's EPA, called the proposal part of ""the quiet dismantling of the regulatory framework"" for the federal government's environmental protections.

Coming one week into a government shutdown, and in the lull between Christmas and New Year, ""this low-key announcement shouldn't fool anyone - it is a big deal, with significant implications,"" McCabe said."
466,daily mail online,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-6592595/Justice-Department-opinion-threaten-online-gambling.html,"LAS VEGAS (AP) - A legal opinion from the U.S. Department of Justice made public Monday could threaten the viability of online gambling that crosses state lines such as poker.

The 23-page opinion interprets the federal Wire Act, which prohibits interstate wagering, to apply to any form of gambling that crosses state lines, not just sports betting. The opinion marks a reversal for the department, which under the Obama administration in 2011 said online gambling within states that does not involve sporting events would not violate the federal law.

The 2011 opinion opened the door for cash-strapped states and their lotteries to bring online gambling to their residents, as long as it did not involve interstate sports betting.

Nevada, New Jersey and Delaware legalized online gambling after that opinion was issued, and the three states have agreements allowing poker players to compete online across the states. Pennsylvania became the fourth state to legalize online casino gambling in 2017.

Since it began in Nov. 2013, internet gambling has been the brightest spot for casinos in Atlantic City, New Jersey, often making the difference between an up month and a down one for the nine casinos. Figures released earlier Monday show internet gambling revenue increased by 21.6 percent in 2018 in New Jersey, to nearly $300 million.

Now, the Justice Department says the previous opinion misinterpreted the statute.

(AP Photo/Wayne Parry, File)

""Based upon the plain language of the statute, however, we reach a different result,"" attorneys for the department wrote in the opinion dated Nov. 2. ""While the Wire Act is not a model of artful drafting, we conclude that the words of the statute are sufficiently clear and that all but one of its prohibitions sweep beyond sports gambling.""

The Wire Act was enacted in 1961 to target the mob and its gambling activities.

Casino operator Caesars Entertainment, which offers online gambling in Nevada and New Jersey, declined to comment Monday.

The American Gaming Association, the largest lobbying group of the U.S. casino industry, said it is reviewing the opinion and its implications on the industry, consumers and ""the eight states that currently offer legal, regulated sports gaming.""

Experts on Monday said the sports betting industry will remain unaffected because the Wire Act already applied to that form of gambling under the previous interpretation.

Jennifer Roberts, associate director of the International Center for Gaming Regulation at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, said the impact of the opinion rests on how strictly the Justice Department is going to enforce the new interpretation of the statute.

""Some could go really far and say even if you send a text message to a casino customer in another state and you are saying 'Come play blackjack this weekend here's a deal,' arguably you can say that is information that assists in the placement of a wager,"" she said. ""I doubt it will go that far, but we will once again be subject to the interpretation.""

The new legal opinion will likely be challenged in court, an issue acknowledged by the department attorneys in their document.

Daniel Wallach, co-founding director of the University of New Hampshire School of Law Sports Wagering and Integrity Program, said the opinion could have ""an immediate chilling effect"" on the ability of states to conduct lotteries online.

""I think the most obviously impacted stakeholders are the lotteries that do internet sales, and that group is the most likely stakeholder to challenge this opinion in court.""

Advocacy group Coalition to Stop Internet Gambling and former U.S. Sen. Blanche Lincoln of Arkansas in a statement cheered the new opinion, characterizing the previous one as ""problematic legally as it was morally"" and calling the new one a ""win for parents, children and other vulnerable populations.""

The group has been backed by Sheldon Adelson, chairman of casino operator Las Vegas Sands Corp., a GOP megadonor supporter of President Donald Trump and a staunch opponent of internet gambling.

""This has been years in the making,"" Wallach said. ""A number of influential Republican lawmakers, backed by Sheldon Adelson through political campaign contributions, have wanted to see the Wire Act restored to its original intent. The problem is the original intent of the Wire Act only applies to sports betting, and I think this muddies the water.""

467,daily mail online,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-6592675/Trumps-Cuba-policy-hurts-private-sector-new-figures-say.html,"HAVANA (AP) - President Donald Trump's Cuba policy is driving hundreds of millions of dollars from the island's private entrepreneurs to its military-controlled tourism sector, the opposite of its supposed goal, new statistics say.

Trump announced in June 2017 that he was tightening limits on U.S. travel to Cuba in order to starve military-linked travel businesses and funnel money directly to the Cuban people.

He restricted Americans' ability to travel to Cuba on their own, rather than with a tour group. At the same time, he allowed U.S. cruise lines to continue to take passengers to Cuba, where they pay millions to disembark at military-run docks and make quick trips onshore that are generally coordinated by government tour agencies that steer travelers to state-run destinations.

Cuban government figures from the first full year under Trump's policy show occupancy of private bed-and-breakfasts in Havana plunged to 44 percent in 2018 after years at near capacity in the wake of President Barack Obama's start of normalization with Cuba, said Michael Bernal, commercial director for the Ministry of Tourism.

Even as the private sector suffered, U.S. travel to Cuba was growing, from 618,000 in 2017 to 630,000 last year, Tourism Ministry figures say. Most of those travelers came by ship, avoiding the confusing rules on travel to the island with package tours that are guaranteed to comply with the law.

The shift to cruises meant the average U.S. stay on the island dropped from six days to three, said Jose Luis Perello, a former University of Havana professor who studies Cuba's tourism industry.

(AP Photo/Desmond Boylan, File)

That has had a devastating effect on owners and employees of Cuba's 24,185 private bed-and-breakfasts and 2,170 private restaurants. They cherished U.S. travelers as heavy tippers who crammed days full of activities like classic car rides and cooking classes that put money into private hands.

David Pajon, a university professor who bought an apartment to rent in Old Havana, said he has had to drop his rates 40 percent since Trump's new policy went into effect in 2017. He still was a third empty last month, the first time in three years that he wasn't fully booked in December.

""U.S.-Cuba normalization inspired a lot of people who thought this was a good business to invest their savings in,"" Pajon said. ""And all of a sudden you have the U.S. government creating a situation that has an impact on the number of people who came, or changes the way they're coming - on cruise ships!""

The number of U.S. travelers to Cuba grew from 162,000 in 2015, the year after Obama and then Cuban President Raul Castro announced detente, to 284,000 in 2016 and 618,000 in 2017.

The overall number of travelers grew, too, from 3.5 million in 2015 to 3.7 million in 2016, 4.3 million in 2017 and 4.7 million last year.

Nonetheless, the private sector suffered.

Enrique Nunez, owner of La Guarida, perhaps Havana's best-known restaurant, said he had to cut his employees' hours last year because his revenue fell 40 percent.

""We don't understand the U.S. rules,"" said Bernal, the tourism official. ""We heard the president's speech saying that the U.S. government supports entrepreneurs. However, that's the sector that's suffering most in Cuba.""

468,the huffington post,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/opinion-wilbur-ross-census-citizenship-question_us_5c2fbc18e4b073352832b457,"Last week, Democrats officially became the majority party in the House of Representatives, gaining control of the congressional committees that are empowered to investigate the presidency of Donald Trump. There is no shortage of targets for Democrats, but one who will be immediately scrutinized by the newly named House Committee on Oversight and Reform is Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross and his misleading testimony about his decision to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census.

In March of last year, the Census Bureau reported that by 2045, white people in America would be the minority, comprising 49.7 percent of the population. A few weeks later, the Commerce Department announced that for the first time in 70 years, the constitutionally mandated census would include a question about citizenship status. With Trump leading the Republican Party's crusade against minorities, immigrants and the working poor, the decision to tamper with the census sure looks like a clear effort to lower the response rate and undermine the accuracy of the count.

Why is this important? Because the census is how representation in our government is determined. The demographics in this country are changing, and this terrifies the virtually all-white club that is today's Republican Party. Its only chance at staying in power is to rig the way power is distributed. What happens with the census could be one of the most important and immediate fallouts of the Trump presidency.

On March 20, 2018, before the House Committee on Appropriations, Ross testified that ""we have had a request, as everyone is aware, from the Department of Justice, to add a citizenship question to the 2020 census."" He specifically stated that ""we are responding solely to the Department of Justice's request.""

Two days later, Ross told the House Ways and Means Committee, ""The Department of Justice, as you know, initiated the request for inclusion of the citizenship question.""

The same claim about the Justice Department's request was repeated by a Commerce Department official before the Oversight Committee on May 8, and by Ross again before the Senate Committee on Appropriations two days later.

However, internal documents made public revealed that Ross was taking steps to add the citizenship question long before the Justice Department's December 2017 request. On March 10, 2017, Ross received an email from a Commerce Department official regarding ""your question on the Census,"" which included a Wall Street Journal article with the headline, ""The Pitfalls of Counting Illegal Immigrants.""

Ross lied to Congress multiple times when he testified that the citizenship addition to the 2020 census originated with a request from the Justice Department.

On April 5, 2017, Ross' executive assistant sent an email to Ross' wife asking about his plans for that evening because ""Steve Bannon has asked that the Secretary talk to someone about the Census."" Bannon, at the time, was one of the highest-ranking advisers in Trump's White House.

The American people have a fundamental right to know why this change was made and why Ross hasn't been truthful about the decision-making process behind it.

In 2009, when Barack Obama's White House chief of staff Rahm Emanuel wanted to change the census chain of command so that the bureau would report directly to the White House, Oversight Republicans, led by my former boss Darrell Issa, blasted the action as a ""shamefully transparent attempt by your Administration to politicize the Census Bureau and manipulate the 2010 Census."" The appearance of White House interference in the census prompted House Republicans to introduce a resolution calling on the secretary of commerce to ""use all legal and reasonable means to count every living person"" in the 2010 census. The resolution, by the way, made no mention of citizenship or legal status.

To date, the same Oversight Republicans who were so willing to attack Obama have been silent about Trump, silent about Bannon's intervention, and silent about Ross' false testimony before Congress. Committee Democrats have diligently pursued the issue and made multiple requests for hearings and subpoenas. Oversight Republicans ignored them and did nothing. That's all about to change.

On May 2, 2017, Ross complained in an email to his staff, ""I am mystified why nothing have [sic] been done in response to my months old request that we include the citizenship question."" His staff responded, ""We need to work with Justice to get them to request that citizenship be added back as a census question, and we have the court cases to illustrate that DOJ has legitimate need for the question to be included. I will arrange a meeting with DOJ staff this week.""

This exchange illustrates very pointedly that Ross lied to Congress multiple times when he testified that the citizenship addition to the 2020 census originated with a request from the Justice Department. Very clearly, the request from the DOJ was orchestrated by Ross and his staff.

On July 21, 2017, Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach sent an email to Ross' chief of staff revealing he had spoken to Ross ""at the direction of Steve Bannon"" and that the citizenship issue was ""pretty straightforward,"" as Bannon had provided ""the text of the question to be added."""
469,the huffington post,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/opinion-ocasio-cortez-pelosi-clinton-trump-congress-2020_us_5c312b98e4b0733528336375,"When Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was sworn in to Congress, she wore a suit of suffragette white. Fashion was an important part of the suffragette movement, a way to push back against stereotypes of women who sought liberation as unfashionable and unattractive. White clothing symbolized the purity of their motives.

Ocasio-Cortez's other sartorial choices -- bright-red lipstick and hoop earrings -- were worn, she said, in homage to Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor, who was advised to appear at her confirmation hearing with neutral-colored nail polish, and had refused, keeping her red.

Watching Ocasio-Cortez being sworn in, I couldn't help but think of a similar outfit -- an all-white pantsuit -- worn by Hillary Clinton, when she officially became the Democratic nominee for president in 2016. Like Ocasio-Cortez, Clinton intentionally set out to echo the suffragettes' struggle for the vote, and to imbue her clothing choice with an appropriate nod to the historical significance of her achievement.

This week, it was thrilling to watch a new class of House members sworn in, a class that contained more women, a substantial minority of whom were women of color, than ever before in United States history. Nancy Pelosi retook the gavel of the speakership. The unprecedented diversity of the Democratic freshman class was unmissable. Detroit's Rashida Tlaib inspired Palestinian-Americans to exult on social media by wearing a traditional thobe, and Ilhan Omar, the first Somali-American in Congress, matched an elegant black hijab with a black manicure.

This isn't just an idle fixation on fashion, a legislative who-wore-it-best. These outfits were selected with evident attention to historical detail, cultural resonance and symbolism. Ocasio-Cortez and others have used historical detail as inspiration for sartorial choices to intentionally echo women who came before them, women who strove for power and attained it. It's a concrete manifestation of the way representation in the halls of power inspires future generations of leaders. Women in power provide visible, compelling encouragement to other women. They are the evidence, our well-dressed and symbolically accessorized proof, that achieving power is possible.

Watching Congress edge toward fuller representation of half the country's population is exhilarating. But for me, it's only created a hunger for more representation. Our nation's legislature is far from achieving gender parity. Even as the Democrats do a better job of electing leaders who look like the people they'll lead, the Republican caucus became even whiter and more male in the 2018 midterms. And as the long, long process of the 2020 election begins to rumble into being, I've found myself returning to a longing I felt acutely during the agonizing contest of 2016: I want my next president to be a woman.

Women in power provide visible, compelling encouragement to other women. They are the evidence, our well-dressed and symbolically accessorized proof, that achieving power is possible.

I felt it with Clinton's candidacy: I wanted a member of my gender, for the very first time, to sit behind the Resolute Desk, to guide our nation's policy, to sign bills into law. I wanted a woman to take her place in the halls of power, and put an end to nearly 250 years of male rule.

Over the long, hotly contested 2016 Democratic primary, I had many occasions to doubt that such a desire was valid. Clinton's candidacy sparked an unparalleled degree of animus among many on the left. Her cautious, technocratic policies and stiff mannerisms became subjects not only of mockery, but of genuine loathing.

The debates between Clinton's supporters and those who backed Bernie Sanders became a policy battleground, one in which my natural affinity drifted toward the eminently sensible policies of single-payer health care and free college education. But gender was the undercurrent of all those arguments, the acrid aftertaste I couldn't shake. Throughout it all, I still wanted a woman president.

In arguments with friends and relatives, I was made to doubt that desire again and again. Wasn't it shallow? Wasn't I a ""vagina voter""? Wasn't it, paradoxically, sexist to consider gender in my selection of a future president?

I've found myself returning to a longing I felt acutely during the agonizing contest of 2016: I want my next president to be a woman.

The arguments revolved on themselves, quickly devolving into bitter tedium. I recognized the real stakes behind the policy arguments -- the accurate diagnosis that, under Obama, progress had been too slow, and Democrats too eager to seek compromise, leaving millions bereft of health care and slipping through the cracks of a slashed social safety net.

But I recognized too a fierce longing in myself, a nearly wild desire to see the ""highest, hardest glass ceiling"" shattered at last. In Clinton's general election platform, the lack of ambitious, visionary policies that could measurably better the lives of Americans was palpable. But at the moment she took to the podium at the Democratic National Convention, swathed in white, standing before the nation with the force of centuries of history and longing behind her, I was struck by the undeniable power of the moment. I felt a shiver to my core.

In the last two years, the indignities of that deferred dream have impressed themselves on me with a vengeance. The miasmic swamp we now call our politics is not only the era of Donald Trump, whose treatment of women has always been abhorrent. It's the era of Brett Kavanaugh, with his blackout beers and the specter of sexual assault. It's an era of unrelenting assault on women's health care at home and abroad, with abortion protections hanging in the increasingly precarious balance of the Supreme Court. The near miss of the Clinton loss is all the more painful in an era of the male grotesque.

As the potential for an end to the Trump era ticks closer, female candidates for the presidency are already subjects of buzz and speculation. Elizabeth Warren has announced her candidacy and has already set out to charm the inhabitants of Sioux City, Iowa. Other potential female 2020 Democratic contenders, like Kamala Harris, Amy Klobuchar and Kirsten Gillibrand, have begun, cautiously, exploring runs.

And I've found that my desire for representation has not dimmed in the slightest, despite a growing chorus of skeptical voices who wonder if a woman can beat Trump. Its return has surprised me with its ferocity. To see a female president in my lifetime is not an idle wish; it is a hunger, an insatiable desire. Watching the 116th Congress being sworn in was a swelling reminder of what it is to feel represented in my government, but it was also a reminder of how partial those gains have been, and how dear. In a country that has never been led by a woman, how can anyone claim that gender equality is at hand -- or even possible?

I've had three years to mull over the 2016 primaries, a subject I never particularly wanted to revisit, but which has a habit of recurring in political conversation like a stench. Questions of centrist versus leftist policies remain complex, and fraught with real consequence for the lives and livelihoods of Americans. But this time, I can't be talked out of my desire for a woman president. I can't be gaslit out of it, or told it's trivial, unnecessary, too much to ask, unimportant. I know in my soul that it is important. Looking down the pale, male corridors of past power, I reflect on centuries of stymied hopes with sorrow, but I look to the future with a terrible and frightening hope in my chest.

Stanley, who was the U.S. commander in Afghanistan for a year during the Obama administration, didn't hold back in his criticism of the president in an interview with ABC News.

'I think it's important for me to work for people who I think are basically honest, who tell the truth as best they know it,' he said of why he would not join Trump's administration.

Retired General Stanley McChrystal slammed President Donald Trump as immoral, shady, and a liar

McChrystal said he would not serve in President Donald Trump's administration

'You think he's a liar?,' asked ABC's Martha Raddatz.

'I don't think he tells the truth,' McChrystal replied.

'Is Trump immoral, in your view?,' she asked.

'I think he is,' he responded.

McChrystal was the U.S. commander in Afghanistan under then-President Barack Obama and did not mince words then either.

He gave an interview to Rolling Stone in June 2010 where he mocked several administration officials, including then-Vice President Joe Biden.

Obama called him onto the carpet, dragging him from Afghanistan to the Oval Office for an explanation of the interview.

McChrystal apologized and resigned from his post amid the fallout.

On Sunday, he praised another military commander for his resignation.

McChrystal told ABC News that the resignation letter from Defense Secretary James Mattis was 'valuable' and should cause all Americans to think about their commander-in-chief.

'I would guess that Secretary Mattis took a long time agonizing over writing a letter that was as direct about his feelings as that particular letter was. He knew it would be very public and it would make a very strong statement that was much broader than the Syria issue. It was about America's role in the world,' he said.

He added: 'I personally think it was valuable. I think maybe it causes the American people to take pause and say, wait a minute, if we have someone who is as selfless and as committed as Jim Mattis resigns his position, walking away from all the responsibility he feels for every service member in our forces, and he does so in a public way like that, we ought to stop and say, OK, why did he do it? We ought to ask what kind of commander in chief he had that Jim Mattis that, you know, the good Marine, felt he had to walk away.'

Mattis' resignation came in protest after Trump announced he was pulling out U.S. troops from Syria, which the two men disagreed about.

Stanley McChrystal was U.S. Commander in Afghanistan under then-President Barack Obama until his resignation in June 2010 after he criticized Obama officials to Rolling Stone magazine

McChrystal praised Defense Secretary Jim Mattis' (right) resignation letter from Trump's Cabinet

He slammed Trump in his resignation letter - a move that earned him an early exit from the administration.

'Because you have the right to a Secretary of Defense whose views are better aligned with yours on these and other subjects,' Mattis wrote in his letter, 'I believe it is right for me to step down from my position.'

'One core belief I have always held is that our strength as a nation is inextricably linked to the strength of our unique and comprehensive system of alliances and partnerships,' he wrote.

'While the US remains the indispensable nation in the free world, we cannot protect our interests or serve that role effectively without maintaining strong alliances and showing respect to those allies.'

Mattis also declared that America 'must be resolute and unambiguous in our approach to those countries whose strategic interests are increasingly in tension with ours.'

'We ought to ask what kind of commander in chief he had that Jim Mattis that, you know, the good Marine, felt he had to walk away,' McChrystal told ABC News

Trump later announced Mattis would leave the Pentagon at the end of the year instead of February as his resignation originally said.

Deputy Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan will be acting secretary.

McChrystal cautioned anyone who would join the president's administration to think carefully if they could be fully loyal to Trump.

'I would ask them to look in the mirror and ask them if they can get comfortable enough with President Trump's approach to governance, how he conducts himself, with his values and with his world view, to be truly loyal to him as a commander in chief and going forward,' he said.

'And we're all instinctively loyal. But the reality is, if there's too much of a disconnect, then I would tell him, I think it's - it would be a bad foundation upon which to try to build a successful partnership with that job,' he added.

He said of Trump supporters: ' I would ask every American to do is, again, stand in front of that mirror and say, what are we about? Am I really willing to throw away or ignore some of the things that people do that are pretty unacceptable, normally, just because they accomplish certain other things that we might like?'

He added: 'If we want to be governed by someone we wouldn't do a business deal with because their background is so shady, if we're willing to do that, then that's in conflict with who I think we are. And so I think it's necessary at those times to take a stand.'"
471,daily mail online,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-6540177/Top-Republican-urge-Trump-rethink-Syria-pullout.html,"US Senator Lindsey Graham, pictured at a November 2018 news conference at the US Capitol, said he would urge President Donald Trump to 'reconsider' his planned Syria pullout

A senior Republican senator said Sunday that he would be meeting with US President Donald Trump to urge him to reconsider his plan to withdraw all US troops from Syria and many from Afghanistan.

""If we leave (Syria) now, the Kurds will get slaughtered,"" Lindsey Graham said on ABC's ""This Week,"" referring to the Kurdish troops allied with US forces in Syria.

""I'm going to ask the president to do something that President Obama would never do: reconsider."" He did not say when the two would be meeting.

Graham, who sits on the Armed Services committee and has frequently visited US troops in conflict regions, said Trump was ""frustrated"" by the limited options available in Syria.

""I'm going to talk to him,"" Graham said. ""The president is reconsidering how we would do this. He's frustrated.

Key dates in the Syrian conflict

""I get it. We're not the policemen of the world here. We're fighting a war against ISIS,"" he said, using an alternative name for the Islamic State group. ""They're not defeated in Syria. I'm asking the president to make sure we have troops there to protect us.""

Graham added: ""I'm going to ask him to sit down with his generals and reconsider how to do this. Slow it down. Make sure we get it right and ISIS never comes back. Don't turn Syria over to the Iranians.""

- A Trump announcement? -

Top Trump advisor Kellyanne Conway seemed to hint that the US president might be planning to tweak his blueprint for a troop withdrawal from Syria

Kellyanne Conway, a close Trump advisor, seemed to hint on Sunday that the president might be tweaking his withdrawal plans.

""In Iraq he had a closed-door meeting and he said watch what happens... Watch what happens because he's got plans and I won't get ahead of his announcement, but he did want me to convey that,"" she said on ""Fox News Sunday.""

""This president is cleaning up the mess left by the last administration, which never took the threat of ISIS seriously.""

Trump's abrupt decision on Syria stunned regional players, US politicians of both parties and military leaders, who expressed surprise that such a major decision would be announced after apparently so little advance consultation, against the advice of his national security advisors -- and on Twitter.

US Defense Secretary Jim Mattis resigned following the announcement, which came on the same day that US officials said Trump was also planning a significant drawdown in Afghanistan, with some reports suggesting as many as half of the 14,000 troops could leave.

Graham warned at the time that a reduction now of US forces in war-torn Afghanistan risked ""paving the way toward a second 9/11.""

A prominent critic of the move was retired US army general Stanley McChrystal, the former commander of US and international forces in Afghanistan.

On Sunday, he told ABC the dual drawdowns could seriously weaken US influence in the region.

""We have a tumultuous regime or region (in Syria) that now has a Russian presence which had been out for about 30 years... and now Russia is back. They're back in an influential way,"" he said.

Retired US army general Stanley McChrystal said a US withdrawal from Syria could create greater instability in the region and sap US influence

""Iran has increased influence across the region now. If you pull American influence out, you're likely to have greater instability, and of course it will be much more difficult for the United States to try to push events in any direction.""

Similarly, he said, Trump's planned drawdown in Afghanistan could seriously undercut American leverage there.

""Just when we were starting to sit down with the Taliban, just as we were starting to begin negotiations, he basically traded away the biggest leverage point we have... Their incentives to try to cut a deal dropped dramatically,"" McChrystal added."

Richard Overton served in an all-black army unit for three years and was involved in combat operations and beach landings in the Pacific during the war.

He was honoured on Veterans Day in 2013 by President Barack Obama.

He credited God for his long life - though he also said whisky and cigars had played their part.

""I been smoking cigars from when I was 18 years old, I'm still a smoking 'em. Twelve a day,"" he is quoted as saying by local TV.

He was in his 30s when he volunteered for the army, served in the all-black 1887th Engineer Aviation Battalion, and was at Pearl Harbor not long after the Japanese attack in 1941.

""He was there at Pearl Harbor, when the battleships were still smouldering,"" Mr Obama said of Overton in 2013. ""He was there at Okinawa. He was there at Iwo Jima, where he said, 'I only got out of there by the grace of God.'""

473,daily mail online,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-6540287/Former-Afghanistan-commander-warns-plans-cut-troops.html,"WASHINGTON (AP) - The former top U.S. commander in Afghanistan said Sunday that withdrawing up to half the 14,000 American troops serving there would reduce the incentive for the Taliban to negotiate a peace deal after more than 17 years of war.

Retired Gen. Stanley McChrystal said the U.S. has ""basically traded away the biggest leverage point we have."" McChrystal's comments were in response to reports that President Donald Trump had ordered the Pentagon to develop plans to withdraw thousands of American troops by next summer. Outgoing Defense Secretary Jim Mattis mentioned the order in his resignation letter. Mattis' last day in the administration is Monday.

The U.S. and NATO formally concluded their combat mission in 2014, but American and allied troops remain, conducting strikes on the Islamic State group and the Taliban and working to train and build the Afghan military.

""If you tell the Taliban that we are absolutely leaving on date certain, cutting down, weakening ourselves, their incentives to try to cut a deal drop dramatically,"" McChrystal said on ABC's ""This Week.""

McChrystal also said he's worried that the Afghan people will lose confidence in the U.S. as an ally that can be counted on.

""I think we probably rocked them,"" said McChrystal, who commanded U.S. and NATO forces in Afghanistan for about a year.

474,daily mail online,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-6564037/AP-FACT-CHECK-Trump-claims-innocence-probe-wall-myths.html,"WASHINGTON (AP) - Feeling the pressure of investigations and a partial government shutdown, President Donald Trump is playing loose with the facts regarding hush payments made by his former attorney Michael Cohen to two women and is changing his story on his promise to build a concrete border wall paid for by Mexico.

In comments over the weekend, Trump said he did not commit any campaign violation and suggests anything improper would be minor compared with infractions of Democrats such as former President Barack Obama. The reality is not so cut and dried. Federal prosecutors in New York have implicated Trump in a crime, linking him to the hush-money scheme. The Obama campaign's infractions were civil, not criminal.

On the border wall, Trump insists he never promised a concrete barrier - even though he did - and asserts that much of it has been built. It hasn't.

The dubious statements capped an expansive week of assertions by the president. On top of the usual Twitter flow, Trump opened a Cabinet meeting with 90 minutes of opining to the press, touching on immigration, drug prices, the Soviet history in Afghanistan, his approval ratings, Syria, oil prices, the attractiveness of his generals (""better looking than Tom Cruise""), and much more. A few days later he spoke for an hour at a Rose Garden news conference.

A sampling of his claims:

TRUMP INVESTIGATIONS

TRUMP: ""Many people currently a part of my opposition, including President Obama & the Dems, have had campaign violations, in some cases for very large sums of money. These are civil cases. They paid a fine & settled. While no big deal, I did not commit a campaign violation!"" - tweet Saturday.

THE FACTS: Trump has been tied to - but not charged with - a crime. At issue is not a routine campaign violation.

Prosecutors' court filings last month said Trump directed Cohen to make payments to buy the silence of porn actress Stormy Daniels and former Playboy model Karen McDougal during the 2016 presidential campaign. Both women alleged they had extramarital affairs with Trump, which the White House denies.

Cohen, who pleaded guilty in August to campaign finance crimes in connection with those payments, had previously implicated Trump. Now the Justice Department is backing up Cohen's claims.

In particular, the Justice Department says the hush money payments were unreported campaign contributions meant to influence the outcome of the election. That assertion makes the payments subject to campaign finance laws, which restrict how much people can donate to a campaign and bar corporations from making direct contributions.

It's unclear whether Trump will actually be charged with illegal activity, because Justice Department legal memos from 1973 and 2000 have suggested that a sitting president is immune from indictment. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., told NBC this past week that Trump isn't necessarily immune, calling an indictment of a sitting president ""an open discussion in terms of the law.""

There's a big difference between Obama's campaign violation and Cohen's case.

A Federal Election Commission audit found that the 2008 Obama campaign failed to file 48-hour contribution reports in a timely manner for more than 1,200 donations totaling $1.9 million. The commission also found the campaign was late refunding some contributions that exceeded legal limits, and discovered some other reporting errors regarding contribution dates.

The commission fined the Obama campaign $375,000 for the violations. The campaign was not found to have willfully violated the law, making it a civil infraction.

In Cohen's case, he admitted he knew he was breaking the law by making the payments. Cohen told ABC last month that ""of course"" Trump knew it was wrong to make the hush-money payments, though he did not provide any specific evidence in the interview. Unlike the Obama case, where the issue was timely reporting, the hush money payments were never disclosed at all on Trump's campaign filings.

Andrew Herman, a lawyer specializing in campaign finance at law firm Miller & Chevalier, said the two cases are ""completely different species.""

""One is a paperwork error,"" he said. ""And the other is a conscious attempt to obscure payments made to affect an election.""

THE WALL

TRUMP: ""As far as concrete, I said I was going to build a wall. I never said, 'I'm going to build a concrete.' I said I'm going to build a wall."" - Rose Garden news conference Friday.

THE FACTS: Actually, he did say he would build a concrete wall. Trump even repeated that promise last week, rejecting the claim of his departing White House chief of staff John Kelly that Trump had abandoned the notion of ""a solid concrete wall early on in the administration.""

""An all concrete Wall was NEVER ABANDONED,"" Trump tweeted on Dec. 31. ""Some areas will be all concrete but the experts at Border Patrol prefer a Wall that is see through.""

During the 2016 campaign, Trump pledged to build a ""big, beautiful wall"" made of concrete, rebar and steel across the length of the southern border with Mexico. Back then, he lashed out at the suggestion that what he was proposing had anything in common with mere fencing.

""Jeb Bush just talked about my border proposal to build a 'fence,' he tweeted in 2015. ""It's not a fence, Jeb, it's a WALL, and there's a BIG difference!""

He now often refers to the wall as ""steel slats.""

""Steel is stronger than concrete,"" he said Friday. ""If I build a steel wall rather than a concrete wall, it will actually be stronger than a concrete"" wall.

TRUMP: ""When they say 'build the wall,' I don't say that any more. I say 'finish the wall.'"" - remarks to reporters Sunday.

TRUMP: ""We've already built a lot of the wall."" - Rose Garden news conference Friday.

THE FACTS: He hasn't built much of the wall at all.

Trump's claim is only supported when counting work done under past presidents and ignoring the fact that fences from prior administrations are not the towering walls he promised. The 2006 Secure Fence Act has resulted in about 650 miles (1,050 kilometers) of border barrier. Money approved by Congress in March 2018 is to pay for 84 miles (135 km), but that work is not done. Trump has achieved some renovation of existing barrier.

TRUMP: ""The drugs are pouring into this country. They don't go through the ports of entry. When they do, they sometimes get caught."" - Rose Garden news conference.

THE FACTS: He's wrong in saying drug smugglers don't or only rarely use official border crossings for their trafficking. Land ports of entry are their primary means for getting drugs into the country, not stretches of the border without barriers, says the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration.

The agency said in a November report that the most common trafficking technique by transnational criminal organizations is to hide drugs in passenger vehicles or tractor-trailers as they drive into the U.S. though entry ports, where they are stopped and subject to inspection. They also employ buses, cargo trains and tunnels, the report says, citing smuggling methods that would not be choked off by a border wall.

TRUMP: ""The new trade deal we have with Mexico and Canada - what we save on that, just with Mexico, will pay for the wall many times over, just in a period of a year, two years or three years. So I view that as absolutely Mexico is paying for the wall."" - Rose Garden news conference.

THE FACTS: Mexico is not paying for the wall and nothing in the trade agreement would cover or refund the construction cost.

Trump is assuming a wide variety of economic benefits will come from the agreement, but they can't be quantified or counted on. For example, he said the deal will dissuade some U.S. companies from moving operations to Mexico and he credits that possibility as a payment by Mexico for his wall.

The deal updates the North American Free Trade Agreement, in the main preserving NAFTA's liberalized environment of low or no tariffs among the U.S., Mexico and Canada, while making certain improvements for each country. Trump stated inaccurately that it's ""brand new. It's totally different.""

Moreover, it's not in effect. The deal has yet to be ratified in any member country and its chances of winning legislative approval are not assured.

Trump has argued repeatedly that Mexico is footing the bill even while insisting on $5.6 billion from the U.S. treasury to go toward wall construction. His demand and the refusal of Democrats to satisfy it are behind the budget standoff that has closed parts of the government.

SYRIA

TRUMP: ""We are pulling back in Syria. We're going to be removing our troops. I never said we're doing it that quickly."" - remarks to reporters Sunday.

TRUMP: ""We're bringing the troops back home over a period of time. I never said so quickly, but over a period of time."" - Cabinet meeting Wednesday.

THE FACTS: He's wrong about his past statements regarding the pace of withdrawal. In a video posted to his Twitter account on Dec. 19, for instance, Trump said of the roughly 2,000 troops in Syria: ""They're all coming back, and they're coming back now.""

TRUMP: ""I read, when we pull out, 'Oh, Russia is thrilled.' Russia is not happy. You know why they're not happy? Because they like it when we're killing ISIS, because we're killing them for them, and we're killing them for Assad, and we're killing ISIS also for Iran."" - Cabinet meeting.

THE FACTS: Russia says it's happy. A U.S. withdrawal opens opportunities for Moscow and Tehran to increase their influence and may help the Syrian government survive as a Kurdish-led opposition force loses its military ally on the ground.

Russian President Vladimir Putin says the U.S. ""has done the right thing"" in planning to pull out.

AFGHANISTAN

TRUMP: ""The reason Russia was in Afghanistan was because terrorists were going into Russia. They (the Soviets) were right to be there."" - Cabinet meeting.

THE FACTS: His assertion that the Soviet Union was experiencing a terrorist influx from Afghanistan when it invaded in 1979 is out of step with history. And his belief that the Soviets were right to invade is a stark departure from U.S. and world opinion.

The Soviets were trying to bolster communists in Afghanistan and possibly expand their influence against the United States and the West.

World condemnation was swift: The U.N. General Assembly voted 104-18 to deplore the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan. The U.S. supported the anti-communist rebels, giving them shoulder-fired rockets to down Soviet aircraft. The Soviets withdrew in 1989.

TRUMP: ""Russia used to be the Soviet Union. Afghanistan made it Russia, because they went bankrupt fighting in Afghanistan."" - Cabinet meeting.

THE FACTS: Afghanistan was far from the sole reason for the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991. The dissolution occurred in a time of ethnic and political troubles, economic woes and a series of revolutions that led Soviet republics to seek their independence. The Soviet demise was accelerated by the heavy cost of competing with the West to wield influence around the world, including in Afghanistan.

OIL PRICES

TRUMP: ""Do you think it's just luck that gas prices are so low, and falling? Low gas prices are like another Tax Cut!"" - tweet Tuesday.

TRUMP: ""It's not luck. It's not luck. I called up certain people, and I said, 'Let that damn oil and gasoline - you let it flow - the oil.' It was going up to $125. If that would've happened, then you would've had a recession, depression."" - Cabinet meeting Wednesday.

THE FACTS: It's not all about him, or even mostly about him.

While Americans may end up paying somewhat less for gasoline this year, Trump's suggestion that he deserves all the credit and averted a U.S. economic depression is an exaggeration. Oil prices, which peaked Oct. 3, have been generally falling on the realization that U.S. sanctions against Iran would not create a shortage and on fear that a global oversupply of oil will spill into 2019 if slower international economic growth depresses energy demand.

The president's supposed ""let it flow"" edict did not stop OPEC and its Russia-led allies from agreeing last month to cut oil production. That initially failed to stop oil prices from sliding further; they have since rebounded a few dollars in the past week. Continued OPEC production cuts would push prices higher.

Trump has pointed to his positive relations with Saudi Arabia, which remains the biggest oil exporter. As a so-called swing producer with the ability to adjust production up or down relatively quickly, it can indeed influence the price of crude. But the market is complex: Canada, for example, is actually the top source of U.S. oil imports, with Saudi Arabia second.

TARIFFS

TRUMP: ""The United States Treasury has taken in MANY billions of dollars from the Tariffs we are charging China and other countries that have not treated us fairly. In the meantime we are doing well in various Trade Negotiations currently going on."" - tweet Thursday.

THE FACTS: Trump is off on two major issues. First, tariffs are taxes paid largely by U.S. business and consumers, not foreign countries. And while Trump's ""MANY billions"" might sound like a lot, it's doing little to nothing to improve the federal balance sheet. The U.S. government spent $4.1 trillion last fiscal year and the budget deficit shot up, according to Trump's own Treasury Department.

Customs and duties generated $41.3 billion in revenues last year, up from $34.6 billion in 2017.

That $6.7 billion increase occurred in part because of the president's tariffs. But it amounted to just 0.16 percent of federal spending.

MATTIS

TRUMP, on Jim Mattis: ""I wish him well. I hope he does well. But, as you know, President (Barack) Obama fired him and essentially so did I. I want results."" - Cabinet meeting Wednesday.

THE FACTS: Actually, Mattis resigned as defense secretary in protest over Trump's decision to pull U.S. troops from Syria.

The retired Marine general announced on Dec. 20 in a resignation letter that he was stepping down after Trump's decision to withdraw 2,000 U.S. troops from Syria. Mattis said he would stay on the job until the end of February. Three days later, Trump said he was replacing Mattis with the second-ranking defense official, Pat Shanahan, on Jan. 1.

As to the tenure under Obama, Mattis served as commander of the military's Central Command. He departed a few months earlier than expected in 2013, in part because of disagreements over Iran.

DRUG PRICES

TRUMP: ""I think you're going to see a tremendous reduction in drug prices."" - Cabinet meeting Wednesday.

THE FACTS: Prices continue to rise. Administration policies announced last year and currently being completed don't seem to have shifted that trend.

Figures on U.S. prescription drug price changes compiled by health data company Elsevier show that from Dec. 20 through Jan. 2, there were 1,179 product price changes. Of those, 30 were price cuts and the remaining 1,149 were price increases, with 328 of them between 9 percent and 10 percent. All but one of the rest were by lower percentages. Elsevier spokesman Chris Capot said more companies will be announcing price increases this month.

Separately, a data firm whose software can help patients find the most cost-effective medications says its information shows price increases on many commonly used drugs for conditions such as high blood pressure and diabetes.

""In the first two days of January, prices have increased on more than 250 different products,"" said Michael Rea, CEO of Rx Savings Solutions. The average increase is about 6 percent, he added.

IMMIGRATION

TRUMP, on the number of immigrants living in the U.S. illegally: ""I used to hear 11 million all the time. It would always stay right at 11. I said, 'Does it ever increase or go down?' 'No, it's 11.' Nobody knows. It's probably 30, 35 million people. They would flow in, mostly from the southern border, they'd come in and nobody would talk about it, nobody would do anything about it."" - Cabinet meeting Wednesday.

THE FACTS: It's nowhere close to 30 million to 35 million, according to his own Homeland Security secretary as well as independent estimates.

The nonpartisan Pew Research Center estimates there were 10.7 million immigrants in the U.S. illegally in 2016, the most recent data available. Advocacy groups on both sides of the immigration issue have similar estimates.

At a House hearing last month, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen acknowledged the number was ""somewhere"" between 11 million and 22 million, significantly lower than Trump's claim of 35 million.

According to Pew, the number of immigrants in the U.S. illegally had reached a height of 12.2 million in 2007, representing about 4 percent of the U.S. population, before declining in part because of a weakening U.S. economy.

TRUMP: ""The coyotes are using children to gain access into this country. They're using these children. They're not with families. They're using the children. They're taking the children. And then they dispose of the children after they're done. This has been going on for years. This isn't unique to us. But we want to stop it."" - Cabinet meeting Wednesday.

THE FACTS: This does happen, though it's not as common as Trump suggests by talking about it so often.

He is referring to adults who come with children they falsely claim to be theirs, so that they won't be detained under a no-child-separation policy.

But such cases of fraud are rare. According to the Homeland Security Department, about 500 immigrants were found to be not a ""legitimate family unit"" and thus separated upon detention from April 19 to Sept. 30 of last year. That's a small fraction of the 107,000 families apprehended in the last budget year, which ended Sept. 30.

475,daily mail online,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6533911/Trump-ties-border-wall-demand-manhunt-illegal-immigrant-cop-killer.html,"By David Martosko, U.s. Political Editor For Dailymail.com and George Martin For Mailonline

President Donald Trump on Thursday seized on the case of an illegal immigrant cop-killer to renew his argument that the U.S. should erect a wall on its southern border.

'There is right now a full scale manhunt going on in California for an illegal immigrant accused of shooting and killing a police officer during a traffic stop,' Trump tweeted.

'Time to get tough on Border Security. Build the Wall!'

Police corporal Ronil Singh, 33, was making a traffic stop in the town of Newman early in the morning when he called 'shots fired' over his radio, according to the Stanislaus County Sheriff's Department.

Singh had pulled over a gray pickup truck in the small town 100 miles south of San Francisco, after noticing it had no license plate. Sheriff Adam Christianson said the stop was part of a DUI investigation.

Signh fired back to defend himself, Christianson said.

Trump also quoted a 2011 tweet from former President Barack Obama, who was repeating a line from his State of the Union address when he wrote: 'I strongly believe that we should take on, once and for all, the issue of illegal immigration.'

'I totally agree!' Trump added Thursday, before tying Singh's murder to the hot-button issue.

Christianson has flown in Trump's orbit before. He sat next to the president during a May 16 event at the White House focused on opposition to 'sanctuary city' policies that prohibit law enforcement agencies from cooperating with federal immigration authorities.

'There shouldn't be anybody interfering with a sheriff's ability, a chief's ability, or anybody in this room at this table today from defending people against those who exploit and victimize them,' he said then.

'There should be no interference in our ability to protect our communities, to protect our national security.'

Authorities in California's central valley have found the truck believed to belong to the unnamed suspect who remains at large.

The vehicle, believed to have been the one stopped by Singh, was found in a garage in a mobile home park about 4 miles away from the scene of the shooting.

The silver extended-cab Dodge Ram 1500 pickup truck was seen in the area at the time of the shooting, and had paper plates on the vehicle, which read 'AR Auto.'

Working from several tips from the public, police discovered it about 13 hours after the shooting at a River Road mobile home park just south of Azevedo Road, where law enforcement officers were serving a search warrant.

Police confirmed the pickup was the one believed to have been driven by the suspect.

Crime scene tape was seen inside the mobile home park, where several media outlets from surrounding counties converged late Wednesday afternoon.

'There's lots of potential evidence,' a police spokesperson said. 'Fingerprints, DNA, gunshot residue and physical evidence. We'll be processing the truck to get any evidence to help in the prosecution.'

The unidentified suspect, who was pictured on security camera footage entering a store shortly before the fatal shots were fired, remains a fugutive.

Singh was found with multiple bullet wounds, and was taken to a local hospital where he was pronounced dead.

The sheriff's office released surveillance stills of the suspect and the gray pickup truck found near the location of the shooting.

The suspected gunman appears in the images in an unzipped hooded sweatshirt and wearing a gold chain while purchasing items in a store.

Ronil Singh is survived by his wife, Anamika, and a 5-month-old son, authorities said

Ronil Singh of Newman Police Department was killed by an unidentified suspect early on Wednesday morning

Singh was a native of Fiji and the father of an infant son. He joined the Newman police force in 2011.

Earlier in his career, Singh worked as a deputy with the Merced County Sheriff's Department.

'He was living the American dream,' said Stanislaus County Sheriff's Deputy Royjinder Singh, who is not related to the slain officer but knew him.

'He loved camping, loved hunting, loved fishing, loved his family,' the deputy said.

On his Facebook page, Singh posted Christmas Eve pictures from a deep-sea fishing trip that produced a big haul of crabs and fish. The profile picture shows him smiling as he stands at a patrol car with a dog - the same photograph of the officer released by the Sheriff's Department.

The slain officer lived in Modesto. He's survived by his wife, Anamika, their 5-month-old son, his parents and a brother.

Outgoing California Gov. Jerry Brown offered condolences to Singh's family and said flags at the state Capitol would fly at half staff in his honor.

'Our hearts are with the entire community of Newman and law enforcement officers across the state who risk their lives every day to protect and serve the people of California,' Brown said."

""For any normal president, travel to Mar-a-Lago would be completely out of the question,"" said Norm Eisen, who was a White House ethics lawyer under President Barack Obama and is now chairman of the watchdog group Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. ""But then, any normal president would not be operating a for-profit resort to benefit himself, selling memberships at that resort to those with special interests before his White House and then squeezing extra money out of those people for a New Year's Eve party."""
477,daily mail online,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6536197/EPA-proposes-easing-regulation-mercury-coal-plants.html,"'This is like when your four-year-old kid tries to clean up your kitchen - it actually makes things worse. Please stop helping,' said a utility industry lobbyist

The Trump administration on Friday said limits on mercury emissions from coal-fired power plants were unnecessary as they were too costly, sparking an outcry from environmentalists who feared the next step would be looser rules favoring the coal industry at the expense of public health.

Under the Mercury and Air Toxic Standards, or MATS, enacted under former president Barack Obama, coal-burning power plants were required to install expensive equipment to cut output of mercury, which can harm pregnant women and put infants and children at risk of developmental problems.

The 2011 Obama administration rule led to what electric utilities say was an $18 billion clean-up of mercury and other toxins from the smokestacks of coal-fired power plants.

Overall, environmental groups say, federal and state efforts have cut mercury emissions from coal-fired power plants by 85 percent in roughly the last decade.

Mercury causes brain damage, learning disabilities and other birth defects in children, among other harm. Coal power plants in this country are the largest single manmade source of mercury pollutants, which enters the food chain through fish and other items that people consume.

Ripping up the rules: An Obama-era curb on mercury emissions's justification will be withdrawn under plans from the Trump-era Environmental Protection Administration

The Environmental Protection Agency Friday left the 2011 emission standards in place but proposed using a different cost analysis to evaluate whether the regulation is needed, a move that paves the way for looser rules going forward. Its statement was issued on Friday during a partial government shutdown.

Since August, the Environmental Protection Agency has been reconsidering the justification for the rule.

A coalition of electric utilities had said the looser rules were not needed since they have already invested billions of dollars in technology to cut emissions of the pollutant and comply.

EPA said it was 'proposing that it is not 'appropriate and necessary' to regulate HAP (Hazardous Air Pollution) emissions from coal- and oil-fired power plants... because the costs of such regulation grossly outweigh the quantified HAP benefits.'

It said its reassessment showed the cost of compliance with MATS was between $7.4 billion to $9.6 billion annually, while the monetized benefits were between $4 million to $6 million.

It also said the identification of unquantified benefits was not enough to support the standards. Among such benefits, environmentalists say are reduced healthcare costs, breathing cleaner air and drinking cleaner water.

'The policy (Acting EPA Administrator) Andrew Wheeler and (President) Donald Trump proposed today means more pregnant women, young children, and the elderly will be exposed to deadly neurotoxins and poisons, just so wealthy coal and oil barons can make a few extra bucks,' Sierra Club Beyond Coal Campaign Director Mary Anne Hitt said in a statement. Wheeler is a former coal industry lobbyist.

'Virtually every coal plant in the U.S. has already met this lifesaving standard, and now Trump is recklessly trying to roll it back,' she said.

A study published this month by Harvard University's School of Public Health said coal-fired power plants are the top source of mercury in the United States, accounting for nearly half of mercury emissions in 2015. It said the standards have markedly reduced mercury in the environment and improved public health.

Since taking office in January 2017, Trump has targeted rolling back Obama-era environmental and climate protections to maximize production of domestic fossil fuels, including crude oil. U.S. oil production is the highest in the world, above Saudi Arabia and Russia, after a boom that was triggered more than a decade ago by improved drilling technology.

The coal industry had challenged a 2016 conclusion by Obama's EPA that the rule was justified because savings to U.S. consumers on healthcare costs would exceed compliance costs. The calculations accounted for how pollution-control equipment would reduce emissions of other harmful substances in addition to mercury.

Trump's industry allies, including Robert Murray, CEO of private coal mining giant Murray Energy Corp, had complained that the MATS rule contributed to the demise of the coal business by triggering hundreds of coal-fired power plant shutdowns and driving coal demand to its lowest in decades.

U.S. coal-fired power generation has fallen more than 40 percent since a peak in 2007, while natural gas-fired generation soared by about the same amount, according to the Energy Information Administration.

Utilities' demand for U.S. coal is projected to fall further this year, by around 2.5 percent to 648.2 million short tons, the lowest in 35 years, according to the EIA.

In July, electric utilities and utility groups favoring the rule asked the administration to keep it in place. They noted that billions of dollars in investments for anti-pollution equipment have already been made, and costs are being recovered from electricity customers through regulated pricing.

'This is like when your four-year-old kid tries to clean up your kitchen - it actually makes things worse. Please stop helping,' said a utility industry lobbyist based in Washington, who asked not to be named. 'The rule itself forced coal plant shutdowns, but they aren't coming back.'

On their way out: The Dave Johnson coal-fired power plant in Glenrock, Wyoming is one of the survivors of a collapse in use of the fuel for electricity generation. Utilities say coal is not coming back but the mining industry has pushed for the rule change planned by Trump's EPA

However, it challenges the basis for the Obama regulation, calculating that the crackdown on mercury and other toxins from coal plants produced only a few million dollars a year in measurable health benefits and was not 'appropriate and necessary' - a legal benchmark under the country's landmark Clean Air Act.

The proposal, which now goes up for public comment, is the latest Trump administration move that changes estimates of the costs and payoffs of regulations in arguing for relaxing Obama-era environmental protections.

It's also the administration's latest proposed move on behalf of the U.S. coal industry, which has been struggling in the face of competition from natural gas and other cheaper, cleaner forms of energy.

The Trump administration in August proposed an overhaul for another Obama-era regulation that would have prodded electricity providers to get less of their energy from dirtier-burning coal plants.

In a statement, the EPA said Friday the administration was 'providing regulatory certainty' by more accurately estimating the costs and benefits of the Obama administration crackdown on mercury and other toxic emissions from smokestacks.

Hal Quinn, head of the National Mining Association, charged in a statement Friday that the Obama administration had carried out 'perhaps the largest regulatory accounting fraud perpetrated on American consumers' when it calculated that the broad health benefits to Americans would outweigh the cost of equipment upgrades by power providers.

Sen. Tom Carper of Delaware, the top Democrat on the Senate's Environment and Public Works Committee, condemned the Trump administration's move.

The EPA has 'decided to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory' after the successful clean-up of toxins from the country's coal-plant smokestacks, Carper said.

He and other opponents of the move said the Trump administration was playing with numbers, ignoring what Carper said were clear health, environmental and economic benefits to come up with a bottom line that suited the administration's deregulatory aims.

Janet McCabe, a former air-quality official in the Obama administration's EPA, called the proposal part of 'the quiet dismantling of the regulatory framework' for the federal government's environmental protections.

Coming one week into a government shutdown, and in the lull between Christmas and New Year, 'this low-key announcement shouldn't fool anyone - it is a big deal, with significant implications,' McCabe said.

EPA said it will take comment for the proposal for 60 days and will hold at least one public hearing."
478,daily mail online,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6536497/Barack-Obama-reveals-favorite-songs-movies-books-year.html,"Continuing his annual tradition that started during his two terms in the White House, Barack Obama on Friday revealed the songs, movies and books that he liked the most in 2018.

Not surprisingly, former first lady Michelle Obama's best-selling memoir, 'Becoming', topped the list of her husband's favorite books, with the ex-president writing sweetly in parentheses 'obviously my favorite!'

Obama, 57, explained in a Facebook post that putting together the lists 'gives me a moment to pause and reflect on the year through the books, movies, and music that I found most thought-provoking, inspiring, or just plain loved.'

His favorite things: Former President Barack Obama on Friday released his annual end-of-the-year lists of his favorite books, movies and songs

Beyonce and Jay-Z's hit song Apesh*t earned the top honor (left), and Cardi B's I Like It got an honorable mention

It has been Obama's custom to release best-of lists every years since taking office

He continued: 'It also gives me a chance to highlight talented authors, artists, and storytellers - some who are household names and others who you may not have heard of before.'

In the music category, Beyonce and Jay-Z's hit song Apesh*t from the album Everything Is Love earned top honors, followed by Bad Bad News, by soul singer Leon Bridges, and King for a Day, by R&B star Anderson East.

Cardi B's chart-topping single I Like It also made it onto Obama's eclectic list, coming in at No 9.

Obama's list of favorite movies was very eclectic, including horror, dark comedy and documentary

The scary science fiction flick Annihilation (left) and the superhero blockbuster Black Panther went one-two on the list for 2018

In the movies category, the science fiction horror film Annihilation, starring Natalie Portman, Jennifer Jason Leigh and Gina Rodriguez, was Obama's No. 1 choice, with the superhero blockbuster Black Panther coming in at No 2 and and Spike Lee's latest offering, BlacKkKlansman, rounding out the top three.

Other honorable mentions included the documentary Minding the Gap about skateboarding, the Netflix film Roma from Academy Award winner Alfonso Cuaron about a year in the life of a Mexican maid in the 1970s, and the the very dark comedy The Death of Stalin, from the creator of HBO's Veep Armando Iannucci.

Not surprisingly, former first lady Michelle Obama's best-selling memoir, 'Becoming,' topped the list of her husband's favorite books

'Becoming' has been at the top of the New York Times' prestigious bestsellers list for the past six weeks. Obama also singled out the fiction novel An American Marriage by Tayari Jones

For the famously well-read former constitutional scholar, 2018 evidently offered an embarrassment of riches when it came to books, given that Obama managed to pick more than two dozen favorites in both fiction and non-fiction categories.

Besides his wife's autobiography, which has been at the top of the New York Times' prestigious bestsellers list for the past six weeks, Obama also singled out the fiction novels An American Marriage, by celebrated author Tayari Jones, and Americanah, by the award-winning Nigerian writer Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie."
479,daily mail online,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-6560373/AP-FACT-CHECK-Trumps-super-talkative-fact-busting-week.html,"WASHINGTON (AP) - President Donald Trump held forth on all manner of things this past week as he emerged from a ""lonely"" spell over the holidays. He opined for more than 90 minutes to the press, at the top of a Cabinet meeting, on the shutdown, immigration, drug prices, the Soviet history in Afghanistan, his approval ratings, Syria, oil prices, the nature of walls, the attractiveness of his generals (""better looking than Tom Cruise""), and much more.

He capped the week with a Rose Garden news conference that stretched for an hour. And he's been tweeting a lot.

Trump's accounts did not show tremendous fealty to the facts. Here's a sampling of what he said:

THE WALL

TRUMP: ""We've already built a lot of the wall."" - Rose Garden news conference Friday.

THE FACTS: He hasn't.

In this Jan. 2, 2019, photo, acting Secretary of the Interior David Bernhardt, left, and acting Secretary of Defense Patrick Shanahan, right, listen as President Donald Trump speaks during a cabinet meeting at the White House in Washington. (AP Photo/Evan Vucci)

Trump's claim is only supported when counting work done under past presidents and ignoring the fact that fences from prior administrations are not the towering walls he promised. The 2006 Secure Fence Act has resulted in about 650 miles (1,050 kilometers) of border barrier. Money approved by Congress in March 2018 is to pay for 84 miles (135 km), but that work is not done. Trump has achieved some renovation of existing barrier.

TRUMP: ""The drugs are pouring into this country. They don't go through the ports of entry. When they do, they sometimes get caught."" - Rose Garden news conference.

THE FACTS: He's wrong in saying drug smugglers don't or only rarely use official border crossings for their trafficking. Land ports of entry are their primary means for getting drugs into the country, not stretches of the border without barriers, says the U.S. Drug Enforcement Administration.

The agency said in a November report that the most common trafficking technique by transnational criminal organizations is to hide drugs in passenger vehicles or tractor-trailers as they drive into the U.S. though entry ports, where they are stopped and subject to inspection. They also employ buses, cargo trains and tunnels, the report says, citing smuggling methods that would not be choked off by a border wall.

TRUMP: ""The new trade deal we have with Mexico and Canada - what we save on that, just with Mexico, will pay for the wall many times over, just in a period of a year, two years or three years. So I view that as absolutely Mexico is paying for the wall."" - Rose Garden news conference.

THE FACTS: Mexico is not paying for the wall and nothing in the trade agreement would cover or refund the construction cost.

Trump is assuming a wide variety of economic benefits will come from the agreement, but they can't be quantified or counted on. For example, he said the deal will dissuade some U.S. companies from moving operations to Mexico and he credits that possibility as a payment by Mexico for his wall.

The deal updates the North American Free Trade Agreement, in the main preserving NAFTA's liberalized environment of low or no tariffs among the U.S., Mexico and Canada, while making certain improvements for each country. Trump stated inaccurately that it's ""brand new. It's totally different.""

Moreover, it's not in effect. The deal has yet to be ratified in any member country and its chances of winning legislative approval are not assured.

Trump has argued repeatedly that Mexico is footing the bill even while insisting on $5.6 billion from the U.S. treasury to go toward wall construction. His demand and the refusal of Democrats to satisfy it are behind the budget standoff that has closed parts of the government.

SYRIA

TRUMP: ""We had a fantastic meeting with the generals and the Syria situation. I mean, I'm the only person in the history of our country that could really decimate ISIS, say we're bringing the troops back home over a period of time. I never said so quickly, but over a period of time."" - Cabinet meeting Wednesday.

THE FACTS: He's wrong about his past statements regarding the pace of withdrawal. In a video posted to his Twitter account on Dec. 19, for instance, Trump said of the roughly 2,000 troops in Syria: ""They're all coming back, and they're coming back now.""

TRUMP: ""I read, when we pull out, 'Oh, Russia is thrilled.' Russia is not happy. You know why they're not happy? Because they like it when we're killing ISIS, because we're killing them for them, and we're killing them for Assad, and we're killing ISIS also for Iran."" - Cabinet meeting.

THE FACTS: Russia says it's happy. A U.S. withdrawal opens opportunities for Moscow and Tehran to increase their influence and may help the Syrian government survive as a Kurdish-led opposition force loses its military ally on the ground.

Russian President Vladimir Putin says the U.S. ""has done the right thing"" in planning to pull out.

AFGHANISTAN

TRUMP: ""The reason Russia was in Afghanistan was because terrorists were going into Russia. They (the Soviets) were right to be there."" - Cabinet meeting.

THE FACTS: His assertion that the Soviet Union was experiencing a terrorist influx from Afghanistan when it invaded in 1979 is out of step with history. And his belief that the Soviets were right to invade is a stark departure from U.S. and world opinion.

The Soviets were trying to bolster communists in Afghanistan and possibly expand their influence against the United States and the West.

World condemnation was swift: The U.N. General Assembly voted 104-18 to deplore the Soviet intervention in Afghanistan. The U.S. supported the anti-communist rebels, giving them shoulder-fired rockets to down Soviet aircraft. The Soviets withdrew in 1989.

TRUMP: ""Russia used to be the Soviet Union. Afghanistan made it Russia, because they went bankrupt fighting in Afghanistan."" - Cabinet meeting.

THE FACTS: Afghanistan was far from the sole reason for the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991. The dissolution occurred in a time of ethnic and political troubles, economic woes and a series of revolutions that led Soviet republics to seek their independence. The Soviet demise was accelerated by the heavy cost of competing with the West to wield influence around the world, including in Afghanistan.

OIL PRICES

TRUMP: ""Do you think it's just luck that gas prices are so low, and falling? Low gas prices are like another Tax Cut!"" - tweet Tuesday.

TRUMP: ""It's not luck. It's not luck. I called up certain people, and I said, 'Let that damn oil and gasoline - you let it flow - the oil.' It was going up to $125. If that would've happened, then you would've had a recession, depression."" - Cabinet meeting Wednesday.

THE FACTS: It's not all about him, or even mostly about him.

While Americans may end up paying somewhat less for gasoline this year, Trump's suggestion that he deserves all the credit and averted a U.S. economic depression is an exaggeration. Oil prices, which peaked Oct. 3, have been generally falling on the realization that U.S. sanctions against Iran would not create a shortage and on fear that a global oversupply of oil will spill into 2019 if slower international economic growth depresses energy demand.

The president's supposed ""let it flow"" edict did not stop OPEC and its Russia-led allies from agreeing last month to cut oil production. That initially failed to stop oil prices from sliding further; they have since rebounded a few dollars in the past week. Continued OPEC production cuts would push prices higher.

Trump has pointed to his positive relations with Saudi Arabia, which remains the biggest oil exporter. As a so-called swing producer with the ability to adjust production up or down relatively quickly, it can indeed influence the price of crude. But the market is complex: Canada, for example, is actually the top source of U.S. oil imports, with Saudi Arabia second.

TARIFFS

TRUMP: ""The United States Treasury has taken in MANY billions of dollars from the Tariffs we are charging China and other countries that have not treated us fairly. In the meantime we are doing well in various Trade Negotiations currently going on."" - tweet Thursday.

THE FACTS: Trump is off on two major issues. First, tariffs are taxes paid largely by U.S. business and consumers, not foreign countries. And while Trump's ""MANY billions"" might sound like a lot, it's doing little to nothing to improve the federal balance sheet. The U.S. government spent $4.1 trillion last fiscal year and the budget deficit shot up, according to Trump's own Treasury Department.

Customs and duties generated $41.3 billion in revenues last year, up from $34.6 billion in 2017.

That $6.7 billion increase occurred in part because of the president's tariffs. But it amounted to just 0.16 percent of federal spending.

MATTIS

TRUMP, on Jim Mattis: ""I wish him well. I hope he does well. But, as you know, President (Barack) Obama fired him and essentially so did I. I want results."" - Cabinet meeting Wednesday.

THE FACTS: Actually, Mattis resigned as defense secretary in protest over Trump's decision to pull U.S. troops from Syria.

The retired Marine general announced on Dec. 20 in a resignation letter that he was stepping down after Trump's decision to withdraw 2,000 U.S. troops from Syria. Mattis said he would stay on the job until the end of February. Three days later, Trump said he was replacing Mattis with the second-ranking defense official, Pat Shanahan, on Jan. 1.

As to the tenure under Obama, Mattis served as commander of the military's Central Command. He departed a few months earlier than expected in 2013, in part because of disagreements over Iran.

DRUG PRICES

TRUMP: ""I think you're going to see a tremendous reduction in drug prices."" - Cabinet meeting Wednesday.

THE FACTS: Prices continue to rise. Administration policies announced last year and currently being completed don't seem to have shifted that trend.

Figures on U.S. prescription drug price changes compiled by health data company Elsevier show that from Dec. 20 through Jan. 2, there were 1,179 product price changes. Of those, 30 were price cuts and the remaining 1,149 were price increases, with 328 of them between 9 percent and 10 percent. All but one of the rest were by lower percentages. Elsevier spokesman Chris Capot said more companies will be announcing price increases this month.

Separately, a data firm whose software can help patients find the most cost-effective medications says its information shows price increases on many commonly used drugs for conditions such as high blood pressure and diabetes.

""In the first two days of January, prices have increased on more than 250 different products,"" said Michael Rea, CEO of Rx Savings Solutions. The average increase is about 6 percent, he added.

IMMIGRATION

TRUMP, on the number of immigrants living in the U.S. illegally: ""I used to hear 11 million all the time. It would always stay right at 11. I said, 'Does it ever increase or go down?' 'No, it's 11.' Nobody knows. It's probably 30, 35 million people. They would flow in, mostly from the southern border, they'd come in and nobody would talk about it, nobody would do anything about it."" - Cabinet meeting Wednesday.

THE FACTS: It's nowhere close to 30 million to 35 million, according to his own Homeland Security secretary as well as independent estimates.

The nonpartisan Pew Research Center estimates there were 10.7 million immigrants in the U.S. illegally in 2016, the most recent data available. Advocacy groups on both sides of the immigration issue have similar estimates.

At a House hearing last month, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen acknowledged the number was ""somewhere"" between 11 million and 22 million, significantly lower than Trump's claim of 35 million.

According to Pew, the number of immigrants in the U.S. illegally had reached a height of 12.2 million in 2007, representing about 4 percent of the U.S. population, before declining in part because of a weakening U.S. economy.

TRUMP: ""The coyotes are using children to gain access into this country. They're using these children. They're not with families. They're using the children. They're taking the children. And then they dispose of the children after they're done. This has been going on for years. This isn't unique to us. But we want to stop it."" - Cabinet meeting Wednesday.

THE FACTS: This does happen, though it's not as common as Trump suggests by talking about it so often.

He is referring to adults who come with children they falsely claim to be theirs, so that they won't be detained under a no-child-separation policy.

But such cases of fraud are rare. According to the Homeland Security Department, about 500 immigrants were found to be not a ""legitimate family unit"" and thus separated upon detention from April 19 to Sept. 30 of last year. That's a small fraction of the 107,000 families apprehended in the last budget year, which ended Sept. 30.

Obama didn't mention Ryan's name, but in Ryan's mind, the president might as well have addressed the speech to him.

Everybody could see Ryan, just sitting there in the front row of an auditorium at George Washington University. One of his colleagues leaned over and asked if they should leave. No, Ryan said. They should stay; they were being watched. He had noticed a photographer with a camera mounted on a unipod, its long lens pointed straight at him. He sat rigidly in his chair.

It had all been a setup.

To Ryan, Obama's breach of decorum in April 2011 -- in which he lightly criticized Ryan's budget while calling for entitlement reform himself -- was Exhibit A in the case against Obama. According to Ryan, it meant Obama was unwilling to work across party lines to solve policy problems. It was an affront to fiscal responsibility and the Beltway Norms. A stunning contrast between the two men -- one a partisan politician and the other a serious policy wonk.

""His false attacks were offensive, even by the low standards for discourse and civility in Washington, D.C.,"" Ryan recalled in his 2014 book, in which he devoted eight pages to the incident.

The story has been retold in at least three books, with Ryan denouncing Obama's ""demagoguery"" each time.

In retrospect, of course, in light of the current president's constant depredations -- against civility, against the discourse, even against Ryan himself -- Obama's speech was the political equivalent of using the wrong fork at a dinner party. The idea that the speech amounted to some great offense, by the standard Ryan has set not even six years later, is patently absurd.

Whereas Obama didn't even mention Ryan by name in the infamous speech, President Donald Trump has repeatedly insulted Ryan directly, calling the House speaker ""weak and ineffective"" and a ""Boy Scout"" and saying he ""knows nothing,"" though Trump has more recently said he has come to appreciate Ryan ""like a fine wine.""

(Reminder: Trump doesn't drink.)

While Ryan made a habit of bashing Obama -- his reaction to Obama's last State of the Union address was to say Obama ""degrades the presidency"" because Obama warned against then-candidate Trump's divisive rhetoric -- he has famously stood by Trump, greeting the president's near-daily embarrassments with cheery unawareness. Even when Ryan couldn't avoid Trump's scandals, he continued to praise Trump as ""thoughtful,"" ""refreshing"" and ""exquisite.""

It's all part of the fiction that Ryan chooses to live in -- a fiction in which Trump is restoring honor to the presidency and his behavior is to be downplayed, dismissed or outright ignored. And it's that blithe fiction, contrasted with our graphic, Trump-y reality, for which Ryan should be remembered.

When Ryan leaves office in January, he will not have balanced the budget or fixed Congress or solved poverty or left our politics smarter or less divided. Instead, during his three-year tenure as speaker, the deficit has nearly doubled. The procedural problems in Congress are more daunting. Poverty isn't much different. And our politics are more partisan, less ideological, than maybe ever before.

The version of Paul Ryan that he and his staff tried to project for years -- the image of a squeaky-clean numbers guy, rolling up his sleeves, solving tough policy problems -- is a sham. According to a number of polls, many people now recognize him as a monumental partisan, a politician who won a reputation as a wonk because he was able to memorize a few lines from an actuarial table and then promptly ignore his own pledges to balance the budget when he had the chance. Ryan is the man who, perhaps more than anybody else, normalized Trump, who led reluctant Republicans back to Trump, who went along with the president even when he knew he shouldn't and traded his dignity for a tax cut.

This week, Ryan and his office released a six-part video series on his decades-long quest to reform the tax code. But he didn't reform our tax code. When all the new guidance is issued, the 40,000-page tax code is likely to be even longer. He simply cut taxes -- or, at least, he didn't stand in the way.

It turned out that cutting taxes by $1.5 trillion wasn't all that hard, as long as ""conservatives"" were on board with not paying for tax cuts. The grand irony of ""tax reform"" is that, for all the credit Ryan and his staff try to give him for the bill, the final legislation was closer to the principles that Freedom Caucus leaders like Reps. Mark Meadows (R-N.C.) and Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) laid out: a corporate rate at 20 percent, a bigger standard deduction and cuts that weren't paid for.

Ryan wanted a bill that was at least mostly revenue-neutral (it ended up costing more than a trillion dollars over 10 years), that would allow individuals to fill out their tax returns on a postcard (that didn't happen) and that had a corporate rate closer to 25 percent (it ended up at 21 percent).

He almost blew up the tax bill by insisting on a border adjustment tax to offset some of the cuts. It wasn't until he gave up on the BAT -- a tarifflike tax that would have increased prices on imports and also, theoretically, increased the value of the dollar -- that tax reform became a reality.

And it was the Senate that played the biggest role in shaping the tax bill, with Sens. Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) and Pat Toomey (R-Pa.) deciding how much debt was acceptable to rack up. In conference, when differences between the two chambers' versions are resolved, legislators took the Senate version on a number of important provisions -- pass-through income, international regulations, the child tax credit -- and ditched a bunch of politically perilous, revenue-raising ideas from the House, like ending deductions on medical expenses and student loans.

Ryan's signature achievement of tax reform is neither actually his nor actually an achievement. Yes, the economy is doing well. But there was low unemployment and economic growth before the tax cuts. A year after it was enacted, the bill remains unpopular. The stock market has basically run sideways since the GOP's tax bill was enacted -- the S&P 500 is down on the year -- and wages for workers have barely grown.

The tax cuts were supposed to spur investment and put more money in everyone's pocket. Instead, they prompted a small round of one-time bonuses, a huge number of stock buybacks and deficits that will persist for decades.

And yet, in true Ryan form, he seeks out another round of feting, when most politicians would have the self-awareness to quietly exit out the back.

It's possible that he will hand over the speaker's gavel to Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) during a partial government shutdown, because he and other Republicans refuse to level with Trump and tell him he's not getting his border wall. A short-term funding bill, looking more likely by the hour, would be more of the same avoidance. It would be stage one in the grieving process.

But denial has been one of Ryan's favorite strategies with Trump. Ryan has been satisfied to try to influence government and the president at the periphery. When Ryan became aware recently that there were more than 10,000 unused work visas, he pushed through legislation making sure Irish nationals would have access to those visas.

When Trump said he might try to end birthright citizenship, Ryan suggested such a move would have to come from Congress, which prompted Trump to say that Ryan ""knows nothing"" about the issue and should be focused on holding the GOP majority -- something Ryan wasn't able to do. The speaker oversaw the largest Republican losses in 44 years.

Ryan never responded to Trump's diss. The direct insults from Trump never seemed to rankle Ryan the same way Obama's indirect slights appeared to bother him.

A simple truth of Ryan's career is that he spent every day fighting to help people who didn't need help. It was always about cutting taxes, and as big of a game as he talked on the debt, when he had the chance to do something about entitlements or spending, he cowered from the challenge.

As part of his farewell tour, he said in November that his two biggest regrets were failing to tackle immigration reform and not addressing the growing national debt. He also theorized that history would be kind to his speakership and the GOP Congress he ruled over, partly because of the tax cuts that passed under his watch.

But there's no evidence that the tax cuts are getting more popular or becoming more effective, and there's no indication that Republicans are getting more serious about debt.

To take the issue of debt seriously for a moment -- something Republicans (and Democrats) don't do -- we've incurred enough debt at this point that the interest payments on our $21 trillion hole will ensure that we never see a balanced budget again without massive spending cuts and tax increases.

For Ryan, this might not be much of a contradiction. Cutting taxes is core to the Republican mission, while the debt is a political tool used to bash Democrats and to justify welfare cuts. The media and the public just fell for the GOP ruse.

""History will not be kind to a president who, when it came time to confront our generation's defining challenge, chose to duck and run,"" Ryan said of Obama after the president once again criticized the House GOP budget in 2012.

But when it was his party controlling Congress and the White House, during a time of economic prosperity, when Washington has traditionally looked to realign the federal budget, Ryan didn't shrink the deficit; he nearly doubled it, through a combination of spending increases and tax cuts. Legislation enacted since Trump took office will add $2.7 trillion to the national debt. The tax cuts and spending bills enacted in fiscal 2018 alone will widen 2019's deficit by $445 billion, according to the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget. And the yearly deficit, which was $585 billion in fiscal 2016 -- the year Ryan took the speakership -- will be roughly $1 trillion when he leaves office.

When Ryan announced his retirement from Congress in April, he cheered the spending increases for the military that Republicans locked into spending agreements. Those Pentagon plus-ups, paired with domestic spending increases to appease Democrats, have ballooned the deficit.

In 2011, conservatives in Congress refused to go along with increases to spending or the debt ceiling without a plan to restrain the deficit. What they came up with was the Budget Control Act, which set caps for defense and nondefense spending for the next 10 years. Except lawmakers have refused to live by those caps. Congress has honored the spending limits exactly zero times. The Pentagon particularly seems unwilling to abide by the limits. And Republicans like Ryan cheer on the military budget increases, even as the Pentagon has never completed an audit.

Ryan entered the speakership by saying he wanted to pass a new Authorization for Use of Military Force. We've justified more than three dozen military operations in more than a dozen countries using the overly broad authorization from 2001.

""It would be a good sign for American foreign policy to have a new one updating our AUMF,"" Ryan said in December 2015.

But he spent the next three years blocking a new AUMF, saying he wouldn't allow debate on any bill that would restrict the ability of the military to fight.

Just last week, Ryan attached special instructions to a rule for the farm bill that would waive provisions in the War Powers Resolution so he could block debate on a resolution about U.S. support for a war in Yemen -- a war that has created what the United Nations called ""the worst man-made humanitarian crisis of our time."" An estimated 85,000 Yemeni children have died from starvation associated with the war, and an additional 17 million Yemenis are at risk of malnutrition.

Ryan's efforts to block debate on war are entirely consistent with his actions as speaker but totally inconsistent with his message as he took the gavel. He said he wanted to return to regular order, that he wanted to allow debate on bills and amendments on the House floor.

Instead, there was one open rule during the entirety of his speakership, meaning there was only one bill to which members could offer any amendment they wanted, as long as it pertained to the bill and wasn't written on the fly. He oversaw what may go down as the most closed Congress of all time. And rather than address immigration or entitlement reform or war or guns or children being separated from their parents at the border or a bill protecting Robert Mueller's investigation, Ryan was satisfied to use the House to pass uncontroversial bills renaming post offices or selling federal land to pump up the number of bills the House passed and Trump signed.

The Republican calls to read the bill -- calls that helped propel them to the majority in 2010 -- have been replaced with Ryan ramming through a 2,232-page bill funding the government 17 hours after leaders released the text. Amazingly, on the same day the House passed that bill, he said he had done ""a phenomenal job"" restoring regular order.

On Wednesday, Ryan took to the Great Hall in the Library of Congress for yet another goodbye speech. It was almost exactly three years since Ryan delivered a speech in that room at the beginning of his speakership. But what was supposed to be a farewell was really more of the same calls he made in the past for reform -- on debt, on immigration and on poverty.

As Vox recently remarked in a headline, ""Paul Ryan really wishes the House speaker would fix immigration and the debt."" Ryan is the speaker who didn't seem to realize that he had the power to do things, that he could do more than cut taxes and that achieving results would take more than grandiose speeches echoing hollowly through the Great Hall in the Library of Congress.

One particular issue that Ryan simply seemed to give up on was poverty.

After the 2012 presidential election, when he was mocked for a soup kitchen photo op in which he seemed to be washing pots and pans that were already clean, Ryan launched himself into what he called a ""poverty tour."" He traveled the country visiting nonprofit organizations that sought to rehabilitate poor people with criminal histories or drug problems.

He came up with a bunch of proposals that were basically a rebranding of welfare cuts, and he built his case for cutting assistance to the poor on a false claim: that the War on Poverty had failed.

That is all consistent with the Ryan we've all come to know. But one of the reasons he was able to con so many people for so long was that he wasn't incapable of coming up with an interesting idea from time to time. He had elements of self-reflection and regret, like when he said in early 2016 that it was wrong of him to have used the frame ""makers and takers.""

In 2014, instead of simply claiming that government programs that help poor people actually make them worse off -- and that therefore antipoverty spending should be cut -- Ryan did something different. He said the government should hire case managers who could work with poor people to create a ""customized life plan to provide a structured roadmap out of poverty.""

Case management was the centerpiece of his proposal to reform the federal government's antipoverty programs into an ""opportunity grant."" The proposal and the poverty tour figured prominently in his 2014 book, ""The Way Forward,"" which is the type of book politicians write when they're thinking about running for president. He portrayed poverty policy as a consistent area of concern during his career, ever since his days working as an aide to Jack Kemp, a former congressman who called himself a ""bleeding-heart conservative.""

But commentators from both sides thought the idea of a ""customized life plan"" was weird. And so Ryan backed away. ""We're saying this is one of the things we recommend, but give the states the ability to try other ideas,"" he told HuffPost in 2014.

After he became speaker and Trump became president, Ryan had a chance to make his poverty agenda a reality. Instead, he used his time and political capital trying to take health care from millions of poor people -- remember, the House GOP health care plan included $834 billion in cuts to Medicaid -- and then passing a tax cut. He gave up on poverty.

He said Wednesday that solving poverty will require ""a great rethinking of how we help the most vulnerable among us."" And without a shred of self-awareness or irony, he urged his Republican colleagues to not ""let this issue drift from your consciousness.""

The sincerity with which Paul Ryan believed in the myth of Paul Ryan was perhaps why it was so effective. During his speech Wednesday, he decried how outrage had become a ""brand,"" how we all needed to disregard ""the noise.""

But what Ryan deems noise and what he thinks warrants outrage have a distinctly partisan slant. When Trump tweeted that he was considering revoking the security clearances of his political enemies, Ryan said Trump was ""just trolling."" When Trump attacks fellow Republicans or when he lies outright or suggests breaking into the Democratic National Committee, that's just to be ignored.

""All this stuff you see on a daily basis on Twitter this and Twitter that -- forget about it,"" Ryan said in October 2017.

Except that was not how Ryan treated Obama. Ryan said Obama was the nation's worst president. Ryan relentlessly attacked Obama and took horrible offense during the 2011 speech in which Obama agreed that the nation needed to tackle entitlements.

In Bob Woodward's telling, ""Ryan felt betrayed. He'd expected an olive branch. What he got was the finger.""

What was the appalling criticism that Obama had made?

One of the most egregious insults was that Obama noted Ryan's budget would transfer Medicare to a voucher system. ""And if that voucher isn't worth enough to buy the insurance that's available in the open marketplace, well, tough luck -- you're on your own,"" Obama said.

And how did the Congressional Budget Office describe Ryan's budget? ""Under the proposal, most elderly people who would be entitled to premium support payments would pay more for their health care than they would pay under the current Medicare system.""

Obama wasn't wrong, though he would later tell Woodward he thought he made a mistake by embarrassing Ryan. Obama had accurately described what Ryan's proposal would do. Ryan was just upset that the reality of his budget didn't measure up to his inflated self-image, of a man whose ideas transcend politics, of a should-be president delivering speeches at a prestigious university or in the marbled Great Hall of the Library of Congress."
481,daily mail online,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-6525575/After-criticism-Trump-pushes-Mattis-sooner-planned.html,"WASHINGTON (AP) - Irritated with the criticism and fallout from Defense Secretary Jim Mattis' resignation, President Donald Trump on Sunday pushed the Pentagon chief out the door two months earlier than planned, an acrimonious end to a tense relationship that had been eroding in recent months.

In a series of tweets, Trump appeared to question why he had put Mattis in his Cabinet in the first place and said Deputy Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan will take over as acting secretary on Jan. 1 to cover the accelerated departure.

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, not the president, notified Mattis of the decision, said a senior administration official who insisted on anonymity to discuss personnel issues.

The sudden change strips Mattis of any chance to further frame national security policy or smooth rattled relations with allies through the originally planned transition at the end of February. And it reflects White House displeasure with the retired Marine Corps general's blistering resignation letter, which he delivered to Trump on Thursday.

Mattis resigned in protest over Trump's decision to pull all U.S. troops out of Syria. U.S. officials, however, said that the reaction to his decision to leave - including the shock and dismay expressed on Capitol Hill - annoyed Trump and likely led to Mattis leaving earlier than planned.

""When President Obama ingloriously fired Jim Mattis, I gave him a second chance. Some thought I shouldn't, I thought I should,"" Trump tweeted Saturday, foreshadowing his displeasure and the Sunday announcement. He also fumed over the media coverage of his Syria withdrawal order, suggesting he should be popular for bringing troops home.

""With me, hit hard instead by the Fake News Media. Crazy!"" Trump tweeted.

A White House official said Trump decided Mattis should leave the administration earlier than planned to avoid a drawn-out transition when someone on hand whom they consider a qualified deputy capable of running the Pentagon in an acting capacity. The official asked not to be identified publicly discussing personnel matters.

Lt. Col. Joseph Buccino, a spokesman for Shanahan, said the former Boeing Co. executive will accept the appointment as acting secretary.

""Deputy Secretary will continue to serve as directed by the president, and the Department of Defense will remain focused on the defense of the nation,"" Buccino said on Sunday.

It is unusual for the Pentagon to have an acting secretary of defense. Historically when a secretary has resigned, he has stayed on until a successor is confirmed. For example, when Chuck Hagel was told to resign in November 2014, he stayed in office until Ash Carter was confirmed the following February.

While Mattis' resignation followed Trump's announcement that he would soon pull all of the approximately 2,000 U.S. troops out of Syria, officials said that the decision was the result of an accumulation of disagreements.

In a stunning resignation letter, Mattis made clear he did not see eye to eye with a president who has expressed disdain for NATO and doubts about keeping troops in Asia. Mattis was also unhappy with Trump's order to develop plans to pull out up to half of the 14,000 U.S. forces in Afghanistan.

Earlier Sunday, Trump's acting chief of staff said that Trump had known for ""quite some time now"" that he and Mattis ""did not share some of the same philosophies ... have the same world view.""

Mick Mulvaney told ABC's ""This Week"" that the president and his defense chief ""just could never get on the same page"" on Syria, adding that Trump had said since his presidential campaign that ""he wanted to get out of Syria."" Mulvaney said the president ""is entitled to have a secretary of defense who is committed to that same end.""

Asked whether Trump wanted a Pentagon leader willing to challenge him or someone in lock step with his views, Mulvaney said ""a little bit of both.""

""I've encouraged him to find people who have some overlap with him but don't see the world in lockstep with him,"" Mulvaney said.

The Pentagon on Sunday would only say that Mattis serves at the pleasure of the president.

Other officials said it wasn't clear whether Mattis had spoken directly to Trump about the accelerated departure. Mattis had been at work on Friday, and defense officials had insisted he was planning to stay through February, when he would attend a NATO defense ministers meeting.

Meanwhile, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., joined leading Republicans on foreign affairs in urging Trump to reconsider his decision to withdraw American forces from Syria.

""We believe that such action at this time is a premature and costly mistake that not only threatens the safety and security of the United States but also emboldens"" the Islamic State group, President Bashar Assad's government, Iran and Russia, according to the letter, signed by McConnell and eight other senators, including Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., who organized it.

They asked Trump to ""not make any final decision for 90 days to allow time to adequately study the impacts of this decision on our partners, our allies and the re-emergence of ISIS and other terror groups, to ensure our nation's strategic interests are secured.""

But Mulvaney, asked on ABC whether there was any chance the president might change his mind on Syria decision, said: ""No. I think the president has told people from the very beginning that he doesn't want us to stay in Syria forever. You're seeing the end result now of two years' worth of work. But keep in mind it's not unusual for a president to lose members of the Cabinet over these types of disagreements.""

Just after tweeting the announcement about Shanahan, Trump said he had had ""a long and productive call"" with Turkey's president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan. Trump said they discussed IS, ""our mutual involvement in Syria, & the slow & highly coordinated pullout of U.S. troops from the area. After many years they are coming home.""

Shanahan, a longtime Boeing Co. executive, was nominated for the deputy job in early 2017.

He moved up through the management ranks at Boeing over a career that began in 1986. The Puget Sound Business Journal called him a Boeing ""fix-it"" man in a March 2016 report. He oversaw the company's global supply chain strategies and use of advanced manufacturing technologies. Shanahan was central to getting the 787 Dreamliner on track after production problems in the program's early years, the report said.

Associated Press writers Robert Burns and Darlene Superville contributed to this report.

482,daily mail online,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-6533439/US-fossil-fuel-exports-spur-growth-climate-worries.html,"GEOJEDO, South Korea (AP) - In South Korea's largest shipyard, thousands of workers in yellow hard hats move ceaselessly between towering cranes lifting hulks of steel. They look like a hive of bees scurrying over a massive circuit board as they weld together the latest additions to the rapidly growing fleet of tankers carrying super-chilled liquefied natural gas across the world's oceans.

The boom in fossil-fuel production in the United States has been matched by a rush on the other side of the Pacific to build the infrastructure needed to respond to the seemingly unquenchable thirst for energy among Asia's top economies. When Congress lifted restrictions on shipping crude oil overseas in 2015, soon after the Obama administration opened the doors for international sales of natural gas, even the most boosterish of Texas oil men wouldn't have predicted the U.S. could become one of the world's biggest fossil-fuel exporters so quickly.

Climate experts say there is little doubt increased American production and exports are contributing to the recent rise in planet-warming carbon emissions by helping keep crude prices low, increasing consumption in developing economies.

Backers of U.S. exports of liquefied natural gas, or LNG, argue that the boom will produce environmental benefits because it will help China and other industrial nations wean themselves from coal and other dirtier fossil fuels.

Environmentalists counter that the massive new supplies unleashed by American advances in extracting natural gas from shale doesn't just make coal-fired power plants less competitive. LNG also competes with such zero-carbon sources of electricity as nuclear, solar and wind - potentially delaying the full adoption of greener sources. That's time climate scientists and researchers say the world doesn't have if humans hope to mitigate the worst-case consequences of our carbon emissions, including catastrophic sea-level rise, stronger storms and more wildfires.

""Typically, infrastructure has multi-decadal lifespans,"" said Katharine Hayhoe, a climate scientist and director of the Climate Science Center at Texas Tech University. ""So, if we build a natural-gas plant today, that will impact carbon emissions over decades to come. So those are the critical and crucial decisions that are being made today. Do we increase access to and use of fossil fuels, or do we make decisions that limit and eventually reduce access to fossil fuels?""

More than half of the 35 vessels scheduled for delivery in 2018 were LNG carriers. A similar number of vessels are lined up for completion in 2019. (AP Photo/Ahn Young-joon)

This story is part of a collaboration between The Associated Press and the Center for Public Integrity, The Texas Tribune and Newsy.

While it is difficult to estimate how much America's rise as major exporter of fossil fuels is contributing to a hotter climate, some of the economic benefits are plain to see in South Korea's shipyards.

At the sprawling Daewoo Shipbuilding and Marine Engineering facility on the island of Geoje, more than half of the 35 vessels scheduled for delivery in 2018 were LNG carriers. A similar number of vessels are lined up for completion next year.

It's the same story at the two other major Korean yards. The construction of the big gas tankers has been credited with lifting the nation's shipbuilding sector out of the doldrums from a decade ago, when the Great Recession caused a downturn in transoceanic trade.

South Korea's big three shipbuilders - Daewoo, Hyundai Heavy Industries and Samsung Heavy Industries - won orders for 53 new LNG carriers in 2018 at about $200 million each, soaking up the lion's share of the 62 vessels ordered globally, according to numbers compiled by the London-based shipping group Clarkson Research. South Korea is expected to finish 2018 at the top spot in overall orders for new commercial ships, surpassing China for the first time in seven years.

""We are getting out of a long tunnel,"" Song Ha-dong, a senior Daewoo executive, said as he surveyed the company's 1,200-acre yard from above the British Contributor, a gargantuan LNG carrier with a freshly painted deck covered in a maze of pipes. ""The U.S.-led shale gas boom is getting fully under way and China, Japan and South Korea are increasing their consumption of natural gas.""

During a recent visit by The Associated Press, three of the LNG carriers were being assembled inside a massive dry dock. Another 13, including the British Contributor, had been floated out to nearby berths where workers were putting on finishing touches.

The Korean shipyards have developed a niche in building ships with the complex systems needed to transport natural gas. The gas is compressed and liquefied for storage by keeping it really cold, about -260 Fahrenheit. In this liquid state, natural gas is about 600 times smaller than at room temperature.

The British Contributor is as long as three football fields and can carry enough liquefied gas to fill about 70 Olympic-sized swimming pools - nearly two days' national supply for South Korea. The country used about 1.9 trillion cubic feet of LNG in 2017, finishing third behind China and Japan as the world's biggest importers, according to data from the U.S. Energy Information Administration.

With no domestic oil and gas resources and an unfriendly neighbor blocking overland shipments from the north, South Korea relies exclusively on oceangoing tankers. Nearly half of South Korea's gas imports come from Qatar and Australia, but the share shipped from the U.S. is growing fast as additional export terminals along the Gulf coast are coming online to handle the glut of gas unleashed by hydraulic fracturing in the Permian Basin of West Texas and southeastern New Mexico.

U.S. LNG exports quadrupled in 2017, with this year on track to see similarly exponential growth. Nearly a fifth of all that gas goes to South Korea.

The British Contributor is the third of six LNG carriers being built by Daewoo for British energy giant BP, which will mainly use them to transport U.S. gas to Asia under a 20-year contract with the Freeport LNG facility south of Houston. Daewoo delivered four similar ships this year to the government-owned Korea Gas Corporation, which has a 20-year deal to buy gas exported from Cheniere Energy's Sabine Pass LNG terminal in Louisiana.

South Korea has been vying with Mexico for the title of the largest importer of U.S. LNG, and its reliance on gas could further increase under the government of President Moon Jae-in, who has pledged to transition his country away from nuclear power following the Fukushima meltdown in Japan.

Park Moo-hyun, a senior analyst at Hana Financial Investment, predicts shipping companies will need to place orders for around 480 new LNG carriers over the next decade to match the U.S.-driven increase in global LNG trade - roughly doubling the current worldwide fleet.

""The impact brought by the emergence of shale is not just about an increase in U.S. energy exports - there has been tremendous growth in the production of energy sources that hadn't been used much, such as LNG,"" Park said. ""Once the groundwork is established for the stable use of these new energy sources, industries are pushed to adapt.""

Natural gas has the added appeal of producing about half the carbon dioxide when it's burned than coal. Its increased adoption for generating electricity has been pitched by the U.S. and others as a way for nations to make progress toward meeting their emissions reductions goals under the 2015 Paris climate accord. Burning gas also creates less particulate pollution.

In China, the Communist government has declared a ""Blue Sky Defense War"" to reduce the choking smog in Beijing and two dozen surrounding cities with a program to convert hundreds of thousands of homes and industrial facilities from burning coal to gas. In February, Texas-based Cheniere signed a 25-year deal with the state-controlled China National Petroleum Corporation to export LNG from its export terminal in Corpus Christi.

But the increased gas exports from the U.S. and other sources hasn't really put much of dent in Chinese coal consumption, which has remained largely flat in 2018. Overall carbon emissions for China, the globe's biggest emitter, saw a nearly five percent increase in 2018.

Daniel Raimi, a researcher at the Washington-based think tank Resources for the Future, said determining whether U.S. gas exports are a net good or bad for the climate is difficult. When considering China, researchers can't just look at whether coal use or carbon emissions are falling. They must also try to calculate how much more coal would have been burned had ample supplies of gas not been available.

Another challenge is that the primary component of natural gas is methane, a potent greenhouse gas that traps far more heat in the atmosphere than a comparable amount of carbon dioxide. Studies have shown that a significant amount of natural gas leaks into the air at almost every stage of its production and transport - from wells to pipelines, processing facilities to ships. Raimi said the impact of all that leaking methane on the climate is roughly 84 times more powerful than the same amount of carbon dioxide over a 20-year time frame.

As part of its broad rollback of environmental rules, the Trump administration moved in September to weaken Obama-era regulations designed to prevent methane from escaping into the atmosphere during oil and gas operations. The regulatory rollbacks are part of President Donald Trump's pro-industry ""Energy Dominance"" strategy to ramp up U.S. fossil-fuel production without concern for the corresponding increase in greenhouse-gas emissions. Trump has falsely claimed climate change is a ""hoax,"" and moved in 2017 to pull the United States out of the 2015 Paris accord.

""With or without increased U.S. oil and gas exports, ambitious policy measures are the essential ingredient to achieving long-term climate goals such as those laid out in the 2015 Paris agreement,"" Raimi said. ""For U.S. LNG exports to reduce global emissions, they must primarily displace coal, and methane emissions must be limited both domestically and abroad.""

483,daily mail online,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6529529/Mattis-shows-Trump-video-message-troops-Christmas-four-days-resigning.html,"Defense Secretary James Mattis sent a dignified videotaped holiday message to American forces overseas - a stark contrast from President Donald Trump's angry Christmas greeting in which he lashed out at his enemies.

The video shows Mattis in front of a wall of flags as he speaks in praise of U.S. troops during a special Christmas address.

'Since Washington crossed the Delaware at Christmas in 1776, American troops have missed holidays at home to defend our experiment in democracy,' he says.

'To all you lads and lasses holding the line in 2018 on land, at sea or in the air, thanks for keeping the faith.

Defense Secretary James Mattis sent a videotaped holiday message to American forces overseas that was recorded a day before he resigned

'Merry Christmas and may God hold you safe.'

The day after the short clip was filmed, Mattis submitted his letter of resignation to Trump.

The abrupt resignation was in protest of Trump's decision to order a troop withdrawal from Syria.

On Christmas Eve, the Department of Defense tweeted out a holiday letter from Mattis.

'We in the U.S. military are privileged to defend America, especially at this time of year, for we ensure our fellow Americans celebrate this season of hope in peace and security,' the former General wrote.

'We know our freedoms are not guaranteed by themselves; they need defenders.

'This month, many in our military will be serving far from their loved ones.

'It is difficult work, but this is nothing new: Since Washington crossed the Delaware on Christmas Day in 1776, American troops have missed holidays to defend our citizens' experiment in democracy.

On Christmas Eve, the Department of Defense tweeted out a holiday letter from Mattis

'To those in the field or at sea, ""keeping watch at night"" this holiday season, you should recognize that you carry on the proud legacy of those who stood the watch in decades past.

'In this world awash in change, you hold the line.

'Storm clouds loom, yet because of you your fellow citizens live safe at home.

'Most don't know your names but all are confident their freedoms and their families will be kept safe.

'Far from home, you have earned the gratitude and respect of your fellow citizens and it remains my great privilege to serve alongside you.

'Merry Christmas and may god hold you safe.'

It was reported by CNN's Barbara Starr that Mattis spent Christmas Day at his third floor office in the Pentagon working.

Mattis' message to the soldiers this holiday season sounds statesmanlike compared to that of his soon-to-be-former boss, Trump.

The President took to Twitter on Christmas and wished 'everyone' a happy holiday, including the 'Fake News Media.'

Earlier on Tuesday, Trump used his annual address to members of the armed forces to attack members of Congress and a former FBI director while defending his border wall and denying claims he colluded with Russia during the election.

During a photo op for that call, Trump defended shutting down the government over funding for his border wall and slam former FBI director James Comey.

He ended his remarks by declaring: 'It's a disgrace what's happening in our country, but other than that, I wish everybody a very merry Christmas.'

Mattis' resignation letter initially indicated that he would serve until late February.

But Trump decided to push him out immediately after the New Year when commentators observed that the resignation letter contained implicit criticism of the President.

The day after the short clip was filmed, Mattis submitted his letter of resignation to President Donald Trump (seen above at the White House on Monday). The abrupt resignation was in protest of Trump's decision to order a troop withdrawal from Syria

Deputy Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan will be named as acting secretary.

'I am pleased to announce that our very talented Deputy Secretary of Defense, Patrick Shanahan, will assume the title of Acting Secretary of Defense starting January 1, 2019. Patrick has a long list of accomplishments while serving as Deputy, & previously Boeing. He will be great!,' Trump tweeted on Sunday afternoon.

Mattis named late February as his exit in his resignation letter, calling it 'a date that should allow sufficient time for a successor to be nominated and confirmed as well as to make sure the Department's interests are properly articulated and protected at upcoming events.'

His letter also noted his views were not aligned with the president's.

This will be the third acting Cabinet member in Trump's administration: Matthew Whitaker is acting attorney general; David Bernhardt will take over as acting Secretary of Interior with Ryan Zinke exit at end of the year; and now Shanahan at Pentagon.

Mick Mulvaney has been named acting chief of staff, which the Trump White House classifies as Cabinet level position.

Pentagon spokesman Col. Rob Manning said in a statement Sunday that 'the secretary of defense serves at the pleasure of the President. The department remains focused on national security.'

Mulvaney said on Sunday - before Mattis' early departure was announced - that the relationship between Trump and Mattis had been 'fraying.'

'Look, let's be honest with each other. I think the relationship between these two men have been fraying. I think the president no longer relied on Mattis to be able to deliver the president's vision,' he said on 'Fox News Sunday.'

He noted on ABC's 'This Week' that the two men 'didn't have the same world view. You heard the president say a couple weeks ago, I think, in an interview that he recognized that Mr. Mattis - he called him a Democrat.'

He added: 'So no, I don't think it was a surprise.'

Earlier Saturday, Special Presidential Envoy for the Global Coalition to Counter ISIS Brett McGurk announced his resignation in the wake of Trump's decision to pull troops out of Syria and just days after Mattis's announced departure.

McGurk was to leave the role in February but moved up his departure date by two months to December 31 after very publicly stating that the move to pull American forces at this time could result in a 'possibly catastrophic outcome'.

Deputy Secretary of Defense Patrick M. Shanahan will serve as acting Pentagon chief starting January 1

Responding to the news , Trump tweeted: 'Brett McGurk, who I do not know, was appointed by President Obama in 2015.

'Was supposed to leave in February but he just resigned prior to leaving. Grandstander? The Fake News is making such a big deal about this nothing event!.

'If anybody but your favorite President, Donald J. Trump, announced that, after decimating ISIS in Syria, we were going to bring our troops back home (happy & healthy), that person would be the most popular hero in America. With me, hit hard instead by the Fake News Media. Crazy!

The veteran diplomat, who got his start in the administration of George W. Bush and was appointed to his current post by Barack Obama, now joins Mattis in an administration exodus of experienced national security officials.

Secretary of Defense James Mattis's letter of resignation

December 20, 2018

Dear Mr. President:

I have been privileged to serve as our country's 26th Secretary of Defense which has allowed me to serve alongside our men and women of the Department in defense of our citizens and our ideals.

I am proud of the progress that has been made over the past two years on some of the key goals articulated in our National Defense Strategy: putting the Department on a more sound budgetary footing, improving readiness and lethality in our forces, and reforming the Department's business practices for greater performance. Our troops continue to provide the capabilities needed to prevail in con?ict and sustain strong U.S. global influence.

One core belief I have always held is that our strength as a nation is inextricably linked to the strength of our unique and comprehensive system of alliances and partnerships. While the US remains the indispensable nation in the free world, we cannot protect our interests or serve that role effectively without maintaining strong alliances and showing respect to those allies. Like you, I have said from the beginning that the armed forces of the United States should not be the policeman of the world. Instead, we must use all tools of American power to provide for the common defense, including providing effective leadership to our alliances. NATO's 29 democracies demonstrated that strength in their commitment to fighting alongside us following the 9-11 attack on America. The Defeat-ISIS coalition of 74 nations is further proof.

Similarly, I believe we must be resolute and unambiguous in our approach to those countries whose strategic interests are increasingly in tension with ours. It is clear that China and Russia, for example, want to shape a world consistent with their authoritarian model gaining veto authority over other nations? economic, diplomatic, and security decisions to promote their own interests at the expense of their neighbors, America and our allies. That is why we must use all the tools of American power to provide for the common defense.

My views on treating allies with respect and also being clear-eyed about both malign actors and strategic competitors are strongly held and informed by over four decades of immersion in these issues. We must do everything possible to advance an international order that is most conducive to our security, prosperity and values, and we are strengthened in this effort by the solidarity of our alliances.

Because you have the right to have a Secretary of Defense whose views are better aligned with yours on these and other subjects, I believe it is right for me to step down from my position. The end date for my tenure is February 28, 2019, a date that should allow sufficient time for a successor to be nominated and confimed as well as to make sure the Department's interests are properly articulated and protected at upcoming events to include Congressional posture hearings and the NATO Defense Ministerial meeting in February. Further, that a full transition to a new Secretary of Defense occurs well in advance of the transition of Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff in September in order to ensure stability Within the Department.

I pledge my full effort to a smooth transition that ensures the needs and interests of the 2.15 million Service Members and 732,079 civilians receive undistracted attention of the Department at all times so that they can fulfill their critical, round-the-clock mission to protect the American people.

I very much appreciate this opportunity to serve the nation and our men and women in uniform.

James N. Mattis"
484,the huffington post,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/mick-mulvaney-chuck-schumer-donald-trump-border-wall_us_5c32879ee4b0d75a9831ecf8,"""My guess is that this boils down to some semantic difficulties with Schumer,"" the acting White House chief of staff says of Trump's claim he can't substantiate.

Acting White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney was unable Sunday to come up with the name of a single former president among those who told Donald Trump they support the border wall -- as the president has claimed they have.

Mulvaney blamed Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) for the apparent lie.

Trump said in comments outside the White House Friday: ""This [wall] should have been done by all of the presidents that preceded me and they all know it. Some of them have told me that we should have done it.""

Among living former presidents, Barack Obama has bashed the wall (and hasn't spoken to Trump since the inauguration except for a brief exchange) and Jimmy Carter has been critical of Trump's position on immigrants. In addition, representatives for George W. Bush and Bill Clinton have said the ex-presidents have never discussed the wall with Trump.

Asked by Jake Tapper on ""State of the Union"" Sunday to identify which presidents Trump was talking about, Mulvaney admitted, ""I can't name any.""

""My guess is that this boils down to some of the semantic difficulties with leader [Sen. Chuck] Schumer,"" Mulvaney said before suddenly veering into an unrelated discussion of wall construction. (See the video above.)

""You don't know what president it was then?"" Tapper pressed again.

""I have no idea,"" Mulvaney said. ""I have not asked the president that question.""

Trump doubled down on the issue Sunday in a tweet indicating that ""Barrack"" Obama backed the wall. Trump quoted Obama as saying that ""we cannot allow people into the United States undocumented"" -- which says nothing about a border wall.

Mulvaney was also challenged about Trump's bizarre claim from last week that the Soviet Union (from which Russia emerged) invaded Afghanistan in 1979 in response to terrorist attacks on the communist state (and that the people of Afghanistan were happy about it). Mulvaney again was unable to support the president's statement.

""I think those are comments the president made born out of frustration from where we are and I'm not too concerned about the details,"" Mulvaney responded.

That led ProPublica reporter Peter Elkind to quip on Twitter that it's a good thing an official who doesn't sweat the details is no longer the head of the Office of Management and Budget. The joke is that Mulvaney is still the head of the OMB, a post he will continue to hold while he is also acting chief of staff.

The Wall Street Journal in an editorial that first appeared Friday blasted Trump's tale about the Russian invasion of Afghanistan as the most ""absurd misstatement of history by an American president"" in memory and bashed his claim that the invasion was justified as ""absurd"" and ""reprehensible.""

Despite the grilling he got in the Tapper interview, Mulvaney chirped that being the acting chief of staff is ""actually a lot of fun."""
485,the huffington post,https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/lindsey-graham-donald-trump-syria_us_5c1b465de4b0407e9077270e,"Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) made a rare move against Donald Trump on Wednesday when he called the president out over the decision to begin the withdrawal of American troops from Syria.

Trump revealed on Twitter that the U.S. had ""defeated"" the self-described Islamic State terror network in the country, which was his ""only reason for"" troops ""being there"" during his presidency.

Graham, who only last week said he didn't see an issue with Trump lying about sex, countered with a tweetstorm warning it ""would be a huge Obama-like mistake.""

He said troop withdrawal ""mightily undercuts"" the effort to contain Iranian expansion and puts ""our allies, the Kurds at risk."" Graham also claimed it would ""be viewed as a boost to ISIS desire to come back.""

Graham and five other senators also signed an open letter to Trump expressing their concern over the policy change.

""We believe that such action at this time is a premature and costly mistake that not only threatens the safety and security of the United States, but also emboldens ISIS, (Syrian President) Bashar al Assad, Iran, and Russia."""
486,bbc news,https://www.bbc.com/news/world-us-canada-46775308,"The withdrawal of US troops from Syria depends on certain conditions, US National Security Adviser John Bolton says, in a further indication that the process is being slowed down.

On a trip to Israel and Turkey, he said he would seek Turkish assurances that Kurds in northern Syria would be safe.

The US also wants to ensure that the remnants of the Islamic State (IS) group are defeated, he added.

President Donald Trump has faced strong criticism over the planned US pullout.

When he first announced the move in the middle of December, he said: ""They're all coming back and they're coming back now.""

US officials said American forces had been given 30 days to leave Syria.

Mr Trump also said at the time that IS had been ""defeated"".

The development shocked allies and US defence officials alike, with Defence Secretary Jim Mattis and senior aide Brett McGurk resigning soon after. On Saturday, Department of Defence chief of staff Kevin Sweeney became the third senior Pentagon official to announce his resignation since President Trump's announcement.

Meanwhile, America's Kurdish allies in north-east Syria were left feeling exposed as Turkey, which regards them as terrorists, appeared poised to move against them.

But Mr Trump seemed to row back last week when he said troops were being pulled out ""slowly"" and that they would be fighting remaining IS militants at the same time.

""We don't think the Turks ought to undertake military action that is not fully co-ordinated with and agreed to by the United States at a minimum so they don't endanger our troops, but also so that they meet the president's requirement that the Syrian opposition forces that have fought with us are not endangered,"" Mr Bolton said in Israel ahead of talks with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.

He told reporters there was no timetable for a US withdrawal from Syria but that there was not an unlimited commitment.

Mr Bolton also said President Trump wanted to ensure that IS was ""destroyed"".

Mr Netanyahu said he would discuss Iran's ambitions in Syria when he met Mr Bolton on Sunday evening.

On Tuesday, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo will begin a week-long tour of the Middle East designed to reassure allies in the region.

Some 2,000 US military personnel are reported to be in Syria although the real numbers could be higher.

American ground troops first became involved in Syria in autumn 2015 when then-President Barack Obama sent in a small number of special forces to train and advise local Kurdish fighters who were fighting IS.

The US did this reluctantly after several attempts at arming anti-IS groups had descended into chaos.

Over the intervening years the number of US troops in Syria has increased, and a network of bases and airfields has been established in an arc across the north-eastern part of the country."

US District Court Judge Wendy Beetlestone for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania temporarily blocked the new expanded exemptions rules from taking effect on Monday, while they are being challenged in court in Pennsylvania and New Jersey.

Beetlestone said in the ruling that loss of contraception coverage resulting from the rule's enforcement could lead to 'significant, direct and proprietary harm' to the states through increased use of state-funded contraception services.

Judge Haywood Gilliam, a United States District Judge of the US District Court for the Northern District of California, granted a request for a preliminary injunction in only California, 12 other states and Washington, DC on Sunday.

'The law couldn't be more clear - employers have no business interfering in women's healthcare decisions,' California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said in a statement on Sunday.

Gilliam limited the scope of the ruling to the plaintiffs in the California case, but Beetlestone's order has now temporarily blocked the rules across the country.

A US judge in Pennsylvania on Monday blocked President Donald Trump's administration rules which would allow more employers to opt out of providing women with no-cost birth control by claim it violates their 'moral convictions' from taking effect, nationwide. President Donald Trump is shown speaking at the American Farm Bureau Federation's 100th Annual Convention on Monday in New Orleans

The changes would allow more employers, including publicly traded companies, to opt out of providing no-cost contraceptive coverage to women by claiming religious objections.

Some private employers could also object on moral grounds.

Opponents of the rules change argue that women would be forced to turn to state-funded programs for birth control and experience unintended pregnancies.

'Today's court ruling stops another attempt by the Trump administration to trample on women's access to basic reproductive care, Becerra said on Sunday.

'It's 2019, yet the Trump Administration is still trying to roll back women's rights.

'Our coalition will continue to fight to ensure women have access to the reproductive healthcare they are guaranteed under the law.'

'The law couldn't be more clear - employers have no business interfering in women's healthcare decisions,' California Attorney General Xavier Becerra said in a statement on Sunday. Becerra is pictured in Sacramento, California on October 10

At a hearing on Friday, Judge Haywood Gilliam said the changes would result in a 'substantial number' of women losing birth control coverage, which would be a 'massive policy shift.' This file photo shows a woman holding a birth control pill at her home on January 3, 2013

The US Department of Justice said in court documents the rules 'protect a narrow class of sincere religious and moral objectors from being forced to facilitate practices that conflict with their beliefs.'

At issue is a requirement under President Barack Obama's health care law that birth control services be covered at no additional cost.

Obama officials included exemptions for religious organizations. The Trump administration expanded those exemptions and added 'moral convictions' as a basis to opt out of providing birth control services.

At a hearing on Friday, Gilliam said the changes would result in a 'substantial number' of women losing birth control coverage, which would be a 'massive policy shift.'

The California judge previously blocked an interim version of the rules - a decision that was upheld in December by an appeals court.

Trump's administration released the final version of the rules in November, with minor changes from the previously blocked intermine rules.

Those updated, final version is now being challenged in courts across the country.

488,daily mail online,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-6551209/Nancy-Pelosi-Former-US-House-speaker-set-reclaim-gavel.html,"Nancy Pelosi, arguably the most powerful Democrat in America, will see her stature grow when she is elevated to speaker of the House of Representatives on January 3, 2019, after her party won control of the chamber in November's midterm elections

Nancy Pelosi is once again Washington's most powerful woman, poised to reclaim the US House speaker's gavel Thursday as opponent-in-chief to an impulsive and unpredictable president.

Keeping Donald Trump in check will be among the California Democrat's top challenges as she presides over the House of Representatives through the 2020 elections, when her party aims to dethrone the Republican commander in chief.

Pelosi is almost certain to win Thursday's House vote for speaker, a position she held for four years from 2007, when she made history as the first woman ever to rise to that post.

When outgoing Speaker Paul Ryan yields to the 78-year-old, she will again become the nation's third most senior official and seal her reputation as one of the great survivors in American politics.

In her first stint, Pelosi was a strong opposing force to Republican George W. Bush in the final two years of his presidency. Her role as a restraint on Trump would be similar.

But she will also need to keep the reins tight on her own caucus, some of whose newly empowered progressives are seeking swift punitive measures against Trump in the coming months.

She and the Democratic leadership would have the power to block Republican legislation, hamstringing large parts of Trump's agenda ranging from proposed new tax cuts to building a wall on the border with Mexico.

And Pelosi could make life for Trump much harder if she uses subpoena power to compel administration officials to testify before Congress or turn over key documents, or if she launches impeachment proceedings.

So far, she has spoken out against using such a powerful political cudgel against him, arguing that the explosive step would likely mobilize Republican voters eager to protect the president.

In her reprised role, she will have to thread a political needle, standing up to Trump when needed but also showing that her party is capable of working with the president to pass legislation.

Her immediate task: finding a way to help end a standoff over Trump's border wall demand that has led to a partial government shutdown now stretching to 13 days.

Pelosi and other congressional leaders met with Trump Wednesday but failed to secure a deal to end the impasse.

Three weeks earlier, at a remarkable Oval Office confrontation with cameras rolling, Pelosi showed she was not afraid to go toe to toe with Trump in a public forum when he appeared to belittle her effort to secure support for her speakership.

""Please don't characterize the strength that I bring to this meeting as the leader of the House Democrats, who just won a big victory,"" a defiant Pelosi said.

- 'Respected,' not hated -

Pelosi is unquestionably among the savviest political leaders of her generation. She shepherded then president Barack Obama's health law through the House to its contentious, historic passage in 2010.

Perhaps for that reason she is still seen by some as a liability eight years later, with Republicans presenting her as the ultimate liberal bogeywoman.

""Can you imagine Nancy Pelosi as speaker of the House?"" Trump asked a crowd at a Minnesota rally in October. ""Don't do that to me!""

Pelosi's big comeback was no foregone conclusion. But she shrewdly navigated a simmering party power struggle that saw dozens of House Democrats and candidates signaling their desire for change at the top.

The internal resistance largely stems from Pelosi's broad unpopularity among voters. But in an interview published Wednesday, she pushed back at the notion that she is reviled.

""I don't necessarily feel hated. I feel respected,"" she told Elle magazine. ""They wouldn't come after me if I were not effective.""

- First elected in 1987 -

At least in part, Pelosi's reputation is shaped by years of rightwing attacks. Conservatives depict her, the wife of an investment millionaire from California, as the embodiment of a leftist elite.

She is accused of everything from wanting to raise taxes for middle-class families to supporting a massive influx of illegal immigrants.

For three decades, Pelosi has represented California's 12th congressional district, which includes San Francisco, a stronghold of left-wing politics, counter-culture and gay rights regarded by many heartland conservatives as a true Gomorrah.

Nancy Patricia D'Alesandro was born in Baltimore to a political family with Italian roots. Both her father and brother were mayors of the East Coast port city.

After studying political science in Washington, she moved with her husband to San Francisco, where they raised five children.

First elected to the House in 1987, Pelosi rose through the ranks to lead the chamber's Democrats beginning in 2002.

Steeled by countless political struggles, Pelosi has largely managed to hold her diverse caucus together.

US politics requires donning ""a suit of armor"" and the ability ""to take a punch,"" she has said."
489,daily mail online,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-6551191/Deaths-highlight-childrens-plight-migrant-surge-US.html,"A Central American migrant scales the US-Mexico border fence from Tijuana, Mexico, into the US (L) on January 1, 2019

The death of two Guatemalan children in the United States within weeks of each other has highlighted why there are so many children among Central American migrants heading north: smugglers tell them families have a better chance of being allowed in by US border guards, witnesses told AFP.

Agustin Gomez was one such migrant who decided to risk the trip.

Gomez's relatives in his western, mainly indigenous municipality of Nenton near the Mexican border said he had heard rumors that bringing along his eight-year-old son Felipe might ease his way.

Felipe died in a New Mexico hospital on Christmas Day, only a week after they were both detained by Texas border guards after crossing the border illegally. US authorities investigating the case say Felipe died after presenting with flu symptoms.

Just two weeks earlier, Guatemala had been rocked by the death of seven-year-old indigenous girl Jakelin Caal, admitted to hospital suffering from dehydration.

She made the journey alongside her 29-year-old father Nery from the Mayan town of Raxruha in northern Guatemala.

Though the surge of Guatemalan migrants to the US-Mexico border is caused largely by the country's dire poverty and violence, Guatemalan migration activist Roxana Palma, told AFP there are messages circulating on social media that carrying children gives a greater ""guarantee"" of establishing themselves in the United States.

- Keeping kids from gangs' clutches -

A group of Central American migrants hide from a border patrol near the US-Mexico border fence, before attempting to cross from Tijuana to San Diego in the US on December 31, 2018

There seems little doubt that the main spur for the migrants is abject poverty at home. But taking children with them is also a way for their parents to prevent them being recruited by gangs, migration experts told AFP.

Smugglers -- nicknamed ""Coyotes"" -- blatantly lie about immigration procedures in the United States and do little for migrants beyond holding out the prospect of a better life, said Palma.

""Unfortunately, they are the ones who misinform people about how to get to the United States 'safely',"" she said.

According to another expert, ""there was special treatment for parents who came with children"" to the United States under the previous US administration of President Barack Obama, but that ended with Donald Trump's arrival at the White House.

""The smugglers continue to say that you can enter with children; that's no longer valid,"" said the expert, who requested anonymity in order to speak freely about the subject.

- Social media messages -

A group of Central American migrants walk away from tear gas fired by US border guards after they tried to cross from Tijuana to San Diego on January 1, 2019

""We are also seeing how networks of coyotes recruit, how they make people pay and then deceive them,"" said Danilo Rivera, coordinator of the Central American Institute of Development and Social Studies (INCEDES).

Rivera said they were aware of cases in the indigenous western Guatemala where networks use local radio to make announcements of false offers of visas and travel to the United States ""immediately and safely.""

Guatemalan authorities ""aren't doing a lot"" to thwart this false and misleading travel information, nor does it do enough to root out the causes of emigration, said Rivera.

According to studies by the International Migration Organization (OIM), the majority of Guatemalan migrants sent back by Mexico and the United States come from western Guatemala, the country's poorest region.

Pascual Domingo's father and two brothers, who previously set out from little Felipe Gomez's home village of Yalambojoch, managed to get to the United States and now send money to the family back home.

""All those who go there, it is because they have no money, because they can't find any work,"" said Pascual. In this department of Huehuetenango, nearly 74 percent of the population live below the poverty line, government statistics show.

Maria Lucas, 40, is happy to show her concrete house, built from the money sent home by her son, Juan, who has been living in the United States for the past three years.

Her party featured several notables, including former President Bill Clinton and former first lady and New York Senator Hillary Clinton, who live nearby the embassy.

Pelosi has said she might have retired rather than seek to reclaim the speakership had Clinton won rather than Donald Trump.

Pelosi and Trump are now in a standoff over the president's border wall, which Pelosi has told fellow Democrats may be connected to his 'manhood' amid a partial government shutdown that has now gone on for 12 days.

Pelosi spoke at the event, and the first female speaker spoke about political achievements for women.

She said the nation would 'celebrate the first 100 years of women having the right to vote,' while also 'celebrating over 100 women in the Congress - in the House of Representatives. That's pretty remarkable. It's pretty exciting,' she said.

Also there was former Secretary of State John Kerry, Playbook reported.

Based on photos tweeted out by guests, there were at least 16 tables, each adorned with an elegant flower arrangement.

Several attendees tweeted out photos of the event - including Bennett performing in front of a rhythm section at the embassy.

491,daily mail online,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-6525103/Macron-says-ally-reliable-US-Syria-pullout-announcement.html,"Since Donald Trump became US president, Emmanuel Macron has attempted to develop a ""special relationship"" with the billionaire tycoon despite widely differing political beliefs and styles

French President Emmanuel Macron on Sunday criticised US President Donald Trump's decision to withdraw American forces from Syria, saying ""an ally must be reliable"".

In a sign of the growing diplomatic rift between the two leaders, Macron said ""I deeply regret the decision"" by Trump to pullout US troops.

Trump last week ordered a complete troop pullout from Syria, asserting that the Islamic State group had been defeated, as well as a significant withdrawal from Afghanistan.

Analysts said the momentous reversal of years of US foreign policy will leave the war-torn regions at risk of continued and potentially heightened bloodshed.

France has said it will maintain its participation in the coalition fighting IS in Syria.

""To be an ally is to fight shoulder to shoulder,"" Macron said in Chad's capital N'Djamena with his Chadian counterpart Idriss Deby, adding that France was doing just that in the fight against jihadist groups in Chad.

The US troop pullout in Syria will leave thousands of Kurdish fighters in northern Syria -- which the Pentagon spent years training and arming against IS -- vulnerable to Turkish attack.

Turkey, which fears the separatist ambitions of Kurds in its own country, has threatened to launch another offensive against Kurdish groups in Syria that Ankara accuse of being ""terrorists"".

On Saturday, a senior Kurdish official called on the US to prevent a potential Turkish offensive, calling it America's ""duty to prevent any attack and to put an end to Turkish threats"".

- Once a 'special relationship' -

In his remarks Macron also paid tribute to Defense Secretary James Mattis, who announced he was resigning on Thursday after Trump told the world about his Syria U-turn.

""I want here to pay tribute to General Mattis... for a year we have seen how he was a reliable partner,"" Macron said.

Mattis, 68, was one of Trump's first cabinet picks and has spent nearly two years at the Pentagon.

In his resignation letter Mattis made clear that Trump's world view was irreconcilable with his own.

French president Emmanuel Macron criticised the US Syria pullout announcement during a visit to Chad's capital N'Djamena, alongside his Chadian counterpart Idriss Deby

""My views on treating allies with respect and also being clear-eyed about both malign actors and strategic competitors are strongly held and informed by over four decades' immersion in these issues,"" Mattis wrote to Trump, who has sought closer ties with Russia and heaped contempt on NATO and other alliances.

""Because you have the right to have a Secretary of Defense whose views are better aligned with yours on these and other subjects, I believe it is right for me to step down from my position.""

Brett McGurk, the US special envoy to the anti-IS coalition, also announced he would bring his departure forward from February due to the Syria policy change.

Since Trump became president, Macron has attempted to develop a ""special relationship"" with the billionaire tycoon despite widely differing political beliefs and styles.

The pair had seemed to share a special camaraderie in the early days of their respective presidencies, a ""bromance"" of sorts that included patting and playful banter.

But differences over policy -- in particular the Paris climate accords which Trump opposed -- have become increasingly hard to paper over and tensions in their relationship have become more apparent.

- Allies must be 'reliable' -

Even early on, when Macron and Trump shared a handshake at their first meeting at a NATO gathering in Brussels in May 2017, photographers focused on the white-knuckle grip of the presidents' handshake as the two tried to out-muscle each other.

After Trump pulled out of the Paris climate accords, Macron played on the words of Trump's electoral slogan ""Make America Great Again"", instead saying ""Make Our Planet Great Again"".

In July 2017, when Trump flew into Paris for Bastille Day, France's national holiday, Trump praised his host, saying: ""France is America's first and oldest ally.""

But Trump raised eyebrows when attempting to compliment Macron's wife Brigitte by telling her she was ""in good shape"".

In April, Macron visited Washington and the powerplay between the two was again evident to see, with Trump appearing to flick a piece of dandruff off Macron's jacket on national television, saying ""we have to make him perfect. He is perfect.""

Later, despite Macron repeatedly appealing to Trump to preserve the Iran nuclear deal, Trump exited the multiparty agreement negotiated by his predecessor Barack Obama and reimposed punishing sanctions on the Iranians.

Then in November, Trump publicly lambasted Macron and mocked the French president's approval rating over remarks about Europe taking greater responsiblity for its own defence.

On Sunday Macron indicated his own disappointment at the frayed relations with the US.

""An ally must be reliable, to coordinate with its other allies,"" Macron said."

The former Obama administration official who launched an exploratory committee last month is expected to enter the Democratic competition for the Oval Office.

Castro is the first of the major Democratic contenders to take the leap -- other power players such as Texas rival and ex-Rep. Beto O'Rourke are still building out their operations.

Ex-San Antonio mayor Julián Castro is teasing a 'special announcement' next weekend in his home town having to do with his '2020 presidential plans'

The former Obama administration official who launched an exploratory committee last month is expected to enter the Democratic competition for the Oval Office

Sen. Elizabeth Warren this week said she is interested in running, as well, but has not moved past the consideration phase.

The 69-year-old Massachusetts Democrat in an attempt to show that she is as hip as potential competitors like the 44-year-old Castro shared an Instagram video of herself grabbing a cold one.

She told reporters afterward: 'I drink Michelob Ultra -- the club soda of beers.'

Warren is likely to jump into the race alongside Castro. She has may have competition from the likes of former Vice President Joe Biden, ex-New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg, fellow Sens. Kamala Harris of California, Sherrod Brown of Ohio, Bernie Sanders of Vermont, Castro and O'Rourke for the nomination, not to mention rumored dark horse candidates.

Democrats have scheduled a dozen debates before the election that will take place in a little under two years, the first of which will take place this June to try and thin the field of contenders that could savage each other before winning the right to formally face-off against Trump.

Castro became the first nationally-known Democrat to say he is considering a presidential bid on on Dec. 12, making an announcement on Twitter that he had formally launched an exploratory committee.

The former Housing and Urban Development Secretary to Obama and San Antonio mayor made his opening bid a YouTube video introducing himself and his value system to Americans.

Without mentioning the current Oval Office occupant, he said, 'Americans are ready to climb out of this darkness. We're ready to keep our promises, and we're not gonna wait -- we're gonna work.

'That's why I'm exploring a candidacy for President of the United States in 2020,' he announced.

Julian Castro delivered the keynote address at the Democratic National Convention in 2012 when delegates nominated Obama for reelection

He became the first national Democrat to say he is considering a presidential bid on Dec. 12, making an announcement on Twitter that he had formally launched an exploratory committee

Castro has two children, Carina and Cristian, with his wife Erica, whom he married in 2007.

A former mayor of San Antonio, Texas, he served in Barack Obama's administration from 2014 until the Democrat left office.

His twin brother, Joaquín, represents Texas in Congress. Joaquín is one minute younger than Julian.

Several household-name Democrats have been flirting with presidential bids, but Castro is the first one to say that he's actively seeking higher office.

Democratic Congressman John Delaney of Maryland was the first to get in the race, however, his bid has not attracted significant attention.

Castro made a point in his announcement video of reaching out to seniors, Muslims, people with 'black and brown skin,' students and other demographic groups who may feel aggrieved by Trump.

'If we want to see a change in this country, we don't wait, we work, we make our future happen,' he said, borrowing from a motto he said his mother used to motivate him with.

The Obama-era official did not challenge Trump directly while intentionally creating a contrast between his beliefs of and that of the sitting president's.

He said it is his belief that the nation can make 'a promise to immigrants' seeking a better life in America without explicitly touching on the controversial topic of border security.

Castro told prospective immigrants: 'We have room for you. We welcome you. Our destines are united.'

The Democratic politician's grandmother was a Mexican immigrant.

SPOT THE DIFFERENCE: Castro's twin brother, Joaquín, right, represents Texas in Congress. Joaquín is one minute younger than Julian

In 2009, Castro became the nation's youngest mayors of a major metropolitan city after serving on the San Antonio city council for a period of fours years. He had been elected to the governing body at age 26 after fending off five challengers.

Castro lost his first bid for mayor in 2005 but won his second on his go-around in 2009. Voters reelected him twice in 2011 and 2013 to the position that he left to head the Housing and Urban division.

While he was still serving as secretary he was considered for the VP spot on Hillary Clinton's ticket. Ultimately, she went with another Obama loyalist, Tim Kaine, a senator from Virginia who had served as the purple state's governor.

Texas is considered to a reliably Republican state, although some urban areas and surrounding districts routinely elect Democrats.

A study in the American Political Science Review deemed San Antonio, for instance, the most liberal city in the entire nation.

Castro's announcement that he will seek the presidency may pit him against another Texan and former El Paso mayor O'Rourke, a former Democratic congressman who lost a November bid to unseat Republican Sen. Ted Cruz.

O'Rourke met with Obama days after losing the election and is also said to be eyeing the Oval Office.

Obama called him an 'impressive young man who ran a terrific race in Texas' on a podcast in which he praised O'Rourke for speaking freely about what he believed, even if his statements didn't win him the contest.

A spokesperson for Obama declined to comment on the Casto's announcement that he is formally beginning a campaign to win the Democratic nomination to the nation's most powerful position.

Castro delivered the keynote address at the Democratic National Convention in 2012 when delegates nominated Obama for reelection.

The speaking slot is often reserved for up-and-coming politicians the party wants to highlight like future President Barack Obama. He gave the address in 2004.

In his speech, Castro spoke about some of the same themes he would later hit on in his presidential announcement.

He said the American Dream, which he said is 'not a sprint, or even a marathon, but a relay' and can take several generations to achieve.

'My grandmother never owned a house. She cleaned other people's houses so she could afford to rent her own. But she saw her daughter become the first in her family to graduate from college. And my mother fought hard for civil rights so that instead of a mop, I could hold this microphone,' he said at a high point of his speech.

Castro's grandmother was a Mexican-born orphan who moved to the United States to live with family as a child.

493,daily mail online,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/ap/article-6518641/US-charges-2-hackers-alleged-Chinese-intelligence-ties.html,"WASHINGTON (AP) - U.S. officials on Thursday said two alleged Chinese hackers carried out an extensive campaign on behalf of Beijing's main intelligence agency to steal trade secrets and other information from government agencies and ""a who's who"" of major corporations in the United States and nearly a dozen other nations.

The indictment is the latest in a series of Justice Department criminal cases targeting Chinese cyberespionage and coincided with an announcement by Britain blaming China's Ministry of State Security for trade-secret pilfering affecting Western nations.

The alleged hackers, one of whom is nicknamed ""Godkiller,"" are accused of breaching computer networks beginning as early as 2006 in a range of industries, including aviation and space, finance, biotechnology oil and gas, satellites and pharmaceuticals. Prosecutors say they also obtained the names, Social Security numbers and other personal information of more than 100,000 Navy personnel.

In a new twist reflecting corporate computing's evolution, the hackers often infiltrated cloud computing companies and other major technology providers to indirectly reach clients' valuable documents.

Prosecutors said the alleged hackers stole ""hundreds of gigabytes"" of data, breaching computers of more than 45 entities in 12 states including NASA's Jet Propulsion Lab and Goddard Space Center. The hackers, identified as members of the group APT10, or ""Stone Panda,"" are not in custody. Prosecutors said their names are Zhu Hua and Zhang Shillong.

U.S. law enforcement officials say the case is part of a trend of state-sponsored hackers breaking into American networks and stealing trade secrets and other confidential information. More than 90 percent of Justice Department economic espionage cases over the past seven years involve China, said Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, and more than two-thirds of trade secrets cases are connected to the country.

An indictment was unsealed Thursday against Zhu Hua and Zhang Shillong.

""China's state-sponsored actors are the most active perpetrators of economic espionage,"" FBI Director Chris Wray said in announcing the case. ""While we welcome fair competition, we cannot and will not tolerate illegal hacking, stealing or cheating.""

""China's goal, simply put, is to replace the U.S. as the world's leading superpower, and they're using illegal methods to get there,"" Wray said. While none of the ""victim companies"" was named, Wray called them a ""who's who of the global economy.""

China on Friday said the U.S. was ""fabricating facts out of thin air."" A statement from Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying described the ""unwarranted accusations"" as a serious violation of the basic norms of international relations that was harmful to China-U.S. cooperation.

Hua accused the U.S. of hypocrisy. ""It has long been an open secret that the relevant authorities of the U.S. conduct large-scale cybertheft and listen in on foreign governments, enterprises and individuals,"" she said.

Secretary of State Mike Pompeo and Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen released a joint statement accusing China of reneging on a 2015 commitment not to seek competitive advantage through theft of trade secrets, intellectual property and confidential business information.

U.S. officials testified before Congress last week that Beijing's continued hacking has made a mockery of that 2015 commitment by President Xi Jinping following a first-of-its-kind indictment that accused Chinese hackers of stealing corporate data from brand-name U.S. companies.

""We want China to cease illegal cyber activities and honor its commitment to the international community, but the evidence suggests that China may not intend to live up to its promises,"" Rosenstein said.

Rob Silvers, a former Obama administration cybersecurity official, said cases like this create an important deterrent but should be supplemented by sanctions and other steps.

""It's necessary to do this kind of thing, but it's not nearly enough,"" he said. ""I don't think Rod Rosenstein would tell you that it's game, set, match.""

After a 2014 indictment against five alleged Chinese hackers, and a subsequent agreement with the U.S., Beijing at least temporarily reduced its hacking activity, Silvers said.

This case shows that ""China has taken the gloves off again,"" he said.

Adam Segal, a cybersecurity expert at the Council on Foreign Relations, agreed that Beijing is unlikely to be swayed by sanctions alone.

The indictment filed in federal court in Manhattan describes how in recent years, as government agencies and corporations have shifted data to cloud computing providers and services including email and collaboration tools to tech service providers, the Stone Panda hackers followed, typically stealing the log-in credentials of system administrators in order to reach coveted proprietary data of clients.

Wray likened it to ""breaking into and getting the keys from the maintenance department.""

Britain's Foreign Office accused the Chinese elite hackers of conducting a ""widespread and significant"" campaign of cyberespionage against the United Kingdom and its allies and ""almost certainly continues to target a range of global companies, seeking to gain access to commercial secrets.""

Targeted nations named in the U.S. indictment include Brazil, Canada, Finland, France, Germany, India, Japan, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Arab Emirates.

In recent months, the Justice Department has filed separate cases against several Chinese intelligence officials and hackers. A case filed in October marked the first time that a Chinese Ministry of State Security officer was extradited to the United States to stand trial.

Chinese espionage efforts have become ""the most severe counterintelligence threat facing our country today,"" Bill Priestap, the assistant director of the FBI's counterintelligence division, told a Senate committee.

Hacking by Chinese state-backed hackers dramatically escalated over the summer in response to the trade war with the U.S. and military tensions in the South China Sea, said Tom Kellermann, chief cybersecurity officer of Carbon Black, whose company's threat-hunting tool is used in global cyber investigations.

He credited the Justice Department with targeting a group that he said was China's ""most prolific hacker crew."" He said he was not optimistic that the pair would be prosecuted in the U.S., but that's not the point.

""The Chinese are operating on a 50-year plan of information dominance, a comprehensive national strategy, and it's high time we actually reacted,"" Kellermann said.

Associated Press writers Jill Lawless in London and Frank Bajak in Boston contributed to this report.

Former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg says that if he runs for president, he'll pay for it himself, defending candidates who use personal riches to bankroll campaigns.

Bloomberg's comments to reporters in Texas on Friday follow a jab from another top 2020 contender.

Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren recently decried the Democratic presidential nomination becoming 'one more plaything that billionaires can buy.'

Forbes estimates Bloomberg's current worth at $45.2 billion; it most recently calculated that Donald Trump is worth $1.68 billion.

But Bloomberg says his riches insulate him from having to curry favor with special interests.

'I ran three times. I used only my own money so I didn't have to ask anybody what they wanted in return for a contribution,' Bloomberg said.

'And, if I ran again, I would do the same thing. I think not having to adjust what you say and what you work on based on who financed your campaign is one of the things that the public really likes.'

Decision time: Michael Bloomberg says he will announce if he will run or not by next month. If he enters the field he would dwarf Trump as the richest-ever presidential contender - at a time when the Democratic party whose nomination he is seeking is turning against the richest

He added: 'I understand not everybody can be self-funded but those that can, I think, should.'

Bloomberg was in Austin to announce that the city had won funding to help combat climate change from his philanthropic foundation.

He told reporters he won't make a decision on a possible presidential bid for 'another month or so.'

Warren has already formed a presidential exploratory committee and generated excitement with a visit to Iowa last week.

She asked recently: 'Is this going to be a Democratic primary that truly is a grassroots movement that is funded by the grassroots and it's done with grassroots volunteers, or is this going to be something that's one more plaything that billionaires can buy?'

Warren said on MSNBC's 'Rachel Maddow Show' that Democrats should 'link arms' and take grassroots funding. 'No to the billionaires,' she said.

Bloomberg didn't mention Warren by name on Friday, but shortly after his comments, spokeswoman Paige Hill said, 'Mike has met Warren and was impressed by her.'

She also offered a statement from Bloomberg senior adviser Howard Wolfson that said 'Mike is somebody who did not grow up with privilege. He made all of his money on his own.'

Roseanne Barr claimed she was fired by ABC from the reboot of her hit sitcom because of antisemitism.

The 66-year-old comedian was fired by ABC in May just a day after she sent a racist tweet about Valerie Jarrett, a former adviser in the Obama administration.

In the tweet about Jarrett, who was born in Iran to American parents and lived in Shiraz , Barr claimed: 'Muslim Brotherhood & Planet of the Apes had a baby=vj'.

Rosanne Barr (pictured) claimed she was fired by ABC from the reboot of her hit sitcom because of antisemitism

The reboot of the popular 90s sitcom 'Roseanne' was axed in May after Barr, 65, made a racist tweet about former Obama aide Valerie Jarrett

Within hours ABC announced it was canceling Roseanne, which was rebooted earlier that year to massive ratings.

At the time, the network said Barr's tweet was 'abhorrent, repugnant and inconsistent with our values, and we have decided to cancel her show'.

The following month the network decided to bring back the show without Barr, giving it the title 'The Conners'.

In the interview this week, Barr said the executives at ABC treated her unfairly because she is Jewish and supports Israel.

'I feel that what happened to me, a large part of it is antisemitism', the Jewish actress told The Jerusalem Post in a phone interview from her home in Hawaii.

She added: 'I think it played a part - the fact that I was never allowed to explain what I meant - and what I meant was a commentary on Iran - so they purposely mischaracterized what I said and wouldn't let me explain.

'And in haste they did something unprecedented that they've never done to any other artist.

'And at the base of that I think it's because I am the most vocal person about Israel and BDS'.

ABC fears it may have jumped the gun by firing Roseanne Barr after the reboot's success was based largely on the audience's love for the family matriarch

ABC had released images of Roseanne Barr (left) and Laurie Metcalf (right) appearing in a scene from the comedy series

The BDS campaign promotes boycotting Israel and its products until the Jewish state removes settlements from the West Bank.

Barr will travel to Israel in two weeks for an event and will discuss her experiences with antisemitism and her opposition to BDS.

She added: 'I want Israelis to know what it's like to be an American Jew, so I'll be speaking about that.

'You guys don't go through the antisemitism that we go through in America'.

Barr also told Jerusalem Post that she turned more to Judaism in particular over the past year.

'It is something that I always turn to, and it strengthened my resolve to become more public about it.

'I decided that this was the time to stand up to be counted'.

Barr, 65, was fired from the show on May 29, after making what was perceived to be a racist remark on Twitter about former Obama aide Valerie Jarrett (right). She later apologized for the tweet

Barr quickly apologized for the tweet which caused furore and led ABC to cancel the show

Barr also claimed she still thinks about running for President after campaigning unsuccessfully for the Green Part nomination in 2012.

'The reason I would run is I have very common-sense solutions to problems.

'And I'm more interested in people hearing my solutions to things than running for anything. And they're all Torah-based solutions'.

In October, Barr gave a pointed response to being killed off in the premiere of the reboot to her once eponymous show The Conners.

Barr tweeted 'I AIN'T DEAD B*****S,' shortly after the episode aired in which it was revealed that the Roseanne character had died from an opioid overdose.

In the first portion of the show, the family is sitting around lamenting how much they miss her, and at first it appeared she had died of a heart attack about three weeks prior.

Barr said the executives at ABC treated her unfairly because she is Jewish and supports Israel

However, before the first commercial break, it is revealed Roseanne had a drug problem and she overdosed.

Prior to Barr's tweet the show had already received criticism for Roseanne's portrayal of a Trump supporter and its attempts to confront social issues involving race and politics.

According to one source, ABC was aware of what they 'were getting' when they hired the outspoken actress and rebooted her show, but the inappropriate tweet was the last straw for Dungey, despite Barr's desperate attempts to save face.

'They could've suspended her from the first few episodes without pay and had her return later on in the season. I mean the season finale saw Roseanne going to the hospital for knee surgery,' the source added.

The show's cancellation also caused conflict among cast members who were forced to publicly condemn their co-star's actions.

John Goodman admitted on Jimmy Kimmel on Tuesday that Barr is 'definitely' missed on set because the cast 'is like family.'"
497,daily mail online,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/afp/article-6583939/Obama-protege-Julian-Castro-set-join-2020-race.html,"Democratic former US housing secretary Julian Castro, the youngest member of president Barack Obama's cabinet, is widely expected to launch a 2020 presidential bid

Former mayor of San Antonio, Texas and Obama-era cabinet member Julian Castro is expected Saturday to launch his bid to become the nation's first Hispanic president, scheduling his announcement in a border state central to America's immigration debate.

Castro would become the most high-profile Democrat to date to officially enter the 2020 race, which is expected to include a diverse field of candidates eager to challenge President Donald Trump.

But the 44-year-old would be among the underdogs in a political showdown that may well feature heavyweights like former vice president Joe Biden, US senators Elizabeth Warren, Bernie Sanders and Kamala Harris, and perhaps even billionaire businessman Michael Bloomberg.

Congresswoman Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii, a progressive Democrat, said Friday she will officially announce her presidential run in the coming days.

Castro's strong oratory skills, experience as Barack Obama's housing secretary and as mayor of the nation's seventh largest city, not to mention his telegenic charisma, could help propel the Texas native into the top tier.

He would also become the third prominent Latino presidential candidate in four years, after Republican senators Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio fought Trump for their party's nomination in 2016.

Castro's candidacy could also help revive Democratic enthusiasm among Latino voters, who supported Hillary Clinton but at a lower rate than Obama.

Trump made immigration a flashpoint of that race, and it remains among the nation's most contentious issues. The US government remains locked in a partial shutdown, soon to begin its fourth week, over Trump's demand for $5.7 billion in border wall funding.

- A ""great guy"" -

Castro's national profile took off in 2012 when he became the first Latino to give a keynote address at the Democratic National Convention.

Four years later he was a finalist to be Clinton's running mate.

Castro, a fierce Trump critic, is a third generation American. Last year he said he probably would not be in the United States if today's strict immigration policies were in place when Castro's grandmother crossed the border as a young girl in 1922.

In his convention speech Castro highlighted ""an unlikely journey"" that he has lived, including growing up with twin brother Joaquin, who is a US congressman. The phrase became the title of his new memoir that was published last month.

He has kept the contents of his announcement secret, but he is widely expected to reveal his White House ambitions.

""I'll tell you and I'll tell the world what I'm going to do,"" he said this week on MSNBC.

Castro does not yet have the national recognition of luminaries Biden, Sanders and Warren.

Dena Grayson, a Democratic strategist, said Castro is a ""great guy"" and ""phenomenal public speaker"" who has potential broad appeal in states with large numbers of Hispanic voters, like California, Texas and Florida.

But standing out in a crowded field will be ""difficult,"" Grayson added."
498,daily mail online,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/wires/pa/article-6543405/Elizabeth-Warren-takes-big-step-2020-presidential-run.html,"Senator Elizabeth Warren has taken the first major step towards launching a widely anticipated campaign for the presidency.

""No matter what our differences, most of us want the same thing,"" the 69-year-old Massachusetts Democrat said in a video that highlights her family's history in Oklahoma.

""To be able to work hard, play by the same set of rules and take care of the people we love. That's what I'm fighting for and that's why today I'm launching an exploratory committee for president.""

Mrs Warren burst onto the national scene a decade ago during the financial crisis with calls for greater consumer protections.

President Donald Trump responded to the move by saying he would love to run against Mrs Warren.

Mr Trump said in an interview with Fox News Channel's All-American New Year set to air on Monday night that he hoped Mrs Warren was among the Democrats to run in 2020.

He said: ""We'll see how she does, I wish her well. I hope she does well. I'd love to run against her.""

She quickly became one of the party's more prominent liberals even as she sometimes fought with Obama administration officials over their response to the market turmoil.

Now, as a likely presidential contender, she is making an appeal to the party's base. Her video notes the economic challenges facing people of colour along with images of a women's march and Mrs Warren's participation at an LGBT event.

In an email to supporters, Mrs Warren said she would more formally announce a campaign plan early in 2019.

Mrs Warren is the most prominent Democrat yet to make a move towards a presidential bid and has long been a favourite target of Mr Trump.

In mid-December, former Obama housing chief Julian Castro also announced a presidential exploratory committee, which legally allows potential candidates to begin raising money. Outgoing Maryland representative John Delaney is the only Democrat so far to have formally announced a presidential campaign.

But that is likely to change quickly in the new year as other leading Democrats take steps towards White House runs.

Mrs Warren enters a Democratic field that is shaping up as the most crowded in decades, with many of her Senate colleagues openly weighing their own campaigns, as well as governors, mayors and other prominent citizens.

One of her most significant competitors could be senator Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent who is eyeing another presidential run harnessing the same populist rhetoric.

She must also move past a widely panned October release of a DNA test meant to bolster her claim to Native American heritage.

The move was intended to rebut Mr Trump's taunts of Mrs Warren as ""Pocahontas"". Instead, her use of a genetic test to prove ethnicity spurred controversy that seemed to blunt any argument she sought to make. There was no direct mention of it in the video released on Monday.

Mrs Warren has the benefit of higher name recognition than many others in the Democratic mix for 2020, thanks to her years as a prominent critic of Wall Street who originally conceived of what became the government's Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.

She now faces an arduous battle to raise money and capture Democratic primary voters' attention before Iowa casts its first vote in more than a year. She has an advantage in the 12.5 million US dollars left over from her 2018 re-election campaign that she could use for a presidential run."
499,daily mail online,https://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-6577797/Jeff-Bezos-gushing-text-messages-TV-anchor-having-affair-with.html,"Jeff Bezos' steamy text messages to the TV anchor he had been having a relationship with for at least eight months before his split from his wife became public were revealed on Thursday and include comments from the billionaire such as 'I want to smell you' and 'I want to breathe you in'.

The messages, which were published by The National Enquirer, date back to April 2018, nine months before Bezos announced his split from his wife MacKenzie.

In them, he told Lauren Sanchez, the former anchor of Fox 11's Good Day, among other things: 'I love you, alive girl.

'I will show you with my body, and my lips and my eyes, very soon.'

In another, he said: 'I want to hold you tight.... I want to kiss your lips.... I love you. I am in love with you.'

It was previously reported that the pair had been dating since June, months before she separated from her husband, Hollywood mega-agent Patrick Whitesell, and nine months before Bezos announced his split from his wife, MacKenzie, on Twitter.

Bezos, 54, and Sanchez, 49, have both denied cheating on their spouses since details of their romance emerged on Wednesday evening.

According to the Enquirer, the pair met several times for illicit trysts as often as six times in two weeks.

He reportedly took her on vacations on his $65million private jet and sent her erotic selfies that were 'too explicit' even for the magazine to print.

A source close to the Bezos told DailyMail.com that the Amazon founder only began seeing Sanchez after separating from his wife - however the National Enquirer claims the affair went on behind their spouses' backs.

Bezos released a statement revealing the split on his Twitter account yesterday in a bid to present the news in a favorable light.

The National Enquirer will publish photos of Bezos and Sanchez in this edition set to hit the stands on Thursday. Bezos announced his divorce in anticipation of the photos' release

He and his wife described each other as 'cherished friends' and gave the impression it was amicable.

'If we had known we would separate after 25 years, we would do it all again,' they said in a joint statement that he published on Twitter.

The Enquirer says it trailed Bezos and Sanchez for four months in what it calls the 'largest investigation' in the magazine's history, with its photographer catching the lovebirds 'doing the dirty on their spouses'.

However they say they have evidence of the affair staring several months before their investigation began.

They say they followed Bezos and Sanchez 'across five states and 40,000 miles, tailed them in private jets, swanky limos, helicopter rides, romantic hikes, five-star hotel hideaways, intimate dinner dates and 'quality time' in hidden love nests.'

The magazine also claim they once met up at the same hotel in Boston, Massachusetts where the Bezos family stayed when they visited their son at MIT for Parents' Day.

Sanchez is married to Hollywood talent mogul husband Patrick Whitesell, and sources say they 'separated this fall' - months after her exchanges with Bezos began.

'Patrick and Lauren Sanchez have been separated for a while.

'Their marriage has been off and on for a while, and they tried hard to fix things, but in the fall they officially separated,' a source told the magazine.

Sanchez did not separate from her husband until 'the fall', several months after the raunchy text messages

Sanchez, who is said to have met Bezos while her company was shooting aerial video for his side venture Blue Origin, was publicly spotted alongside the online retail mogul as recently as Amazon's Golden Globes party on Sunday.

Bezos and Sanchez were seen together, along with her husband Whitesell, at a party for the Amazon film Manchester by the Sea in 2016.

Whitesell is a CEO at William Morris Endeavor whose clients include Michelle Williams, one of the stars of the film.

The two couples are said to have known each other for years, and grown close because they both have homes in Seattle.

In their statement on Wednesday, Jeff and MacKenzie said they had been going through a 'trial separation' in recent months.

'As our family and close friends know, after a long period of loving exploration and trial separation, we have decided to divorce and continue our shared lives as friends,' the statement read.

'If we had known we would separate after 25 years, we would do it all again.'

Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos and novelist MacKenzie Bezos announced they are divorcing, through a joint statement on Wednesday, after 25 years of marriage. They are shown at left in 2003, and are pictured at right the 2018 Vanity Fair Oscar Party in Beverly Hills, California in March

'As our family and close friends know, after a long period of loving exploration and trial separation, we have decided to divorce and continue our shared lives as friends,' the statement posted to Jeff's Twitter account on Wednesday read. 'If we had known we would separate after 25 years, we would do it again'

Bezos is worth close to $140 billion. The statement did not mention how the two will split that fortune, though experts believed that's already been hashed out.

Much of that dollar amount comes from his 16 percent ownership stake in Amazon, which briefly became the second US-based company to reach a $1 trillion valuation in September, behind Apple in August.

Amazon's stock edged up $2.84 on Wednesday to close at $1,659.42.

That left Amazon with a market value of $811 billion, more than any other publicly traded company in the US. The company passed Microsoft this week to become the world's biggest publicly traded company by market capitalization.

The divorce should have no material impact on the company and its shares, said Thomas Forte, an analyst at DA Davidson & Co.

Amazon Vice President of Corporate Communications Drew Herdener told DailyMail.com in a statement: 'Jeff remains focused on and engaged in all aspects of Amazon.'

Two-time author MacKenzie Bezos, 48, who won an American Book Award in 2006, was one of the first employees of Amazon at its founding, doing accounting for the start-up.

Jeff and MacKenzie Bezos married in 1993, one year before he founded Amazon, which he started from a garage in Seattle in 1994. Jeff is pictured with stacks of books in 1997

The two, who both graduated from Princeton University six years apart, live in Washington, which is a community property state, and that means all assets acquired during the marriage by either spouse are split equally unless there's a prenuptial agreement stating otherwise.

The division of the Bezos' assets will be complicated because the two will continue to pursue joint ventures, according to the joint statement.

'We feel incredibly lucky to have found each other and deeply grateful for every one of the years we have been married to each other,' the statement read.

'We've had such a great life together as a married couple, and we also see wonderful futures ahead, as parents, friends, partners in ventures and projects, and as individuals pursuing ventures and adventures.

'Though the labels might be different, we remain a family, and we remain cherished friends.'

Toby Yerburgh, Partner and Head of Family at Collyer Bristow LLP, told DailyMail.com:

'Not since the 'conscious uncoupling' statement of Gwyneth Paltrow and Chris Martin have a high profile couple released such a positive and upbeat statement announcing their divorce as the one released today by Jeff Bezos and his wife.

'Such agreed statements often form part of the negotiations over a financial split and come attached to an NDA. They demonstrate the importance of high profile divorcing couples' lawyers working hand in glove with their PR agents.'

Jeff Bezos is worth close to $140 billion. The statement did not mention how the two will split that fortune. Jeff (right) is pictured attending the Amazon Prime Video's Golden Globe Awards After Party at The Beverly Hilton Hotel on January 6 in Beverly Hills, California with Mr. Robot series creator Sam Esmail (left), head of Amazon Studios Jennifer Salke (second from left), and the star of The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel, Rachel Brosnahan (second from right)

The bulk of the assets now at issue in this financial split include nearly 79 million shares of Amazon stock, which is currently worth about $130 billion, along with Rocket ship maker Blue Origin and The Washington Post.

According to Refinitiv Eikon data, MacKenzie does not hold any Amazon shares directly.

Liat Sadler, a San Francisco matrimonial lawyer, noted that spouses owe a fiduciary duty to one another.

'They have duties not to waste or devalue marital resources, and to keep the value of marital property as high as possible,' she said.

'I don't think there is an issue of concern for shareholders as to what will happen to Amazon because of the divorce.'

Sadler said the main options facing the couple regarding Amazon stock were for Jeff to buy out his wife or for MacKenzie to retain shares.

'If she trusts that he would manage Amazon well, either he should pay her for her share of the stock, or they could enter a more complicated agreement where she keeps stock and he keeps voting rights,' she said.

It is unlikely that many details of the divorce will become public, New York lawyer Bernard Clair, who is representing Judith Giuliani in her divorce from former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, said.

'These two have been separated for a not insignificant time, and I would assume ... they would have used the time to reach a private, confidential agreement,' Clair said.

Less than two years ago, Jeff and MacKenzie couldn't keep their hands off of each other as they vacationed in Italy in May of 2017

Less than two years ago, the two couldn't keep their hands off of each other as they vacationed in Italy in May of 2017.

And now, on Sunday night, Jeff was all smiles while at the Golden Globe Awards, hobnobbing with celebrities without MacKenzie by his side.

Amazon Prime Video' hosted its own after party at The Beverly Hilton Hotel on January 6 in Beverly Hills, where he was photographed with Mr. Robot series creator Sam Esmail, head of Amazon Studios Jennifer Salke, and the star of The Marvelous Mrs. Maisel, Rachel Brosnahan.

Jeff came up from virtually nothing to become the self-made billionaire, one hundred times over, that he is today.

He was born to a 16-year-old mother, Jacklyn Gise, and deadbeat dad, Ted Jorgensen, in Texas on January 12, 1964, as Jeffrey Preston Jorgensen.

When Jeff was 17 months old, his mom divorced Jorgensen, who belonged to a unicycle troupe and was making $1.25 per hour at a retail store, according to CNBC.

About three years later, Gise remarried Miguel Bezos in 1968.

Miguel had arrived in Miami in 1962 from Cuba, and he only knew one word of English: 'hamburger.'

When Jeff was four, Jorgensen agreed to allow Miguel to adopt his son, and that's how Jeff became became Jeffrey Preston Bezos.

'Though the labels might be different, we remain a family, and we remain cherished friends,' the statement read. Jeff (second from right) and MacKenzie Bezos (third from left) are pictured with their three sons, the oldest of which is Preston, 18 (second from left), and their adopted daughter from China (third from right), attending the premiere of Paramount Pictures' 'Star Trek Beyond' at Embarcadero Marina Park South on July 20, 2016 in San Diego, California

MacKenzie was born MacKenzie S. Tuttle on April 7, 1970, in San Francisco, California. Her father was a financial planner father and she had a stay-at-home mom.

By high school, she had moved east, and graduated from Hotchkiss School in Connecticut in 1988.

MacKenzie went on to graduate from Princeton University with a bachelor's degree in English, with highest honors in 1992.

She studied under Pulitzer Prize-winning writer Toni Morrison while in college, who said she was 'one of the best students I've ever had in my creative writing classes.'

Morrison, who was MacKenzie's thesis adviser, was the one who connected her with famed literary agent Amanda 'Binky' Urban.

Jeff also graduated from Princeton, but in 1986, and the two never crossed paths while studying there.

Jeff and MacKenzie met at work in New York City in 1992. Jeff was the first to interview MacKenzie at the investment management firm of DE Shaw.

At the time, Jeff was a vice president there, and MacKenzie had come on board as a research associate, Business Insider reported.

The two Princeton graduates were engaged three months later and married in 1993.

Transformation: When Bezos' net worth reached $105.1 billion in January of 2018, CNN reported that he was the richest person in history. Jeff is shown at left during a press conference on August 23, 2000, and at right during the Allen & Co. Media and Technology Conference in Sun Valley, Idaho on July 13, 2017

That was all before Jeff founded Amazon, which he started from a garage in Seattle in 1994. Since that time, the two have made a noticeable style transformation.

Portraits of the Amazon CEO that were taken in 1997 -- the year his company went public -- show him wearing a blue button-down shirt, pleated khaki pants, and a black leather wrist watch while posing next to stacks of books.

Fast forward to 2017, and Jeff set the internet alight when he showed up to the annual Allen & Company Sun Valley conference with bulging muscles peeking out from his polo shirt.

With his shaved head and tinted sunglasses -- plus the bulging biceps -- many on Twitter couldn't help but compare the Amazon CEO to action star Vin Diesel.

Gone were Jeff's baggy shirts and receding hairline and there, among the richest and most influential people in the world, he seemed to emerge reborn.

MacKenzie, meanwhile, went from frumpy separates to sleek, form-fitting sheath dresses that she often accessorizes with a pair of classic pumps.

The two were most-recently seen attending Senator John McCain's funeral in early September. Jeff was wearing a classic black suit with a blue tie, while MacKenzie wore a long-sleeve black sheath and matching heels.

Speaking of their early years at an event in Berlin in April, Jeff said MacKenzie's support was instrumental when he founded Amazon, and that she did the accounting for the company in its first year.

'When you have loving and supportive people in your life, like MacKenzie, my parents, my grandfather, my grandmother, you end up being able to take risks,' he said at the event.

Now, if the two file for divorce in their home state of Washington, their assets may be subject to the community property state's laws of division.

In Washington, all income earned and property acquired by either spouse during a marriage is owned by both spouses, together, and will be split equally upon divorce, unless that default rule is opted out of with a prenuptial agreement.

But since the duo's fortune was amassed after they met, it's highly likely they didn't draft a pre-nup before they wed.

Jeff's wealth has grown exponentially in the last five years, with Forbes estimating his net worth at $32 billion in March of 2014.

When his net worth reached $105.1 billion in January of 2018, CNN reported that Jeff was the richest person in history.

Now, he's worth $136.9 billion, and he and MacKenzie are thought to own more land, together, than almost anyone else in the United States of America, according to Business Insider.

If his $137 billion fortune is split equally with MacKenzie, it would mean Jeff would lose the title as world's richest person, and MacKenzie would gain the title of world's richest woman.

But even with a $69 billion fortune, the Amazon founder would still be ranked fifth richest person, according to the Bloomberg Billionaire Index.

The two, who have been known to live relatively modestly despite the monumental wealth they've acquired in recent years, reportedly lived in a one-bedroom rented home in Seattle through 1999. To date, they now own at least five homes throughout the country.

Community property is the default rule in Washington, which means all assets acquired by either spouse during a marriage are split equally in divorce, but that can be opted out of with a prenuptial agreement. Jeff and MacKenzie own two homes in Medina, an exclusive Seattle suburb, an aerial view of which is shown. They paid $10 million for the property in 1998

On the west coast, they own two homes in Medina, Washington, an exclusive Seattle suburb that is also home to Bill Gates.

They paid $10 million for 5.3 acres of property in 1998, according to the Wall Street Journal.

One of the homes covers 20,600 square feet with five bedrooms and five bathrooms. The other is 8,300 square feet with five bedrooms and five bathrooms. The latter is rumored to have cost $53 million.

The estate with 310 feet of Lake Washington shoreline underwent a $28 million renovation in 2010.

To date, the two own five homes throughout the country, including this second house shown in Beverly Hills which was acquired off-market from a neighbor for $12.9 million

In Beverly Hills, the two added on to an original purchase in Southern California from 2007 that cost them $24.45 million by buying an adjacent home in an off-market sale from a neighbor for $12.9 million in 2017.

The first home is a seven-bed, seven-bath Spanish-style mansion with a greenhouse, tennis court, swimming pool, six car garage and four fountains.

Neighbors reportedly include A-listers Jimmy Stewart, Donna Reed and Walter Matthau.

The second home is far more modest at just 4,568 square feet with four bedrooms.

The majority of the duo's land holdings are in West Texas, where the family owns an estimated 400,000 acres in Culberson and Hudspeth counties east of El Paso. One of the holdings is a 30,000-acre Figure 2 ranch outside of Van Horn (pictured in an aerial view)

Figure 2 is also the home base of Jeff Bezos' space exploration company Blue Origin, which was incorporated in 2001

The majority of Jeff and MacKenzie's land holdings are in West Texas, where the clan owns an estimated 400,000 acres in Culberson and Hudspeth counties, east of El Paso.

Most of the Texas land was purchased using limited-liability companies named for famous explorers, according to the Wall Street Journal.

It includes the family's 30,000-acre Figure 2 ranch outside of Van Horn, which serves as a reminder of the summers Jeff spent on his grandparents' ranch growing up.

Figure 2 serves as the home base for Jeff's private space company Blue Origin, which was founded in 2001.

A portion of the duo's net worth comes from Blue Origin, which is valued at somewhere between $1 billion and $28 billion.

It is difficult to determine the specific value of the company because of the lack of details available about the enterprise, and the fact that Jeff is the sole shareholder, Chad Anderson, CEO of venture fund Space Angels, told Bloomberg.

Jeff said in April 2017 that he funds Blue Origin through the sale of 'about $1 billion a year of Amazon stock'.

The Bezos paid $23 million for the former Textile Museum in Kalorama, Washington, DC in 2016

On the east coast, Jeff and MacKenzie own property in Washington, DC, as well.

In 2016 the Bezos dropped $23 million on a former textile museum in the Kalorama neighborhood of Washington, DC.

The 27,000 square foot space was built in 1912 and occupies a spot on the National Register of Historic Places.

Kalorma is known to be an enclave for Washington power-players including the Obamas, who own a $5.3 million home nearby, as do Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner.

Jeff's other big investment in the capital is The Washington Post, which he purchased in August 2013 for $250million. The paper is included in his estimated net worth.

And in Manhattan, the two bought three condos in the Century building at 25 Central Park West in New York City's Upper West Side in 1999 under an LLC called 'Jetima.'

The purchase was from former Sony Music head Tommy Mottola for $7.65 million.

Jeff and MacKenzie share four children, including three sons and a daughter, who they adopted from China. Their oldest child, Preston, turned 18 in March.

MacKenzie is the author of 'The Testing of Luther Albright,' a psychological novel about the challenges facing a Sacramento, California father and his family after an earthquake, which won her the American Book Award in 2006.

In 2014 she launched Bystander Revolution, an anti-bullying organization.

In September, Jeff committed $2 billion through the Bezos Day One Fund to helping homeless families and starting pre-schools for low-income communities. He had solicited ideas on Twitter in 2017 for ways to donate some of his wealth.

Last January, the couple donated $33 million to fund college scholarships for US high schoolers with Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) status, an Obama-era program protecting young immigrants brought to the United States illegally by their parents.

In 2012, they donated $2.5 million to a Washington state campaign to legalize same-sex marriages there.

In November, Amazon picked America's financial and political capitals for massive new offices, branching out from its home base in Seattle with plans to create more than 25,000 jobs in both New York City and just outside Washington, DC.

Wife who helped him create a web giant

Without MacKenzie Bezos, Amazon may never have existed. She is said to have encouraged her husband Jeff to leave the hedge fund where they worked together in the early 1990s to try out his idea for an online bookseller.

A quarter of a century later Amazon has revolutionised internet retailing, and MacKenzie played a huge role. But the 48-year-old novelist has said she sees her fortune as coming from having loving parents and her family, not her wealth.

While she rarely does interviews, Mrs Bezos did once give a book about her husband a one-star review on Amazon because it had 'way too many inaccuracies'.

Mrs Bezos was born MacKenzie Tuttle and studied under Pulitzer Prize-winning author Toni Morrison while at Princeton. She met her future husband when they were working at investment management firm DE Shaw where he was a vice-president and she was a research assistant.

He interviewed her and they hit it off immediately. She asked him out to lunch and three months later they were engaged; three months after that they married.

In an interview with Vogue in 2013 Mrs Bezos said that she loved hearing her future husband's laugh in the office next to hers, which she called 'fabulous' - others have said it sounds terrifying.

The couple have three sons and an adopted a daughter from China and once tried homeschooling, without nannies. A friend said: 'They would think it bad to raise kids who are isolated by their wealth.'"
