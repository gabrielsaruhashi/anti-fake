0,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/07/us/politics/govenment-shutdown-impact-effects.html,"WASHINGTON -- The impact of a partial government shutdown began to ripple across the economy as it stretched into Day 17, with mortgage applications delayed, public companies unable to get approval to raise capital and thousands of Secret Service agents expected to show up for work without pay.

President Trump and congressional Democrats have made little progress in negotiations to end a shutdown that has affected about 800,000 federal workers, many of whom will miss their first paycheck this week, and who owe a combined $249 million in monthly mortgage payments, according to the online real estate firm Zillow.

The shutdown shows no sign of ending soon, with Mr. Trump announcing Monday that he would address the nation on Tuesday evening from the Oval Office to discuss what he called the crisis at the southern border, and the White House saying that he would travel to the border this week as part of his effort to persuade Americans of the need for a wall -- the sticking point in negotiations with Democrats.

The standoff is beginning to inflict pain on Americans, whose lives are affected, in one way or another, by the federal government. It is already the second-longest shutdown in history, behind the one that started in December 1995 and lasted 21 days.

On Monday, the Trump administration moved to soften some of the blow -- and prevent taxpayer outrage -- by directing the Internal Revenue Service to issue tax refunds during the shutdown, reversing previous policy. While the decision will allow taxpayers to get their money, the I.R.S. workers being called back from furlough to process those refunds will not be paid until the shutdown ends.

The effects of a prolonged shutdown have some Wall Street economists predicting a hit to the United States economy. Bank of America Merrill Lynch economists said Monday that it had pushed them to downgrade their estimates for economic growth at the end of 2018 by a 10th of a percent.

The ramifications of a prolonged shutdown are beginning to unnerve those both inside and outside the federal government. Some private companies and charities that serve public employees are searching for ways to cushion the impact.

The effects extend from the president's inner circle, to Wall Street to farm country.

Virtually every employee with the Secret Service involved in investigations, security and the protective division, which protects Mr. Trump and dozens of other current and former government officials and their families, is required to work during the shutdown. And 6,000 of the organization's roughly 7,000 employees will not be paid.

The same is true at the Securities and Exchange Commission, which has come to a standstill with ""only an extremely limited number of staff members available to respond to emergency situations,"" according a shutdown plan posted on the commission's website.

As the effect moves well beyond the nation's capital, craft brewers cannot get approval from the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives for new beer labels. And the Commerce Department has stopped processing requests from auto suppliers and other manufacturing companies seeking an exemption from Mr. Trump's metal tariffs, leaving them uncertain over the price they will need to pay for key materials this year.

Farmers who planned to apply for subsidies to help mitigate the effect of Mr. Trump's trade war must wait to get paid until the Agriculture Department's Farm Service Agency offices reopen. And in neighborhoods across the country, as many as 39,000 federally backed mortgage applications may have already been delayed because of reduced staffing in federal agencies, according to Zillow estimates.

The tax refund decision flies in the face of previous shutdown plans -- and interpretations of federal law -- when the I.R.S. was prohibited from dispensing tax refunds.

The earliest I.R.S. statistics from 2018 show that 18 million individual tax returns had been filed by Feb. 2. By that point, the I.R.S. had issued more than six million refunds, totaling $12.6 billion -- an average refund of $2,035. The agency issued more than $324 billion in refunds for all of last year.

Several nonprofit organizations, including the Federal Law Enforcement Officers Association, are trying to aid Department of Homeland Security workers who need immediate help with a limited pool of cash and other resources, an officer with the group's charitable foundation said. The Navy Federal Credit Union is offering no-interest loans to service members who face the prospect of missed paychecks. USAA, though, has drawn criticism from members of the Coast Guard for offering similar loans that charge interest.

Secret Service agents are growing increasingly anxious and angry about the shutdown, according to several current and former agents. The Secret Service protects 42 people associated with the Trump White House, 11 more than were given details during the Obama administration. In August 2017, the agency's new director, Randolph D. Alles, told an interviewer that the sprawling Trump entourage was putting unprecedented strains on his agents, in terms of staffing and budgeting.

""They are asking you to put your life on the line and not paying you -- it's ridiculous,"" said Donald Mihalek, 49, a 20-year Secret Service veteran whose own retirement paperwork has yet to be processed because of the shutdown.

""Morale is a serious issue,"" said Mr. Mihalek, who served on the presidential detail during George W. Bush's and Barack Obama's administrations. ""This is an incredibly stressful job that requires your full attention, and if you are standing there thinking about your mortgage, or your credit card bills, or the fact that you are burning through your savings, you are distracted, you not able to give 100 percent.""

Financial enforcement is also suffering. The S.E.C. has about 4,400 full-time employees and during the shutdown is operating with just a few hundred -- most of those tasked ""to protect life or property.""

The constrained operations means pending investigations in securities violations have ground to a halt, and there is no one reviewing applications for company stock offerings to raise cash or consider merger and acquisition filings.

Defense and corporate lawyers said meetings with potential witnesses in pending investigations have been canceled, and some companies seeking to raise cash through a stock offering are having to bide their time. Staff lawyers at the S.E.C. are largely prohibited from responding to emails seeking information or guidance.

In the past, the S.E.C. had managed to keep operating during government shutdowns by shifting around money in its budget. But the commission, which has been operating under a hiring freeze for more than a year, is not able to do that this time.

""When I was there, we always had money to be able to operate for a certain period of time,"" said Andrew M. Calamari, a lawyer with Finn Dixon & Herling in Connecticut, who stepped down as the director of the S.E.C.'s New York office in October 2017. ""I was there for 17 years, and in my time, we had several shutdowns, and in each case, we continued to operate.""

The S.E.C. said in a statement that staff ""continues to monitor the asset management space, track market activity and watch for systems issues or other events that could disrupt the fair and orderly operation of the securities markets.""

The agency also said it had advised financial filers to request expedited action before the shutdown.

But corporate America will now have to wait for the government to reopen in order to move ahead with things like initial public offerings and pending corporate mergers that need approvals from regulators.

""I have a client in registration right now for an M.&A. deal, and nothing is going on,"" said Marc Leaf, a partner at Drinker Biddle & Reath in New York who used to work for the S.E.C. as an adviser to a commissioner.

Mr. Leaf also said so-called secondary stock offerings -- which companies often rely on to raise cash -- are paused. A dearth of those deals could create financial hardships for midsize public companies that have fewer financial resources to draw upon.

""If this it is not solved and goes on for weeks, there will be companies who are really slowed down in the public offering process,"" Mr. Leaf said. ""There is a lot of basic blocking and tackling that can't get done, and that will impact a number of issuers.""

Deutsche Bank economists warned on Monday that the shutdown could also affect the Federal Reserve's interest rate decisions by delaying the release of key economic data, like new home sales and durable goods orders. That delay ""would significantly impair"" economic forecasters' ability to gauge growth, the economists wrote, and cloud decision-making for Fed officials who have emphasized ""data dependence"" in their policy decisions.

The biggest and most far-reaching effect of the shutdown looms on Feb. 1. Trump administration officials say that funding for the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, or SNAP, which provides food benefits for about 40 million people, will run out of cash by the end of the month. The Agriculture Department has not made it clear how long it will be able to fund the program, which costs about $4.7 billion a month, but estimates by anti-hunger groups put the department's reserves at $3 billion to $5 billion, meaning funding is more likely to completely run out in February or March.

Other food assistance programs are facing a more immediate cash crunch. The Special Supplemental Nutrition Program for Women, Infants and Children, known as WIC, has already been cut off, with state funds filling the gap as the shutdown drags on. WIC provides aid to an additional seven million low-income Americans who are considered to be at ""nutritional risk.""",1034931151
1,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/18/us/politics/deep-state-trump-classified-information.html,"WASHINGTON -- Call it the deep-state defense.

After the Pentagon stripped an official's security clearance for reading a top-secret paper in public, his allies said he was ""caught in the web of the deep state.""

When federal agents raided the home of a government contractor suspected of taking classified documents, his supporters denounced the ""deep state F.B.I.""

And when a conservative conspiracy theorist rejected a plea deal with the special counsel, he claimed he was targeted because he dared ""to oppose the deep state.""

President Trump has long tried to explain away his legal troubles as the work of a ""deep state"" of Obama supporters entrenched in the law-enforcement and national-security bureaucracies who are just out to get him. Now junior officials and others accused of wrongdoing are making the case that the same purported forces are illegitimately targeting them, too.

The defenses have frustrated some current and former government officials -- including at the White House -- who say the accused are trying obscure their responsibility for mishandling classified information.

Adam Lovinger, a Pentagon analyst, was one of the first to wrap himself in the deep state defense, and he appealed the loss of his security clearance in a closed hearing last week. His lawyer, Sean Bigley, has become one of the architects of the strategy.

""If someone had come to me a couple years and started talking about the deep state, I would have rolled my eyes and said, 'You are in tinfoil-hat territory,'"" Mr. Bigley said. ""But I have now represented well over a dozen people who have been targeted for political reasons.""

A Striking Coincidence?

Alleging misconduct by law enforcement has long been a standard defense tactic, especially in white-collar cases, but the political cast of deep-state-style claims is new, said Samuel Buell, a Duke law professor and former federal prosecutor. He said it seemed to be aimed at getting conservative media attention in the hope that Mr. Trump will come across their case and intervene.

""From the practitioner standpoint, this is not going to appeal to the judge,"" he said. ""You are playing to a different audience -- the one with the pardon power.""

Indeed, Mr. Lovinger has become a cause célèbre on the right. His lawyer has appeared on Fox Business and Sean Hannity's radio program to argue that bureaucrats have weaponized the security clearance process against government workers who are Trump supporters. Conservative media outlets like The Daily Caller, The Washington Free Beacon and Breitbart regularly cover him.

The case traces to a September 2016 Hawaiian Airlines flight from New York to Honolulu during which Mr. Lovinger reviewed a document with labels showing it contained highly classified information. Unbeknown to Mr. Lovinger, he was sitting next to a naval intelligence officer. When the plane landed, the officer immediately reported the security breach.

By the time Mr. Lovinger joined the staff of the National Security Council five months later under President Trump, his troubles were mounting. He faced additional investigations into allegations that he had orchestrated the leak of information to a reporter and improperly increased the security clearance of a Pentagon contractor, according to a summary of the inquiry.

In May 2017, Mr. Lovinger's own clearance was suspended, and he was escorted out of the Eisenhower Executive Office Building, Mr. Bigley said.

Determined to win it back, Mr. Lovinger fashioned himself a victim of Democratic-supporting national security officials. ""Security clearances are being weaponized against the White House by hostile career bureaucrats, thwarting the president's agenda by holding up or blocking appointees,"" Mr. Bigley, his lawyer, wrote in a Wall Street Journal Op-Ed this spring.

Mr. Bigley disputes the Pentagon's charges, saying the document on the plane was improperly marked and contained no real top-secret information and that his client leaked to no one. As for the dispute over the contractor's clearance, Mr. Bigley insisted that his client followed procedure.

The real motive for the scrutiny, Mr. Bigley said, stemmed from complaints Mr. Lovinger made in 2016 about lucrative Pentagon contracts awarded to outside consultants, including at the Office of Net Assessment, the Pentagon's strategy group where he worked.

Their defense took on its deep-state tinge over the summer after an academic named Stefan Halper, the recipient of one of the contracts Mr. Lovinger had questioned, was identified as an F.B.I. informant who sought information from Trump associates during the early stages of the investigation into ties between the campaign and Russia.

As Mr. Trump and conservative media began to portray Mr. Halper as a deep-state spy inside the Trump campaign, labeling it Spygate, Mr. Bigley amplified his deep-state defense. Though Mr. Lovinger had not known about Mr. Halper's work for the F.B.I., he had complained about his Pentagon contract.

""Mr. Lovinger was targeted because he blew the whistle on Stefan Halper and a Clinton crony getting suspicious defense contracts,"" said Tom Fitton of the conservative watchdog group Judicial Watch, which has sued for files about the case. ""It is disturbing that the Defense Department may now be implicated in Spygate targeting of President Trump.""

But there is no evidence Mr. Lovinger's clearance was revoked for political reasons, said Robert O. Work, the deputy secretary of defense in both the Obama and Trump administrations, asserting the officials who oversaw Mr. Lovinger were fiercely apolitical. ""It is quite surprising to me that someone would think this is some sort of deep state,"" Mr. Work said.

Mr. Lovinger has a found champion in Representative Louie Gohmert, Republican of Texas, who said this year without evidence that he believed the Justice Department was ""spying"" on him for his criticism of the Russia inquiry. Mr. Gohmert has introduced a bill, the Adam S. Lovinger Whistleblower Reprisal Act of 2018, aimed at giving additional protections to government employees who report wrongdoing.

A Spreading Strategy

While Mr. Lovinger may have seized on the defense early, it is spreading. Jerome Corsi, who recently published a book called ""Killing the Deep State,"" employed it as he began publicly discussing his potential plea deal last month with the special counsel overseeing the Russia investigation, Robert S. Mueller III.

In November, Mr. Corsi decided against agreeing to plead guilty to lying to Mr. Mueller's investigators, who have questioned him about whether he had advance knowledge of WikiLeaks' plans to publish stolen Democratic emails during the 2016 campaign.

Mr. Corsi has insisted he simply misremembered events and portrayed himself a victim of Mr. Trump's purported enemies in law enforcement and national security.

""I guess I am going to have to go to prison for the rest of my life because I dare to oppose the deep state,"" Mr. Corsi said.

Others targeted by Mr. Mueller have taken up the mantle. George Papadopoulos, the Trump campaign adviser who served two weeks in prison for lying to investigators, is working on his own book: ""Deep State Target.""

Last month, F.B.I. agents searched the home of Dennis N. Cain, the former bureau contractor, as part of a counterintelligence investigation, suggesting they had information that Mr. Cain was illegally storing copies of classified bureau documents there.

Mr. Cain had provided copies of the F.B.I. files to the Justice Department inspector general as part of a whistle-blower complaint. The documents related to the Clinton Foundation and Uranium One, a Canadian mining company whose sale in 2013 to the Russian state-owned nuclear power corporation was subject to American approval because the nuclear fuel is considered a strategic asset.

The State Department under Hillary Clinton approved the sale, and a conspiracy theory has developed that she signed off because a businessman who once owned much of the company had made a large donation to her foundation years earlier. There is no evidence Mrs. Clinton played any personal role in approving the deal, but the theory has gained credence in conservative circles.

After The Daily Caller first reported the raid on Mr. Cain, conservative websites piled on, arguing that it showed a deep-state cabal in control of the F.B.I. Donald Trump Jr. linked on Twitter to another Daily Caller story about the raid. And Mr. Cain joined in last week: ""So I blow the whistle on the FBI, get raided by the same FBI, and now they want to keep the FBI's reasons secret?"" he wrote in a since-deleted Twitter post. ""Do we now live in a secret police state? Feels a little like '1984.'""

A reporter for The Daily Caller wrote in an email last week sent to congressional aides, right-wing figures and others that prosecutors were engaged in a ""cover-up for the F.B.I."" The reporter, Richard Pollock, added: ""Eventually, justice will be done.""

The F.B.I. declined to comment.

The inspector general delivered the documents to the congressional intelligence committees, a person familiar with the case said. The Senate Intelligence Committee received documents they believed to be from Mr. Cain but deemed them meaningless, according to a committee official. The committee has decided not to interview Mr. Cain; Republicans and Democrats on the panel had already concluded they had no compelling reason to scrutinize the uranium deal.

Still, Senator Chuck Grassley, Republican of Iowa and chairman of the Judiciary Committee, has demanded that the inspector general provide him copies of Mr. Cain's documents and asked the F.B.I. about the raid.

And some organizations, including left-leaning groups, have criticized the raid, saying Mr. Cain should have enjoyed whistle-blower protections. Mr. Cain and his lawyer say they followed federal whistle-blower rules.

But by bringing the documents home, Mr. Cain violated those rules and lost his legal protections, experts said. ""The rules must be followed,"" said Mark S. Zaid, a national security lawyer who has represented whistle-blowers. ""It is a very simple and straightforward concept.""",1021179412
2,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/14/magazine/all-the-presidents-memes.html,"On the 12th day of the federal government shutdown, the 45th president of the United States of America posted a meme on his Instagram account: an image of his half-glowering, half-smirking visage, hovering gigantically above the Southwestern desert, dwarfing the picture's centerpiece -- a rendering of his signature campaign promise -- and, in a familiar font, some explanatory text: ""The Wall Is Coming."" It's an image that makes you think, That's from HBO's hit series ""Game of Thrones"" -- sort of, and then makes you think about the unique privileges and burdens of living in this moment in history.

There are so many unusual aspects of Donald Trump's presidency that his willingness to communicate with the public through internet memes is often overshadowed. Typically, he retweets images made by his most enthusiastic backers -- in November he shared one of the Clintons, Barack Obama, Huma Abedin, Robert Mueller, his own deputy attorney general Rod Rosenstein and others, all locked up in a prison cell together -- but the wall meme appears to be a White House original. It is also the second ""Game of Thrones"" meme the president has shared in the last two months. He does this sort of thing so often that the Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, recently felt compelled to tweet, like an exasperated high school teacher, ""Enough with the memes.""

It's impossible to overstate how peculiar it is that the most powerful man in the world, who will turn 73 in June, posts memes. It's a behavior more often associated with youth, irreverence and a surfeit of free time -- though certainly plenty of old, aggrieved people have picked up the habit in recent years. In 2016, the Trump campaign united message-board trolls and Facebook boomers, and together they disseminated so many memes that some of them began to believe -- both jokingly and not -- that their ""meme magic"" had helped Trump win the election.

In current usage, ""meme"" refers most often to an image with text overlay, designed for distribution online. They're like the bumper stickers of the digital realm, in that any one concept can be endlessly remixed to convey just about any sort of sentiment (Calvin can pee on anything). What began more than a decade ago as a fun way to imagine how cats might talk has evolved into a surprisingly fertile mode of political communication. The online database Know Your Meme has confirmed the existence of some 4,066 successful memes in the wild -- including newcomers like Big Chungus, a fake series of video games starring an obese rabbit, and classics like Doge, which featured a shiba inu speaking broken English. The actual number is certainly much higher.

You might find this very silly, and you wouldn't be wrong. But keep in mind: The president posts them.

All of this represents a long fall from the meme's origins. The word was coined by the British ethologist Richard Dawkins in his 1976 book, ""The Selfish Gene,"" as a way to conceptualize the transmission of culture in biological terms. For Dawkins, a meme, shortened from the Greek mimeme -- ""an imitated thing"" -- was a unit of culture, a building block of our mental architecture. ""Just as genes propagate themselves in the gene pool by leaping from body to body via sperms or eggs,"" Dawkins wrote, ""memes propagate themselves in the meme pool by leaping from brain to brain."" They could be as small and short-lived as a tune or catchphrase, he explained, or as large and consequential as ""God"" and ""eternal damnation.""

Genes, Dawkins argued, do not aim to propagate a species; they seek only to propagate themselves. Memes, he believed, were similarly selfish. Dawkins spends most of his chapter on memetics fixating on religion, and because he has since become such an aggressively outspoken atheist, reading the book today it is easy to get the sense that he considers religion almost parasitic. The concept of ""God,"" he figured, endures because it offers a psychological salve to people, while ""eternal damnation"" survives because it is useful as a means of social control. Thus both live on, copied from generation to generation, latching on to humanity and perpetuating themselves too effectively to be got rid of. ""Selection favors memes that exploit their cultural environment to their own advantage,"" Dawkins wrote.

Ideas, in this view, have lives of their own, and the environment in which they struggle for survival is the human mind -- our limited processing power means that only the toughest will persevere. ""If a meme is to dominate the attention of a human brain,"" Dawkins wrote, ""it must do so at the expense of 'rival' memes."" He conceded that a meme would also have to compete for airtime on the radio or TV, billboard space, column inches and book pages. But, writing back in the 1970s, he had no reason to consider what would happen if those scarcity conditions vanished. If they did, you would find yourself in a terrifyingly fecund primordial soup in which all sorts of ideas could develop, mutate, cross-pollinate, do battle, die off and be reborn. You would find yourself, well, online.

And while this primordial soup has brought forth many novel concepts, and resuscitated some old, corrosive beliefs, the things we call ""memes"" today are largely just joke formats -- mechanisms for the efficient production of humor. They develop less like new ideas and more like algal blooms, spreading until they block out the sun and consume all the oxygen, before dying out naturally (people get sick of them) or getting hit with bleach (explainer journalists write about them). Individually, these memes leave little mark on our culture. Worse than being forgettable, they become, within a year or two, embarrassing to think back on for even one second.

But taken as a whole, this swarm of cultural mayflies represents a meaningful shift in our culture. Joke-making, a sometimes cruel enterprise, has been mechanized and democratized. Humor now emerges from the ether, authorless or, more accurate, authored and improved upon by everyone. Jokes are communal now, and constant. Online, everything that happens all day -- in politics, in culture, in the news -- is rapidly repurposed for laughs, by everyone, all at once.

For the most part, this is harmless. After all, what could possibly go wrong in a culture where all anyone wants is to be perpetually amused?

Before Trump's border wall was the cause of a government shutdown, it was a mnemonic device -- less a policy proposal than a string tied around the finger. According to a recent article in The Times, the wall was a ""memory trick for an undisciplined candidate."" Trump's advisers Sam Nunberg and Roger Stone knew that getting tough on immigration would play well to a right-wing audience, but they also knew the man they were dealing with. He has a mind for the tactile, so they gave him something gigantic to hang onto: an 1,800-mile-long slab of concrete.

But Trump's talking points were never just talking points. They were more like bits. His campaign rallies were rambling, unscripted affairs, almost like an open-mic comedy set: Not a fearsome Nuremberg rally, but an aging showman road-testing material, seeing what caught the audience's attention. Early on, his speeches were ""all over the place,"" the NBC reporter Katy Tur told ""Frontline,"" but as time passed, ""he started to really hone his message, and he started to remember what lines worked."" In the same episode, the writer Marc Fisher said Trump told him that he would simply wait to see the red lights on the TV cameras in the press box turn on, indicating he was live, and then he would say ""whatever it took to keep the red light on.""

The border wall kept the lights on. At a 2016 rally in Burlington, Vt., Trump mentioned the wall to tremendous, wonderful applause, then paused and asked his audience, ""And who's gonna pay for the wall?"" The crowd roared back, ""MEXICO!"" They -- he and his crowd -- did this two more times together, then Trump laughed. ""I've never done it before, I swear,"" he said, throwing his arms up as if surprised it had worked. ""That was pretty cool. We're gonna have to use that.""

This incentive structure, in which an easily distracted person says a bunch of stuff he kind of means to an assembled audience, slowly learning what generates a reaction and what doesn't, is familiar: It's like posting online. This is the process that nudged the wall ever closer to reality, despite the fact that it was only ever supposed to be a metaphor, a shorthand, a catchphrase. It is an idea with no real owner or creator, passed from person to person, from lectern to grandstand to TV and Twitter and back again, copying itself and growing and mutating until it became big, beautiful and tipped with spikes forged from American steel. The border wall is, in the truest sense, a meme: an idea that persists not because it will benefit us but simply because it thrives in our environment. It was so effective at doing whatever it did that it couldn't be contained, spilling out of the president's brain and spreading throughout our entire body politic, cooling and hardening like bacon grease, until it finally brought everything to a standstill. And I hate to admit it, but that is a little funny.",1039910146
3,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/28/opinion/do-women-want-to-have-a-mimosa-with-hillary.html,"Gail Collins responded to some of the thousand-plus comments she received on her Sunday Review cover story ""Behind Hillary Clinton's Mask.""

Q: I mean this not as a criticism, but a neutral observation: This piece helped me understand those people who voted for George W. Bush because he seemed like the kind of guy they'd like to have a beer with. Gail is describing a candidate with whom secure middle-aged and senior women would like to have a mimosa ...

I think Hillary deserves respect for what she's done, and the G.O.P.'s attacks on her are horrifying. But my partner and I also are too tied up with student debt to buy a house and still struggling after the 2008 financial crisis, for which no one was held truly accountable. As a young feminist, I'm grateful for the work of women in the past, but I'm looking forward to my hypothetical kids' future, hoping my partner and I can both work slightly fewer hours to raise them and not have to worry about the cost of their college while we're still paying for our own. And as much as I respect Hillary, no one urging me to vote for her seems to understand my concerns here and now. This is the problem with puff pieces like this, even as I understand why people want to vote for a candidate like them, even if they'll never actually have a beer or mimosa with them.

-- Jessie, USA

Gail: Jessie, I really like your mimosa line. You're absolutely right that the election will be decided by people like you who are trying to cope with life in the real world. I think you may underestimate how much Clinton cares about those issues, too. She's certainly always been obsessed with things like early childhood education and she's talked a lot about college debt.

And I do appreciate your impatience with older women who see this moment in terms of the first-woman thing. But have some patience -- we're just enjoying the moment. We aren't going to spend the next three months talking about the days when we couldn't get credit cards.

Q. ""How is it possible that we still don't really know the most famous woman in America?""

The answer is really quite simple: We see things not as they are but as we are.

As I've changed over the years, my view of Hillary Clinton has changed, too.

I'm 45, which means that Bill Clinton's first term were my ""Bernie years."" If politics has a ""stages of grief,"" I've been through that cycle a couple of times now: the hope that turns to disillusionment, the apathy that eventually, if we're lucky, flares into the energy of anger, and then to action.

There are a lot of really angry and sad Sanders supporters out there, and the D.N.C. should've done better. I hope their hurt will heal so they don't have to spend as long in apathy as I did. I hope they'll vote their conscience, and register a dozen new voters, too.

These days, my stage is acceptance. I don't imagine Hillary Clinton to be any more or less honest than I myself am. I don't expect her to mirror me perfectly: I'm pretty imperfect myself. I believe she has ambitions, makes compromises, has values she often fails to live up to, just like me. ...

I think she's going to be a really good president.

-- Shnnn, Brooklyn, N.Y.

Gail: When people give their hearts to a candidate, it's often hard to let go. To be honest, some of the Hillary people in 2008 were more angry and resistant of Obama than the average Bernie supporter is now. You seem to have found a good road forward.

Q. I used to think that a woman would be president before a black man. But over the years and especially since I have had a daughter who is doing remarkable things I have learned that misogyny and discrimination against women is even more deeply ingrained in our society/civilization than racial hatred ...

-- Richard Saunders, Colorado

Gail: Back in the day, we used to say that a feminist was a male conservative who had just fathered twin girls. I don't mean to suggest you were a conservative before your daughter was born, but your letter is a good reminder of how many men see the whole gender equality thing differently once they're imagining a future for their child.

Q: One of the most important reasons to elect Hillary Clinton is to put down Donald Trump, and put him down hard! Trump is the biggest threat to this country that I've experienced in my 84 years on the planet. That includes the Great Depression, World War II, the Cold War, McCarthyism, Richard Nixon, the Cuban Missile Crisis, the assassination of J.F.K. and Martin Luther King, the presidency of George W. Bush, the current problem with terrorism and every other bad thing this country has gone through in the 20th and 21st centuries.

-- Joan Wheeler, New Orleans

Gail: Well, Joan, I'm not sure I agree with you about World War II. But you have definitely driven your point home.

Q: Unless you've been in a room where a man looks around and says, ""All these women here and nobody made coffee?"" you will not understand why women of my generation love Hillary.

-- LAJ, Rochester, N.Y.

Gail: I hear you. Though I do appreciate that to some younger women, our stories sound like tales of how back when we were their age, we had to walk five miles to school in the snow with no boots.

Q. It is possible to have two things going on at the same time: She has overcome a lot of sexism and unfair criticism and she has been dishonest and has operated in a bullying and back-room dealing way that is at odds with the portrayal of her as some sort of savior for women and liberals.

She is a poor choice for first woman president. I wonder whether the conflict and criticism that she will draw -- partly because of irrational hatred and sexism but partly because she has brought it on herself -- will set women back. ...

It is astonishing that so many are willing to bury their heads in the sand about these flaws because she is a woman.

-- Hdb, Tennessee

Gail: Without signing on to your entire critique, I do agree it would have been great if the first woman major party candidate was somebody fresh, and new and charismatic like Barack Obama. But to be honest, I don't think we're quite at a point yet where a relatively untested, unknown female candidate could take that big leap. Maybe after November ...

Q: I know it is important to women that she is a woman who is breaking the glass ceiling. I get that.

I am supporting a candidate who is a dedicated public servant of unusual intelligence and ability. Perfect? No, but we aren't electing a deity, just another human being. When I saw her testify in front of Gowdy and the rest of the Bengazi committee it was clear that she was tough enough to be president. She won my vote that day because she could clearly hold her own in a room full of testosterone intoxicated adversaries. It was a spectacular presentation of grit, strength and clarity.

4,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/18/magazine/27-million-potential-hispanic-votes-but-what-will-they-really-add-up-to.html,"Two weeks after Hillary Clinton accepted the Democratic presidential nomination in Philadelphia, beaming through a hail of gigantic balloons, her campaign's ""Latinos con Hillary"" program began in five cities in Virginia. One of the kickoff parties took place at Todos Supermarket in Prince William County, in a modest white room where about 40 people gathered around three tables draped in cheap blue cloth to hear a speech by Clinton's national Latino-vote director, Lorella Praeli. When she was 2, Praeli, now 28, lost one of her legs in a car accident, but with her crutches, she commanded the room more adroitly than any of the speakers who preceded her, moving among the tables as she rallied her troops. Though the party was advertised on Facebook, most of the men and women in attendance were seasoned Democratic politicians, staff members and volunteers.

""I'm not here to make it pretty,"" Praeli said. ""The work ahead of us, the task and challenge ahead of us for the next what -- 96 days -- is huge."" She ticked through the efforts needed to register and turn out Latinos: knocking on doors, hosting phone-bank parties, convincing friends, haunting markets, teaching Spanish-speakers the how and the when and the where of voting. In her speech, the job sounded herculean. Near the end of her pitch, she asked everyone to stand and feel the energy in the room while they said, in Spanish, ""We will be the difference.""

""I want you to say it and to believe it,"" Praeli instructed. ""I want you to say it and to commit yourself."" She smiled, but these were marching orders. ""If we don't believe it, other people won't believe,"" Praeli said in Spanish. ""If we don't believe it in this room, we won't be the difference in November.""

Latinos have been hearing that they will be the difference for decades. In Spanish-language media this year, the rhetoric around the election has often gone so far as to imply that Latinos will decide the result on their own. Telemundo's election coverage runs under the slogan ""Yo Decido,"" ""I Decide."" The Univision news anchor Jorge Ramos told The Times last year that ""the new rule in American politics is that no one can make it to the White House without the Hispanic vote.""

It's true enough that 800,000 Latinos turn 18 every year, and both parties burn millions of dollars trying to woo Hispanic voters. This year, 27 million will be eligible to vote. But the idea of a fearsome Latino political power remains more myth than reality. Journalists have been writing about the so-called ""sleeping giant"" of Hispanic voters since at least the 1970s, but the fact is that voter turnout among Latinos remains dismal. It can run almost 20 percentage points lower than that of African-Americans and non-Hispanic whites. Exactly the same percentage of eligible Latinos, 48 percent, showed up for Romney versus Obama in 2012 as turned out for Bush versus Dukakis in 1988. While the raw number of Latino ballots cast has tripled since 1998, so has the number of Latino citizens who don't vote. Only once in the past 28 years, during the 1992 match among George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton and Ross Perot that spurred a jump in overall turnout, has Latino turnout exceeded 50 percent. More often than not, ""Yo Decido"" to stay home.

This year, the new spin on the old dream is that Donald Trump will finally shake the giant awake. He opened his campaign last summer by calling Mexican immigrants ""rapists,"" has repeatedly proclaimed that he will build a wall between Mexico and the United States and, until recently, has made the deportation of 11 million undocumented immigrants a cornerstone of his platform. As early as September 2015, Javier Palomarez, the president and chief executive of the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, told Politico: ""I think the greatest thing to ever happen to the Hispanic electorate is a gentleman named Donald Trump. He has crystallized the angst and anger of the Hispanic community."" He added, ""I think we can all rest assured that Hispanics can turn out in record numbers.""

Perhaps. But achieving record turnout for a demographic with a lackluster voting history isn't so simple as watching them take themselves to the polls. In June, Mi Familia Vota and the National Council of La Raza, two nonprofit groups devoted to organizing Latinos, warned that they needed more cash to match their voter registration numbers from 2012. In July, the Pew Research Center noted that ""Hispanic voters lag all registered voters on several measures of engagement"" -- they aren't paying attention to election news as closely as other citizens and they aren't thinking about the election as much. At a conference on the Hispanic vote held in New York City in January, the big unanswered question was ""Why have Latinos never really turned out in force?""

Looking for answers, I spent six months interviewing scores of Latinos in Virginia, a battleground state where the Latino share of the population has more than tripled since 1990. I met with Latino Catholics, Pentecostals and Mormons, with legal residents, citizens and undocumented immigrants. I frequented a church and a community center, soccer fields and a dance club. I lurked around Republican and Democratic events and a skateboard park. I interviewed custodians and construction workers, lawyers and real estate agents, restaurant owners and community organizers, college students and political staffers. In all, I spoke with more than 100 Virginians of various ethnic backgrounds.

For all the energy that activists, especially on the Democratic side, have put into turning out the Latino vote, I met strikingly few Latinos outside the upper-middle class who talked about voting as if it were something they did regularly. The exceptions tended to be people like Lucía Rodriguez, 61, who cleans houses and has voted regularly for more than a decade -- even in 2008 after she and her husband, a custodian, saw all their savings vanish in the mortgage crisis. For years afterward, they scrambled to keep their family afloat, working every available hour. Yet she kept on voting. Why? ""It's a civic duty,"" she said. Rodriguez explained that in Bolivia, where she had been an accountant, she learned the habit of voting because nonvoters could be penalized with fines. In her Mormon church in the United States, she was surrounded by friends who voted. To pass her citizenship test, she had to study American government and learn English. Her voting behavior entailed years of effort and experience. Through all my conversations, I began to fear that the real roots of political engagement, which lie not in quadrennial outreach programs but around dinner tables and in churches and classrooms, are far more absent from Latino life in America than most people understand.

""A person on the fence needs to be activated to turn into a voter,"" Marvin Figueroa, 30, said one humid Friday in July as he stood before a crowd of white-collar professionals at a ""Happy Hour for Hillary."" These borderline voters, he said, often need ""13 touches"" -- calls, door knocks, texts, etc. -- before they would turn out. Figueroa is Clinton's political director for Virginia. His spreadsheets contain not only Latinos but also African-Americans, millennials and Muslims: any constituent group that might be pulled into a pro-Clinton coali­tion. This evening, inside the Arlington home of a defense contractor who turned Democrat after the Tea Party swept into Congress in 2010, the audience was mostly female, mostly Caucasian and only marginally Latino. The doors to the screened-in porch were open; the air-conditioning was off; the margarita machine was on. The Spanish speakers blended into the crowd.

Statistically, the Latinos most likely to cast ballots are almost identical to other reliable American voters. They are over 40. They've lived in the United States for at least 20 years. They are Puerto Ricans and Cuban-Americans with long cultural histories of citizenship. They are college graduates.

The Latinos least likely to vote represent a different demographic slice altogether. They are under 30, single and Mexican-American. Their families earn less than $50,000 a year. They may not have completed high school.

Data capsules like these suggest that the Latino vote is simply hamstrung by the same factors that impede the Election Day turnout of all Americans: poverty, youth, lack of schooling. Political scientists showed long ago that voting goes hand in glove with affluence and education. Generally speaking, the wealthier you are, the more degrees you earn, the more likely you are to turn out. But if these were the only relevant factors, Latino voting would most likely rise naturally over time as more Latinos enrolled in college and as the age of the average American-born Latino increased. (In 2012 their average age was 18.)

Causality unravels, however, when you start picking at the numbers. Take income, for example. While nearly a quarter of Latinos live in poverty, as a group they are slightly better off than African-Americans. Yet in 2012, African-Americans had the highest turnout rates in the nation. They, not Latinos, have arguably been the decisive bloc in our last two presidential contests and in this year's Democratic primary. So poverty alone can't explain the weak Hispanic vote.

Youth and education also prove to be red herrings. Hispanics are America's youngest and least-educated major racial or ethnic group. Nearly a third of foreign-born Latinos never reached ninth grade. Some have never had a day of schooling in their lives. But if age and learning were the decisive catalysts, we would expect to find the highest voter turnout among Asian-Americans, who are our second-oldest and best-educated group. More than half of Asian-Americans hold bachelors degrees. Yet Asian-Americans tend to vote at even lower rates than Latinos. In 2012, 53 percent of their eligible voters did not go to the polls.

So what do Asians and Hispanics, two vastly different groups in terms of age, education and culture, have in common? It's obvious once you look for it: For the past 30 years, most of America's immigrants have arrived from Asia and Latin America. Both groups struggle with English. Roughly a third of Hispanic adults and a 10th of Hispanic children say that they cannot speak English ""very well."" Among Asians, the numbers are similar.

The American political system once efficiently trained immigrants in how to pull electoral levers. For all their flaws, urban political machines like Tammany Hall did an extraordinary job of recruiting poor, undereducated Irish and Italian immigrants, then shepherding their political incorporation into local and national affairs. But immigrants from Latin America and Asia were largely excluded from the old machines, both by laws limiting their naturalization and enfranchisement and by racism. The Voting Rights Act of 1965 was not extended to Hispanics and Asians until 1975. By then most of the urban machines had been dismantled, and the leading edge of our current wave of Asian and Hispanic immigrants began unpacking their bags in Los Angeles, San Francisco, New York, Atlanta and Washington.

The immigrants from Latin America immediately found themselves lumped together under the label ""Hispanic,"" even if they spoke Portuguese or an indigenous language, even if they had no ancestral link to Spain. It's tough to galvanize such a heterogeneous group. The panethnic, multilingual category of ""Hispanic"" is a uniquely American invention, created by congressional legislation in the 1970s. In her book ""Making Hispanics,"" G. Cristina Mora shows how bureaucrats, media executives and political activists built the notion to combine Mexican-Americans, Cuban-Americans, Puerto Ricans and others in census counts and federal programs. The term was always deliberately ambiguous, Mora notes, so that it could accommodate varied origin stories. There are Hispanics who swam the Rio Grande hoping for a living wage, Hispanics who flew business class to enroll in Ivy League schools, Hispanics who disembarked as Cold Warriors in Florida. There are even Hispanics whose families owned land in the Southwest before it was ever part of the United States. (These ""Hispanics"" like to joke that they didn't cross the border; the border crossed them.) Unlike African-Americans, most of whom can trace a connection to slavery, Latinos have no single common history. Trump, Figueroa once told me, ""makes us more Latino"": His threats and insults provoke a unifying sense of indignation.

Sifting thorough the numbers and this complicated history makes the 52 percent of nonvoting Latinos look rather different. The problem isn't their youth, poverty or lack of education. The problem is that when you're poor, young or undereducated, it takes more effort to overcome your immigrant family's low levels of political socialization. For first-generation Americans, politics is often just one more cultural expression that they must decipher on their own. It's rarely a priority. The immigrant parents that I spoke with swam rivers and boarded airplanes to escape violence, to earn money, to educate their children. Learning to play American politics was never on the agenda.

In Virginia, I found that serious political talk was so rare among the American-born children of Spanish-speaking immigrants that they would often ask me questions like ""What is the Tea Party?"" and ""Who is my mayor?"" Alicio Castañeda, a student at George Mason University whose parents are from Mexico, told me that after we had lunch in April, he began reading more news articles and researching deeper into the presidential candidates. He voted on Super Tuesday. His love for the soccer team Manchester United had led him to The Guardian newspaper, which reminded him that it was a big day in America. ""I've always been personally interested in politics,"" he told me, ""but I haven't had anyone to talk to about it.""

Until the 1960s, high schools often taught courses on democracy, civics and government. At the turn of the 21st century, most teenagers received one such class, or none. This drought in civics hurts all Americans, but for Latinos it's devastating. Several studies have found that merely hearing parents chat about politics or watching them cast a ballot improves the odds that a child will later vote as an adult. Yet a national survey directed by Mark Hugo Lopez in 2002 found that young Latinos were the least likely to have discussed politics with their parents. They were also the most likely to believe that voting is ""difficult.""

On Super Tuesday, I glimpsed what was missing among so many of the Latino families I spoke with when I met Kat Heller, a non-Hispanic mother, exiting a polling station with two children. Growing up in Minnesota, Heller had always tagged along with her parents when they voted. Once, when she was about 12, her father took her to watch the ballots being counted. ""I just remember feeling it was really exciting,"" she told me. ""It was seeing history happening. Everyone was waiting breathlessly."" Inside the voting booth on Super Tuesday, Heller put her 3-year-old son on her hip and asked him: ""Which do you think we should vote for?"" His 13 touches had already begun.

Absent Tammany Hall and civics in schools, the work of turning ""new Americans"" into voters often falls to volunteers like Keisy Chavez. Several weekends this summer, Chavez, 45, has stood outside of Todos Supermarket and other locations in Northern Virginia, clipboard in hand, fishing for Latinos who haven't registered to vote. On the Saturday morning that I joined her, she looked surprisingly stylish for the occasion: gold-toned sandals, brilliant white capri pants, fiery nails and a bright orange T-shirt blazoned with the words ""New Virginia Majority."" You could not engineer a better volunteer than Chavez to help turn out the Latino vote. Political appeals, social scientists have found, work best when delivered by co-ethnics. Chavez meets other requirements as well: She's bilingual, outgoing and frank.

A good rate for voter registration is two new registrations an hour. Chavez and her colleague hit the mark with four new registrations between them (the colleague waited for Chavez every time someone's dominant language was Spanish). Still, most passers-by ignored them. One 20-something with jet black hair who did stop told Chavez, in Spanish, that he was a citizen but not registered. She tried to reel him in.

""O.K.,"" she responded with a smile, ""what is the problem?""

He said that he would come back to register next week, that she should give him her phone number.

""What happens if you don't come next week?"" she asked him.

""I promise you.""

""You know what happens,"" she said. ""If you don't do it now, four more years will go by, and you won't vote.""

Back and forth they went for several minutes. Finally, seeing that Chavez wouldn't give him her number, the man walked away without registering. Winning votes, Lola Quintela of the Fairfax County Democratic Committee told me, is ""trabajo de hormiga"" -- ants' work, performed grain by grain.

The political scientist Lisa García Bedolla proposed a different method in a 2005 paper for The Harvard Journal of Hispanic Policy. Because political engagement is strongly influenced by social ties, she argues, Latinos should improve their participation by politicizing their existing social networks. (She also pushes for civics in schools.) Several of the Latinos I met seemed to vote only because they were connected to a political junkie. Manuel Fernandez, 25, a Mexican-American born in New York State, prefers rebuilding and drifting cars to reading politics, but he has voted in local and presidential elections since he turned 18 because his father, Guadencio, a businessman, persuaded him to register to vote and tells him when and how to cast his ballots. ""Dad is really into it,"" he said. ""Whenever my dad says it's voting time, we go vote.""

The Clinton campaign is splitting its strategy between the tactics. After analyzing which programs worked best during the primaries, Praeli began pushing an expansion of Nevada's bilingual Mujeres in Politics program in battleground and ""expansion"" states across the country. Mujeres in Politics marshals Latinas for the ant work of canvassing and phone banking, but it also relies on social ties to deepen the campaign's reach into Latino communities. Each Latina who participates is tasked with the responsibility of drawing in five more Latina volunteers.

""The theory for us was if you target Latinas and then you have Latinas talk to other Latinas, they're the best communicators to do that,"" Praeli told me. ""We see them as the C.E.O.s of their family and their communities. Part of my program description is you need to know that bodega with the highest foot traffic or the church secretary that can give you access to a faith community or who are the comadres in the neighborhood that have the largest influence. All you have to do is talk to a Latina to really understand that."" Of course, it doesn't hurt that Latinas have voted in higher numbers than Latinos or that they were a key base for Clinton in the primaries.

Chavez herself was lured into politics by a Latina friend. For years after she settled in Virginia from Peru, she earned money washing dishes, waitressing, cleaning bathrooms, cleaning offices, ""cleaning anything,"" she says. At one point she held three jobs: a full-time job, a part-time job and a weekend job cleaning the airport at night. In 1996, she earned her real estate license. Then in 2009, after a friend asked her to walk with Terry McAuliffe in a parade, she was so smitten by his concern for Latinos that she decided to volunteer for his campaign for governor. For Chavez, the experience was intoxicating: ""I was like, 'Whoa, I did not know any of this existed.' "" She has volunteered for Virginia Democrats every year since then. Election season feels like a party to her. ""I have the best time,"" she told me. When Praeli spoke at the ""Latinos con Hillary"" event at Todos, Chavez was there, dressed head to toenails in blue.

The widespread assumption has been that rising numbers of Hispanic citizens will turn Virginia and other states in the South permanently Democratic. Certainly, with each election since 2001, Virginia Democrats have expanded their network of experienced Latino staff members and volunteers. Praeli and Figueroa's work depends on these veterans, a fact that Clinton tacitly acknowledged before Figueroa was even hired. On June 11, five days after The Associated Press called the Democratic primary for Hillary Clinton, the former president Bill Clinton held a closed-door round table in Arlington with about 20 key Latino leaders from all over the state. He, like Praeli after him, was rallying troops.

But Latinos aren't natural Democrats, any more than they are natural Republicans. In 1984, Ronald Reagan won the presidency with nearly half their vote in California. In 2004, George W. Bush won a second term with 40 percent of the national Latino vote, setting off panic in Democratic circles. And even in 2012, 33 percent of the Latino vote in Virginia went to Mitt Romney. He also took 39 percent of the Latino vote in Florida and 42 percent in Ohio.

From the beginning, Latino voters have been up for grabs. The national electoral bloc that we now call the Hispanic vote was created by middle- and upper-class Mexican-American Democrats who wanted more clout in government and politics. According to the historian Ignacio M. García's book on the subject, they organized ""Viva Kennedy"" clubs in Texas, California, New Mexico, Indiana, Illinois and elsewhere. Working together under an absurd logo of John Kennedy riding a grinning burro, these grass-roots clubs turned out thousands of Spanish speakers in delegate-rich states, helping Kennedy squeak into the White House by a margin of less than 1 percent of the popular vote. But Republicans pushed the strategy further: In ""Making Hispanics,"" Mora shows how members of Richard Nixon's 1972 re-election campaign, who nicknamed themselves the ""Brown Mafia,"" ran Spanish-language ads on radio and television. They crafted three distinct campaigns to bring in not just Mexican-Americans but also Puerto Ricans and Cuban-Americans. With their help, Nixon was re-elected by a landslide, taking about 35 percent of what was then known as the ""Spanish speaking"" vote. The real loss for Republicans since President George W. Bush left office is that their candidates have frittered away the affections that he and Reagan earned among Latinos.

Many conservative Hispanics I spoke with in Virginia told me that they don't fit neatly into either party. They would prefer a candidate who legalizes undocumented immigrants, outlaws abortion, makes college education free, wipes out drugs and gangs, rolls back the legal right to gay marriage, supports small-business credits and raises the minimum wage. Immigration reform might be a distinguishing concern for Latinos, but a recent report from Pew found that, as in previous presidential contests, it is not the top issue for Latino voters. More Latino voters say that the economy, health care and terrorism are very important.

Several of the Catholic Latinos I met said that abortion laws were their top priority. ""If we can close that one clinic,"" Iris Chavez told me with a sparkle in her eye, referring to a Planned Parenthood-like women's clinic that was once located in Manassas, ""we can set fire to the nation."" Chavez, 26, was brought into the United States illegally from El Salvador when she was 11 and was protected by Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, which Obama created in 2012 for undocumented millennials who came to the United States as children. She works part-time as a secretary at All Saints Catholic Church, where so many Latinos attend the Sunday afternoon, Spanish-language Mass that they spill from the pews to stand three to four deep against the walls. She doesn't much like Donald Trump, she told me, but if she could vote, she would vote for him based on her belief that abortion is murder.

Chavez is the kind of Latino that Nixon's ""Brown Mafia"" was after -- the same kind that Reagan tried to embrace with his 1986 amnesty, which legalized 2.7 million Hispanics who had no criminal history, and the kind that Reince Priebus had hoped the Republican National Committee's 2012 election autopsy would provoke Republicans to seek again. If the party had followed George W. Bush's lead, Todos Supermarket might have become a site for G.O.P. events. Carlos Castro, its owner, considered himself ""almost 100 percent Republican"" until 2007, when the Republicans of Prince William County championed an anti-Hispanic ""Immigration Resolution,"" and he began to reconsider. He's now an independent. Other conservatives in the county told me that they would keep their votes out of everybody's reach until a candidate arrives whom they can fully support.

The specter of Trump has roused many Latinos to change their minds about registering; spikes have been documented in North Carolina and Georgia. In California, the rise in registrations early this year was almost double what it was during the same period in 2012. Jairo Castillo, a Nicaraguan-American construction worker in Virginia, complained to me in April that the vote ""doesn't count,"" but after Trump secured the Republican nomination in June, he registered to vote for the first time.

Even if a ""Trump effect"" among Latinos this year does help put Clinton in the White House, will those new voters stay engaged? History suggests they might not. According to the political scientists Matt Barreto and Gary M. Segura, more than a million Latinos in California registered to vote for the first time in the years after the state passed Proposition 187, a 1994 ballot initiative. Prop. 187 prohibited undocumented immigrants from state-funded institutions, like schools, and required police officers to report their arrests to federal immigration authorities. In a statewide election, the initiative passed with 59 percent of the vote. Pete Wilson, the Republican governor who had championed the measure, won re-election that same fall. Prop. 187 was soon tied up in federal court, which ruled many of its elements unconstitutional, but California's electorate soon went on to pass a ban on affirmative action (Prop. 209) and a reduction in bilingual education (Prop. 227). Both measures were widely regarded as anti-Hispanic.

Prop. 187 and its cousins had notoriously partisan effects in California. In a paper published in The American Journal of Political Science in 2006, the political scientists Shaun Bowler, Stephen P. Nicholson and Segura found that before 1994 Latinos split their votes almost equally between the two parties. By contrast, after the passage of these propositions, the probability that a Latino would identify as Republican fell by more than two-thirds, erasing all the gains that Republicans made since Ronald Reagan's 1980 campaign. Data also revealed that the propositions moved many non-Hispanic whites in California into the Democratic column. Attacking undocumented immigrants and Latinos had provoked a white backlash against Republicans that mirrors the disaffection that Trump's nomination has stirred among many party moderates this season.

But as time went on, Prop. 187's effect on Latino turnout revealed itself to be not a turning point but a blip. Last September, The Los Angeles Times noted that only 17 percent of eligible California Latinos voted in 2014. Turnout was similar among Asian-Americans, while all other racial and ethnic groups combined voted more than twice as much. ""By all accounts, the Central Valley is a place where Latino candidates should win elections,"" the reporter Kate Linthicum noted. ""Yet Latino candidates' election losses have piled up here in recent years -- in large part because Latinos aren't turning out to vote.""

Among those defeated in 2014 was Amanda Renteria, now the national political director for Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign. Renteria ran for Congress in a Central Valley district that was 74 percent Hispanic. She grew up in the Central Valley and taught math at her old high school in Woodlake before attending Harvard Business School and becoming the first Latina chief of staff in the history of the Senate. She lost her 2014 bid for Congress by 17 points. If Latinos had turned out for her at the levels that African-Americans turned out for Obama, it's possible that today she would sit in Congress.

This March, the Public Policy Institute of California released a report that detailed the gulf that has opened up in California politics since the Prop. 187 surge. ""Voters in California,"" it noted, ""tend to be older, white, college educated, affluent and homeowners. They also tend to identify themselves as 'haves' -- rather than 'have-nots' -- when asked to choose between these two economic categories. Nonvoters tend to be younger, Latino, renters, less affluent and less likely to be college educated than likely voters -- and they generally identify themselves as have-nots.""

California may be a majority-minority state in terms of its population, the report observed, but its electorate is not: 60 percent of its likely voters are white, while only 18 percent are Latino. It would be naïve, however, to expect Democrats to throw themselves wholeheartedly into the project of turning out the state's Hispanics given that they already control solid majorities in California's State Assembly and State Senate.

""We have to be honest,"" María Teresa Kumar, the president and co-founder of Voto Latino, a nonpartisan organization, told me last fall. ""When it comes to voter registration, each party is looking to the Latino community and the African-American community for enough votes. They don't need us all."" From her office in Washington, she directs efforts to engage young Latinos who are often navigating the political system for their families. ""Our job,"" Kumar said, ""is to do true political empowerment: It's mass mobilization and mass participation. And for parties, it's about how little do they need to spend to get over the top.""

If Virginia's battleground status suggests a triumph of the Latino vote, it also provides a cautionary tale about its limitations. In early August, Senator Tim Kaine, Hillary Clinton's running mate, appeared in the green-and-yellow gymnasium of Huguenot High School in Richmond. ""Yes, we Kaine!"" the crowd shouted under the floodlights. His homecoming rally doubled as a history lesson. Kaine pointed out that Virginia had gone 170 years without a president or vice-president. When he moved to Virginia in 1984, he said, neither Republicans nor Democrats bothered to campaign in the state, a situation that he attributed to a conservative lock on power that depended upon marginalizing women and minorities. ""We pushed you away from the table,"" he said. But since Barack Obama turned Virginia into a battleground, it has become a campaign stop for every would-be president. ""It's much better to live in state where no one can take you for granted,"" Kaine said.

The shift that brought volunteers like Keisy Chavez to the Democratic table actually began long before Obama. When Mark Warner was elected governor in 2001, his campaign strategy relied on winning rural, Nascar-loving Republicans, not on including minorities. But Kaine's own gubernatorial victory in 2005 used an urban-suburban strategy that relied upon the participation of Northern Virginia's fast-growing, multiethnic communities. Given Kaine's experiences arguing civil rights cases and his work as a missionary in Honduras, the shift may have reflected personal affinities. It was also a canny response to Virginia's changing demographics. According to the University of Virginia's Demographics Research Group, in 1970 only one in 100 Virginians were born outside of the United States. By 2012, that ratio had increased to one in nine. Such demographic transformations are hardly unique to the state. Between 1990 and 2008, the number of Latinos living in Arkansas, Alabama, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee grew by 602 percent, prompting political scientists to dub the region the ""Nuevo South."" ""If you put your faith in the Virginia voter,"" Kaine recalled telling the candidate Obama in 2008, ""You're going to win Virginia.""

Yet the majority of Virginia's General Assembly is still Republican, and only two of its state-level representatives, the delegates Alfonso Lopez and Jason Miyares, are Latino. Harry Wiggins, the chairman of Prince William County's Democratic Committee, described the problem like this: ""We win the presidential. We won for Mark Warner. We won for Tim Kaine. We won for Terry McAuliffe. Yet the county board we lose, because they have off-year elections, and we have very light turnout.""

Figueroa is already preparing for the inevitable drop. ""The numbers are going to plummet next year in places that count, like Prince William,"" he told me. In 2015, the Census Bureau weighed Prince William County at 22.3 percent Latino, 21.8 percent African-American and 8.7 percent Asian. The chairman of its board of supervisors, however, is Corey Stewart, a Republican, who is also chairman of Donald Trump's campaign in the state. ""When he is president and I am governor, you're going to see one helluva tag team in Virginia, and we're finally going to remove illegal immigrants,"" Stewart told The Richmond Times-Dispatch in June. The gubernatorial race will occur next year, when no other state in the country except New Jersey will be holding elections.

While Kaine spoke, Figueroa stood near the press box, tapping at his phone and taking in the scene. In the days leading up to the rally, he mentioned several times that he was working to make the event ""blacker and browner."" His handiwork was evident in the V.I.P. bleachers directly in front of the television cameras, where a group of people sat, many of them wearing the unmistakable bright blue-and-white jerseys of El Salvador's national soccer team. They were students, parents and teachers associated with the English-as-a-second-language program at Huguenot High School and its International Club. Their V.I.P. seating had come from Figueroa. Their homemade red, white and blue sign ""Juntos Se Puede!"" (""Together we can!"") gave Kaine a camera-ready opportunity that he seized, pointing to them and leading a round of ""Sí se puede!"" -- a chant that will always have special resonance for those who know that it originated not in 2008 with Obama but with Cesar Chavez and Dolores Huerta in 1972.

After Kaine finished his speech, as ""Shake It Off"" blasted through the gym, several of these students joined the throng vying for an opportunity to snap a selfie with him. I asked two of them what they knew about Kaine. ""He was mayor of Virginia,"" one said. The other added that he had lived in Honduras and was a friend of Latinos. That was all that they seemed to know. Two parents I spoke with told me, in Spanish, that they understood only pieces of Kaine's speech, which was in English. This explained why one father appeared so poker-faced through much of the rally. Unless his son translated the speeches for him, he couldn't form an opinion. He didn't understand what was being said.",1040193035
5,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/09/us/politics/democrats-investigations-trump.html,"WASHINGTON -- Democrats, transitioning into the House majority, have quietly sent dozens of letters in recent weeks seeking documents and testimony from President Trump's businesses, his campaign and his administration, setting the table for investigations that could reach the center of his presidency.

Clear targets have emerged in the process, and some others appear to have fallen away, at least for now. Family separation and detention policies at the border have jumped to the forefront. So has the acting attorney general's oversight of the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III. But Democrats, after slamming House Republicans for their inadequate inquiry, do not plan to reopen a full-scale Russian interference investigation. They have also chosen to hold off on an immediate request for Mr. Trump's tax returns.

For eager liberals coming off two years of Republican oversight paralysis, the next few weeks may feel something like a game of hurry up and wait. Arranging witnesses and wrangling sensitive government documents take time, and most House committees have yet to be populated with lawmakers, not to mention much of the legion of lawyers who will do a lot of the work of investigations. The Intelligence Committee did not technically have a chairman until last week.

""Those people who are expecting some kind of Hollywood movie here are going to be disappointed because it is going be very orderly,"" said Representative Jim Himes, Democrat of Connecticut and a senior member of the Intelligence Committee.

Here is what Democrats will focus on first.

Immigration policy and the special counsel's investigations.

The impasse over Mr. Trump's proposed border wall and the death late last month of an 8-year-old boy from Guatemala in United States custody have catapulted the administration's divisive policies at the border to the top of House Democrats' agenda. Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York, the Judiciary Committee chairman, and a handful of other chairmen plan to examine immigration policies.

Their interest and detailed questions could prove problematic for Mr. Trump's efforts to make a case for his border wall, shining a light on gaps in the current policy and trying to highlight the human toll on migrants.

""We are calling on D.H.S. to preserve any and all evidence related to these horrible incidents,"" the chairmen wrote. ""We as a country can and must do better.""

Mr. Nadler has already invited Matthew G. Whitaker, the acting attorney general, to be the committee's first public hearing witness, and indicated in recent days that he would subpoena Mr. Whitaker if necessary to compel an appearance before the end of the month. Democrats are intent on pressing Mr. Whitaker on his involvement in the ousting of former Attorney General Jeff Sessions, his role in the oversight of the special counsel investigation and other policy matters, including the administration's decision not to defend the Affordable Care Act in a lawsuit brought by Republican state attorneys general.

Mr. Nadler has indicated that he intends to wait for Mr. Mueller to conclude his work before seriously considering an impeachment inquiry -- a prospect weighing heavily on Democrats that could swamp other oversight efforts. But he said in December that the committee would begin investigating facts presented by federal prosecutors that strongly point to Mr. Trump's involvement in hush-money payments just before the 2016 election to two women who claim to have had affairs with him, a violation of campaign finance law. They will also look at what Democrats view as ""improper"" communications between the president and federal law enforcement.

On Russia, targeted questions rather than a full inquiry.

After seething over Republican use of the House Intelligence Committee to turn an investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election into an attempt to discredit the president's investigators, Democrats plan to quickly flip the lens back on to Mr. Trump and his campaign itself. But the panel's leaders have cautioned that their approach will be narrower than once predicted.

""We are conscious of the fact that the Senate continues to do their work, Mueller continues to do his work, and at this point in the game, I would not expect the committee to announce an omnibus investigation,"" Mr. Himes said. ""The time has passed for that.""

Instead, Democrats will initially pursue at least two questions -- one discreet, the other potentially very complicated -- that Republicans in control of the committee would not touch. The panel's new chairman, Representative Adam B. Schiff of California, said it was initiating a request for phone records of the president's eldest son, Donald Trump Jr., to clarify whom he called while arranging a June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower in Manhattan between members of the Trump campaign and a Russian lawyer. Phone records already in the hands of congressional investigators show a call was placed to a blocked number, and Donald Trump Jr. told investigators that he did not remember who he had called. Democrats believe the blocked number may have belonged to his father, and could prove that the president had prior knowledge of the Russian offer to share dirt on his opponent, Hillary Clinton.

The committee would also like to request financial records related to Mr. Trump's dealings with Russia and other foreign powers, but that ultimately may have to rope in the House Financial Services Committee. Intelligence Committee Democrats appear to be circling around two well-known but still mysterious transactions: Mr. Trump's sale of a Palm Beach, Fla., mansion to a Russian oligarch in 2008 and loans to the Trump Organization from Deutsche Bank.

In the real estate case, Mr. Trump bought a Palm Beach estate for $41 million in 2004 and, only four years later, amid a national housing crisis, sold it to the Russian billionaire, Dmitry Rybolovlev, for $95 million. Democrats say the deal stinks of potential money laundering. Loans from Deutsche Bank -- hundreds of millions of dollars extended by a bank later accused in an unrelated case of laundering Russian money during a time when few other major banks would lend to Mr. Trump's businesses -- also raise concerns that Russia could have financial leverage over the president.

Democrats are prepared to subpoena the records if necessary. Mr. Schiff said staff had already begun informal conversations with institutions, potential witnesses and their lawyers about records requests, but because the panel has not technically been appointed yet, formal requests must wait -- most likely until the end of January.

Mr. Schiff declined to name specific witnesses except Michael D. Cohen, Mr. Trump's former personal lawyer who has pleaded guilty to lying to Congress about the Trump Organization's dealings with Russia and to buying the silence of two women who say they had affairs with Mr. Trump.

Wait, but what about Trump's tax returns?

Democrats tried more than a dozen times over the past two years to obtain Mr. Trump's tax returns. But now that they finally have the opportunity to do so -- thanks to an obscure 1920s tax code provision -- the relevant Democratic committee chairman appears to be in no rush.

In an effort to parry Republican accusations of overreach, the House Ways and Means chairman, Representative Richard E. Neal of Massachusetts, has decided instead to try to first build a public case for why the returns ought to become public before he lodges a formal request. He plans to convene a hearing this month focused on presidential tax returns in conjunction with sweeping anticorruption legislation that includes language requiring all presidents and candidates to make their returns public.

Ultimately, Mr. Neal and Democrats do not need new laws. Sometime after the hearings -- probably in February -- Mr. Neal plans to invoke Section 6103 in the tax code, which allows chairmen of the House and Senate tax writing committees to request from the Treasury Department tax returns or related information on any tax filer. In theory, committee investigators could then privately study the returns for any compromising or illegal financial dealings. The committee would have to vote to make any of the information public.

Whether the administration will put up a fight remains unclear. Mr. Trump has said publicly that he does not care if Democrats pursue the documents; Steven Mnuchin, the Treasury secretary, has said he will defer to legal counsel. There is, however, scant precedent for this particular case: Mr. Trump is the first president or major presidential candidate in decades to refuse to release his returns.

The low-hanging fruit: hurricane response, security clearances and government jets.

Representative Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland, the chairman of the Oversight and Reform Committee, had a stern and straightforward message when he sent off 51 oversight letters to cabinet secretaries and Trump Organization lawyers shortly before Christmas: Consider this ""a basic first step"" and not a voluntary one.

As he stands up the House's marquee investigative committee, Mr. Cummings has deliberately chosen to begin with targets that Republicans once agreed should be studied, but failed to follow up on. They include records related to the administration's response to Hurricanes Irma and Maria, which devastated American territories in the Caribbean; Ivanka Trump's use of a private email account for government business; the use of government jets for personal travel; misconduct by the former Environmental Protection Agency administrator, Scott Pruitt; and the Flint, Mich., water crisis.

Laying the groundwork to look for potential violations of the Constitution's emoluments clause, which bans payments from foreign governments to federal officeholders, he wrote to the Trump Organization requesting documents related to the company's procedures for identifying foreign payments.

In each, Mr. Cummings said he expected the documents by Friday. Subpoenas could follow if they are not produced. But much of the committee's investigative work is likely to remain private in the coming weeks.

Other targets appear to be imminent. Representative Carolyn B. Maloney, Democrat of New York, said she and Mr. Cummings agreed they would study what she called the Trump administration's attempts to manipulate the 2020 census for political gain.

""Our whole democracy is based on representation,"" Ms. Maloney said, ""and if there is a conscious effort to undercount representation, that is an attack fundamentally on our democracy.""",1036054604
6,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/06/learning/lesson-plans/border-wall-lesson-plan.html,"Walls protect. Walls divide. Both these statements are true. Yet perhaps no issue represents the deep political chasm separating this country as a wall -- a ""big, beautiful wall"" in the words of President Trump.

In this lesson plan, students move past the political rhetoric to analyze the function and symbolism of a border wall. They learn about what's in place already along the United States-Mexico border, they find out what life in the borderlands is like, they learn more about border security and they consider walls as symbols. Then, if you would like to go further, we invite your students to compare President Trump's proposed wall to other historic walls, from China to Berlin.

_________

Warm Up

Ask students to respond to the following prompt:

Both of the following statements are true.

Walls protect.

Walls divide.

Which statement do you think is more true? Explain why.

Then have students share their answers as a class.

If you are feeling a little more adventurous, you can have students stand up and respond to this same prompt using a barometer activity. Tape two signs, ""Walls Protect"" and ""Walls Divide,"" on opposite ends of the classroom. Ask students to stand along a continuum between the two signs based on how strongly they feel about their answer to the prompt. Give them a minute to find their spot along the continuum, then have students share what they think and why.

_________

Stations Activity

For the main part of this lesson, we propose a stations activity. Depending on your goals, however, you may simply choose to do one of these stations, such as the first one about what is currently in place at the United States-Mexico border, as a whole class activity. Each station has one main resource, or set of resources, accompanied by questions for writing and discussion, as well as suggestions for further research if there is time. The activity concludes with a writing activity in which students reflect on what they learned and what they think.

Station 1: The Current U.S.-Mexico Border

Instructions: Close your eyes. Imagine what you think the 1,954-mile United States-Mexico border looks like.

Then scroll through this NYTimes.com interactive to learn about what security measures are already in place at the border.

Then, answer these questions:

1. Describe the current United States-Mexico border as if you were telling a friend who had no idea what the border was like.

2. Describe the current United States approach to controlling who and what passes across the border with Mexico.

3. Imagine what you think the 5,525-mile United States-Canada border looks like. Then look at some photographs documenting that border. How is the United States' northern border different from its southern border? Why do you think it is so different?

4. Do you think the current approach to United States border security is effective? What ideas do you have to make it more effective?

5. Do you think all, some or no national borders around the world should have walls or fences separating countries? Why?

Here are additional resources showing what the United States-Mexico border looks like:

""Before the Wall: Life Along the U.S.-Mexico Border""

Station 2: Life Along the Border

According to this 2014 data from the Mexican government, the total population that lives in cities and counties along both sides of the United States-Mexico border is 14 million people and an estimated one million people legally cross the border every day.

What is life like along the border? Watch this video about two towns separated by the United States-Mexico border, Douglas, Ariz., and Agua Prieta, Sonora. Then answer these questions:

1. How has life in these two towns changed since a border fence was erected in the past decade?

2. How do these towns collaborate and maintain ties even though a border fence separates them?

3. The binational event in the film features jaguars. What do jaguars symbolize in relation to the border?

Here are additional resources showing life in the borderlands:

""Life in Tijuana Means Negotiating 'La Línea,' an Always Present Wall""

""Crossing With Faith"" (3-minute film)

""Dealing on Both Sides"" (3-minute film)

""Far From Washington, the Routine Symbiosis of the Border Plays Out in Texas and Mexico""

""Is the Border in Crisis? 'We're Doing Fine, Quite Frankly,' a Border City Mayor Says""

Station 3: A Wall as Public Policy

First, look at the graph above about illegal border crossings from 2000 to 2018. Then look at the graph below, about people apprehended or turned away at the border between 2005 and 2018.

What do you notice going on? What do you wonder? What story might these two graphs tell?

Now look at two more graphs, about the immigrant population and the violent crime rate, from 1980 to 2016.

What do you notice about these two graphs? What story might they tell?

Then, read the introduction of this article debunking some of the rhetoric about ""illegal"" or ""undocumented"" immigrants in the United States. It begins:

There are 11 million of them, the best estimates say, laboring in American fields, atop half-built towers and in restaurant kitchens, and swelling American classrooms, detention centers and immigration courts.

In the public's mind, the undocumented -- the people living here without permission from the American government -- are Hispanic, mostly Mexican and crossed the southwestern border in secret.

In the eyes of their advocates, they are families and workers, taking the jobs nobody else wants, staying out of trouble, here only to earn their way to better, safer lives for themselves and their children.

At the White House, they are pariahs, criminals who menace American neighborhoods, take American jobs, sap American resources and exploit American generosity: They are people who should be, and will be, expelled.

Illegal immigrants can be many of these things, and more. Eleven million allows for considerable range, crosshatched with contradictions.

There may be no more powerful symbol of how fixedly Americans associate illegal immigration with Mexico than the wall President Trump has proposed building along the southern border. But many of the unauthorized are not Mexican; almost a quarter are not even Hispanic.

After Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador and Honduras, the largest number of unauthorized immigrants comes from China (an estimated 268,000), where deportations run aground on a less literal wall: China is one of 23 countries that do not cooperate with deportations. (The Trump administration has pledged to pressure all 23 into doing so.)

They tend to be younger -- the Pew Research Center has found that adult unauthorized immigrants were, at the median, about a decade younger than American-born adults -- and skew slightly more male than the rest of the country.

Then answer these questions:

1. How many undocumented immigrants are living in the United States?

2. How do advocates see this group of people?

3. How does the White House view this same group?

4. From where do they come? List the top six countries of origin.

If you have more time, choose one or more of the other five sections in the same article to read: ""Strong American Ties,"" ""Criminal Records,"" ""Overstayed Their Visas,"" ""Repeat Crossers"" and ""Asylum Seekers."" For each section you read, write two things you learn or that surprise you.

Here are additional resources related to people and things crossing the border illegally:

""The Wall and the Shutdown, Explained""

Station 4: The Psychology of Walls

Walls aren't just tangible objects we can touch. They can also have real psychological power.

Costica Bradatan, a professor in the Honors College at Texas Tech University, wrote about the power of walls back in 2011, in advance of the 2012 presidential election. Read the following excerpts from his essay, and decide if they feel relevant today:

Walls are back in fashion. Walls and fences. Not long ago, you may recall, Republican presidential candidates expressed their devotion to them. In October Michele Bachmann signed a pledge to support the construction of a fence that would run the entire length of the United States-Mexico border. Not to be outdone, Herman Cain voiced his support for an electrified border fence, one juiced up enough to be lethal: Touch it and die. As someone who grew up behind the Iron Curtain, I happen to know how the device works; in a certain way, we invented it (we should have copyrighted it). The ability to cross the ""lethal fence"" used to be part of the East-European survival kit.

He continues:

While walls and fences are certainly physical things -- imposing ones at that -- a good deal of their power comes from elsewhere. As their role in political discourse makes clear, they are also things of the mind. And it is not a concept confined by American borders. The Germans, who seem to have a name for everything, use the phrase Mauer im Kopf (""wall in the head"") to refer to the phenomenon. The Berlin Wall may have been torn down long ago, but many people in Germany still feel divided; the wall is intact in their minds. (As a native of Germany, Niemann may know a thing or two about this.) Walls can be spectacular as architectural structures but they can be even more fascinating as entities that inhabit our thinking and shape cultures.

Walls, then, are built not for security, but for a sense of security. The distinction is important, as those who commission them know very well. What a wall satisfies is not so much a material need as a mental one. Walls protect people not from barbarians, but from anxieties and fears, which can often be more terrible than the worst vandals. In this way, they are built not for those who live outside them, threatening as they may be, but for those who dwell within. In a certain sense, then, what is built is not a wall, but a state of mind.

Then answer these questions:

1. Costica Bradatan asserts that a good deal of the power of walls and fences come from their psychological power. What does he mean? To what extent do you agree?

2. He argues that walls are not built for security, but instead for a sense of security. Why does he make this distinction? Do you agree?

3. Do you think walls have a different psychological effect from fences? Or are they really just the same thing with a different name?

Station 5: A Political Symbol

Hours before a partial government shutdown kicked in at midnight on Dec. 22, President Trump released a video reiterating his demand for additional funding for a ""wall or a slat fence or whatever you want to call it."" He said, ""We need a great barrier."" In the video, he claimed: ""It's very dangerous out there. Drugs are pouring in, human trafficking, so many different problems, including gangs like M.S. 13. We don't want them in the United States."" The White House previously declared there is a ""crisis at the border.""

The Times Editorial Board counters Mr. Trump's claim that border security is a crisis in this editorial, writing:

Let's be clear: This fight [about the wall and the shutdown] is not about security. Contrary to Mr. Trump's claims, there is no flood of savage foreigners pouring across the border. Even so, reasonable Democrats and Republicans acknowledge a need for some mix of a bigger staff, better technology and, yes, fencing -- as well as humane and sensible immigration and asylum policies. Achieving all of that has proved a tall order even for competent administrations. But it's why Congress, on a bipartisan basis, has already been allocating more money for border security -- although the administration has spent less than 10 percent of what Congress has allocated in the past year.

To avoid the complex, hard work that has traditionally gone with his job, Mr. Trump has instead manufactured a political impasse over a symbol, a wall, that even his new acting chief of staff, Mick Mulvaney, back when he was a congressman, derided as ""an easy thing to sell politically"" that ""doesn't really solve the problem."" John Kelly, Mr. Trump's departing chief of staff, told The Los Angeles Times that the administration long ago abandoned the idea of a concrete wall as irrelevant to the real needs of border security -- drawing a heated contradiction from the president on Twitter.

Writing in National Review, a conservative magazine and website, Jonah Goldberg agrees that the wall is in fact a big symbol: ""Trump's wall is now an entirely symbolic affair."" He continues: ""The symbolism is more important than the reality. Indeed, the president has offered to compromise, saying that we don't have to call it a wall and it doesn't even have to really look like one. But that doesn't matter either, because for Democrats, any structure that the president could claim victory over would be a defeat.""

Answer these questions:

1. Do you agree that the border wall has become a political symbol for both the president's supporters and opponents? Why?

2. As of Jan. 3, parts of the United States government were closed because the president and Congress could not agree on the president's demand for $5 billion in funding to begin construction of a border wall. Do you think the two branches of government will be able to get past this impasse? Should either side compromise? And if yes, what should a compromise look like?

3. In its editorial, the Times Editorial Board suggests the need for sensible border security investments and immigration reform. In his essay, Mr. Goldberg writes that the symbolism of the wall fight has made immigration policy itself ""something of an afterthought."" First, do you agree with either or both of these positions? Second, do you think the president and Congress will be able to move past the shutdown standoff to address larger issues related to immigration? Why or why not?

4. Walls also can have great symbolic power. The Department of Homeland Security unveiled eight wall prototypes in October 2017, which President Trump visited six months later. None of these prototypes have been selected, and no wall has been built. But these eight prototypes have symbolic power.

Choose one of these eight prototypes and explain what you think it symbolizes from two points of view: first, for the president and his supporters, and second, for the president's political opponents.

Now, look at some proposals that weren't selected, including a 2,000-mile pink wall, a shopping mall and a detention center. Again, choose one proposal and explain the symbolic value for both the president's supporters and opponents.

Here are additional resources related to the wall as a political symbol:

""End of Government Shutdown May Depend on the Definition of 'Wall'""

Conclusion and Reflection

After students have completed the four stations, have them discuss what they learned and what surprised them. Then, ask them to write a response to the warm-up prompt, using evidence from the four stations.

Walls protect. Walls divide. Which statement do you think is more true when it comes to the United States-Mexico border? Explain why.

As an alternative, students can draw their own editorial cartoon offering commentary on the issue.

Going Further: Research Other Walls

In May 2016, in the middle of the last presidential campaign, The Upshot featured 16 walls and fences from history and today. The article begins:

It is lost to history whether Hadrian, Qin Shi Huang or Nikita Khrushchev ever uttered, ""I will build a wall.""

But build they did, and what happened? The history of walls -- to keep people out or in -- is also the history of people managing to get around, over and under them. Some come tumbling down.

The classic example is the Great Wall of China. Imposing and remarkably durable, yes, yet it didn't block various nomadic tribes from the north. History is full of examples of engineering thwarted by goal-oriented rank amateurs. But Donald Trump has promised to build a wall on the United States-Mexican border that he says will be big, beautiful, tall and strong, and he says Mexico will pay for it.

Select one of the walls included in the article and find out more about the following:

1. Why was the wall built?

2. How was it built? Of what material?

3. To what extent did the wall fulfill its purpose?

4. What, if any, unintended consequences did the wall have?

5. What is the wall's legacy? How is it viewed today?",1034074101
7,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/06/opinion/trump-2020-republicans-impeachment.html,"Now that a new Congress has taken office, the vote count from the 2018 midterms is all but final. It shows that Democrats won the national popular vote in the House races by almost nine percentage points. That margin is smashing -- larger, by comparison, than in any presidential race since Ronald Reagan's 1984 re-election landslide.

The size of the victory has gone somewhat overlooked, because election-night story lines still have an outsize influence on people's perceptions. On election night, more than a dozen House races were still uncertain, and Democrats were suffering disappointing losses in several (mostly red-state) Senate and governor races.

But the final story of the 2018 midterms should be clear: They were a giant warning sign to the Republican Party, also known as the Party of Trump.

Without a significant improvement in Trump's standing, he would be a big underdog in 2020. Remember, presidential elections have higher turnout than midterms, and the larger electorate helps Democrats. At least 10 million more people -- and maybe many more -- are likely to vote in the next presidential election than voted in the 2018 midterms. Those extra votes, many from younger or nonwhite Americans, would make Trump's re-election all the more difficult.

It's not just Trump, either. If his approval rating doesn't rise over the next two years, multiple Senate Republicans will be in trouble. I've long assumed that Susan Collins of Maine could win re-election for as long as she wanted. But she may not be able to do so if Trump loses Maine by 15 percentage points -- which was the combined Republican deficit in Maine's two midterm congressional races.

Then there is Cory Gardner of Colorado (where Republicans lost the 2018 popular vote deficit by more than 10 percentage points), Joni Ernst of Iowa (where the Republican deficit was four points) and Martha McSally of Arizona (where it was two points).

If Trump's popularity were to drop at all, another batch of senators -- from North Carolina, Texas and Georgia, three states where Republicans only narrowly won the 2018 popular vote -- would become more endangered. Even Kansas elected a Democratic governor last year, and it will have an open Senate seat in 2020. On Friday, Pat Roberts, the Republican incumbent, announced he would not run again.

Over the weekend, I published a column making the case that Trump deserved to be removed from office -- that he has violated both federal law and his constitutional oath, that he is manifestly unfit to be president and that his continued tenure is a danger to the country. Of course, regardless of these dangers or his sins, he will remain in office so long as congressional Republicans want him there. And I know that many people, from across the ideological spectrum, believe that Trump's standing with Republicans remains secure.

I think he is more vulnerable than many people realize.

First, there are the political risks that his current standing creates for other Republicans. It's true that his approval rating has been notably stable, around 40 percent. It's also notably weak. Thus the Republican whupping in the midterms.

Second, Trump's political fortunes are more likely to deteriorate than improve this year. The economy isn't likely to get a lot stronger. The various investigations aren't going away. And Trump will surely commit more unforced errors, like the government shutdown. ""It's still difficult to predict how all this ends,"" the political scientist Jonathan Bernstein wrote on Friday, about the shutdown. ""But it's hard to see it ending well for Republicans.""

Third, Republican support for Trump may remain broad, but it's shallow. Trump has already faced far more intra-party criticism than most presidents. Since the midterms, it seems to be growing. Jim Mattis, the defense secretary, resigned and criticized Trump while doing so. Mitt Romney entered the Senate by once again turning against Trump. Collins and Gardner have started grumbling about the shutdown.

As Republicans begin looking nervously to 2020, their willingness to break with Trump may increase. For some of them, their political survival may depend on breaking with him. If that happens, it's quite possible that his approval rating will begin to drift below 40 percent -- and the bad news will then feed on itself.

No, none of this is guaranteed. Democrats could overreach, by quickly impeaching Trump and thereby uniting Republicans. Or Trump could end up navigating the next few months surprisingly well. But that's not the mostly likely scenario.

The normal rules of politics really do apply to Trump. He won a shocking victory in 2016, and his opponents have lacked confidence ever since. They should no longer lack it.

Donald Trump still has great power as the president of the United States. But as presidents go, he is very weak. His opponents -- Democrats, independents and Republicans who understand the damage he is doing to the country -- should be feeling energized.

8,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/07/opinion/trump-impeachment-republican-party.html,"The president deserves to lose his job -- and he's vulnerable. Just look at the final midterm results.

This article is part of the Opinion Today newsletter. You can sign up here to receive the newsletter each weekday.

In his recent book on the history of impeachment, the legal scholar Cass Sunstein asks readers to do a mental exercise. When thinking about the impeachment of a given president, imagine that he was a member of your political party, Sunstein suggests. In that case, would you still support impeaching him?

Here is the basic evidence about our current president:

1. He has accepted money from foreign governments, used the presidency to promote his businesses and hidden his personal finances from the American people.

2. He directed a criminal campaign-finance violation scheme, in the final month of the presidential campaign, and lied to the American people about it.

3. He pressured Justice Department officials to go easy on an investigation into the president himself and his campaign.

4. He attempted to undermine the credibility of multiple checks and balances on the executive branch, including the justice system, the press, the electoral system and the Central Intelligence Agency.

No other president, Republican or Democrat, has ever behaved as Donald Trump has. I think Americans, regardless of party, should come to see that he is unfit for the office and is damaging the country. In the Sunday Review yesterday, I made the much longer version of this case. I also argued that Democrats would be doing him a favor by impeaching him soon. The best way to push for his removal from office is not to impeach him, at least not yet. Richard Nixon, as you may recall, was never impeached but resigned under pressure after he lost the support of fellow Republicans.

If you've already read the article, you may be interested in the reader comments that other Times readers suggested as the most interesting (which you can see by clicking on the ""Readers' Picks"" tab). I'm grateful to my editors for encouraging me to write the piece and for giving it as much space as they did.

I know one skeptical question that many readers ask is a version of: So what? That is, even if Trump deserves to be removed from office, people have come to believe congressional Republicans will never abandon him. I don't think that's quite right, and my Monday column explains why. The column starts with an analysis of the midterm elections. As the final results have come in, it's clear they were even worse for Republicans than first understood.

Finally, for anyone interested in more detail, I recommend Sunstein's book, as well as a new book ""Impeachment: An American History,"" written by four experts.

""One thing we've learned from [Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez's] tax plan,"" tweeted Binyamin Appelbaum, the economics writer at The Times, ""is that a surprising number of people in Washington don't seem to understand how marginal tax rates works.""

Ocasio-Cortez appeared on CBS's ""60 Minutes"" and said she favored a top tax rate of as much as 70 percent on income above $10 million. ""As you climb up this ladder you should be contributing more,"" she explained. That's how marginal tax rates work. Even people making more than $10 million would not pay a 70 percent rate on the first $10 million of their income. They'd pay a much lower rate.

But after Ocasio-Cortez's interviews, social media and television shows were full of talk suggesting that she wanted to start taxing a wide swath of people at 70 percent.

My colleague Paul Krugman explains that some of the world's top economists favor a top marginal rate -- on the very highest incomes -- as high as the one Ocasio-Cortez discussed. He noted that the United States also had such a rate for many years and that the American economy did extremely well during these years. In a previous column, I've argued that such high rates discourage corporate executives from paying themselves ludicrously large sums.

9,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2018/12/19/business/19reuters-usa-saudi-nuclear-congress.html,"WASHINGTON -- Lawmakers from both U.S. parties introduced legislation on Wednesday to give Congress more say in any deal on civil nuclear power cooperation between the United States and Saudi Arabia.

The Trump administration is eager to strike a deal with Saudi Arabia to share nuclear power technology with the kingdom, as the domestic industry struggles to compete with lower-priced power sources such as natural gas.

But the talks have come under scrutiny since the killing of columnist Jamal Khashoggi in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul in October.

Despite President Donald Trump's desire to maintain close ties to Saudi Arabia, several of his fellow Republicans have joined Democrats in blaming Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman for Khashoggi's death. The crown prince has denied knowledge of the operation that killed Khashoggi.

The No Nuclear Weapons for Saudi Arabia Act would require the House of Representatives and the Senate to approve any so-called 123 agreement with the kingdom. Typically, such agreements go into effect unless majorities of Congress pass joint resolutions of disapproval.

It is unlikely that the legislation will pass before the end of the current Congress in January, but the bill raises scrutiny of any deal. It also calls on Saudi Arabia to release details of Khashoggi's killing before a deal is approved.

Concern about whether Saudi Arabia could use nuclear power to develop a weapons program mounted after the crown prince told CBS in an interview in March that his kingdom would develop nuclear weapons if its archrival Iran did.

""This legislation would ensure that we put key checks in place to ensure that Saudi Arabia never ends up with the U.S. technology or materials to make a nuclear bomb, and that Congress is the final say,"" said Senator Edward Markey, a Democrat.

Markey introduced the bill with Senator Marco Rubio, a Republican. Representatives Brad Sherman, a Democrat, and Luke Messer, a Republican, have introduced companion legislation in the House.

The talks have slowed as Saudi pushed for relaxing nonproliferation guidelines, known as the ""gold standard,"" that could allow it to enrich uranium or reprocess fuel waste. Those processes raise concerns because they have potential to create quantities of uranium and plutonium that could be used in nuclear bombs.

Energy Secretary Rick Perry visited Saudi Arabia this month to talk about the potential deal. Perry has said he told the kingdom it is important for it to be perceived to be strong on nonproliferation.

This year, the kingdom put the United States on a short list of countries for a deal. The winner will likely be selected next year.

U.S. reactor builder Westinghouse, which and is owned by Brookfield Asset Management, would likely sell nuclear technology to Saudi Arabia in any deal.

10,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/18/opinion/2020-primary-polls-wrong.html,"Promise me something: Over the coming weeks, whenever you hear a pundit or read a poll on the subject of who the 2020 Democratic nominee might be, you'll flash back four years. You'll remember predictions about the Republican nominee at this same point before the 2016 election.

Republicans then were in a situation similar to the one that Democrats are in now. More than a dozen candidates were poised to run. And in December 2014, CNN/ORC published the results of a survey that sought to determine which of them had the most support and the best chance.

The answer was not Donald Trump.

""Jeb Bush is the clear Republican presidential front-runner, surging to the front of the potential G.O.P. pack,"" read the story on CNN's website.

Surging. Jeb!

He had the support of 23 percent of respondents. That put him fully 10 points ahead of his nearest competitor, who was ... Chris Christie. Next came Ben Carson, followed by Rand Paul and Mike Huckabee.

Need I remind anyone how that fearsome five fared?

We political junkies got far ahead of ourselves then, and we're getting ahead of ourselves now. Almost 23 months before the 2020 election, we're handicapping contenders, edging toward prophecies and setting ourselves up to look every bit as foolish as we deserve to. We don't learn. That would get in the way of a guessing game that we relish too much.

Polls are being done at an accelerating pace. CNN released one late last week. It surveyed Democratic voters nationwide, among whom Joe Biden ranked first; Bernie Sanders, second; and Beto O'Rourke, third. So they're the Bush, Christie and Carson analogues. If 2014 is any guide, they should spare themselves a lot of travel and a world of heartache and pack it in now.

Of course, 2014 isn't a guide, but it's a caveat. A reality check. Assessments of candidates at this early stage have limited bearing on how well they'll be doing more than a year down the road, when the Iowa caucuses kick off the primary season. Too little has happened so far. Too much will happen in fairly short order.

At this juncture back then, Trump's candidacy wasn't even anticipated. Pollsters didn't present his name to Republican voters as an option. That remained true in February 2015, when someone new did challenge Bush for front-runner status and then briefly wrest it from him: Scott Walker. If you forgot about his supposedly big promise, no wonder. His campaign wouldn't last until the end of that year.

Trump finally came onto the radar and earned inclusion in polls around May 2015 -- five months further into the process than where we are now. But he didn't take the lead even then. In a Quinnipiac poll of Republican voters released on May 28, 2015, he placed eighth, just behind Ted Cruz. Cruz would be the only one, in the end, to give him any competition for the nomination.

While the 2016 presidential race was messy, it wasn't a complete anomaly. The 2008 race, for example, looked very different this far ahead of Election Day than it did in the homestretch. A CNN/ORC poll in December 2006 showed that among Democrats, Hillary Clinton had more than double the support that Barack Obama did.

She remained 14 points ahead of him three months later, in a USA Today/Gallup poll that established an even more commanding front-runner on the Republican side: Rudy Giuliani. Republicans preferred him to John McCain by a margin of 44 percent to 20 percent. McCain, obviously, went on to become the nominee. Giuliani exited the contest in January 2008.

The volatility partly reflects how little attention most voters pay to the nomination contests until much later on. But it's also a function of how much about the candidates remains unknown or has yet to emerge.

Sure, most of them have been vetted somewhat during prior runs for office. But whatever scrutiny they received, and whatever pressure they felt, pale next to the withering spotlight of a presidential bid. Previously overlooked discrepancies between their images and their reality will emerge; so will secrets. They'll teeter, some of them. Others will implode. Just ask such short-lived hopefuls as Giuliani, Howard Dean and John Edwards.

Already I'm hearing debates about O'Rourke's true politics that weren't a big factor in his recently concluded Senate race; if he runs for president, he'll have to explain a tension between his relatively moderate reputation in Congress and a more progressive tilt on the campaign trail.

Already Elizabeth Warren is suffering from an intensity of second-guessing that wasn't there before she released her DNA test about two months ago. Maybe it's a blip. Maybe not.

We think we know a lot about these candidates, and we do: their basic biographies, their professional accomplishments, their fluency so far at the microphone and in interviews.

But we don't have the most consequential information of all, at least in terms of their presidential ambitions. With the exception perhaps of Warren, who has given recent speeches on foreign policy and racial justice, we haven't heard the specific, boiled-down cases for themselves -- and their prescriptions for the country's future -- that they'll present to American voters. We don't know how persuasively they'll communicate that. And we haven't been able to judge how well it complements what voters are hungriest for now.

Trump is instructive. The phenomenon of his candidacy had everything to do with what he said when he came down that escalator in Trump Tower on June 16, 2015. He delivered a racially charged, anti-immigrant message with surprising resonance, and he did so -- not just then but in the months afterward -- with an unapologetic bluntness that many listeners interpreted as strength. That wasn't easily foreseeable and, for the most part, it wasn't foreseen.

Biden's, Sanders's and O'Rourke's strong showing in current polls isn't wholly irrelevant. It will help them with fund-raising. It will direct more media attention their way. It demonstrates that they've crossed the all-important threshold of widespread name recognition.

I was joking when I suggested that it spelled doom. But they shouldn't be too encouraged by it. And the rest of us shouldn't use it to write off other candidates.

11,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/31/nyregion/tish-james-attorney-general-trump.html,"[What you need to know to start the day: Get New York Today in your inbox.]

Letitia James, the incoming New York attorney general, has made no secret of how she feels about President Trump.

She calls him an ""illegitimate president."" She says her decision to run for attorney general was largely ""about that man in the White House who can't go a day without threatening our fundamental rights.""

She has suggested that Mr. Trump could be charged with obstruction of justice, and implied that foreign governments channeled money to Mr. Trump's family's real estate holdings, which she characterized as a ""pattern and practice of money laundering.""

Democratic attorneys general across the country, including Ms. James's predecessors in New York, have repeatedly used their offices to confront Mr. Trump. But since her election, Ms. James has opened herself up to criticism that she has gone too far in allowing politics to shape her agenda.

Her strident attacks on the president could potentially threaten the legal standing of cases that her office brings against Mr. Trump, his family members or their business interests, legal experts said.

Mr. Trump recently accused Ms. James of winning her election on a ""GET TRUMP agenda,"" and of doing ""little else but rant, rave & politic against me.""

Ms. James has signaled that she will be as aggressive as New York's current attorney general, Barbara D. Underwood, and her predecessor, Eric T. Schneiderman, both Democrats, in pursuing Mr. Trump in his home state.

She will continue a lawsuit against the Trump Foundation that was filed by Ms. Underwood and may also examine whether Mr. Trump is in violation of the Constitution's emoluments clause, which bars federal officials from accepting gifts, or emoluments, from foreign powers without congressional approval.

After an investigation by The New York Times showed that Mr. Trump received hundreds of millions of dollars from his parents, most of it by helping them dodge taxes, Ms. James issued a statement calling for ""a full examination of these claims"" by the state, including the attorney general's office.

""Donald Trump's days of defrauding Americans are coming to an end,"" Ms. James said.

Daniel S. Goldman, a fellow at the Brennan Center for Justice and a former assistant United States attorney in Manhattan, said that it was unlikely that Ms. James's remarks could directly lead to a dismissal of charges against Mr. Trump, but that they could put cases in jeopardy because of an appearance of ""an individualized political vendetta.""

""If there were to be a motion to dismiss because of bias, the attorney general's office would have to show a stronger factual basis for the legal issue,"" Mr. Goldman said. ""If there is a close call along the way, it could have an impact on the way a judge rules.""

A similar issue arose in 2015 when Judge Valerie E. Caproni of Federal District Court in Manhattan chided Preet Bharara for publicly criticizing Sheldon Silver, the former New York Assembly speaker, after he was charged with corruption. Mr. Bharara, then the United States attorney in Manhattan, had suggested to reporters that Mr. Silver had ""sold his office to line his pockets.""

Mr. Silver asked for the charges to be dismissed. Judge Caproni declined, but said she was ""troubled"" that Mr. Bharara's remarks appeared to ""bundle together unproven allegations"" about Mr. Silver. She warned his office to try the case ""in the courtroom and not in the press.""

Mr. Goldman characterized Mr. Trump's criticism of Ms. James as the right message from the wrong messenger, given how Mr. Trump has used public remarks on Twitter to discredit criminal and civil investigations involving himself, his family and associates.

""Donald Trump is desperately trying to turn everything into a hyperpartisan issue, including criminal justice,"" Mr. Goldman said. ""It's essential that prosecutors maintain their neutrality and an objective view of the facts and the evidence, no matter the politics involved.""

In an interview, Ms. James defended her remarks about the president, adding that she believed that her race and gender were shaping what she characterized as assumptions and misconceptions about how she would perform as attorney general.

Ms. James is the first woman in New York to be elected as attorney general, the first African-American woman to be elected to statewide office, and the first African-American to serve as attorney general. Before winning election, she was the New York City public advocate.

""This is similar to when I was about to take office as public advocate, and individuals expressed concerns,"" Ms. James said. ""What I have done repeatedly throughout my life is I have been underestimated and have continued to perform.""

Ms. James's role could take on heightened significance should Mr. Trump decide to issue pardons for anyone implicated in the investigation by the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, into Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential election.

Convictions under state law, however, are not covered by federal pardons. Ms. James has championed a change in state law that would allow the prosecution of those who have been pardoned by the president.

The importance of Ms. James's position was underscored when Ms. Underwood's office announced on Dec. 18 that Mr. Trump and his lawyers had agreed to shut down the Donald J. Trump Foundation.

That agreement emerged from an investigation that began under Mr. Schneiderman, and from a lawsuit filed by Ms. Underwood.

The lawsuit, which seeks restitution and penalties and could result in Mr. Trump and his three oldest children being barred from the boards of other New York charities, will proceed under Ms. James's watch.

Mr. Trump's lawyers had argued that the case should be dismissed because it was politically motivated. A state judge ruled in November that the case could proceed.

Ms. James began her legal career as a lawyer at the Legal Aid Society, eventually becoming head of the New York attorney general's Brooklyn regional office. In 2003, she was elected to the New York City Council; she was elected as the New York City public advocate a decade later.

As public advocate, Ms. James sought to redefine the position: She filed 12 lawsuits on behalf of city residents, more than all of her predecessors combined, but to mixed results. A small handful of cases were thrown out because judges ruled that she lacked standing to file the lawsuits.

Even inside the attorney general's office, some shared concerns that Ms. James's outspoken approach toward Mr. Trump may undermine her efforts.

Eric Soufer, who served as senior counsel for policy for Mr. Schneiderman, said Ms. James's bluntness had caused ""apprehension and uneasiness"" among some high-level officials who have left the office after her election.

""You've got to let the cases do the talking,"" said Mr. Soufer, now a managing director at Tusk Strategies, a political consulting group. ""She doesn't need to expose what she thinks about Donald Trump. What people want are results.""

Ms. James acknowledged that her words and promises would carry more weight as attorney general.

""I recognize that this is the premier law office in this nation,"" Ms. James said in the interview. ""I recognize that as the face of this office, one must be circumspect.""

Days later, Ms. James was back in attack mode, telling NBC News that she would use ""every area of the law to investigate President Trump and his business transactions and that of his family.""",1029868817
12,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/01/us/politics/joe-biden-presidential-campaign-2020.html,"When officials at the University of Utah invited Joseph R. Biden Jr. to speak there in December, Mr. Biden's representatives listed a number of requirements for the appearance. His booking firm, Creative Artists Agency, said the school would need to fly Mr. Biden and his aides to Salt Lake City by private plane. It would have to buy 1,000 copies of his recent memoir for distribution to the audience. There would be no insertion of the word ""former"" before ""vice president"" in social media promotions. And the speaking fee would be $100,000 -- ""a reduced rate,"" it was explained, for colleges and universities.

But three days before the event, Mr. Biden's aides learned that the public university would be using state funds to pay his fee. They already had a policy against taking tuition dollars, and decided that accepting taxpayer dollars for such a windfall might appear just as politically distasteful. Mr. Biden made the trip anyway but declined to take a check.

That costly last-minute reversal exposes the complicated balance Mr. Biden has attempted since leaving the vice presidency two years ago: between earning substantial wealth for the first time and maintaining viability as a potential 2020 presidential contender.

He has done so while building a network of nonprofits and academic centers that are staffed by his closest strategists and advisers, many making six figures while working on the issues most closely identified with him. It has effectively become a campaign-in-waiting, poised to metamorphose if the 76-year-old Mr. Biden announces his third bid for the presidency.

Mr. Biden is expected to reveal his plans early this year, after consulting with his family over the holidays. Having skipped the 2016 race after the grueling death of his elder son, Beau, from brain cancer, he would enter the coming Democratic contest as an early front-runner. With his political self-branding as ""Middle-Class Joe,"" he is seen by Democratic strategists as well equipped to make inroads into President Trump's base of blue-collar white voters.

By The New York Times

So long as a campaign remains possible, Mr. Biden has appeared mindful of the political backlash against the last Democratic nominee, Hillary Clinton, for earning millions by speaking to private interests in the run-up to 2016, and for her family foundation's acceptance of huge sums from corporate and foreign donors.

He has imposed telling restrictions on his moneymaking and fund-raising activities: Mr. Biden does not speak for pay to corporate, advocacy or foreign groups and does not consult or sit on boards, said Bill Russo, his spokesman. His nonprofits do not accept contributions from abroad, and the Biden Cancer Initiative does not take money from drug companies, he said.

Yet Mr. Biden, whose blue-collar roots have been central to his political persona through six terms in the Senate and two as vice president, has accumulated millions of dollars through a lucrative book deal and selective paid speaking.

He also has helped to start three foundations, a political action committee and academic centers at the Universities of Delaware and Pennsylvania. At least 49 staff or board members of the various Biden entities worked previously as aides or advisers to Mr. Biden, or held other positions in the Obama-Biden administration or campaigns. Their salaries and stipends consume a substantial share of the budgets of the six groups, including the philanthropic ones.

The list includes Mr. Biden's sister and longtime campaign manager, Valerie Biden Owens, who is vice chairwoman of both the Biden Institute at the University of Delaware and the Biden Foundation, as well as a paid consultant to the institute; Mike Donilon, his strategist across four decades and now the managing director of the institute and a consultant for Mr. Biden's PAC; and Steve Ricchetti, his vice-presidential chief of staff and now the managing director of the Penn Biden Center for Diplomacy and Global Engagement. Another longtime Biden operative, Joshua Alcorn, has been paid by Mr. Biden's PAC while serving as an executive at the Beau Biden Foundation for the Protection of Children.

The top compensation, as far as can be determined from Internal Revenue Service records, belongs to Gregory C. Simon, who was projected in a tax exemption application to receive $552,500 a year to run the cancer initiative. Mr. Biden selected Mr. Simon in the final year of the Obama administration to lead the White House Cancer Moonshot Task Force for less than 40 percent of that amount.

Mr. Biden declined through his spokesman to be interviewed about his post-vice-presidency. But several people close to him emphasized that he had built his mini-empire not to prepare for 2020 but to make a continuing contribution on matters of longstanding concern.

""They planned a lot of this under the assumption that Hillary Clinton would be president of the United States,"" said Sarah Bianchi, a former Biden policy aide who is now a paid senior adviser to the institute.

That said, some top staff members will undoubtedly decamp for a campaign if there is one, several advisers said. Whether all the groups could sustain operations is unclear, given that Mr. Biden could face pressure to suspend fund-raising to avoid improper influence.

During the 2018 cycle, Mr. Biden maintained visibility with campaign visits to 24 states and at least 135 other speaking engagements, giving him a platform whenever he wanted. At a book-related talk in Missoula, Mont., in early December, he fueled coast-to-coast speculation about his plans by declaring himself ""the most qualified person in the country to be president.""

Sources of Wealth

Mr. Biden has long been self-deprecating about his relative lack of wealth, compared with some politicians. He and his wife, Dr. Jill Biden, left office with assets worth between $277,000 and $955,000 (not including their house near Wilmington, Del.), as well as a mortgage of $500,000 to $1 million and other smaller loans, according to a 2015 federal disclosure. The report gives values in ranges.

But they have very likely earned more in the two years since leaving office than in the prior two decades, thanks largely to a three-book deal with Flatiron Books reported to be worth $8 million (a figure unconfirmed by the publisher). Two months after the contract was announced, they bought a six-bedroom vacation house in Rehoboth Beach, Del. -- off the water -- for $2.7 million. No mortgage was recorded.

Mr. Biden's only salaried work, according to Mr. Russo, is a Penn professorship that occupies about one day a week. Dr. Biden -- who is writing one of the three books -- earns $99,398 as an English professor at Northern Virginia Community College, state records show. Mr. Biden, who earned $230,700 a year as vice president, receives a hefty federal pension after 44 years of public service. The couple's last public tax return, from 2015, shows they receive about $66,000 a year in Social Security and other pension benefits.

Mr. Russo said Mr. Biden would be transparent about his finances if he ran. ""He will make available his tax returns, financial interests and other information that used to be -- and should once again become -- commonplace,"" he said, referring to Mr. Trump's defiance of a four-decade tradition of voluntary disclosure by presidents and many candidates.

Mr. Biden has restricted his paid speeches to about 40 ticketed shows and campus appearances, according to Mr. Russo. Most of have been shaped around a yearlong tour to promote his 2017 book ""Promise Me, Dad,"" a plain-spoken account of the final year of Beau Biden's life. It spent 11 weeks on the New York Times nonfiction best-seller list and has sold more than 300,000 copies, according to NPD PubTrack Digital.

Mr. Biden did make at least two corporate speeches, to conferences held by a financial services company and by the hedge fund led by Anthony Scaramucci, Mr. Trump's brief-tenured communications director. But he donated the fees to charity and passed on future corporate events, said a person close to him who was not authorized to speak by name.

Mr. Biden has spoken subsequently at events for advocacy and partisan groups or underwritten by corporations -- health care conferences; a banquet for the Charleston, S.C., branch of the N.A.A.C.P.; the Human Rights Campaign's national dinner -- but not for pay, Mr. Russo said.

Open records requests to public universities revealed that Mr. Biden had appeared at some without charge -- Rutgers in October 2017 and the University of Nevada, Las Vegas, last month. The Nevada school paid $225,000 to the Clinton Foundation for a speech by Mrs. Clinton in 2014.

Mr. Russo and Mr. Biden's representatives at Creative Artists declined to disclose his usual fees. But his contract with the University of Utah, obtained through the state's freedom of information act, was for $100,000, plus $10,000 for the private plane. In an October email between university officials, one told the other that an agent for Mr. Biden had described that as a discount.

The book events feature Mr. Biden being interviewed for an hour by another prominent figure, like the screenwriter Aaron Sorkin or the philanthropist Melinda Gates. Tickets for a recent appearance, in Burlington, Vt., cost $45 to $90, with a meet-and-greet package going for $375.

The Bidens pay a staff of five to handle scheduling, media and advance work through a Delaware firm they incorporated called CelticCapri, after his and her Secret Service code names.

Staffs of Allies

Nearly all of the former vice president's closest advisers are attached to one of his centers, full or part time.

Mr. Ricchetti, who has been gauging donor support for a Biden candidacy, is at the Penn Biden Center, a foreign policy think tank intended to give the university a higher profile in Washington. Others on the staff include Antony J. Blinken, who was Mr. Biden's national security adviser, and several regional policy experts.

At the Biden Institute at Mr. Biden's alma mater, the focus is on domestic issues including strengthening the middle class, gay and civil rights, and violence against women. It is housed within the school of public policy, which was recently renamed for him as well.

Administrators at both universities declined to provide budgets or salaries. Their presidents called Mr. Biden's contributions invaluable, particularly in luring dignitaries to their campuses. ""Among our strategic priorities is bringing Penn to the world and the world to Penn, and who better to do that?"" said Amy Gutmann, Penn's president.

Mr. Biden's PAC, American Possibilities, is led by Greg Schultz, a political operative who served as his senior White House adviser. The committee paid him $225,000 over 18 months, records show.

The PAC raised $2.5 million during the 2018 midterm cycle from contributors who included the technology entrepreneur Sean Parker and the Hollywood producers Steven Spielberg and Jeffrey Katzenberg. But only 21 percent of its spending was distributed to Democratic candidates and committees -- more than 120 in all -- while the rest went to salaries and expenses like Mr. Biden's travel.

There is modest overlap between Mr. Biden's political donors and the benefactors of the Biden Foundation, the only of his nonprofits that has voluntarily disclosed its donors. Notable is Tim Gill, a Colorado software entrepreneur and influential gay-rights activist, who, with his husband, is listed as giving at least $1 million to the foundation, as well as the maximum $10,000 each to the PAC.

The foundation is chaired by Ted Kaufman, Mr. Biden's chief of staff in the Senate and appointed successor after the 2008 election. With Mr. Biden's help, it raised $6.6 million in its first two years, including seven gifts of at least $500,000. The Bidens pitched in $100,000, according to Mr. Kaufman.

Staff compensation accounted for 42 percent of the foundation's $2.6 million in spending in 2017. That included $256,000 for the executive director, Louisa Terrell, who was deputy chief of Mr. Biden's Senate staff. The foundation's website now lists 16 staff members, including policy experts in areas like military families and violence against women.

""These are people who have been with him doing these kinds of things throughout his career,"" Mr. Russo said.

The Biden nonprofits are not traditional grant-makers, and the only one made by the Biden Foundation was nearly $500,000 to spin off the cancer initiative. That group took in $3.9 million in 2017, including three gifts from undisclosed donors worth at least $1 million, according to tax filings.

It spent $1.8 million, more than three-fourths of it on salaries and other compensation. That included Mr. Simon's package and a projected $292,500 for the vice president, Danielle Carnival, who had worked on cancer policy in the Obama White House.

At the Beau Biden Foundation, based in Wilmington, Del., salaries accounted for 45 percent of spending in 2016 and 2017, while grants accounted for less than 1 percent.

Those around Mr. Biden would not speculate about what might happen to the groups if he entered the 2020 race. But at least one set of plans has already been shelved.

When the Biden Foundation applied to the I.R.S. for tax-exempt status in February 2016, it stated that one mission would be to ""educate the public regarding Vice President Biden's career in public service"" by building ""a first-of-its-kind vice-presidential library and museum for the study of the vice presidency.""

Then Donald J. Trump was elected, perversely reviving Mr. Biden's three-decade dream of winning the presidency, a job that comes with its own library. ""Since that time,"" said Mark Gitenstein, the foundation's president, ""the board of the Biden Foundation determined that was no longer a relevant objective.""",1030664247
13,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/29/opinion/climate-change-global-warming-history.html,"Mr. Bledsoe lectures on environmental policy at American University.

Thirty years ago, a NASA scientist, James Hansen, told lawmakers at a Senate hearing that ""global warming is now large enough that we can ascribe with a high degree of confidence a cause-and-effect relationship with the greenhouse effect."" He added that there ""is only 1 percent chance of accidental warming of this magnitude.""

By that, he meant that humans were responsible.

His testimony made headlines around the United States and the world. But in the time since, greenhouse gas emissions, the global temperature average and cost of climate-related heat, wildfires, droughts, flooding and hurricanes have continued to rise.

This fall, the United Nations Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change released an alarming report warning that if emissions continue to rise at their present rate, the atmosphere will warm up by as much as 2.7 degrees Fahrenheit (1.5 degrees Celsius) above preindustrial levels by 2040, resulting in the flooding of coastlines, the killing of coral reefs worldwide, and more catastrophic droughts and wildfires.

To avoid this, greenhouse gas emissions would need to fall by nearly half from 2010 levels in the next 12 years and reach a net of zero by 2050. But in the United States, the world's second-largest emitter of greenhouse gases, President Trump continues to question the science of climate change, and his administration is rolling back emissions limits on power plants and fuel economy standards on cars and light trucks, while pushing to accelerate the use of fossil fuels. Other major nations around the world aren't cutting emissions quickly enough, either.

So what has happened over the last 30 years? Progress has been made in fits and starts, but not nearly enough has been done to confront the planet-altering magnitude of what we have unleashed. Here's a look at some of what has occurred:

1988

A report to Congress by the Environmental Protection Agency warns that global warming caused by industrial pollutants is likely to shrink forests, destroy most coastal wetlands, reduce water quality and quantity in many areas and otherwise cause extensive environmental disruption in the United States over the next century.

The United Nations and the World Meteorological Organization form the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change to report to world leaders on the science of climate change.

1989

Britain's prime minister, Margaret Thatcher, who earned a degree in chemistry at Oxford, tells the United Nations in a speech, ""We are seeing a vast increase in the amount of carbon dioxide reaching the atmosphere."" She warns that, as a result, ""change in future is likely to be more fundamental and more widespread than anything we have known hitherto."" She calls for a global treaty on climate change.

1990

In its first report, the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change says that ""human activities are substantially increasing the atmospheric concentrations of the greenhouse gases"" and will lead to a predicted ""increase of global mean temperature during the"" 21st century ""of about 0.3 degrees Celsius per decade,"" which it says is ""greater than that seen over the past 10,000 years."" That's a little more than a half-degree Fahrenheit per decade.

1991

An internal study by the oil giant Exxon finds that ""warming will clearly affect sea ice, icebergs, permafrost and sea levels"" in the Arctic and that ""higher sea levels and bigger waves"" could ""damage the company's existing and future coastal and offshore infrastructure.""

1992

The United States and 171 other nations, meeting at the Earth Summit in Brazil, sign a treaty on climate change to limit greenhouse gas emissions to a level that will not interfere with the planet's climate. But the deal lacks mechanisms to achieve that goal.

1993

President Bill Clinton proposes a federal tax on fossil energy sources to help reduce carbon dioxide emissions. The measure narrowly passes the House of Representatives but dies in the Senate; a gasoline tax increase of 4.3 cents per gallon becomes law instead, the last time federal energy taxes have been raised.

1994

An Earth Summit agreement, approved by 166 counties, enters into force, committing nations to ""stabilizing greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system.""

1995

Countries that signed the Earth Summit agreement in 1992 agree to negotiate ""binding targets"" on emissions for major developed countries like the United States, but set significantly less stringent requirements for developing countries like China and India.

1996

Climate change plays almost no role in the presidential campaign, with no mentions in the presidential debates and only a passing reference in the vice-presidential debate.

1997

Concentrations of carbon dioxide, the main greenhouse gas, reach the highest levels in at least 400,000 years, as measured in Arctic ice cores.

More than 1,500 scientists from 63 countries, including 110 Nobel Prize winners, issue a call to action: ""A broad consensus among the world's climatologists is that there is now a discernible human influence on global climate"" that represents ""one of the most serious threats to the planet and to future generations.""

One hundred and ninety-two nations agree to the Kyoto Protocol to fight global warming. The agreement requires the United States and other developed countries to cut greenhouse gas emissions, but not developing countries like China.

1998

The global average temperature of 58 degrees Fahrenheit is the warmest since reliable records began about 120 years ago.

Industry opponents of the Kyoto Protocol draft a proposal to spend millions of dollars to convince the public that the environmental accord is based on shaky science.

2000

In the presidential campaign, George W. Bush, the Republican nominee, promises to cut carbon dioxide emissions from power plants, while Al Gore, the Democratic candidate, calls for aggressive climate policies but does not make climate change a major campaign issue and mentions it only once in the debates.

2001

Under strong pressure from conservative Republicans and industry groups, President Bush says his administration will not seek to regulate emissions of carbon dioxide from power plants. reversing a campaign pledge. He also says he will seek to withdraw the United States from the Kyoto climate accord and that the United States will not comply with its emissions-reduction targets.

China declines to slow the rapid growth of its greenhouse gas emissions.

2002

President Bush proposes a voluntary plan involving tax credits and other incentives to encourage businesses and farmers to reduce their greenhouse gas emissions.

2003

The Senate votes 55 to 43 against a bill sponsored by Senator John McCain, a Republican from Arizona, and Senator Joe Lieberman, a Democrat from Connecticut, to limit carbon dioxide emissions by creating a market-driven ""cap and trade"" program. Only four Republicans vote yes.

The Republican campaign adviser Frank Luntz writes a memo to party officials noting: ""Should the public come to believe that the scientific issues are settled, their views about global warming will change accordingly. Therefore, you need to continue to make the lack of scientific certainty a primary issue.""

2004

Climate scientists across the globe overwhelming agree that evidence of climate change is clear and persuasive, according to a detailed analysis in Science Magazine by the science historian Naomi Oreskes. As she puts it: ""Many details about climate interactions are not well understood, and there are ample grounds for continued research to provide a better basis for understanding climate dynamics. The question of what to do about climate change is also still open. But there is a scientific consensus on the reality of anthropogenic climate change. Climate scientists have repeatedly tried to make this clear. It is time for the rest of us to listen.""

2005

At a climate conference in Montreal, the United States and China refuse to agree to take mandatory steps to reduce greenhouse gas emissions.

Congress passes an energy policy act that provides tax and other incentives for some low emissions energy sources, including nuclear power, hydropower and wind and solar power. But it also continues large subsidies for fossil fuels.

2006

With its rapid industrialization, China surpasses the United States as the world's biggest emitter of greenhouse gases.

2007

Congress raises auto fuel efficiency standards for the first time since 1976.

2008

Barack Obama and John McCain, the Democratic and Republican presidential candidates, endorse limiting greenhouse gas emissions through cap-and-trade legislation.

2009

The House of Representatives passes a cap-and-trade bill that would require cuts in greenhouse gas emissions of 17 percent below 2005 levels by 2020 and 83 percent by 2050. Only eight Republicans vote yes. The bill never receives a vote in the Senate, even though Democrats control 57 seats and two independents caucus with them.

The American Petroleum Institute, funded by major oil companies, helps organize and pay for the first Tea Party rallies, including protests against the House-passed cap-and-trade legislation.

President Obama says the United States will cut greenhouse gas emissions by 17 percent below 2005 levels by 2020 as part of the Copenhagen Accord signed by 193 nations. Large developing nations, including China, also pledge reductions, though they are voluntary.

2010

The International Energy Agency reports that global energy-related emissions of carbon dioxide hit a high of 30.6 billion tons, an increase of 1.6 billion tons over 2009.

President Obama reaches an agreement with American auto companies to raise fuel efficiency standards to 54 miles per gallon by 2025, the largest emissions-cutting action of his presidency.

2011

More than half of all carbon dioxide emissions from fossil fuels combustion since the Industrial Revolution began in 1751 have occurred just since the mid-1980s, according to a study by scientists for the United States government.

Greenhouse gas emissions in the United States decline slightly, but China's have increased by about 170 percent since 1999.

2012

In his acceptance speech to become the Republican presidential nominee, Mitt Romney mocks President Obama's climate efforts: ""President Obama promised to slow the rise of the oceans and to heal the planet. My promise is to help you and your family.""

2013

Scientists report that concentrations of carbon dioxide reached a record 400 parts per million in the atmosphere, the highest levels in at least three million years, before human beings evolved, and that global emissions rose by 60 percent between 1990 and 2013.

In his second Inaugural Address, President Obama calls climate change the leading issue of our time. ""We will respond to the threat of climate change, knowing that failure to do so would betray our children and future generations.""

More than 60 percent of all carbon dioxide emissions come from six nations: China, 30 percent; the United States, 16 percent; India, 6 percent; Russia, 5 percent; Japan, 4 percent; and Germany, 3 percent.

2014

President Obama and President Xi Jinping of China announce limits on greenhouse gas emissions; the United States agrees to cut emissions by 26 to 28 percent below 2005 levels by 2025; China says it will begin scaling back emissions before 2030. The agreement sets the stage for a global climate deal.

A United Nations study finds that even if global greenhouse gas emissions are cut to the level required to keep temperature rise below 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit or 2 degrees Celsius, the cost of climate change adaptation in developing countries is likely to reach two to three times previous estimates of $70 billion to $100 billion per year by 2050

2015

The Paris climate accord is approved by 195 nations, including the United States, marking the first time that all major nations pledge to make emissions reductions to limit the global average temperature increase to less than 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit.

The Republican-controlled Congress votes to phase out tax credits for wind and solar energy by 2020; various tax incentives for fossil fuel production remain. President Obama signs the bill, citing support from the renewable energy industry.

2016

2016 is the warmest year on record, the third consecutive year that a global annual temperature record has been set, and the 40th consecutive year that annual temperatures have been above the 20th-century average. The five warmest years have all occurred since 2010.

James Hansen and other scientists publish research finding that current global temperatures are the highest in at least 115,000 years, when sea levels were 20 to 30 feet higher than today.

Nearly all of the 16 Republican presidential hopefuls deny the science of climate change, and none support the Paris climate agreement. Donald Trump pledges to ""cancel"" American involvement in the Paris accord.

Not a single question on climate change is asked by moderators in any of the four presidential or vice-presidential debates.

The United States joins with 189 other countries to phase out hydrofluorocarbons, gases used as refrigerants, a move that will stave off nearly a degree Fahrenheit of warming by 2100.

Mr. Trump is elected president following a campaign in which he called for more fossil fuel drilling, fewer environmental regulations and vowed to pull the United States out of the Paris climate accord. ""Regulations that shut down hundreds of coal-fired power plants and block the construction of new ones -- how stupid is that?"" Mr. Trump asked during the campaign.

2017

Following up on his campaign promises, President Trump signs an executive order directing his administration to undo regulations to cut emissions from the electric power sector; orders the resumption of the federal coal leasing program; says he will seek to weaken fuel economy standards for cars and light trucks; and proposes to cut the budget of the Environmental Protection Agency by 30 percent. He also says he will withdraw the United States from the Paris climate accord.

Hurricane Harvey unleashes 50 inches of rain, the largest rainfall in United States history, paralyzing five million in Houston, killing 30, with a price tag of at least tens of billions of dollars to federal taxpayers. Multiple peer-reviewed studies find that Hurricane Harvey was made as much as 40 percent larger and more intense because of warming Gulf of Mexico waters tied to the changing climate.

More than 30 leading climate science and policy experts, including Nobel Prize winners, say that limiting global temperatures to below 3.6 degrees Fahrenheit will require removing fossil fuels from the global energy system by 2050, reducing emissions of super greenhouse gas pollutants like HFCs, methane and black carbon rapidly by 2030, and extracting carbon dioxide directly from the atmosphere.

2018

Concentrations of carbon dioxide in the atmosphere reach 410 parts per million, the highest level in at least three million years

President Trump insists coal is the key to the country's energy and economic future and orders Energy Secretary Rick Perry to take immediate steps to prevent market shutdowns of coal plants.

The Trump administration says it will roll back fuel economy standards set by the Obama administration for cars and light trucks, a move that would increase greenhouse gas emissions in the United States by an amount greater than many midsize countries put out in a year.

In another move to undo the Obama climate legacy, the Trump administration proposes letting states set their own coal emissions regulations, upending rules to reduce carbon dioxide emissions from coal-fired power plants. Many experts say this will cause greenhouse gas emissions from the power sector to begin rising for the first time in decades.

After falling for more than a decade, carbon dioxide emissions in the United States are set to rise by 2.5 percent in 2018. Global emissions grew by 1.6 percent in 2017 and will increase by about 2.7 percent in 2018.

Go. Jerry Brown of California signs legislation requiring that 100 percent of the state's electricity come from carbon-free sources by 2045.

Thirteen federal agencies present the starkest warnings to date of the consequences of climate change for the United States, predicting in a report that if significant steps are not taken to rein in global warming, the damage will knock as much as 10 percent off the size of the American economy by century's end. The report warns of devastating effects on the economy, health and the environment, including record wildfires in California, crop failures in the Midwest and crumbling infrastructure in the South.

An international team of scientists finds a growing likelihood that runaway warming could destabilize the entire global climate system and lead to a ""Hothouse Earth"" that in the long term will push global average temperatures to seven to nine degrees Fahrenheit warmer than preindustrial temperatures, with seas 60 to 200 feet higher than today. ""Humanity is now facing the need for critical decisions and actions that could influence our future for centuries, if not millennia,"" the scientists write.

14,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/17/magazine/democrats-trump-investigation.html,"At noon on Jan. 3, the 435 members of the House of Representatives of the 116th Congress will convene for the first time in the Capitol. The chaplain will offer a prayer, the clerk will lead the chamber in the Pledge of Allegiance and a roll-call vote will be held to elect Nancy Pelosi speaker of the House. Then the new speaker will grasp the gavel and swear in the representatives-elect -- their right hands raised, some of them clutching Bibles or Torahs or Qurans in their left. There will be speeches and family photos and, among the Democrats, who will now be in the majority, much celebration. But before any of that happens, Representative Elijah Cummings will have sent out letters.

One letter will have been jointly addressed to Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen and acting Attorney General Matthew Whitaker, demanding the age, gender, country of origin and current location of every child who was separated from his or her parents under the Trump administration's immigration policy. Another will have gone to Pat Cipollone, the White House counsel, asking for the identities of any senior White House officials who have used -- as Hillary Clinton once did -- nongovernment email accounts to conduct official business.

The White House chief of staff will have received a letter, also addressed to the heads of multiple federal agencies, requesting information and documents about the use of government-owned aircraft for personal travel and private aircraft for official travel. Outside the government, the Trump Organization will have received one asking for a complete accounting of all the payments it has received from foreign governments or foreign-government-owned entities since Donald Trump's election. Each letter will have been written on stationery bearing the seal of the House of Representatives Committee on Oversight and Government Reform and signed with Cummings's looping signature over the word: ""Chairman-designate.""

Elected to the House in 1996, Cummings, 67, represents a majority-African-American district anchored in Baltimore. He is a son of two former sharecroppers turned Pentecostal ministers; his bald head and booming baritone project a ministerial -- and authoritative -- presence. Until now, Cummings's greatest national renown came in 2015: During the riots that followed Freddie Gray's death from injuries he sustained in a Baltimore police van, Fox News broadcast live coverage of the congressman walking through the city's streets, bullhorn in hand, urging calm and shouting at protesters to go home.

""I'm not trying to do anything extraordinary,"" Cummings told me of the letters. ""I'm trying to do what the Constitution says I'm supposed to do."" It was election night, and he was at a small party in Baltimore, where he had just been informed by a colleague, Representative John Sarbanes of Maryland, that the networks were declaring that Democrats would have a majority in the House of Representatives for the first time since 2011. ""Mr. Chairman!"" Sarbanes said in breaking the news.

The midterm results effectively brought an end to Trump's legislative agenda, or at least the parts of it that Democrats find objectionable. But the victory gives Democrats little legislative power of their own. If by some miracle any Democrat-authored House bill makes it through the Republican-controlled Senate, Trump's veto pen awaits.

What the House Democrats will have, however, is oversight authority: the ability to hold hearings and request documents and, if necessary, issue subpoenas to uncover and expose all the incompetence and misconduct and outright corruption that they suspect permeates the executive branch under the current occupant of the White House. ""Make no mistake, Democrats will honor our constitutional responsibility to exercise oversight of the Trump administration and get the American people the answers they deserve,"" Pelosi said in a statement. ""Voters delivered a check and balance on the president that will hold him and his administration accountable for the abuses of power and culture of corruption that have consumed Washington."" Trump is already besieged by the investigation led by Robert Mueller, the special counsel, into Russian interference in the 2016 elections and by multiple probes by the United States attorney's office for the Southern District of New York into his family business. In January, he will face a Democratic-controlled House of Representatives that suddenly has the power to open a third investigative front against him -- power that will reside, in large part, in Cummings's office.

That power is both broad and subtle. The Oversight and Government Reform Committee's mandate is investigation,across the whole range of federal government operations -- and even into the private sector. (The three-year congressional investigation into the use of steroids in Major League Baseball in the 2000s was a House Oversight production.) Other committees have the power to investigate, too, but none have so expansive a remit. ""Oversight,"" says former Representative Henry Waxman of California, the Democratic chairman of the committee from 2007 to 2009, ""has jurisdiction over the world.""

This has given Cummings's predecessors a unique ability to shape the public perception of recent presidencies -- particularly when, as will be the case in January, it is a president of the other party. Many of the familiar details of the George W. Bush administration's outing of the covert C.I.A. agent Valerie Plame, emergency-response failures during Hurricane Katrina and disastrous reconstruction of Iraq were ferreted out by Waxman, who led the Oversight and Government Reform Committee for the last two years of Bush's second term. The congressional investigations of the Obama administration -- into claims that the Internal Revenue Service targeted Tea Party groups and that the Justice Department allowed guns to be illegally trafficked across the Mexican border -- that dominated Fox News chyrons after Republicans took back the House in 2011 were started by Waxman's Republican successor, Darrell Issa.

As a rule, the Oversight and Government Reform Committee is a sleepy place when the same party controls Congress and the White House. But even by these standards, the committee's performance during the first two years of the Trump administration has been unusual. Under the chairmanship of Representative Jason Chaffetz of Utah and then, after Chaffetz resigned in June 2017 and took a job at Fox News, Representative Trey Gowdy of South Carolina, the committee essentially turned a blind eye toward the executive branch. On matters big (like the firing of the F.B.I. director, James Comey, or the administration's botched response to Hurricane Maria) and comparatively small (like Trump's decision to revoke the security clearance of the former C.I.A. director John Brennan), the Oversight Committee did not seem interested in doing much real oversight.

""If the president's party on Capitol Hill becomes subservient to the executive branch and just becomes an appendage of that, then Congress basically loses its meaning,"" Tom Davis, the Virginia Republican who was chairman of the committee during part of Bush's presidency, from 2003 to 2007, told me. ""We turn into a parliamentary operation."" Norman Ornstein, a congressional scholar at the American Enterprise Institute, puts it even more bluntly. ""Looking back over the first two years of the administration,"" he says, ""I can't point to a single example, House or Senate, where any committee or subcommittee actually fulfilled its role of doing oversight.""

Over the past two years, as the committee's ranking member, Cummings issued 64 subpoena requests; they were requests because the minority party can't issue subpoenas without the majority's approval. Chaffetz and Gowdy rejected them all. And even when Chaffetz or Gowdy did ask the Trump administration for information, they didn't push very hard. ""I was able to get them to jointly request documents that we needed to do our job,"" Cummings told me, ""but when the administration basically said, 'Screw you' -- and the administration basically said that to every request -- they refused to back it up with a subpoena."" Indeed, the first requests Cummings will send out as the incoming Oversight chairman -- the letters about family separation, nongovernment emails and government-owned aircraft for personal travel -- will be those that Chaffetz and Gowdy jointly sent with him over the past two years and that the administration largely ignored.

At the time, Cummings counseled his Republican colleagues to put aside the politics of the moment and to think long-term. ""I get in these guys' ears, and I talk to them heart to heart,"" Cummings says. ""I told them, 'Trump is 72. I'm 67. You all are still young guys. Why are you trying to carry this guy's water? After he's dead, you're going to be living with this [expletive].' ""

Congress's oversight responsibilities originated from an incident on Nov. 4, 1791, when a 1,400-soldier military expedition led by Arthur St. Clair, then governor of the Northwest Territory and a former general officer in the Continental Army during the Revolutionary War, was routed in what is now Ohio by a confederacy of warriors from three Native American tribes. Nearly 700 soldiers were killed and 300 wounded. The House of Representatives established a select committee to investigate the defeat and authorized it to ""call for such persons, papers and records as may be necessary to assist their inquiries."" President George Washington was initially concerned that Congress had overstepped its bounds. But after Washington's cabinet -- including Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson and Treasury Secretary Alexander Hamilton -- unanimously counseled him otherwise, he agreed to cooperate with the investigation, turning over the documents that had been requested.

In the 226 years since the committee investigated -- and ultimately absolved -- St. Clair, Congress has performed its oversight and investigative functions with varying degrees of enthusiasm, competence and responsibility. For every Senate investigation into the Teapot Dome scandal -- which brought down Albert Fall, Warren Harding's secretary of the interior, in 1923 for accepting hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes from oil barons -- there's Senator Joseph McCarthy's use of his chairmanship of the Committee on Government Operations in the 1950s to search for Communists in the government.

In the decades after Watergate, both the Senate and the House conducted rigorous, and bipartisan, investigations into topics including intelligence-agency abuses and military-procurement fraud, producing meaningful reforms in the process. That heyday came to an end, however, when Republicans took back the House in 1995, giving them control of it for the first time in 40 years. Once Newt Gingrich was installed as House speaker, he merged several House committees with responsibilities to monitor government agencies into a single panel, naming it the Government Reform and Oversight Committee.

The new committee had the broadest oversight jurisdiction of any in Congress -- a power Gingrich quickly weaponized against the Clinton administration. He filled over half the G.O.P.'s committee seats with freshmen who arrived on the wave of his Republican revolution, and in 1997 made Representative Dan Burton of Indiana its chairman. An ardent Clinton foe, Burton had already proposed investigating the suicide of the deputy White House counsel Vince Foster -- Burton infamously conducted amateur forensics tests, reportedly by shooting melons in his backyard -- and how much money the White House was spending on postage to respond to letters that children had written to the Clintons' pet cat, Socks.

In his six years as chairman, Burton issued more than 1,000 unilateral subpoenas and demanded everything down to the White House holiday-card list. But his Javert act ultimately became too much even for Republicans. For all his exertions, Burton proved unable to find concrete evidence of serious wrongdoing on the part of the Clinton administration. He repeatedly undermined himself, as in 1998 when one of his top aides -- Trump's future deputy campaign manager David Bossie -- released transcripts of the jailhouse phone conversations of Hillary Clinton's old law partner and former Associate Attorney General Webb Hubbell, who was convicted of fraud for overbilling clients, that seemed to implicate Clinton in the overbilling. Democrats later showed that the transcripts had been misleadingly edited, and Bossie was pressured to resign. ""We'd just put our foot out,"" recalls Henry Waxman, who was the top Democrat on the committee during Burton's chairmanship, ""and he'd trip over it."" Gingrich eventually stopped giving sensitive investigative assignments to Burton's Oversight Committee.

In 2003, Tom Davis took over as the Oversight Committee chairman and established what became the standard mode of low-key defense when the chairman's own party is in the White House. ""I had to show the party flag,"" Davis says of fighting off some Democratic demands for investigations of the Bush administration. But when it came to big issues -- like the Bush administration's slow and poorly executed response to Hurricane Katrina in 2005 or the disgraced lobbyist Jack Abramoff's contacts with President Bush and other White House officials -- Davis, much to the consternation of some of his fellow Republicans, led rigorous investigations. ""He had a concern about oversight,"" Waxman says, ""and he thought the questions we wanted to pursue were legitimate and worthwhile.""

After Democrats took back the House in the 2006 midterms, Waxman became Oversight Committee chairman. He was an aggressive but careful investigator; unlike Burton, he didn't initiate an inquiry at the first whiff of scandal, nor did he succumb to some of his Democratic constituents' blood lust. ""I'd go to some of the Democratic clubs back home, and people would say, 'Why haven't you imprisoned George W. Bush?' "" Waxman recalls. ""I had to tell them we don't have the power to imprison people. There was a widespread belief that there's a prison right there in the Capitol.""

But Waxman's investigations into the failures of the Coalition Provisional Authority in Iraq, profiteering by the military contractor Blackwater and the Federal Emergency Management Agency's dangerous policy of housing families displaced by Hurricane Katrina in trailers with unhealthful levels of formaldehyde, among others, harked back to the heyday of post-Watergate oversight. His hearings calling executives from A.I.G. and Lehman Brothers to testify about their role in the 2008 financial crisis helped lay the groundwork for Congress's most substantial attempt in decades to rein in the financial sector, the Dodd-Frank Wall Street Reform and Consumer Protection Act.

One of Waxman's most trusted lieutenants on the Oversight Committee was Cummings, who proved so adept at political theater that Waxman and his staff often relied on him to ask the most crucial questions of hostile witnesses testifying before the committee. Even today, Oversight veterans speak in awed tones about a 2007 hearing when Cummings questioned the State Department's inspector general, Howard Krongard, about claims that he impeded a federal investigation into Blackwater. During testimony, Cummings informed Krongard that committee staff had discovered that Krongard's brother was at a Blackwater advisory board meeting in Williamsburg, Va.: ""This meeting is taking place right now,"" Cummings said, ""as we speak."" Krongard resigned from the State Department a few weeks later. ""It was like a Perry Mason moment,"" Waxman says.

During their years in the minority, Cummings and his roughly 35-person committee staff, led by its director, David Rapallo, became skilled at conducting investigations without much political or legal leverage. In 2017, a Democratic investigator for the Oversight Committee, scrutinizing Michael Flynn, Trump's first national-security adviser, reviewed Flynn's 2016 security clearance renewal application and noticed that Flynn took a trip to Saudi Arabia in 2015 -- during which he claimed to stay at a hotel that did not exist and to attend a conference that did not occur. Robert Mueller went on to investigate Flynn's suspected efforts to broker a $100 billion energy deal between Saudi Arabia and Russia's nuclear-power agency.

Combing through the unpublished supporting evidence of an inspector general's report, Democratic committee staff found emails that appeared to show that Trump, in spite of his own denials, had ordered the reversal of plans to move the F.B.I. headquarters to a suburban location and off Pennsylvania Avenue, where it currently sits across from the Trump Hotel -- a reversal that would benefit his hotel by preventing commercial developers from building a competing property across the street. ""The Cummings people did a lot of great investigative work without formal tools,"" says Phil Barnett, who was the staff director of the Oversight Committee under Waxman. ""Now they will have formal tools.""

In September, Pelosi invited Cummings to her Capitol office, along with two other Democratic congressmen who, if the party won the House in November, would become chairmen of committees with powerful investigative mandates: New York's Jerrold Nadler, of the Judiciary Committee, and California's Adam Schiff, of the Intelligence Committee. There they were joined by several Democratic representatives who worked previously as prosecutors: Joe Kennedy of Massachusetts, Dutch Ruppersberger of Maryland and Eric Swalwell of California. Pelosi told the group that they shouldn't take the outcome of the midterms for granted. At the same time, she said, the Democrats needed to begin thinking about how they would conduct oversight of the Trump administration -- and the strategizing needed to start now.

Like Cummings, Nadler and Schiff chafed at their committees' Republican chairmen's lack of interest and outright interference during the Trump presidency. Mueller's investigators have spent months building an increasingly sweeping case about Russian meddling in the 2016 elections, implicating and indicting several of Trump's closest associates to date. But under the chairmanship of the Republican Devin Nunes of California, the House Intelligence Committee -- which has a clear constitutional authority to conduct some of the same investigatory work as Mueller -- produced a report that breezily concluded that there was no collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russian government and that, contrary to the official consensus of the American intelligence community, the Russian government was not even seeking to help elect Trump. Committee Democrats said they were shut out of the drafting process and publicly condemned the report.

Nunes also initiated parallel investigations of the F.B.I. and the Justice Department for what he claimed was ""criminal activity and fraudulent behavior"" in an effort to hurt Trump's campaign -- investigations that Schiff contends ""I think that the mission for the chairman has been protecting the White House, protecting the president and furthering a political narrative which is completely at odds with the facts,"" Schiff told me.

When Immigration and Customs Enforcement, following a new and unprecedented Trump administration policy, separated more than 2,300 immigrant children from their families at the Southern border this spring, the Republican-led Judiciary Committee did not hold a single oversight hearing for Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, whose agency falls under the committee's oversight jurisdiction. Other committees, too, had their own lists of Trump-administration oversight oversights: the Natural Resources Committee's lack of interest in Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke's suspected ethical and managerial misdeeds, which have been the subject of at least 17 federal investigations, for instance; or the Veterans Affairs Committee's refusal to look into whether three Trump friends, all Mar-a-Lago members, improperly influenced a $10 billion contract to modernize veterans' health care records. ""The oversight job, after two years of Donald Trump,"" says Representative Jamie Raskin, a Maryland Democrat who serves on both the Oversight and Judiciary Committees, ""is like coming upon a 73-car pileup on the highway.""

With so many targets, and so many hungry Democrats, ""there's the potential for oversight fratricide next year,"" says a senior Democratic official on the Intelligence Committee, noting the overlapping jurisdictions of the various committees. There's also the potential for distraction. ""The question is, do you want to be the Breaking News Committee that just investigates the issue of the day?"" asks Swalwell, who sits on the Judiciary and Intelligence Committees. ""Or do you want to look at broader, longstanding core issues?"" At that September meeting and at multiple gatherings of members and their staffs over the subsequent weeks and months, an initial strategy -- and a division of labor -- began to take shape.

Schiff, the incoming Intelligence Committee chairman, will play a major role. One of his top priorities will be protecting -- and assisting -- Mueller's investigation, and one of his first acts in the new Congress will be trying to get to the bottom of one of the more tantalizing mysteries of the whole Russia affair: Whom did Donald Trump Jr. speak to on his phone in between calls setting up the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting with Russians peddling dirt on Hillary Clinton? Trump Jr. claims he can't remember, and the call appears as a blocked number on his phone records. Nunes refused to ask Trump Jr.'s cellular provider for the blocked number. ""That phone call may lead to a place the Republicans didn't want to go,"" Schiff says, ""and so they were unwilling to get the answer."" Schiff wants the answer and will press the provider for it.

Nunes's investigation may not have produced much, but under his leadership, the committee did conduct hundreds of hours of interviews: with Trump Jr., Jared Kushner, Roger Stone and other key figures in the Russia matter. On Nunes's orders, almost all the transcripts have remained in the sole possession of the committee, which has, among other things, kept them out of the hands of Mueller's investigators. Schiff plans to publicly release the remaining transcripts when the new Congress convenes in January.

In November, Michael Cohen, Trump's former lawyer, pleaded guilty to lying to Congress about a Moscow real estate project Trump pursued. Cohen was caught by Mueller's investigators only because he publicly released his opening statement to the Intelligence Committee. Referring to the unreleased transcripts, Swalwell told me: ""I just wonder how many more crimes are just sitting in the basement of the House Intelligence Committee that Mueller doesn't know about because he hasn't seen that they lied to us.""

Schiff is also interested in examining Trump's business dealings -- including whether Russians laundered money through the Trump Organization -- from a counterintelligence perspective. ""What would be most compromising to our nation and our national security is if a hostile foreign power has leverage over the president of the United States,"" Schiff told me. Or as the senior Democratic Intelligence Committee official says: ""Whenever Putin is alone in a room with Trump with just the two of them and their translators, like they were in Helsinki, is Putin reminding him that he has an Excel spreadsheet of how many rubles are parked in Trump Tower?""

One afternoon in late November, Nadler, the incoming Judiciary Committee chairman, was in his congressional office. The walls were bare, save some exposed nails. All the pictures and framed bills that once hung on them were piled in a plastic-lined dumpster in the reception area -- ""Jerry's bucket of achievements,"" Daniel Schwarz, Nadler's communications director, joked. Nadler was in the process of moving to a space closer to the Judiciary Committee's offices.

The congressman from the Upper West Side became the top Democrat on the committee in December 2017 after John Conyers, the long-serving Michigan representative, resigned from Congress over sexual-harassment claims. Nadler has been a Trump bête noire since the 1980s, when, as an assemblyman, he fought to prevent Trump from building a proposed 150-story building in his district, where Trump hoped to live in an apartment on the top floor. After his election to Congress in 1992, Nadler made sure Trump didn't receive federal mortgage guarantees for the project. ""I didn't want him to be the tallest man in the world there,"" Nadler told me. Trump described Nadler in his 2000 book, ""The America We Deserve,"" as ""one of the most egregious hacks in contemporary politics.""

The Judiciary Committee is endowed with the authority to start impeachment proceedings against a president, as committee Republicans did against Bill Clinton in 1998, and as committee Democrats did against Nixon in 1973. Nadler is thus probably the committee chairman most likely to find himself caught between the expectations of the Democratic base and the political and institutional realities their representatives are now subject to.

""If they're successful at doing their jobs, then they'll bring forth more information about Trump's wrongdoing, and the logical conclusion will be impeachment,"" says Kevin Mack, lead strategist for the liberal billionaire Tom Steyer's group Need to Impeach, which has gathered nearly 6.5 million signatures supporting Trump's impeachment. And if Democrats don't impeach Trump? ""What you're saying by not attempting to stand up for the rule of law is that the rule of law is not the most important thing to you,"" Steyer told me. ""Complaining about something is not doing something about it.""

When Nadler ran to succeed Conyers as the top Democrat on the Judiciary Committee, his pitch included a leaflet he wrote and distributed to his fellow Democrats, which said that he was ""our strongest member to lead a potential impeachment."" Since clinching the chairmanship, however, Nadler has become much more circumspect, at least publicly, about impeachment. ""It's too early,"" he told me in November. ""It's a very momentous step. It has real consequences."" Even if Robert Mueller or congressional Democrats uncover what he concludes are impeachable offenses, Nadler told me, he would want to begin impeachment proceedings only if he believes that, by the end of the process, there would be an ""appreciable fraction of the Trump voters"" who support Trump's impeachment.

""You don't want to tear the country apart,"" Nadler said. ""You don't want a situation where for the next 30 years half the country is saying, 'We won the election; you stole it from us.' "" He added an interesting caveat, however: ""Now notice I didn't say an appreciable fraction of Republican senators. It's the Trump voters. Because it might be -- I'm not saying it is, but it might be -- that the Republican Party becomes so one-sided, or such a cult group in effect, that no matter what the evidence is, no matter what the malfeasances are, they"" -- Republican senators -- ""would never agree to break from the president.""

Still, as he sat in his emptying office, Nadler did not sound like someone eager to lead a potential impeachment. ""The fact that you find impeachable offenses and the fact that you think you can prove impeachable offenses,"" he said, ""doesn't necessarily mean the offenses rise to the level of importance where you should impeach."" When I spoke to Nadler a couple of weeks later, after federal prosecutors said that Trump directed Michael Cohen to make payments in violation of campaign-finance laws to squelch a sex scandal, he still sounded cautious. ""I don't think things have changed, really,"" Nadler said. ""We know a little more, but there's a lot more to know.""

In the days after the election, Nadler began firing off ""preservation letters"" to the White House, the Justice Department and other agencies warning them that ""concealing, removing or destroying"" any documents related to Jeff Sessions's firing or Mueller's investigation ""may constitute a crime."" In January, the committee's first order of business, Nadler said, will be to call Matthew Whitaker, the acting attorney general, to testify; Whitaker, who has a thin legal résumé, was tapped by Trump to replace Sessions and will hold the job until the official nominee for attorney general, William Barr, is confirmed by the Senate. From the moment Whitaker was appointed, Nadler told me, ""It was clear that Trump wanted him to be his hatchet man."" When Whitaker comes before the committee, Nadler said, he will ask him: ""Have you told Mueller not to follow some line of inquiry? Have you told him not to indict somebody? What instructions have you given to him, if any? Have you communicated with the White House about these matters in any way or with the president's lawyers in any way? What have you told them? Those kinds of questions.""

Nadler's to-do list goes far beyond Whitaker. There is the Justice Department's decision not to defend the Affordable Care Act in a lawsuit brought by Republican state attorneys general; the Trump administration's family-separation policy; whether the White House improperly interfered with the F.B.I.'s background check into Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh.

""In the last two years, the Republicans in Congress, their basic idea has been: Let the Trump administration do what it wants, let there be no oversight,"" Nadler said. In a normal presidency, this would have been problematic, but with Trump in the White House, Nadler argued, ""there are real challenges to the democratic norms that we haven't seen the likes of since the Civil War."" The result, he said, is that ""we have a real crisis now.""

On the last Thursday in November, the House Oversight Committee held what was most likely its final hearing of the year, and Cummings's final hearing as the ranking member. It was devoted to the 2017 hurricane season and the Trump administration's response to Hurricane Maria, and Cummings believed it was long overdue. He initially asked Gowdy to hold hearings on the matter back in September 2017, nine days after Maria devastated Puerto Rico. Gowdy refused and continued to turn down requests for a hearing for more than a year. Now Gowdy had finally scheduled the hearing in the lame-duck session on a day Democrats were holding their leadership elections. As a result, when the hearing began, only six of the committee's 41 members were present.

""Our Republican colleagues have promised to accommodate us, and I appreciate it,"" Cummings said when it was his turn to speak, ""but they would not move the hearing to a different day, and they would not even move up the start time by 30 minutes so we could ask Administrator Long our questions."" He was referring to the head of FEMA, Brock Long, who was testifying that day. He lit into Gowdy. ""I greatly respect the chairman, as a person, as an attorney and as a friend, but this is not transparency, this is not accountability and this is certainly not oversight.""

If Cummings is perceptive of the tactics being used against him to defend a president, it's because, not so long ago, he was the one doing the protecting. He became the top Democrat on the committee when Republicans took back the House in the 2010 midterms, and the new chairman, Darrell Issa, promised to hold hundreds of hearings into the Obama administration. Cummings was the first line of defense against the coming investigative onslaught. ""Mr. Cummings was very smart and deliberate and methodical, and was a perfect foil to Darrell,"" says Kurt Bardella, Issa's former spokesman and later a spokesman for Breitbart, who last year renounced the G.O.P. and became a Democrat. Cummings batted back Republicans' most incendiary charges against Obama by pointing to the lack of any real evidence, and repeatedly provoked Issa into own goals, like the time Issa received negative coverage for ordering Cummings's microphone cut off when Cummings tried to make a statement at the end of a hearing.

Cummings proved a similarly effective opponent to Gowdy on the special committee investigating the 2012 attack on the United States mission in Benghazi, Libya -- which Gowdy led and on which Cummings was the top Democrat -- and then to Chaffetz, who succeeded Issa as Oversight Committee chairman. Cummings's friends are quick to point out that Issa, Chaffetz and Gowdy will not be serving in the next Congress. ""They all quit after having to deal with Elijah!"" Waxman says.

""Darrell pursued headlines,"" Bardella told me. ""He wanted visibility and publicity."" During the Trump presidency, he argues, ""Cummings can focus on substance, and the reality is, they have so much more to work with on substance than we did. Our approach was, there could be corruption, there could be waste, fraud and abuse. We already know those things exist with Trump. There's no fishing expedition required.""

And yet, those Obama-era investigations made an indelible mark on politics. Congressional Republicans may never have been able to prove that Obama's I.R.S. unfairly singled out Tea Party groups for scrutiny; or that Eric Holder tried to hide the facts about a failed Justice Department investigation into gunrunning along the Mexican border, called Fast and Furious, that resulted in the death of a Border Patrol agent; or that Hillary Clinton, as secretary of state, tried to cover up a bungled response to the Benghazi attack -- but you might not know this if you spend much time on conservative media or the Trump rally circuit.

Burton's probing of the Clinton administration occurred in the old-media landscape of the 1990s, when the expectations of the press -- and of the public -- were that for a congressional investigation to be considered successful, it needed to produce the factual goods. But Issa and his successors, by virtue of right-wing-media megaphones like Fox News (which was in its infancy during the Clinton years) and Breitbart, were able to conduct investigations as a kind of post-truth theater, where proving charges was less important than making them, loudly and repeatedly. By the time of the 2016 presidential campaign, a Fairleigh Dickinson University survey found that 44 percent of Republicans and a full half of Trump supporters believed it was ""definitely true"" that ""as secretary of state, Hillary Clinton knew the U.S. Embassy in Benghazi was going to be attacked and did nothing to protect it.""

The challenge of conducting oversight in this post-truth political environment is not lost on Cummings and other Democrats. ""I watch Fox News every now and then,"" Cummings told me, ""and the reason why I watch Fox News is, I'm trying to see how they can twist things around and make them sound so like the Democrats have some conspiracy against the president -- and they do a good job of it."" Democrats worry about what will happen if they turn up concrete evidence of presidential wrongdoing in their investigations and a sizable portion of the electorate simply refuses to believe it.

It's also very likely that Trump, having already broken so many other norms, will have few qualms about breaking the norm of cooperating, or even feigning cooperation, with congressional investigations. ""If the president treats the Congress the way he has Bob Mueller, we can expect the administration to respond to many of our requests with stonewalling and invective,"" Schiff says. ""It's very possible the administration will decide they're not going to compromise on anything, and litigate everything."" David Bossie, the Dan Burton aide who stepped down for misleadingly editing and releasing the Hubbell transcripts, remains an informal adviser to Trump; he has gone so far as to suggest in a recent interview with Jacqueline Alemany of The Washington Post that the White House should encourage people subpoenaed by House Democrats to plead the fifth or even flee the country. Congressional Republicans have also sent a message by picking Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio, perhaps Trump's most staunch and outspoken defender on Capitol Hill, to serve as the top Republican on the Oversight Committee. ""When the caucus picked Jordan,"" Tom Davis says, ""they really picked confrontation.""

The most disheartening prospect for Democrats is what that confrontation could ultimately reveal: just how little leverage -- political and legal -- a divided Congress has in a fight with a president like Trump. If Trump administration officials refuse to comply with subpoenas, Democrats could vote to hold them in contempt of Congress. But that's a largely toothless gesture. Even if the House does succumb to the Democratic base's desire and impeaches Trump, the G.O.P.-controlled Senate would almost certainly never convict. What's more, impeachment could backfire. ""You don't want to reward an offender like the president with martyrdom,"" Eric Swalwell, who's currently exploring his own presidential run in 2020, told me. ""That would be the worst outcome -- that he gets more popular, that his base grows because of it.""

Surveying the task ahead of him, Cummings says, ""This will be one of the hardest things I've ever done."" On a recent afternoon, he sat in his congressional office and contemplated the possibility that he'd fall short. In the past year and a half, Cummings was hospitalized for nearly five months because of a serious knee infection and complications from a heart-valve replacement. ""My saddest thought,"" he said, ""is that there will be damage done which will not be corrected during my lifetime and perhaps for a long time.""

Democrats realize that they'll have to wage their battle in the court of public opinion -- and Cummings believes that will require eventually winning over at least some of his Republican colleagues to his side. ""There is one incentive for them: love of country and democracy,"" he said. ""We have to try to help them get there. We have to try to help their constituents see what they're doing and what they're not doing and try to bring them back to some sense of normalcy.""

Seated at the top of the dais in the Oversight Committee hearing room at the sparsely attended hearings into Hurricane Maria last month, Cummings tried to get a head start on doing just that. He noted how FEMA hadn't been responsive to his entreaties for information over the last two years. He told Long, the FEMA head, that his attitude would have to change and that he expected answers to a new a batch of questions before the end of the year -- after which Cummings would be the one holding the gavel.

""I guarantee you, Administrator Long,"" Cummings said, raising his hand and pointing a long, knobby finger, ""this hearing will not be your last before this committee.""",1020329801
15,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/15/opinion/shutdown-trump-ocasio-cortez.html,"Gail Collins: Well, gee, Bret, happy new year. How do you think 2019 has been going so far? I mean, except for the fact that the government is shut down. And Donald Trump is still president.

What do you think's going to happen next?

Bret Stephens: And happy new year to you, Gail. My predictions, as our readers know, are unfailingly accurate. I predict that Democrats will fold over the shutdown, Mexico will agree to pay for the wall, House Republicans will vote for impeachment, the Rams will win the Super Bowl and Donald Trump will win the Nobel Prize. For Literature.

Gail: Not economics? For his pathbreaking work in demonstrating that governments don't need to be funded?

Bret: ""The Collected Tweets of Donald Trump"" is surely a worthy successor to the work of William Golding, the 1983 laureate and author of ""Lord of The Flies,"" in its depiction of adolescent cruelty. Sorry, go on.

Gail: I want to know what you think should happen next. Presuming our president doesn't have a visit from an angel who tells him that instead of building a wall he should concentrate on building -- oh, I don't know, a stairway to the stars? A re-creation of the hanging gardens of Babylon?

It looks like the current options, short of actually being rational, are declaring a national emergency, stealing money from the Army Corps of Engineers or just going on like this forever. What's your pick?

Bret: My guess is that he'll declare a national emergency and allocate Pentagon funds for the border wall. That's bad news for the country, precisely because it sets a precedent future presidents will abuse for their own partisan purposes. And it will alienate a lot of traditional Republicans, like Senator Marco Rubio, precisely for that reason.

But that won't stop Trump, who isn't exactly the sort of guy to worry about institutional precedents. He understands that if he folds on wall funding, his presidency is effectively over. It means he will have failed a test of strength against the despised Nancy Pelosi while betraying his core political promise. As when George H.W. Bush broke his campaign promise and raised taxes in 1990 as part of the budget agreement, it will be his ""Read My Lips"" moment.

But could I be wrong? Of course. Predicting what Trump will do is like trying to guess which way the goldfish swims next.

Gail: Since you're presuming the president behaves irrationally, hard to say you're wrong. My prediction would be that the whole thing winds up in court, creating endless litigation, screwing up the economy and making it impossible for Congress to do anything about anything else.

One of the many, many problems here is that the Democrats are just at the beginning of their presidential selection process, so you've got around 20 people waving their hands, none of whom have the stature to speak as the opposition. Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer are both very good at their jobs, but the talents you need to get a bunch of legislators to work together on a party agenda are not the talents you need to rally the country.

It'd be nice if we heard some Republicans speak out, but all we're getting is Lindsey Graham scrambling to win the Best Boy award from the White House. Any signs of a more promising voice? I'm getting kinda tired of patting Jeff Flake on the back. Really, he's gone.

Bret: Our new junior senator from Utah, Mitt Romney, seemed like he might be volunteering for the post of semi-courageous Republican with that op-ed he wrote for The Washington Post. I'm somewhat allergic to Romney because he's such a transparently calculating politician. But I think he deserves support. The healthiest thing that can happen in 2020 -- other than Donald Trump losing the presidency -- is a Republican primary challenge to the president from someone like Romney or John Kasich, if only to serve as a reminder that not everyone on the political right has lost his mind. And, of course, we shouldn't discount the possibility that Trump won't be on the ballot next year.

Gail: Deeply, deeply cynical as I am about Mitt Romney, I would never argue that he wouldn't be 10 times better a president. And while it's true I once made fun of Romney's dog, we have to remember that we now have the first president ever who has never had a pet in his entire life. That says something.

You know, we're agreeing way too much. Let me ask you something that might spark a divide. We just had a story about the veterans' hospitals and the conservative desire to move all the veterans out of the old system and into private hospitals. What do you think?

Bret: For it. The V.A. system has been a scandal-ridden mess for years, with endless stories about substandard medical and nursing care and scandals over hidden waiting lists. It's one of the reasons Americans should be wary of ever embracing government-run health care as the norm. According to The Times's own story, ""private care could mean shorter waits, more choices and fewer requirements for co-pays."" The whole purpose of a V.A. system is to assure our vets the best possible care, not the worst.

I know there are arguments against it, including that it will threaten existing V.A. hospitals and strain the private system. Those arguments remind me a bit of the case against school choice. But the point is that we have these systems to help veterans (or students), and not to maintain the systems for their own sake. What do you think?

Gail: In a way it really is like school choice. It's great when you have a lot of good oversight and citizens are getting more quality options. But we've seen examples -- Betsy DeVos's Michigan school privatization efforts come to mind -- where all you do is replace deeply imperfect public schools with really terrible privately operated ones. Which cost more and protect the public less.

When it comes to things like health and education, privatization only works when you have excellent government monitors. And I am absolutely certain this administration will never find them.

Bret: I'm not against regulation, so long as it's intended to prevent abuses rather than simply impose costs and restrict innovation. But I can't think of many areas where the private sector doesn't do a better job than government of providing a service, from delivering mail to running an airline to providing a better quality of education. This is a point I sometimes find myself making to Park Slope progressives who, for ideologically mysterious reasons, somehow wound up sending their kids to private schools like Poly Prep or St. Ann's instead of their local public schools.

Gail: I'm generally fine with, say, giving parents the option of sending their kids to charter schools that have been carefully monitored for quality. But you need very serious oversight. There are too many examples of privatization leading to either lower quality or higher prices for me to be comfortable with just presuming that profit-making services are better than the ones the government offers.

And, of course, I'm totally uncomfortable if the folks doing the privatization are reporting to Donald Trump. Hey, I tried to find a non-Trumpian issue for us to discuss and he sneaked back in. Is there any place we can go where he won't poke his orangy head?

Bret: Hmm. The former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia just voted to rename itself Republic of North Macedonia. Maybe that? Or, wait, the Osiris-Rex space probe is now orbiting the asteroid Bennu. Surely Trump doesn't have strong views about our space probes.

Gail: Bet he thinks the Space Force could have done it better.

Bret: Ha! It really is astonishing how completely Trump infects everything. He's like that guy with a bad flu, coughing and sneezing on a packed subway car. I consider it a point of pride that my first four columns of 2019 mention him only glancingly. I think we'd be serving our readers, and our profession, better if we resolved to try to write about him a lot less this year. Otherwise, as Frank Bruni pointed out in his latest column, we run the risk of becoming his accomplices in amplifying his voice when we should be trying to diminish it.

Gail: Frank was so right. But boy this guy is hard to ignore.

Bret: By the way, speaking of people who are sucking up a lot of media oxygen, can we discuss the freshman representative known to all by her initials, A.O.C.? Her habits of bending the truth to suit her ideological preconceptions and delight her base have an echo in you-know-who.

Gail: Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is somebody I was prepared to leave alone for a while. I mean really, she's 29, a neighborhood organizer who suddenly vaulted into Congress by defeating a very senior and stale member of the Democratic leadership. She deserves a little media vacuum while she's adjusting. But she's not going to get it and pretty clearly doesn't want it anyway.

Still, I think you're underestimating her. She did make some factual errors about military spending and she did bristle when the fact checkers came after her. But then she figured the whole thing out pretty quickly, and thanked the fact-checking community for their good work. That's the furthest thing from Trumpian.

Bret: Fair point. And I'm mindful that she's a rookie politician who's bound to make rookie mistakes. Though what mainly bothers me aren't her misstatements of fact but rather the unworkability of her proposals. The last person to try a 70 percent-plus tax on the rich was François Hollande, the one-term former president of France, and it quickly proved an economic and political fiasco. Is it too much to ask even a young politician to be aware of recent history?

This is a country that desperately needs to rediscover its center. Republicans abandoned it when they went with Trump, and I fear Democrats might be tempted to do the same by embracing the proposals of people like Ocasio-Cortez.

Gail: Well, it isn't as if she's proposing a coup. I say let all the Democrats run their ideas up the flagpole and see what happens. No fair muttering anything about ideas that flap in the breeze.

16,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/28/world/asia/indonesia-natural-disasters-sutopo.html,"JAKARTA, Indonesia -- For Sutopo Purwo Nugroho, this has been the year of living with disaster, both national and personal.

Mr. Sutopo, the spokesman for Indonesia's disaster management agency, has become a household name as a source of reliable information during a deadly string of earthquakes, floods, landslides and, just a week ago, a tsunami that killed more than 400 people.

At the same time, he has been dealing with his own calamity. A lifelong nonsmoker, he learned early this year, at the age of 48, that he had Stage 4 lung cancer. Doctors gave him one to three years to live.

""When I heard the diagnosis in January, I was shocked,"" he said during a recent interview at his office in Jakarta, the capital. ""After that, I accepted that it was my fate, just like people who were affected by earthquakes and the tsunami.""

Now 49, he has used the time left to him to plunge into his work, winning the admiration of his compatriots and gaining a large following on social media.

His Twitter feed is filled with dramatic videos of landslides, rushing floodwaters and erupting volcanoes, interspersed with photos of him undergoing chemotherapy at a Jakarta hospital.

After a 7.0 magnitude earthquake struck the resort island of Lombok in August, killing more than 550 people, he fielded calls from reporters while receiving treatment.

Despite the constant ache in his bones, where the cancer has spread, he has remained a commanding presence at news conferences beamed live across the country.

""When there is a disaster and I have to do a press conference, my adrenaline increases and I even forget I am sick,"" he said. ""As soon as I get home, I feel the pain.""

A vast archipelago of more than 17,000 islands, Indonesia is especially vulnerable to volcanic eruptions, earthquakes and tsunamis because it sits astride the Ring of Fire, an active seismic area on the margins of the Pacific Ocean.

This has been the country's deadliest year for natural disasters in more than a decade, Mr. Sutopo said. More than 4,600 people died, a figure that does not include the 189 passengers and crew members killed in the crash of a Lion Air plane in the Java Sea on Oct. 29.

The worst of the catastrophes was the 7.5 magnitude earthquake and tsunami that struck the island of Sulawesi in September, killing more than 2,100.

""This has been the year of disasters,"" Mr. Sutopo said.

When the second tsunami of the year struck on the evening of Dec. 22 in the Sunda Strait, Mr. Sutopo was in the city of Yogyakarta, having a holiday with his family and seeking alternative treatment for his cancer.

He quickly began sending updates to the news media, keeping at it until 1 a.m. He was back to work before 6 a.m., apologizing for typos in his messages, saying that the fingers of his left hand were numb from his treatment.

Later, he spoke bluntly about the lack of a tsunami alert, saying, ""The disaster early warning system in Indonesia is still far from satisfactory.""

Across Indonesia, people rely on Mr. Sutopo when a disaster strikes.

""He explains things in simple language for average people,"" said Caroline Maringka, a store manager in Jakarta. ""I also feel he is very committed and puts the public's interest on top. Even though he is suffering from a terminal illness, he still does his job.""

Despite his condition, Mr. Sutopo was upbeat and vigorous during a two-hour interview.

The father of two children, ages 12 and 19, he said he was taking morphine for pain, including an aching spine. Lying down is so painful that he rarely sleeps more than three hours a night.

He posts often about his condition on Twitter, sharing X-rays of his lung and before-and-after photos of the top of his bald head, showing that some hair, oddly, has grown back during chemotherapy.

Pak Topo, or Mr. Topo, as he is affectionately known, grew up in the Central Java town of Boyolali, about 330 miles east of Jakarta and close to Mount Merapi, one of Indonesia's many active volcanoes. He studied geography at university and later earned a doctorate in natural resources and environmental management.

For 16 years, he worked for government agencies as a researcher, mainly on water issues. After a dam broke near Jakarta in 2009, killing more than 100 people, he analyzed photos of the dam and went public with his finding that cracks in the structure had caused it to fail.

""It was me against the Ministry of Public Works,"" he said. ""At that time, I received a lot of threats to keep quiet.""

Even so, he was asked to take a leading role in analyzing and explaining subsequent disasters.

He turned down his current post three times, he said, because he did not want a job in which he thought his role would be to promote his boss.

He was finally left with no choice in 2010, when he was directed one day to attend a ceremony dressed in a suit. Only after he arrived did he discover he was being sworn in as the disaster agency's spokesman.

He said he never received training for the job.

""I don't have a background in communications,"" he said. ""I just do it. And I just have to have the guts to criticize the government, not using bureaucratic language but in my own style.""

Rumors often spread quickly during big disasters, and Mr. Sutopo sees part of his job as combating online hoaxes and false reports. ""What I am giving out is the real thing, not fake news like Donald Trump,"" he said.

Like many Indonesians, he prefers President Trump's predecessor, Barack Obama, who lived in Indonesia as a child and has visited several times since winning the presidency in 2008.

In a country where people often rely on faith and superstition to understand the world, Mr. Sutopo's job sometimes entails explaining the science of disasters, such as the fact that quakes and volcanic eruptions are caused by the shifting of tectonic plates that form the earth's outer layer.

He also incorporates local wisdom and traditional beliefs into his explanations.

""The cultural approach works better than just science and technology,"" he said. ""If people think that it is punishment from God, it makes it easier for them to recover.""

His office shelves are lined with dozens of awards. An Indonesian anti-hoax group called Mafindo honored Mr. Sutopo in October for his efforts to combat the spread of false information during disasters. The Straits Times newspaper in Singapore named Mr. Sutopo an ""Asian of the Year"" this month.

The attention he has received is unusual for a midlevel bureaucrat. He has become so prominent that the president, Joko Widodo, whom Mr. Sutopo calls his idol, met with him in October.

Another dream came true in November when Mr. Sutopo met his favorite celebrity, a pop singer, Raisa Andriana.

He had been trying to get her attention by including her Twitter handle in some of his disaster posts. He said he hoped she would retweet the messages to her 8.4 million followers.

When she didn't respond, some of his followers began using the Twitter hashtag #RaisaMeetSutopo, which went viral for a few days in October.

They finally met last month in Jakarta, where she sang a song to him. He called it one of the highlights of his life.

Who is next on his wish list to meet?

""Not Donald Trump,"" he said. ""Obama.""",1028362679
17,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/09/opinion/trump-speech-prime-time-bludgeon.html,"The people who didn't want television networks to cede a prime-time hour last night -- or, as it turned out, a prime-time 10 minutes -- to the president of the United States were implicitly giving Donald Trump a credit that he does not deserve. There is a kind of silver-tongued orator who can persuade in any situation, who like Caesar's Mark Antony can find a crowd leaning one way and leave them stirred up for the opposite cause, who is legitimately dangerous when given a rostrum or a soapbox or a prime-time speech. But that is not our president: His rhetoric is a bludgeon, and what we saw last night was just an attempt to club his enemies and critics with the same arguments he's made a thousand times before.

In fairness to Trump, the immigration bludgeon was effective once -- for two reasons that played out in surprising ways across the 2016 campaign. First, Trump-the-candidate's dire warnings about criminals and terrorists crossing the southern border dovetailed with two 2016-specific trends -- the spike in violent crime after decades of decline, and the rash of Islamic State-inspired attacks on both sides of the Atlantic.

Second, the extremity of his rhetoric persuaded skeptics of mass immigration, long burned by politicians of both parties, that Trump would not betray them. In a political landscape where every year seemed to bring a new bipartisan push for amnesties and immigration increases, his xenophobic style was an effective political marker for anyone with inchoate anxieties about immigration. You didn't have to literally believe that he would build the Wall and make Mexico pay for it to regard that wild promise as evidence that he would be more genuinely restrictionist and hawkish on the issue than politicians merely paying lip service to ""border security.""

But the problem for Trump is that presidents have to deal with changing circumstances and cope with unexpected crises, not just fulminate in the same style regardless of the context. And the world of 2019 looks different than the world in which he campaigned. The crime rate didn't keep rising, the pace of terror attacks hasn't quickened, and fate has given him an immigration crisis that's substantially different than the crisis of murderers and terror plotters that he invoked in his campaign rhetoric -- a humanitarian crisis, a crisis of families and children, in which the problem isn't the people that we can't catch crossing the borders but the people who surrender willingly, hoping to exploit our overstrained asylum system and disappear with their kids into the American interior.

A more supple strategist and orator than our president might have been able to adapt his tough-guy proposals to this complicated new reality, and in the process to exploit the Democrats' core vulnerability -- their difficulty figuring out exactly what kind of deportation policies, if any, their base will allow them to support.

Such an adaptation would have involved making two arguments in parallel. First, Trump could have argued that 15 years of increased spending on border security -- walls and fencing and other barriers very much included -- has played a big role in reducing the old kind of illegal immigration, in which single young men cross the border looking for work. My proposed wall, really an expansion of steel fencing, would build on this success, he could have said, and build on policies that Democrats once voted for, in order to make sure the old rates of illegal immigration don't come back.

Then, second, he could have explained the new challenge of family migration, admitted to mistakes (I know, imagine that) in the child separation policy of 2018, and emphasized that he's asking for more money and various legal and administrative changes to ensure that inhumane conditions can be improved, that families can be kept together, that the system can adjudicate, process and deport without last year's performative cruelty. He could have even talked about the attempts at deal making with Mexico, the attempt at a bilateral arrangement that our southern neighbor would keep migrants on its territory while they applied for asylum on ours.

If you parsed last night's 10 minutes of presidential words carefully enough you could find fragments of these arguments -- but only fragments, shored around an argumentative edifice that was just the same old 2016-vintage Trumpian warnings about how (to quote Vox's Dara Lind) ""immigrants are coming across the border to kill you.""

And this ""IACATBTKY"" argument just doesn't match up with the news that most Americans consume. There is no rising immigrant crime wave at the moment, no wave of terror attacks by border jumpers, the immigrant caravan didn't end in bloodshed, and the dominant images from the current border crisis are pictures of exhausted parents and frightened, incomprehending kids.

So what we heard from the president was a play to people deep in the Trumpian bubble, a pledge to his electoral rump that he's still fighting the fights he promised two years ago even if the facts on the ground require a somewhat different strategy.Where the rest of the country was concerned, including many voters a more effective president would be trying to win over or win back, it was almost certainly just a waste of breath.

18,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/07/opinion/sunday/hillarys-summer-of-love.html,"It's looking more and more like Donald Trump is the best thing that ever happened to Hillary Clinton.

He's definitely the strangest.

With his fits of pique, spasms of ignorance and flashes of demagogy, he has turned the G.O.P.'s favorite bogeywoman into its summer crush. I haven't seen a love story this unlikely since ""Harold and Maude.""

Dozens of prominent Republicans have come out and said that they'll vote for her or consider it, including, just last week, the Silicon Valley titan Meg Whitman, the Jeb Bush confidante Sally Bradshaw, and Maria Comella, a former spokeswoman for two of Trump's most pugnacious promoters, Chris Christie and Rudy Giuliani.

You can expect that list to grow. The Clinton campaign clearly does. As Bloomberg Politics and The Washington Post reported last week, Clinton's aides have gone so far as to set up something of a special operation -- a defection watch -- to monitor news accounts and any other public hints that a Republican leader is thinking of renouncing Trump, so that someone on Team Clinton can reach out and ask him or her to take the next step. The Times's Jonathan Martin revealed that Clinton herself called Whitman a month ago.

I envision a box of cigars en route to Colin Powell, long-stemmed roses for Condoleezza Rice, a brand-new smartphone for Senator Lindsey Graham. Hallmark should consider a line of come-to-Clinton cards, with a donkey and an elephant gazing into each other's eyes against the setting sun of Trump's orange head.

The breadth of G.O.P. affection for Clinton shouldn't be overstated. The grudging nature of it can't be overlooked. If Trump stormed off and a more appetizing Republican was put on the menu, these Clinton converts would most likely revert to their usual diet. And there's a real limit to the number of Republicans who will publicly embrace her.

But many, many more Republicans are privately rooting for her. By making clear that they won't vote for Trump, they intend to throw the election her way. After decades of demonizing her and all those Benghazi hearings, a noteworthy contingent of Republicans are giving her a degree of active and passive help that less polarizing Democratic presidential nominees never received.

She's gone from Republican voodoo doll to Post-Partisan Barbie.

To appreciate the surprise of this, flash back on four words: ""vast right-wing conspiracy."" That's what Clinton labeled the political enemies who exposed her husband's sexual involvement with Monica Lewinsky and who pressed, successfully, for his impeachment. The phrase was larger than that ugly chapter. It traced the magnitude of suspicion and animosity that the Clintons felt toward many Republicans, and vice versa.

And remember that toward the end of her husband's administration, she provoked the fury of pro-Israel Republicans with a public kiss of the Palestinian leader Yasir Arafat's wife, Suha. Now many of those same Republicans are the ones most disposed toward her and opposed to Trump, whose geopolitical naïveté and isolationist talk worry them more than anything in her past.

Clinton isn't unschooled in appeasing the other side. For all the florid fighting that her husband did with congressional Republicans, he also moved rightward on occasion, famously signing welfare reform legislation.

After the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, when she was finishing her first year in the Senate, I did a long magazine story on her and Chuck Schumer's effort to get help for New York, and several Senate Republicans told me how surprised and impressed they were by her work ethic, warmth and willingness to cooperate.

For many months now, she has been sending signals that a second Clinton administration would differ from President Obama's in the earnestness and aggressiveness of its bid for bipartisan cooperation. Her pick of Senator Tim Kaine as a running mate fit into that framework. He's liked and respected by Republican colleagues, a dynamic that Clinton surrogates immediately stressed.

What hasn't happened, though, is the construction of a substantive, policy-based bridge across the aisle. She moved leftward during the primaries to deal with Bernie Sanders's challenge, and many of her positions are anathema even to those Republicans who prefer her to Trump.

Does she change that over the next months or, if elected, upon taking office? Does she have to? There are some fascinating forks in the road ahead -- some big decisions -- all created by the singular mess of Trump's candidacy and the possibility, suggested in the latest polls, including one that showed her ahead in Georgia, that he'll lose the election by a devastating margin.

Many Democrats smell a rout, hope that a slew of Republicans go down with Trump, and fantasize about a subsequent Democratic dominance in Washington that will allow the party to enact laws without much if any Republican input and assistance. After all the Republican obstructionism that they've put up with, they ache for such liberation.

But such a rout would presumably require Clinton to campaign stridently against endangered House and Senate Republicans between now and Nov. 8, an approach at odds with her current entreaties to the Whitmans of the world.

It would also be a huge, risky bet on sustained Republican disarray and a durable Democratic advantage, without which Republican revenge would be swift and merciless. Obama defied Republicans during the first two years of his presidency, only to be tormented by them for the remainder of it.

That's why I'm hoping that Clinton takes a different, big-tent tack, and combines passion projects with attention to areas of common Democratic and Republican interest: tax reform, immigration reform, maybe even education reform.

Yes, a big Democratic victory in November would give Democrats both the right and the imperative to implement their most deeply cherished ideas. But it would reflect the unpopularity of Trump as much as any sweeping, compelling mandate for a particular program.

And we've seen, in recent years, what sharply drawn lines and perpetual warfare between the parties bequeath: legislative paralysis, debased discourse and the precise public disgust with politics and politicians that has given rise to Trump. Here we are, stuck and miserable.

Clinton's summer of love isn't merely a stunning narrative twist. It's an opportunity, in the nick of time. Despite our supposedly intractable partisanship, a swelling group of highly visible leaders is putting country before indiscriminate allegiance to their party. That's an invitation for Clinton to do a bit of the same. Of all politicians, she could be the one with the best chance to move us a few crucial inches beyond this wretched sclerosis. Who would have ever predicted that?",1040246011

Jason Zengerle wrote about three Democratic representatives who will soon have the power to investigate the Trump White House.

Out here in Ohio, there is relief and even some hope that now Donald Trump, his family, his campaign and his administration can begin to be held accountable for their words and actions in the last two years. Congressional Republicans have given Trump and company free rein in running the government. Sadly, we are seeing the results of handing that freedom to the incompetent and corrupt. We also want to see some focus on issues that are essential to our lives -- health care, taxes, wages, the environment. I actually feel 2019 may be a turning point for 60 percent of us to finally see some accountability for Trump and the Republicans. Meg, Troy, Ohio

Do not rest until we have all the facts and everyone responsible for the corruption is in jail. We need Trump's tax returns, correspondence between the campaign and Russian operatives and details about decision-making in the White House, especially as it relates to lobbying by the fossil-fuel industry for reduced environmental protections. We gave Democrats power so they could hold the worst president in history accountable, and we demand that they do so. Casey Penk, New York

Never has an administration been so unprepared to lead and so willing to make money from power. Never has a party been so willing to ignore corruption as the Republicans of 2016 to 2018.

I trust Jerrold Nadler, Adam Schiff and Elijah Cummings to choose wisely. Godspeed, gentlemen. Deirdre, New Jersey

The new House Democrats should go as far as they have to go in order to investigate the activities of this administration and a president who by and large continues to hold himself both unaccountable and above the law. And the main reason he has been able to get away with everything he has done so far is that the checks-and-balances system that normally regulates the overreach of any individual's power has been drastically compromised by the one party now in control of all three branches of government. This is not about a ""witch hunt,"" nor should it be. This is about justice. And it's about time. N. Smith, New York

Re: Denaturalized

Seth Freed Wessler wrote about the push to strip naturalized immigrants of their citizenship.

I am a current law student, and I had the privilege of working with Irina Hughes as an intern on Odette Dureland's case. I remember sitting in federal court and watching Dureland's husband, children and grandchild weep as the judge announced she would be deported. This case is heartbreaking, unacceptable and one of the myriad reasons we need comprehensive immigration reform. Porfírio Gueiros, Gainesville, Fla.

This is an important story. As far as I knew, the only codified restriction on naturalized citizens was that they could not become president. Stripping naturalized citizens of their citizenship furthers the goal of creating two classes of citizens and tells immigrants that they can never truly be Americans. This is exactly what the Republican Party wants at this time. People need certainty in their lives to thrive. The idea that the government could take everything away from a person and family in an instant because of a mistake made decades before, spun as ""fraud,"" is abhorrent to the idea of freedom. Every naturalized citizen -- and those who love them -- have to realize that they could be targeted by a cruel white-nationalist government. And even if the government's case fails, everything is thrown into question while it is pending. That's frightening. The bar for these denaturalization suits should be very high, and the government should have to pay lawyers' fees if it brings a losing case. Max Farthington, Washington

20,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/09/us/politics/bill-shine-donald-trump.html,"WASHINGTON -- At the beginning of the government shutdown, Bill Shine was about as far away from the capital as President Trump's most senior communications official could get. While the president was complaining about sitting alone in the White House trying to force Democrats to accept a wall on the Mexican border, Mr. Shine was on a Hawaiian vacation.

As the shutdown presented Mr. Trump with an ever-expanding political challenge, Mr. Shine, who joined the White House staff with the expectation that he would deliver on his promise to satisfy Mr. Trump's hunger for positive news coverage, stayed on vacation, keeping in contact with colleagues by phone.

Eventually, Mr. Shine came home early to help manage the administration's response. But any expectation that he would be by the president's side crafting a cohesive message would be a miscalculation of the role he has actually come to play as Mr. Trump's latest communications director, according to interviews with over a dozen former and current administration officials.

An alumnus of Fox News, where he was known as a protector of the network's chairman, Roger E. Ailes, Mr. Shine has confined his White House role mainly to stagecraft, people who have worked with him say, and Mr. Trump, who chafes against being managed, has openly expressed skepticism about what he has done.

Once he was back in Washington, Mr. Shine was among the aides pushing Mr. Trump to both deliver Tuesday's prime-time Oval Office speech and make a visit to the border on Thursday. And it was Mr. Shine who was among the unnamed targets of the president when Mr. Trump criticized those plans at a lunch with broadcasters before his speech.

The border visit was ""not going to change a damn thing,"" Mr. Trump told the group, belittling the plan as a photo op urged on him by ""these people behind you,"" he said, pointing to Mr. Shine and a cluster of other communications aides.

The criticism was nothing surprising given Mr. Trump's habit of quickly turning on his staff, and his recent habit of asking people whether Mr. Shine has been ""good"" for him since arriving last summer had a familiar ring.

For Mr. Shine, there was one obvious challenge from the beginning.

""This president's never going to be happy with his coverage because he's in a permanent war with the media,"" Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker and an occasional Trump adviser who was once a contributor on Fox News, said in an interview. ""Shine in that sense is in a challenging environment. His primary client is somebody who would like a result that requires change but is not willing to change.""

The White House declined to provide comment for this article from a spokesperson, from Mr. Shine or from Mr. Trump, after multiple requests. But Kellyanne Conway, the counselor to the president, praised his instinct for a good story in a text message.

""Donald Trump is an irrepressibly press-savvy, communications-centric president,"" Ms. Conway said. Of Mr. Shine, she added that he ""has a gut for what sells and an eye for what compels.""

A longtime associate of Mr. Ailes, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, said Mr. Trump thought he was ""getting Roger,"" who built Fox with a keen eye for aggressive political strategy, in his hire. But Mr. Shine, according to his critics, has shown little understanding of the conservative media beyond the cable news ecosystem and his former network -- the one place where the president does not need much assistance, and where Mr. Shine has few remaining admirers.

Mr. Shine has survived mainly by fulfilling the president's desire to be in charge of his own messaging.

""He understands really strong personalities,"" Mr. Gingrich said, noting Mr. Shine's past at Fox. ""He understands that his job is to operate within the framework of that personality, not to try to change that.""

At 55, Mr. Shine is older than many of the other aides in the West Wing. He is widely described as genial and good humored by his colleagues, several of whom refer to him as an ""adult in the room."" He is known as a level presence and, in the words of one senior administration official, is good at ""staying in his lane."" Unlike many other White House aides, Mr. Shine tends to avoid matters that are not in his immediate purview.

Exactly what that purview is can be hard to discern. Multiple people close to the White House, for instance, said that the communications office issued no guidance on what points they should make on television after Mr. Trump's Oval Office address.

According to one senior administration official, Mr. Shine, arriving at the White House, appeared overwhelmed by a fractious West Wing, in part because he was hired by the president after John F. Kelly, his former chief of staff, was unwilling to reassign Mercedes Schlapp, the White House director of strategic communications.

Early on, Mr. Trump was impressed with Mr. Shine's ability to help pull him out of an unflattering news cycle in the wake of a widely criticized news conference in Helsinki, Finland, with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia.

Days after the meeting, Mr. Shine arranged for the president to step out in front of reporters on the South Lawn and hail his administration's economic accomplishments. Describing the scene, a senior administration official said that Mr. Trump kept his eyes trained on Mr. Shine, who stood casually nearby with a Starbucks cup in hand, while the president addressed the group and momentarily shifted the news cycle.

But two senior administration officials said that Mr. Shine's new colleagues, who expected Mr. Shine to come in with a degree of Ailes genius, have not been impressed by what they considered timeworn suggestions, such as the president not tweeting so much.

The shutdown has highlighted the inner workings of a strategy-challenged White House, where one official described Mr. Shine as a bridge between the bifurcated communications and press teams. He is one of four assistants to the president -- an official distinction -- who focus on communications. They often do not work in concert, according to several White House officials.

But it is not as if there have not been some novel communications tactics.

Last week, riding high from a meeting over the plans for funding his long-promised wall at the southwestern border, the president held a haphazardly arranged press briefing with law enforcement officials without taking any questions. At an Oval Office appearance, he conspicuously displayed a ""Game of Thrones""-inspired shutdown poster. And then there were his taped Rose Garden videos, or the tweet with the video of him singing ""Green Acres"" at he 2005 Emmys.

Mr. Shine had nothing to do with any of that, according to an administration official.

To his friends and allies, Mr. Trump wistfully brings up Hope Hicks, his most successful communications director, who departed nearly a year ago. Ms. Hicks had the president's trust in a way that only a few remaining aides do, and she was generally seen as among the small number of people who could suggest to Mr. Trump that he hold back from indulging in some of his public relations whims.

And Ms. Hicks was a rare breed in Mr. Trump's West Wing -- someone with whom he had a bond even though she never went on television.

By most accounts, Mr. Shine has chosen to shun the spotlight, unlike Anthony Scaramucci, a colorful predecessor. He has chosen to become useful to Jared Kushner and Ivanka Trump, the president's son-in-law and eldest daughter. At one point, Mr. Shine tried to help craft a network special for a planned trip by Ms. Trump to Africa, which has been postponed amid the government shutdown.

So far, Mr. Shine has not satisfied the president's demand for better news coverage, but the two have bonded over Mr. Trump's tendency to hold grudges toward certain journalists and news outlets. In November, as the president stepped up to the podium in the East Room of the White House for a news conference that devolved into an aggressive exchange with Jim Acosta, a CNN reporter, Mr. Shine turned to Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary.

""This is going to be fun,"" Mr. Shine said, a remark that was overheard by people nearby.

White House aides said Mr. Shine could not have planned that a confrontation between Mr. Trump and Mr. Acosta would take place, or known that it would turn into a fight that ultimately went to court, and insisted he was referring simply to the president's feistiness before he went to the podium.

But Mr. Shine's willingness to encourage a confrontation that led to Mr. Acosta's White House access badge being pulled -- something that aides for months had kept the president from doing -- is in keeping with much of his private advice to the man he now works for.

""After he's done with all of this,"" Mr. Gingrich said, ""Shine will be able to write a great book. I joke with him that in the long run, there's a great opportunity here.""",1036674585
21,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/21/sports/ncaafootball/big-12-conference-looks-to-expand.html,"Paul D. Ryan, the House speaker, turned to college football this week in persuading Texas delegates at the Republican National Convention to unify behind the presidential candidate Donald J. Trump.

Noting the antipathy between the state's two biggest teams, Texas and Texas A&M, Ryan argued, according to one report, ""When one of the teams advances to a big bowl game or a national championship, don't you root for the Aggies if you are a Longhorn?""

Ryan, of course, was booed. Under no circumstances does a Longhorns fan root for the Aggies, or vice versa.

But earlier in his analogy, Ryan said something about the rivals that was nearly as tone-deaf, wistfully recalling the days ""when the Big 12 was the Big 12.""

Nostalgia for the Big 12 can strike a seasoned college football fan as inapposite. The conference, an arranged marriage of two dying leagues, has existed for only two decades. And as the Big 12 confirmed Tuesday, when it announced that it was open to expanding beyond its current stable of 10 teams, no league better exemplifies the reality that big-time college sports are now driven less by generations-old animosity than by cable cords and subscriber fees.

After digesting the reports of two outside consultants, the 10 Big 12 members unanimously asked their commissioner, Bob Bowlsby, to vet several suitors for membership. That means that in the near future, the Big 12 could again feature 12 teams; it might even grow to 14.

The justifications revolved around money and football championships. Most immediately, Monday brought reports of a 20-year broadcast-rights extension between the Atlantic Coast Conference and ESPN to 2036, along with a digital network starting this year and a full-fledged, linear cable network by the 2019 season. (The A.C.C. and ESPN are expected to announce that deal Thursday morning.)

The Big 12 felt it needed to keep up.

""We are continuing to operate in an environment that is filled with change, even over the period of a few days,"" the University of Oklahoma's president, David Boren, said, making sure to note that the annual media-rights payouts for Big 12 members would not be affected by any proposed expansion.

It was less rah-rah, more green eyeshade.

But such is life in the so-called Power 5 conferences, whose football and men's basketball deals add up to billions of dollars for their 65 member colleges. As an example: The 12-year College Football Playoff contract with ESPN, entering its third season, is worth $7.3 billion, with the vast majority of that money paid to those Power 5 leagues.

That financial focus is especially the reality for the Big 12, which was born as a merger of two defunct conferences (the Southwest and the Big Eight); which lost members to three other leagues during the past several years of realignment; which suffered in 2014 when its lack of a conference championship game cost it a spot in the inaugural four-team national playoff (it will have a title game starting in 2017); and which is now the only Power 5 league without its own cable network, or plans for one.

""I believe schools added to our league will raise our national profile,"" John Currie, Kansas State's athletic director, said in an interview Wednesday.

To take a cue from Ryan (and Trump), then, expansion will not make the Big 12 the Big 12 again. Nor will it restore longstanding annual rivalries that were obliterated by realignment -- Kansas-Missouri or Texas-Texas A&M -- or even bring about new ones. (There are teams in the Big 12 that Cincinnati, maybe the likeliest candidate for expansion, has never once played.)

But expansion will spell greater stability and, eventually, more cash.

The Big 12 is staring at an economically driven, zero-sum landscape in which other conferences' gains are frequently its losses. It is also looking at a media environment that seems rather resilient, despite the increased prevalence of so-called cord-cutters and cord-nevers -- fancy words for people who no longer pay, or never paid, the monthly cable bills that finance billion-dollar rights deals.

The most important data point in favor of Big 12 expansion, said Neal Pilson, a media consultant and former CBS Sports president, is the massive rights extensions the Big Ten reportedly struck with Fox, ESPN and CBS, which would nearly triple that conference's annual rights revenue (not including the Big Ten Network), to nearly a quarter of a billion dollars.

""A digital network the A.C.C. is talking about with ESPN -- it's a no-brainer, but it's not a big revenue generator,"" Pilson said Wednesday. ""It's added exposure. It looks good. It sounds good. But in terms of the real driver, which is revenue generation, I think the Big Ten is much more relevant.""

For that reason, Pilson advised the Big 12 to take a page from the Big Ten's playbook. Much as the Big Ten, a traditionally Midwestern league, recently added Rutgers and Maryland to plant its flag near several East Coast population centers, the Big 12, whose members reside in Great Plains states and Texas (and West Virginia), ought to invite Connecticut to join, Pilson said.

""Having Texas and Oklahoma and the other major Big 12 schools playing in the Northeast would create additional revenue opportunities and make it a more attractive conference in terms of new sponsors and a better linear television deal,"" Pilson said.

Cincinnati and Connecticut -- or Memphis, Brigham Young, Colorado State or Houston, to name a few other probable suitors -- would find loveless marriages in the Big 12 compared with the passionate hatred that the Longhorns and the Aggies once consummated annually. But bringing them aboard would produce dollars and make sense.

""You remember what Wayne Gretzky said,"" Kansas State's Currie said, paraphrasing the hockey star. ""'I skate to where the puck will be, not where the puck is.'""",1040207270
22,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/30/business/economy/us-economy-gdp-q2.html,"The economic recovery may be durable, but it is anything but dynamic.

Weighed down by anemic business spending, overstocked factories and warehouses, and a surprisingly weak housing sector, the American economy barely improved this spring after its usual winter doldrums.

Consumer spending advanced at a robust pace, helping to sustain a modest growth rate of 1.2 percent, but the gain was overshadowed by the poor showing in other sectors of the economy. The April-June quarter was the third consecutive period in which the economy advanced at less than a 2 percent annual rate, the weakest stretch in four years.

The new economic data underscores the continuing frustration about the current growth cycle, which has now gone on for seven years -- longer than most economic upswings -- but which has repeatedly failed to break out into a higher orbit.

And with the political conventions now over, and the brawl between Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump for the White House in full swing, Friday's data at least partly undercuts the Democrats' argument that the nation's economic health is improving.

""This definitely feeds into an existing Republican narrative that the economy is growing too slowly and dials it up a notch,"" said Jared Bernstein, a liberal economist who served in the Obama administration.

The economic debate may intensify ahead of the election in November, particularly because the recovery's gains have been less robust in battleground states like Ohio and Pennsylvania. States firmly in the Democratic or Republican column -- California and Texas, for example -- are generally doing much better.

On Friday, Republican leaders were quick to cite the new data on the nation's gross domestic product to reinforce their argument that President Obama's policies have failed to turn things around.

""After eight years of higher taxes, endless regulations and skyrocketing health care costs, the chickens are apparently coming home to roost,"" said Senator Tom Cotton, Republican of Arkansas.

But there are other signs that the economy is on the mend, even for ordinary Americans who had, until recently, barely benefited from the rebound. The unemployment rate, which reached 10 percent after the recession, has fallen back to around 5 percent, while hiring and pay gains have been healthier lately. Those factors may ultimately contribute more to perceptions of vitality than abstract statistics on the nation's economic output.

""What really matters to people is jobs and income, and that's most recently been a positive story,"" added Mr. Bernstein, who is now a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities.

Based on more complete information about recent years, the government revised last year's growth rate up slightly to 2.6 percent -- the best so far since the severe downturn ended in mid-2009. But that is still below the gains the American economy recorded in the mid-2000s, let alone in the booming late 1990s.

Over all, the economy's 1.2 percent advance in the second quarter, the Commerce Department reported Friday, was just slightly better than the 0.8 percent pace recorded in the first quarter.

Besides the decrease in inventory accumulation and business investment, weaker government outlays also held back growth, reinforcing a trend that has hobbled the recovery in recent years.

The abrupt falloff in homebuilding caught analysts off guard, but it came after a series of double-digit gains in late 2014 and 2015. And with mortgage rates very low and home prices still rising in many parts of the country, the residential real estate sector is expected to contribute to growth again in the coming quarters.

Household spending was the economy's bright spot, rising at an annualized rate of 4.2 percent.

""The consumer is doing all the heavy lifting,"" said Nariman Behravesh, chief economist at IHS Markit. ""Aside from technology and software, business spending was bad and housing was also surprisingly weak, which is payback for gains in recent quarters.""

On the positive side, the overstock at stores and warehouses is starting to dissipate. That could help growth in the second half of the year, Mr. Behravesh said.

After a long period in which trade has weighed on the economy, the balance between exports and imports may finally be improving. The net trade picture actually lifted growth by nearly a quarter of a percentage point last quarter, the first significant improvement from trade since mid-2014.

In addition, Mr. Behravesh said, wages are finally beginning to inch higher for many workers after years of stagnation. Gas prices also remain low.

While grappling with weaker demand from customers in Asia and Europe, many factories and mills in the nation's midsection have been hit by the drop in energy prices as new drilling for oil and natural gas has collapsed.

Regional disparities have contributed to differing perceptions of the economy. Workers in the West are finding themselves priced out of neighborhoods in booming San Francisco and Seattle, while families in less prosperous parts of the country say they feel as if the recession never really ended.

Domestically focused service industries like software, health care and financial services are doing well, lifting incomes among white-collar workers. A strong real estate market in many parts of the country and the run-up on Wall Street are also encouraging more affluent consumers to open their wallets.

This week, the Federal Reserve noted improving economic conditions in the United States after a two-day meeting of policy makers, even as the central bank held off on increasing in interest rates.

A top Fed official downplayed the latest report.

John Williams, president of the San Francisco Fed, said the second-quarter gross domestic product reading was weak largely because of inventories and government spending, noting that underlying data that discount for swings in stock building ""look good.""

Speaking to reporters after a speech in Cambridge, Mass., Mr. Williams, an influential centrist at the central bank, noted the two key employment and inflation reports before the next meeting in mid-September. ""It makes sense, assuming the data continue to support that, to raise rates again this year,"" he said.

Michael Gapen, chief United States economist at Barclays, said the disappointing gross domestic product report makes a move by the Fed in September a bit less likely, but it could still be on track if the government issues strong jobs reports for July and August. July's data will be released by the Labor Department next Friday.

""The domestic side of the economy looks O.K. Not stellar, not fantastic, but enough to keep us on a modest growth path,"" Mr. Gapen said. ""And if it's all about personal consumption, then the labor market is your best forward-looking indicator.""",1040215145

As shutdown drags on, few options in battle over border security

President Trump traveled to the southwestern border yesterday, where he reiterated the demand for a wall that has led to a bitter political impasse and a government shutdown now in its 21st day. He used the visit to blame the shutdown on Democrats and suggested that he might declare a national emergency to bypass Congress.

White House officials considered diverting emergency aid to build a border barrier. Among the options: moving $13.9 billion allocated last year after devastating hurricanes and wildfires.

Some Senate Republicans came off the sidelines to seek a deal that would reopen the government. But negotiations collapsed before they could gain momentum.

The fallout continues to spread:

* President Trump canceled a planned trip to the glittering economic conference held annually in Davos, Switzerland, citing what he called the Democrats' ""intransigence.""

* Farm country has stood by the president, but some farmers say the loss of crucial loans, payments and other services could change that.

* The leaders of unions representing air traffic controllers and aviation safety inspectors warned of potential risks to air travel.

Assessing Trump the manager

Donald J. Trump's management style as a businessman -- impetuous, impolitic, sometimes immature -- worked when he ran his private company, writes the NYT business columnist James Stewart.

But now Mr. Trump is running a much larger enterprise, and the management traits that may have propelled him into the White House are not serving him well now that he's there.

With the government shut down over Mr. Trump's demand for border wall funding, the loss of a Republican majority in the House and scant legislative achievements beyond the 2017 tax cut, Mr. Stewart argues, his presidency is emerging as a case study in how not to govern.

Confronting #MeToo in economics

Sexual harassment, discrimination and bullying are rampant in economics, a field that regularly isolates and dissuades women and minorities and that has only recently begun to address its entrenched culture of exclusion, write Ben Casselman and Jim Tankersley of the NYT.

The issue arose often last weekend at the annual meeting of the American Economic Association in Atlanta, they report, where women from Ivy League schools told stories of wearing khakis and loafers to fit in with their male colleagues and new research was released showing that only 10 percent of tenured finance professors are women.

Ben Bernanke, the former Fed chairman and the group's president, said at the event that ""economics certainly has a problem"" and ""a reputation for hostility toward women and minorities."" Janet Yellen, who was the Fed's first chairwoman and will head the association next year, said that dealing with misconduct and discrimination ""should be the highest priority.""

Last month, the NYT wrote about harassment accusations against Roland G. Fryer Jr., a prominent Harvard economist, who had been expected join the association's executive committee this month but was asked to resign.

A #MeToo lawsuit: The board of Google's parent company, Alphabet, is being sued in California over the departure of Andy Rubin, a senior executive known as the ""father of Android."" The shareholder lawsuit alleges that directors knew about an investigation into a sexual harassment claim against Mr. Rubin but nevertheless played an ""active and direct role"" in approving a $90 million severance package for him. The NYT reported in October that Google made the payout after a female employee accused Mr. Rubin of coercing her into performing oral sex.

China trade talks head for Washington

Negotiations between China and the U.S. are advancing, with China's vice premier and economic chief, Liu He, heading to Washington on Jan. 30 and 31. He will meet with the U.S. trade representative, Robert Lighthizer, and the Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin, according to the WSJ.

The next-level gathering, unless it is stymied by the government shutdown, will continue three days of midlevel discussions in Beijing that wrapped up on Wednesday with a sense of progress but few specific resolutions.

This fight does have some winners: Tariffs on Chinese and American cars could bolster automakers in Japan. Restrictions on American soybeans could help farmers in Brazil and Canada.

But investors want resolution. The standoff has shaken global markets, and signs of optimism from negotiators lifted stocks this week. Today in Asia, the Hang Seng, Nikkei, Kospi and Shanghai Composite indexes all closed higher.

Espionage in China: A Chinese employee of Huawei and a Polish employee of the French telecommunications company Orange have been arrested in Poland, charged with spying for the Chinese government.

Patience is the Fed's new watchword

Jerome Powell, the Federal Reserve chairman, said the central bank would evaluate the health of the economy before any further interest rate increases, using the word ""patience"" four times in his remarks. Financial markets have shown signs of anxiety about the economic outlook, but Mr. Powell said 2018 was ""a very good year for the economy."" The Fed, he said, saw signs of continued momentum.

In other Fed news: Most private economists expect it to hold interest rates steady at least until June, according to a WSJ survey. Last summer, the Fed's policy of quantitative tightening was expected to lift bond yields, but in the topsy-turvy world of Wall Street, the reaction has reversed in just a few months.

Earnings season is looking ugly

The forecast on Wall Street calls for plenty of pessimism, as a slew of companies slashed their financial predictions and announced cost-cutting measures yesterday:

* American Airlines said a measure of fourth-quarter revenue would gain just 1.5 percent, after previously promising as much as 3.5 percent. Delta, which will report its earnings on Tuesday, made a similar announcement earlier this month.

* Ford said it would cut thousands of jobs in Europe, as it faces declining demand and increasingly stringent emissions rules. Jaguar Land Rover said it was cutting 4,500 jobs because of ""multiple geopolitical and regulatory disruptions.""

* BlackRock, which will report its earnings on Wednesday, will show 500 employees the door in the next few weeks. The world's largest asset manager blamed ""market uncertainty.""

* Macy's suffered the biggest single-day sell-off in its history after scaling back its sales and earnings guidance.

* Holiday sales at Kohl's were disappointing, rising 1.2 percent last year from the year before, compared with a nearly 7 percent boost in 2017. Barnes & Noble said it might slash its outlook by as much as 10 percent because of higher spending on advertising and promotions.

* Bed Bath & Beyond was one of the few bright spots, saying it was ahead of some of its financial goals.

Many more businesses are scheduled to report results next week, with JPMorgan Chase and Wells Fargo earnings coming on Tuesday, Goldman Sachs and Bank of America on Wednesday, and Netflix and Morgan Stanley on Thursday.

But how long will it take the market react to the secrets likely buried in the ""dreary and repetitious"" prose that makes earning reports so ""mind-numbingly boring""? Months, probably, writes the NYT's Jeff Sommer.

24,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2018/12/19/us/politics/ap-us-united-states-syria-glance.html,"WASHINGTON -- Here, at a glance, is a look at U.S. involvement in Syria:

HOW IT STARTED

In September 2014, then-President Barack Obama launched a U.S. air campaign against the Islamic State in Syria, one month after starting airstrikes in neighboring Iraq. The Islamic State had built substantial military firepower in Syria, which it used to sweep across western and northern Iraq earlier in 2014.

In late 2015 the first American ground troops entered Syria -- initially 50, growing to the current official total of about 2,000. They recruited, organized and advised thousands of Syrian Kurdish and Arab fighters, dubbed the Syrian Democratic Forces, and pushed IS out of most of its strongholds.

___

MILITARY OPERATIONS

To date, the U.S.-led coalition has launched airstrikes on at least 17,000 locations in Syria since the start of the operation. Last week, there were strikes on 208 locations, largely on Islamic State fighters and facilities in the Middle Euphrates River Valley, according to the U.S. military.

Thousands of IS fighters have been killed or captured, but U.S. military officials say there are still as many at 2,000 insurgents still in the MERV, and a number of others who have escaped to various locations around the country.

___

COMPLICATIONS

Russia joined the big-power entanglement in Syria in the fall of 2015. Moscow said it was there to defeat terrorists, but Washington objected, saying the Russian military was propping up Syrian President Bashar Assad and making it more difficult to eliminate IS. To avoid aerial confrontations and accidents, U.S. and Russian military officials set up a telephone ""deconfliction line,"" which remains in effect.

Turkey's concern about links between the U.S.-supported Syrian Kurdish militias and Kurdish insurgents inside Turkey added a further complication for Washington. The Turkish military intervened in northern Syria, prompting the Syrian Kurds to temporarily abandon the fight against IS.

Iran has also maintained a presence in the country, supporting Assad and supplying weapons, the U.S. has asserted.

___

THE U.S. PULLOUT

President Donald Trump said his administration had continued the Syria fight only because of the IS threat. On Wednesday the president tweeted, ""We have defeated ISIS in Syria,"" and later U.S. officials said he had ordered a full withdrawal of U.S. forces there.

The Pentagon said in a prepared statement that IS-held territory had been ""liberated,"" but added that the U.S. would continue ""working with our partners and allies to defeat ISIS wherever it operates."" Officials refused to say when all U.S. troops would be out of Syria.

___

REACTION TO THE DECISION: OPPPONENTS

The decision has been met with widespread condemnation and only a smattering of support.

Pentagon leaders were largely mum on Wednesday, adhering to the mandate that U.S. civilian leaders make policy and the military salutes and moves forward. But top defense officials have been blunt in recent assessments that the fight against the Islamic State is not over.

Brett McGurk, the administration's envoy for the fight against IS, said on Dec. 11: ""It would be reckless if we were just to say, well, the physical caliphate is defeated, so we can just leave now. I think anyone who's looked at a conflict like this would agree with that.""

Sen. Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican, called the pullout ""catastrophic,"" and Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., deemed it a ""disaster in the making.""

Sen. Jeanne Shaheen, D-N.H., said an ill-informed and hasty withdrawal may breathe new life into ISIS and other insurgent groups, and ""will also cede America's hard-fought gains in the region to Russia, Iran and Assad.""

___

REACTION TO THE DECISION: SUPPORTERS

Sen. Rand Paul, R-Ky., said he was ""very supportive"" of the decision. ""For the first time in my lifetime we have a president with the courage to declare victory and bring the troops home. We haven't had a president in 20 or 30 years who can figure out how to declare victory,"" he said.

Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., said Americans don't want troops in Syria in perpetuity. ""We brought them there to crush ISIS. We've crushed ISIS. We have troops in Iraq who can spring over there (to Syria) to do something"" if needed.",1022517851
25,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/14/business/economy/americas-inequality-problem-real-income-gains-are-brief-and-hard-to-find.html,"Working families finally got a raise.

Early on Tuesday, the Census Bureau provided some long-awaited good news for the beleaguered working class: The income of the typical American household perched on the middle rung of the income ladder increased a hearty 5.2 percent in 2015, the first real increase since 2007, the year before the economy sank into recession.

Households all the way down the income scale made more money last year. The average incomes of the poorest fifth of the population increased 6.6 percent after three consecutive years of decline. And the official poverty rate declined to 13.5 percent from 14.8 percent in 2014, the sharpest decline since the late 1960s.

The numbers are heartening, confirming that the sluggish yet consistent recovery of the American economy has finally begun to lift all boats. They fit the story coming from the job market, which is about as tight as it has been in a very long time. They follow rises in the minimum wage across many states and municipalities.

""This shows the importance of robust labor markets,"" said Jared Bernstein, a former top economic adviser to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. ""If working-age Americans are going to get ahead, it is through a paycheck.""

And yet this positive news -- while clearly undermining Donald J. Trump's unbridled pessimism about the American economy -- does not justify unbridled celebration, either.

""The next question is why did it take such a long time for things to look good?"" said Arloc Sherman of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning policy analysis group. As Sheldon H. Danziger of the Russell Sage Foundation put it, it's great news that men's earnings from work increased 1.5 percent. But they are still lower than in the 1970s.

The answer does not just involve sluggish growth. It is also about its distribution. Gains may be finally trickling down to those at the bottom of the ladder. But the numbers still offer a lopsided picture, with a gargantuan share of income rising to the top. While the bottom fifth of households increased their share of the nation's income, by the census's definition, to 3.4 percent from 3.3 percent, the richest 5 percent kept 21.8 percent of the pie, the same as in 2014.

""There's an inequality problem,"" Mr. Sherman added.

Against the backdrop of the last few decades, the income gains revealed on Tuesday underscore how difficult the American economy has made it for average workers to get ahead. In nearly every successive economic cycle, progress came slower and harder than in the previous one.

The data, which measured how Americans were doing six years into the economic recovery, show that incomes in the middle, measured in 2015 dollars, were still 1.6 percent below the previous peak of $57,423 a household, which was attained in 2007, just before the economy sank into what has come to be known as the Great Recession.

How does that look compared to the nation's recent history? After the economy slipped into recession in 1969, it took only three years for incomes in the middle to rebound and surpass their previous peak. After the downturn of 1973, it took five; after back-to-back recessions in 1981 and 1982, it took seven.

And, except for the long expansion that ran from 1991 through 2000, it has been getting worse. The economic growth from late 2001 to about the end of 2007 never even managed to deliver incomes above the previous peak for the typical household, reached near the end of Bill Clinton's presidency. The expansion underway today may not get there, either.

Today, median household incomes are still 2.4 percent below the absolute peak they hit in 1999 -- when Facebook had yet to come into existence, the big news in the music business was Napster, and the good times in Silicon Valley were about to come crashing down with the collapse of the dot-com bubble.

At the bottom of the ladder, households at the 10th percentile -- those poorer than 90 percent of the population -- are still a bit poorer than they were in 1989. Americans have managed to develop an internet economy, invent social media and build driverless cars since then, but not to improve the lot of those at the bottom.

What's more, changes starting in 2013 in the way the census asks people about their incomes can distort comparisons with previous years. After adjusting the data for these changes, according to Elise Gould of the Economic Policy Institute, the income of American households in the middle of the distribution last year was still 4.6 percent below its level in 2007 and 5.4 percent below where it was in 1999.

Of course, the Census Bureau's numbers on income and poverty don't add up to a perfect representation of families' means. For one thing, they include only ""money income"" -- excluding in-kind government benefits like housing vouchers or food stamps. They don't include the impact of taxes, ignoring the earned-income tax credit, which provides substantial help to families with low earnings.

The official poverty line, moreover, is assessed using a basket of necessities defined in the 1960s -- which has little to do with people's lives today. Over the last few years the census has also published an alternative Supplemental Poverty Measure -- which keeps a better tab on Americans' income and expenditures. Using that count, poverty dipped to 14.3 percent, the lowest level since the census began compiling it in 2009.

Analysts like Scott Winship of the right-leaning Manhattan Institute have argued for some time that long-term income numbers, like those published by the Congressional Budget Office, suggest that Americans in the middle of the income distribution and below have not done badly over recent decades. He concludes that the best strategy to promote the welfare of working Americans is to focus on improving overall economic growth. The fixation with inequality and income distribution, he says, will produce bad policy.

The current census data does suggest that growth can ultimately bring prosperity to average Americans. Still, it also points to the persistence of wide inequality as being at the center of the story.

Across the entire bottom 60 percent of the distribution, households are taking home a smaller slice of the pie than they did in the 1960s and 1970s. The 3.4 percent of income that households in the bottom fifth took home last year was less than the 5.8 percent they had in 1974. With their share shrinking with almost every economic cycle, it is hardly a surprise that it takes longer for them to experience any income gains at all. Growth, alone, is not adding to their prosperity as it once did.

By contrast, households in the top 5 percent have profited nicely from America's expansions. In 2015, they took in $350,870, on average. That is 4.9 percent more than in 1999 and 37.5 percent more than in 1989.

Historical precedent suggests the latest economic expansion is getting long in the tooth. Lawrence Summers, Treasury secretary under Bill Clinton and a top economic adviser in President Obama's first term, says there are better than even odds today that the United States will tip into a recession within three years. In July, Deutsche Bank said the probability of a recession within the next 12 months had jumped to 60 percent, the highest since August 2008. JPMorgan thinks the odds are 37 percent.

For all but Americans at the very top, that means that the punch bowl may well be taken away again before the party really gets going. That is not how a well-functioning economy should work.",1040215127
26,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/18/us/beyond-coal-imagining-appalachias-future.html,"PIKEVILLE, Ky. -- Here in the heart of central Appalachian coal country, an economic experiment is underway inside an airy renovated Coca-Cola bottling plant. Most days, Michael Harrison, a former mine electrician and ""buggy man"" who once drove trucks 700 feet underground, can be found hunched over a silver laptop, designing websites for clients like the Pikeville tourism board.

Mr. Harrison, 36, is one of 10 former mine workers employed at BitSource, an internet start-up founded by two Pikeville businessmen determined to prove a point: that with training and encouragement, Kentucky miners can learn to code.

""We told them, 'Quit thinking of yourselves as unemployed coal workers; you're technology workers,'"" said Rusty Justice, a founder of BitSource. He called his pep talks ""reimagination training.""

Nearly 13,000 coal jobs -- and countless more in related industries -- have disappeared in Kentucky since President Obama took office; coal employment is at its lowest level since 1898. In Washington, Democrats and Republicans remain locked in a feud over whether Mr. Obama's aggressive environmental regulations amount to a ""war on coal."" On the presidential campaign trail, Donald J. Trump is vowing to ""put our miners back to work.""

But across central Appalachia, and especially here in eastern Kentucky, elected officials, business leaders, environmentalists and community advocates are looking beyond politics to wrestle with a question essential to the region's survival: What comes after coal?

The founders of BitSource are not the only ones thinking creatively; there are nascent efforts in craft agriculture and energy efficiency as well. These initiatives will not cure central Appalachia's economic woes; at BitSource, Mr. Harrison was among 1,000 laid-off miners who applied for 10 jobs.

Rather, said Lora Smith, who oversees grants in central Appalachia for the Mary Reynolds Babcock Foundation, they represent lurching steps into what one local writer called ""a terrifying liberation"" for a region rich in natural resources whose people have deep ties to the land.

It is ""terrifying,"" Ms. Smith said, ""because people are out of work, but it's also this liberation, to reimagine what this place can be.""

Starting at Home

If Pikeville, population 6,900, offers a glimpse into coal country's uncertain future, Benham, Ky., with 500 mostly elderly residents, is a window into its past.

Benham was built a century ago as a coal mining camp by a subsidiary of International Harvester, which mined the nearby hillsides, extracting coal to make steel. Today, the signs of coal's decline are everywhere.

The old company store is a mining museum. The brick schoolhouse, on a hillside overlooking the historic town, is an inn, said to be haunted. Abandoned houses lay crumbling in the hollows.

Yet on a spring afternoon, something unusual -- construction work -- was going on. It was part of a project to retrofit old company houses like one owned by Pearl Cope, 83, a retired mine company receptionist whose home is so energy inefficient she pays up to $650 a month for heat during the winter.

Carl Shoupe, 69, a retired miner and member of the local power board, organized the project with help from Kentuckians for the Commonwealth, a progressive advocacy group.

Mr. Shoupe, a onetime union organizer, is no fan of the coal industry. Badly injured in the mines, he sports a goatee to cover scars on his chin and wears an orthopedic shoe with a two-inch lift to compensate for a mangled left leg. He got into environmental advocacy about a decade ago, after giving up alcohol and finding God.

""I got to looking around, when all this mountaintop removal and strip mining and tearing up of our beautiful mountains was going on, and I started praying about it,"" he said.

To Mr. Shoupe, the retrofitting is a small step on the daunting path toward what environmentalists call a ""just transition"" -- economic growth that does not harm people's health or the land. To Joshua Bates, 21, who spent the afternoon blowing insulation into Mrs. Cope's basement, it means a job in the region he calls home.

""A lot of people have left,"" Mr. Bates said sadly. ""Eighty percent of my friends are gone.""

Tomatoes and Hemp

The road to Hippo, Ky., snakes through a hollow in Floyd County that runs across Brush Creek, not far from where Todd Howard's ancestors settled after the Revolutionary War.

Mr. Howard, 36, a seventh-generation Kentuckian, grew up here, dodging coal trucks on his bike and watching miners tromp off to work toting their lunch buckets. When he was 19, he joined his father's business, helping mining companies navigate the cumbersome permit bureaucracy.

But by 2009, with fewer permits being handed out, the company closed. ""That sort of catapulted me into this farming thing,"" he said.

His path into farming began in February 2010, when he persuaded his wife that they should put a greenhouse in their backyard, and planted 42 varieties of heirloom tomatoes.

Out-of-work Kentuckians are increasingly turning to farming ""out of necessity,"" said Martin Richards, who runs Kentucky's Community Farm Alliance. His group works with eight farmers' markets in eastern Kentucky, including one Mr. Howard helped found with another seventh-generation Kentuckian, Nathan Hall; Mr. Richards says twice as many farmers participate as did five years ago.

In 2014, Congress allowed certain states, including Kentucky, to begin farming industrial hemp after a ban of 60 years. Mr. Hall, 33, a Yale M.B.A. student who also studies environmental management (and briefly worked as a miner), was already exploring the idea of growing hemp, first cultivated in Kentucky in 1775.

Today, with grants from companies like Patagonia, the clothing manufacturer, he and Mr. Howard are growing hemp on six sites in four counties -- including five acres of reclaimed surface mine -- and have big dreams to scale up.

People here often say there will be no silver bullets, but rather ""one thousand silver BBs"" to replace lost coal jobs. Mr. Hall offers a variation: ""We want to be a part of the silver buckshot,"" he said, ""that's going to hopefully transform this region.""

Luring the Young

Reimagining central Appalachia will take more than putting unemployed miners back to work. It will also require giving young people a reason to stay.

In 2013, Representative Harold Rogers, a Republican who has been eastern Kentucky's congressman for 35 years, and Steve Beshear, the governor at the time and a Democrat, became founders of SOAR, Shaping Our Appalachian Region, an initiative intended to promote innovation. They were tired of solutions that came from Washington.

""We decided that whatever we did would have to be sprung from within,"" Mr. Rogers said.

SOAR convened its first Innovation Summit here in December 2013, in the middle of a blizzard; 1,700 people showed up. That inspired Mr. Justice of BitSource and his business partner, M. Lynn Parrish, whose engineering and excavation company has lost 70 percent of its customers in the coal downturn. They founded BitSource, with help from a federal grant, in an effort to diversify.

About an hour away in Whitesburg, the leaders of Appalshop, an arts organization that grew out of President Lyndon B. Johnson's War on Poverty, were also rethinking the group's future in a post-coal economy. Ada Smith, 29, is among a new generation taking over; she is the daughter of an Appalshop founder, Herb E. Smith, 64, a filmmaker and miner's son who has spent the past half-century documenting union fights, mine disasters, polluted land and water, and wrenching cycles of boom and bust.

""What's needed in this transition,"" said Ms. Smith, who returned home after college, ""are people in the region who want to stay -- and figure it out.""

That rethinking led Appalshop to create a for-profit digital marketing venture, Mountain Tech Media. It was unveiled in March at a party where a gourmet moonshiner, an early client, served thimble-size drinks. The company, a worker-owned cooperative, has two full-time employees on a team of 12, its chief executive, Jeremy McQueen, 30, said. The hope is to hire local young people over time.

On a bright Monday in June, SOAR held its third Innovation Summit here. It looked like a convention of tree-huggers and suits. Lunch was served outside while a bluegrass band played. There were two sandwich options: pulled pork and vegan wraps.

Old coal country tensions flared. While Mr. Rogers was speaking, Ada and Herb Smith helped unfurl a banner opposing the construction of a $444 million prison. Mr. Rogers says it will bring 300 jobs, but Mr. Smith calls it ""the wrong answer to the region's economic problems.""

Mr. Parrish, who has known Mr. Smith for decades (their wives were college sorority sisters), was furious. ""We're all there trying to do solutions,"" he said. ""This was not the venue to do that in.""

Even so, Mr. Justice and Mr. McQueen made plans to get together, to talk about ways their fledgling tech companies might collaborate. The encounter spoke volumes about the current political moment here. As Mr. Justice said: ""Cats and dogs are sleeping together in the mountains now.""",1040233823
27,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/08/06/business/economy/jobs-report-unemployment-wages.html,"The American jobs machine has moved back into high gear.

After a long stretch of conflicting reports, the Labor Department said on Friday that the economy in July delivered a second consecutive month of robust hiring and rising wages in a signal that the expansion is strengthening, not ebbing, as it enters its eighth year.

Stocks surged, experts expressed more confidence that the Federal Reserve was likely to raise interest rates before the end of the year, and it was clear that long-stagnant wages for ordinary workers were advancing at a healthier pace.

""This was everything you could have asked for, maybe more,"" said Michelle Meyer, head of United States economics at Bank of America Merrill Lynch. ""We're seeing new entrants into the labor market, which implies a longer runway for the business cycle.""

With the political conventions completed, the buoyant jobs numbers also have major implications for the presidential campaigns of Hillary Clinton and Donald J. Trump.

Not only does the new data undercut Republican arguments that the recovery is faltering, it also suggests that after years of paltry gains, deeply frustrated workers are finally seeing some benefits from the drop in unemployment, which was unchanged last month at a relatively low 4.9 percent.

Wages are up 2.6 percent over the last 12 months, a faster pace than earlier in the recovery, and many economists expect that the gain in incomes, adjusted for inflation, will accelerate later this year and into 2017.

""The idea that Republicans are touting, that the job market is a wreck, is clearly belied by the data,"" said Jared Bernstein, an economist who served in the Obama administration. ""What matters most to people isn't G.D.P. growth, it's jobs and wages.""

Longtime G.O.P. economic hands like Wayne Berman, a veteran of several Republican presidential campaigns, conceded Friday's data was favorable for Democrats, but insisted it represented a snapshot of the economy, not necessarily the underlying trends. A major failing in the recovery, Republicans note, is that millions of Americans who dropped out of the work force during the recession have still not found jobs.

July's jobs number ""is a good statistic for Clinton to pivot towards,"" said Mr. Berman, who currently serves as a top official at the Blackstone Group and advised Senator Marco Rubio of Florida during the Republican primary. He noted, however, that the economy grew at an annual rate of just 1 percent in the first half of 2016, a sharp decrease from last year.

""We're in a very mixed economic picture now,"" said Mr. Berman, recalling the presidential campaign of Senator Bob Dole two decades ago, when attacks on Bill Clinton's economic record failed to resonate at a time of rising prosperity. ""You can't say this is like 1996, when there was no oxygen for Bob Dole's arguments.""

The July increase in payrolls stands in sharp contrast to data released just last week showing disappointing economic growth in April, May and June.

A reason for the difference is that parts of the economy are still suffering from the continuing fallout from low oil prices as energy companies cut back on investment. Government spending also has been weak and many companies, at least for now, prefer to hire more workers rather than invest in new equipment and increase their efficiency and output.

If business and government investment continue to lag, that could undermine the long-term ability of the American economy to be more productive and raise living standards for most workers.

In late spring, the government reported that job creation in May was much weaker than economists had expected; a big rebound in June similarly caught the experts off guard. The July data helps clear up some of the confusion.

""This is a validator,"" said Michael Gapen, chief United States economist at Barclays. ""This is a report that indicates that the slowdown in hiring earlier in the year has been reversed.""

June's gain was revised upward by 5,000 jobs, and May's by 13,000. The combination of better gains in the spring and July's increase in hiring means that the Federal Reserve is likely to have a more vigorous debate about raising interest rates when it meets in September. But most experts think the Fed will wait until December to be sure the economy remains on a solid track.

The Fed said in July, after the most recent meeting of its policy-making committee, that the economy was growing more strongly and there were fewer clouds on the horizon, suggesting it was giving greater consideration to rate increases later this year.

But on the policy-making front, William C. Dudley, the president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York and an influential adviser to Janet L. Yellen, the Fed's chairwoman, said on Sunday that current economic conditions still called for ""caution in raising U.S. short-term interest rates.""

Job openings are spreading. ""It's been a really good summer for hiring all across the country,"" said Tom Gimbel, chief executive of LaSalle Network, a recruiting and staffing firm based in Chicago. ""Business has been great. Kids coming out of college are getting hired, and we're seeing a lot of activity in the $50,000 to $150,000 category.""

The upswing in jobs last month also coincided with a sharp drop in unemployment among the least-educated workers, a group that has missed out on nearly all the gains of the current recovery thus far.

Other measures of the labor market suggest that underlying joblessness is higher than the official 4.9 percent rate, although nowhere near the 42 percent level Mr. Trump suggested last fall.

The broadest measure of unemployment calculated by the Labor Department, which includes workers who want full-time positions but cannot find them, stood at 9.7 percent in July.

To arrive at his figure, Mr. Trump apparently compared the total civilian population aged 16 and up -- about 253.6 million people -- with the 102 million Americans who are not in the labor force, according to Bureau of Labor Statistics data.

But in addition to the 7.7 million currently counted as unemployed, that larger figure includes more than 50 million Americans above the age of 55 who say they don't want to work and are, for the most part, retired. It also takes into account 13.5 million Americans age 16 to 24, most of them in school, and millions of women who have chosen to stay home to care for their young children. None of those people are considered unemployed by the Labor Department.

The payroll figures, which reflect hiring at companies and in the public sector, revealed broad-based job gains, not just in lower-paid sectors like retail and leisure and hospitality, but in high-paying fields like professional and business services as well.

The household survey, which has offered a mixed picture in the past, was also robust.

The jobless rate for high school dropouts, which has been elevated throughout the recovery, fell more than a full percentage point to 6.3 percent, suggesting that employers who had previously ignored these lower-skilled workers are now taking a second look.

As the unemployment rate has fallen, some employers have raised salaries to retain their best workers and attract new ones. Increases in the minimum wage in many states recently, and increases in the lowest-tier salaries by big employers like Walmart, Target and Aetna, are also beginning to ripple through the broader work force.

But a two-tier job market remains in place, with workers in the same region facing radically different conditions depending on their level of education and skills.

In San Francisco, even the most junior software engineers hired at Sunverge, a maker of energy storage systems for solar electricity users, command starting salaries of just over $100,000.

A little more than 60 miles to the east, at Sunverge's assembly plant in Stockton, Calif., where the unemployment rate is 9 percent, new blue-collar workers can expect to earn about $14 an hour, or $29,000 a year.

Sunverge is bulking up in both cities. But hiring technical talent is much more time-consuming, said Stu Statman, Sunverge's chief of engineering.

""It doesn't seem like it's that hard to find good factory workers in Stockton,"" Mr. Statman said. ""In San Francisco, if you're talking about software engineers or developers, it's very hard. It takes a long time, and there's a huge amount of hunger out there for people with these skills.""",1040215138

Trade, Immigration, and the Revolt Against Globalization

By John B. Judis

157 pp. Columbia Global Reports. Paper, $15.99.

Since the twin convulsions of 2016, Trump and Brexit, a cottage industry has evolved dedicated to explaining these phenomena, especially to liberals shocked and appalled by them both. John B. Judis was an early entrant into the field, publishing ""The Populist Explosion"" to wide acclaim just before Donald Trump was elected president. Like many of his fellow explainers, Judis writes as a liberal who has wised up, one who has seen what so many of his progressive confreres have missed and who sighs with exasperation at how desperately out of touch they have become.

His project in ""The Nationalist Revival"" is to explain the resurgence of nationalism, in both the United States and Europe. Once again, his timing is sharp: The fall midterm campaign saw Trump tell a Houston rally, ""You know what I am? I'm a nationalist. OK? I'm a nationalist."" In that same speech, the president pitted himself against ""corrupt, power-hungry globalists,"" deploying a term understood by anti-Semites as a code word for Jews. A week later, a self-described nationalist gunned down 11 Jews at prayer in Pittsburgh. So an inquiry into nationalism seems both necessary and urgent.

Methodically and with data widely drawn, Judis points the finger at a globalization that has seen once well-rewarded jobs shipped overseas; at immigration and the cultural and economic resentment it stirs; and at terrorism and the fear of the other it provokes. He also reminds us that ethnic nationalism is hardly new in the United States -- that the melting pot self-conception of the American nation is relatively recent and that for more than a century the American people conceived their country in strictly white, northern European and Protestant terms. Wisely, he argues that nationalism does not have an innate political color, that it can shade right or left depending on the ideological pigment with which it is combined.

With that context established, his focus is on the here and now and on explaining the current nationalist surge. Such an endeavor always carries a risk: that in seeking to explain a phenomenon, you stray into justifying it. Judis crosses that line more than once. Straining hard to see the world from the point of view of a voter for Trump or, say, the Hungarian strongman Viktor Orban, he too often channels that view unchallenged, accepting too many of its assumptions.

He draws, for example, on the typology set out by the British writer David Goodhart, who divides voters into two categories: Anywheres and Somewheres. The latter tend to live in once-homogeneous towns rather than diverse cities, valuing tradition and rootedness, while the former are footloose, prizing the novel over the long-established and constructing their identity from their individual professional or educational achievements rather than from the collective affiliations into which they were born. In this view, it is the Somewheres, often left behind economically and alienated by the rush to diversity, who have driven the nationalist revival, backing Trump, Brexit and a host of xenophobic politicians across Europe, while Anywheres remain stubbornly clueless about the pain and cultural dislocation their fellow citizens have endured.

But Judis, like Goodhart, too easily caricatures Anywheres as unmoored citizens of the world (both writers eschew the phrase ""rootless cosmopolitans,"" with its unhappy history, but that's the idea). Anywheres are disconnected from and deaf to the natural feelings of national kinship that animate their less well-heeled, less educated countrymen and women. Judis constructs a straw man when he takes on ""the cosmopolitan liberals who believe in a borderless world,"" for how many liberal arguments, outside a John Lennon lyric, seriously demand a world without countries?

Similarly, in fleshing out the supposed outlook of these cosmopolitans, a category that he estimates makes up ""perhaps, 15 to 20 percent of the electorate,"" he cites a poll taken of the founders of internet start-ups in Silicon Valley, as if that tiny, rarefied group reflects the views of one-fifth of the American population. Sure, these tech millionaires and billionaires love immigration and value ""global trade"" over ""American workers,"" but they are outliers.

More troubling is Judis's embrace of some of the presumptions that underlie the hawkish nationalism he aims to analyze. A small tell is his adoption of aquatic language when discussing immigration: Twice we read of a ""flood"" of refugees. Elsewhere a ""trickle"" of migrants becomes ""a raging stream."" It's only a small act of dehumanization, but it is such a common trope of anti-immigrant rhetoric that one would have expected Judis to be on guard against it.

It is striking too that Judis accepts the link that xenophobic nationalists make between immigration and terrorism. True, he is careful to write that this is the perception of anxious voters drawn toward nationalism, but he could surely have devoted a sentence or two to the question of whether that perception has a solid basis in fact. ""Some of the terrorist incidents involved refugees,"" he writes. That's true of a handful of cases in Europe, though the vast majority of incidents did not involve refugees. Meanwhile, the number of acts of terror that have been committed by refugees in the United States since 1980 hovers between one and zero, depending on whether you count only fatal acts (zero) or nonfatal ones (one).

Judis handles other (white) nationalist prejudices the same way. ""Many Americans blamed the rise of welfare spending ... on new Hispanic immigrants and newly empowered blacks using relaxed welfare laws to free ride,"" he writes, again without challenge. Later we learn of the ""resentment that many in the Euro-American core felt toward African-Americans and Latino immigrants, whom they believed to be benefiting from government programs without paying taxes to support them."" Sure, the verbs here are ""blamed"" and ""believed,"" but it would not have impaired Judis's exercise in understanding to note that black and Latino Americans are of course taxpayers too.

There's a reason this matters. The fact that many of these hostile perceptions of migrants and minorities are often only loosely grounded in reality is surely central to understanding the current nationalist surge. It tells us that this is as much about fear as it is about reality. Judis himself provides the evidence, noting that the number of illegal immigrants entering the United States peaked in 2007 and has declined ever since. Yet Trump was able to use the issue of supposedly rampant illegal immigration as rocket fuel for his campaign. Fear is the heart of the matter.

In a well-informed survey of the nationalist ascendancy in Europe, Judis again scolds liberals for being oblivious to nationalism's enduring power. He upbraids the European Union for insufficient sensitivity to the national yearnings of Poland and Hungary -- never quite saying whether the E.U.'s error has been in condemning those countries' drift toward illiberal democracy or in admitting them into the E.U. club in the first place -- and admonishes the Clinton and Obama administrations for a similar tin ear toward Russia. But here too he slips from explanation to justification, adopting what sounds a lot like Putin's narrative. In his telling Russia did not invade or annex Crimea, for example, but merely ""reclaimed"" it.

Still, Judis would surely wave aside these objections as typical liberal fastidiousness, untuned to the more elemental, raw longings of national identity that liberals need to accommodate fast. On that point, he makes a robust case: Liberals have indeed underestimated for too long the need for a collective sense of belonging, failing to see that any social democratic project involving redistribution or welfare spending requires a basic level of fellow-feeling among citizens. That too is nationalism, and this book is a timely, if flawed, reminder of its importance.",1021179404
29,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/16/business/media/national-enquirer-trump-mistresses.html,"The most powerful print publication in America might just be The National Enquirer. It functioned as a dirty-tricks shop for Donald J. Trump in 2016, which would have been the stuff of farce -- the ultimate tabloid backs the ultimate tabloid candidate -- if it hadn't accomplished its goal.

The Enquirer's power was fueled by its covers. For the better part of the campaign season, Enquirer front pages blared sensational headlines about Mr. Trump's rivals from eye-level racks at supermarket checkout lanes across America. This stroke-of-genius distribution apparatus was dreamed up by the man who made The Enquirer the nation's biggest gossip rag: its previous owner, Generoso Pope Jr.

The Enquirer's racks, under the current chief, David J. Pecker, were given over to the Trump campaign. This was a political gift even more valuable than the $150,000 that The Enquirer paid in a ""catch-and-kill"" deal with the former Playboy model Karen McDougal for her story of an affair with Mr. Trump.

Wondering what The Enquirer's covers were worth to the Trump campaign, I called Regis Maher, a co-founder of Do It Outdoors, the national mobile and digital billboard company. He said a campaign with that level of national prominence would cost $2.5 million to $3 million a month.

""It's such a powerful placement,"" Mr. Maher said. ""Everybody's gotta go to the grocery store.""

With the news last week that The Enquirer had admitted to federal prosecutors that it made the catch-and-kill payment to influence the election, it's worth stepping back and appreciating the unlikely role played by the supermarket tabloid and its parent company, American Media Inc., in electing the 45th president of the United States.

Now that federal prosecutors have cleared away some of the fog that shrouded the 2016 campaign, it's easy to see that The Enquirer was more than just a publication that puffed up Mr. Trump while going after his rivals.

It was the real-world embodiment of the fantasy online world of trolls, Russian and domestic, who polluted the political discourse. From its perches at Publix and Safeway, it was often doing the same job as Alex Jones, of the conspiracy site Infowars, and the more strident Trump campaign surrogates on Twitter and Facebook.

The Enquirer spread false stories about Hillary Clinton -- illnesses concealed, substance abuse, child prostitution, bribery, treason. Each cover trumpeting these tales was arguably more powerful than a tweet from an account with millions of followers.

It's a shame it went this route, because The Enquirer was built to cover Mr. Trump's wild ride. If it had only stuck with its original mission -- digging up dirt on the rich and famous, without a care for the rules of traditional journalism -- it would have had the tabloid story of a lifetime.

Instead, it refused to unlock its vault of Trump tips and stories as it promoted him as America's savior. Actually, make that the world's. As one Enquirer report in early 2016 had it -- from ""a source close to Donald'' -- even President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia wanted him to win the White House.

""It was like a double whammy,"" Jennifer Palmieri, Mrs. Clinton's campaign communications director, told me. ""They could have been covering all of Trump's misdeeds. But, instead, not only were they not reporting on that, they were a pipeline from dark-net conspiracy theories to grocery-store lines.""

With its online cohorts, American Media Inc. helped build a powerful distortion machine that so polluted election-season news cycles that, for its more receptive audiences, Mrs. Clinton not only deserved to lose the White House, she deserved time in the big house.

Before making her its main target, the machine chewed up Senator Ted Cruz. It ran unsubstantiated allegations of extramarital affairs against him at a time when he was proving himself Mr. Trump's most stubborn Republican challenger.

The only person quoted by name in the affairs piece was Roger J. Stone Jr., a longtime adviser to Mr. Trump, who was quoted as saying, ""Where there's smoke, there's fire."" (Mr. Stone, who communicated with top campaign officials through the election, is under investigation by the special counsel Robert S. Mueller III.)

One passage in the Cruz story caught my eye. Citing a report in Radar Online -- a gossip outlet also owned by A.M.I. -- The Enquirer claimed that ""an individual purporting to be a representative of the hacker group Anonymous posted a disturbing Twitter video that threatens to expose 'very dirty secrets,' including information about Ted 'visiting prostitutes.'""

Here's an odd thing. Radar attributed the provenance of this supposed Anonymous video to an obscure Twitter handle with only a few thousand followers that has since gone dormant. A review of the account's activity found tweets and retweets of anti-Muslim and anti-immigrant messages relating to Europe, as well as a critique of the United States policy on Libya linked to a video from RT, the Russian state-financed cable network.

It makes you wonder if the inquiring mind of Mr. Mueller would like to know more about The Enquirer than he has let on. (Federal prosecutors in New York have led the investigation of A.M.I.)

Once Mr. Cruz was out of the way, two people familiar with A.M.I.'s operation told me, the company pulled up files on the Clintons that it had collected over decades -- some two dozen cardboard boxes filled with promising material.

A.M.I. began a painstaking effort to sort through the old clips and tips concerning ""pay-for-play"" deals, rumors of affairs and Vince Foster conspiracy theories. But as the campaign wore on, The Enquirer's covers favored stories similar to those coursing through Infowars, Russian trolldom and, increasingly, your uncle's Facebook feed.

According to one headline, Hillary was ""Corrupt! Racist! Criminal!"" In another, she was ""Eating Herself To Death!""

The Enquirer also reported -- make that ""reported"" -- that she had suffered ""three strokes,"" had ""liver damage from booze,"" and was prone to ""violent rages.""

A couple of weeks before Election Day, as Russian bots were pushing a narrative into Facebook of a ""Clinton ""body count,"" an Enquirer cover line screamed: ""Hillary Hitman Tells All.""

The false narratives built to a frenzy that included an appearance by the A.M.I. chief content officer Dylan Howard on Infowars and a cover promising that Mrs. Clinton and her aide Huma Abedin were ""Going to Jail"" for ""Treason! Influence Peddling! Bribery!""

Inside were the unsubstantiated allegations that Mrs. Clinton had ""covered up a child sex scandal"" -- which echoed the ""Pizzagate"" conspiracy -- and that her relationship with Ms. Abedin had ""lesbian undercurrents.""

For those who were seeing the same bilge online, The Enquirer's headlines and stories may have increased their doubts about the Democratic nominee. For those seeing such stuff for the first time, right next to the gum and candy, the false coverage may have been revelatory.

Placement on nationwide checkout lines was perhaps Mr. Pecker's greatest gift to Mr. Trump, and it's something that he inherited from Mr. Pope.

Watching his circulation plateau as his readers moved to the suburbs in the 1960s, Mr. Pope struck a deal with major grocery chains: He would build new racks to put magazines at eye level near the cash registers, arguing that more sales for him meant more profit for them, too.

""It gave us complete exposure, saturation, whatever you want to call it,"" his son Paul David Pope told me on Friday.

As the younger Mr. Pope's history of the family business, ""The Deeds of My Fathers,"" shows, The Enquirer was known to pull off an occasional ""catch-and-kill"" deal in the old days, including one involving Senator Edward M. Kennedy in a bid for access to Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis. But the tabloid usually raised hackles not because the stories it published were false, but because of its methods. This was a publication so hungry for celebrity dope that it sneaked a reporter -- disguised as a priest -- into Bing Crosby's funeral.

""I am sure my father's intention with his media empire was not to be used after his passing as an outlet for fake news,"" the younger Mr. Pope said.",1020067313
30,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/13/us/politics/florida-democrats-2020-election.html,"PEMBROKE PINES, Fla. -- After a painful midterm election for Florida Democrats that showed this crucial swing state drifting away from them, a group of party activists gathered at a Cuban restaurant last month to receive some bitter medicine -- and a sober warning -- to go with their croquettes and plantain chips.

Democrats started organizing Latino voters too late, didn't tailor their message for an increasingly diverse community and ultimately took Latino support for granted, a Florida pollster told about 50 members of the Democratic Hispanic Caucus of Broward County.

Democrats will lose again in 2020 if they don't move swiftly to win over Hispanics, the pollster, Eduardo Gamarra, told the group. ""You just need to start now,"" he said.

With the swearing-in last Tuesday of two newly elected Republican leaders, Gov. Ron DeSantis and Senator Rick Scott, Florida has become a more reliably red political bastion, making the path to Electoral College victory that much tougher for the 2020 Democratic nominee.

For Republicans, Florida stands out as the best political news from an otherwise grim year, a show of strength in a state that has voted for every presidential winner since 1992 and seems to be growing more favorable to their party at a moment when demographic changes are lifting Democrats elsewhere. The successful courting of up-for-grabs Hispanics, the surge of transplanted senior voters, the solidifying support in conservative North Florida: All illustrate why this prized battleground state is tilting to the right.

As for Democrats, they remain just as shellshocked as they were after Election Day, when it became clear that Bill Nelson, the state's longtime senator, and Andrew Gillum, the electrifying young mayor of Tallahassee, had lost by exceedingly close margins. As of Tuesday, there was still only one Democrat in statewide office.

""We just live in a red state here,"" said Alex Sink, a former Democratic state official who once narrowly lost a bid for governor. ""I think it's just tilted toward the Republicans now, and I hate to say that.""

The question looming over the state going into 2020 is the same one Democrats are wrestling with elsewhere: How can the party narrow its losses with voters who are older -- and in many cases white -- without alienating younger, nonwhite voters?

What is so agonizing for Democrats is that 2018 did little to clarify the best path. The party put forward Mr. Gillum, a 39-year-old black progressive, and Mr. Nelson, a 76-year-old white moderate who had been in elected office for nearly half a century. Mr. Nelson lost by about 10,000 votes and Mr. Gillum didn't fare much worse, losing by about 32,000 votes.

In other words, the party pursued two differing approaches in the same state and the same year -- nominating a progressive who could mobilize voters difficult to turn out in midterms as well as a moderate who would appear more amenable to persuadable voters -- and both failed.

That has done little to extinguish the intraparty debate, after a banner year for Democrats nationally, when they gained 40 House seats and seven governorships amid a backlash against President Trump.

Some moderates, including Ms. Sink, say flatly that Democrats would have won the governorship had they nominated former Representative Gwen Graham, who narrowly lost to Mr. Gillum in the primary. ""What would they have pinned on her?"" asked Ms. Sink, alluding to Mr. Gillum's left-wing politics and to an F.B.I. investigation into potential corruption in public real estate development in Tallahassee under Mr. Gillum.

More broadly, the pragmatic wing of the party argues that the only way to win in such a dead-center state is to promote consensus-oriented candidates who can limit Republican margins in Florida's rural and exurban areas.

Ms. Graham said the results last year made it clear that ""you have to have a candidate who can make a difference in areas where having a D behind your name makes people suspicious.""

Mr. Nelson, the recently ousted Democratic senator, says he has a preferred 2020 candidate, who he thinks might turn things around: former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr.

""I would say of the whole crowd, I think Biden would have the best chance in Florida,"" Mr. Nelson said of the 2020 field, allowing that he has encouraged his former colleague to run and believes he would be perceived ""as moderate enough.""

But these sorts of assessments make progressives want to pull their hair out.

Pointing to the near-identical results, they argue that many of the state's conservative-leaning voters made little distinction between Mr. Gillum and Mr. Nelson. Mr. Gillum's supporters also note that he improved upon the losses of the last two Democratic nominees for governor, who were both white.

""He got closer than anybody else did,"" said State Senator Oscar Braynon II, a Miami-area Democrat, pointing to how African-American turnout spiked from the last race for governor and suggesting no other candidate could have done that.

If the Democrats' challenges in Florida are difficult to resolve, they are easy enough to diagnose.

Florida is a microcosm of the country -- and some of what is dogging Democrats in the state reflects the party's broader challenges.

""This is not a progressive state,"" said Philip Levine, the former Miami Beach mayor who also ran unsuccessfully for governor. ""And that, in my opinion, is representative of the state of our country today. Florida is America.""

Florida's rural white voters, as elsewhere, have abandoned their ancestral allegiances and become reliable Republicans.

At the same time, Fox News-watching seniors from the Northeast and Midwest are flooding the state's retirement communities. They can be counted on to vote regularly, and they are increasingly supporting Republicans.

""You have a lot of retirees who reminisce about their childhoods every time they hear Donald Trump say 'Make America Great Again,'"" said Representative Darren Soto, an Orlando Democrat. ""And they vote in a higher percentage than anybody else.""

These transplants descending on Central Florida, the Gulf Coast, the Panhandle and parts of the Atlantic Coast run the socioeconomic gamut but share the same Republican loyalties. For example, two of the three counties with the strongest turnout in November were retiree hubs with notably different profiles.

The party's best-performing county in the state was Sumter, the Central Florida enclave that is home to the Villages retirement community and its thousands of golf cart-driving, middle-class seniors. But turnout was nearly as strong in Collier County, a more well-heeled community on the gulf that includes Naples.

Mr. Gillum and Mr. Nelson both received less than 35 percent of the vote in Collier County and less than 30 percent in Sumter County. These voters have little connection to state politics, are largely grounded in national issues and are overwhelmingly supportive of Mr. Trump.

Mr. Nelson still sounded in near disbelief weeks after his loss, which he attributed to Mr. Scott's self-financing and the faulty design of the Broward County ballot, which all but hid the Senate race on a bottom corner of the page.

But he seemed particularly anguished as he recounted losing the county where he grew up.

""We only got 43 percent,"" he said of Brevard County, contending that many there were not aware of his roots or what he had done for nearby Cape Canaveral.

Mr. Nelson recalled setting up a press round table at a local restaurant with a former NASA administrator who was supporting his campaign. When his staff arrived, he said, the manager on duty was so rude they decided to move the event elsewhere.

""He was just a Trump guy,"" said Mr. Nelson, lamenting the state and country's drift toward what he called political ""tribalism.""

More unique to Florida is the Republican Party's success at cutting deeply into the Democrats' share of the Latino vote.

Hispanic voters in Florida are more ideologically diverse than elsewhere in the country, and Democrats have lagged behind Republicans in understanding the nuances of these voters. According to a postelection survey conducted by Mr. Scott's campaign, which courted the bloc relentlessly, he won 48 percent of the Latino vote.

He and Mr. DeSantis both broadened the traditional Republican pitch to Cubans -- that they represent the party of freedom -- to woo more recent Central and South American immigrants who have also fled authoritarian regimes. And Mr. DeSantis used Mr. Gillum's support from Senator Bernie Sanders to label him a ""socialist,"" which has a more sinister connotation with these more recent émigrés than with many Americans.

Beyond Hispanics, Florida Republicans have long outperformed Democrats in their organizing efforts, especially when it comes to mobilizing reliably conservative voters in off-year elections. The party has had a virtual stranglehold on state government for more than two decades, giving it an advantage when it comes to redistricting, fund-raising from special interests and creating a farm system of new candidate talent.

Democrats have not won the governor's mansion since 1994. The only Democrat in statewide office is Agriculture Commissioner Nikki Fried, whose election represented one of the few bright spots for Florida Democrats this year, in addition to a ballot measure restoring voting rights to ex-felons.

Ms. Fried's success offered Democrats a few clues for how to win in the state: She ran on legalizing medical marijuana, gun control and addressing Florida's toxic algae. And Ms. Fried spent the last 24 hours of her race in a decidedly unusual region for a Democrat: Florida's deep-red Panhandle.

""There are so many issues that transcend partisan politics, and too many times we all get into our pigeonholes of what we're supposed to say and what we can get behind,"" she said.

Last month, the local party leaders hosted Tom Perez, the chairman of the Democratic National Committee, during Art Basel Miami Beach, one of the year's biggest events. Over lunch at Joe's Stone Crab, Democrats made the case for bringing the party's 2020 convention to Miami, acknowledging they could use the boost, according to Dan Gelber, the current Miami Beach mayor.

""Our toast tends to fall butter side down,"" he said.

Few Democrats know that better than the veteran Hispanic activists who gathered in Broward County a few days later to listen to Dr. Gamarra, a professor at Florida International University who studies public opinion among Latinos.

""It's the same thing over and over and over again,"" said Maurice A. Ferré, who served as Miami's first Hispanic mayor from 1973 to 1985. The Democratic Party, he said, ""feels that they can turn the switch on just a couple of months before.''

Well, it never worked that way,"" he said, ""and it never will.""",1039332244
31,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/10/us/politics/border-wall-government-shutdown.html,"McALLEN, Tex. -- President Trump traveled to the border on Thursday to warn of crime and chaos on the frontier, as White House officials considered diverting emergency aid from storm- and fire-ravaged Puerto Rico, Florida, Texas and California to build a border barrier under an emergency declaration.

In a sign of growing unease about the partial government shutdown, some Senate Republicans came off the sidelines to hash out a deal that would reopen the government as Congress worked toward a broader agreement tying wall funds to protection for some undocumented immigrants and other migrants.

But before those negotiations could gain momentum, they collapsed: Vice President Mike Pence and other members of Mr. Trump's team let it be known privately that the president would not back such a deal.

""It kind of fell apart,"" Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, said, looking dejected. ""I have never been more depressed about moving forward than I am right now. I just don't see a pathway.""

In a brief statement not long after, Mr. Graham declared, ""It is time for President Trump to use emergency powers to fund the construction of a border wall/barrier."" He added, ""I hope it works.""

The administration appeared to be looking into just that: using extraordinary emergency powers to get around Congress in funding the wall. The White House has directed the Army Corps of Engineers to examine emergency supplemental funds allocated last year after devastating hurricanes and wildfires that could instead be used to pay for the wall, according to congressional and Defense Department officials with knowledge of the matter, who insisted on anonymity to discuss the possibility.

But the president's advisers, including his son-in-law and senior adviser, Jared Kushner, whose role was first reported by The Wall Street Journal, have urged him to try to find other approaches than declaring a national emergency.

The advisers have warned him of a range of possible negative outcomes, particularly the risk of losing in court, people familiar with the discussions said. Some have suggested that Mr. Trump would be giving a dysfunctional Congress a pass from fulfilling its duties if he makes an aggressive move.

The White House counsel's office has explored an executive order, but officials there have also suggested that Mr. Trump should exhaust other options first. And some of his more conservative advisers have suggested it is a form of government overreach that is antithetical to conservative principles.

As the shutdown neared Day 21, Mr. Trump, used a visit to a border facility in McAllen, Tex., to blame the protracted shutdown affecting large sections of the federal government on Democrats, charging that their opposition to a wall was allowing for brutal crime and violence.

""You'll have crime in Iowa, you'll have crime in New Hampshire, you'll have crime in New York"" without a wall, he warned.

""If we had a barrier of any kind, whether it's steel or concrete,"" Mr. Trump said of tragic stories involving violence and human trafficking, ""they wouldn't even bother trying. We could stop that cold.""

In a bewildering set of statements that underscored the freewheeling, often contradictory nature of his attempts to force Democrats to capitulate, Mr. Trump renewed his threat to declare a national emergency and build his wall without congressional approval, but then suggested a short time later that he was open to a broader immigration deal that would grant legal status to undocumented immigrants.

""We can declare a national emergency,"" Mr. Trump said. ""We shouldn't have to.""

Later, standing just above the Rio Grande with military vehicles and border agents as his backdrop, he said he would consider a compromise that would allow undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as children, often known as Dreamers, to maintain legal status they lost when he ended the Obama-era program that protected them.

""I would like to do a much broader form of immigration,"" Mr. Trump said. ""We could help the Dreamers.""

Only hours earlier, Mr. Pence had rejected such a deal as part of the current negotiations, saying the president wanted to wait until the Supreme Court ruled this spring on whether an Obama-era program protecting young immigrants brought here illegally as children was constitutional. ""No wall, no deal,"" Mr. Pence declared in a briefing with reporters on Capitol Hill. ""We're going to keep standing strong, keep standing firm.""

The vice president faulted the Democrats, declaring it time for them to begin negotiating, but he has essentially blocked potential offramps for the impasse. He has made it clear that Mr. Trump would not drop his insistence on funding for a wall on the southwestern border, which Democrats have branded a nonstarter.

Mr. Pence also indicated that the president was disinclined to accept the idea behind a bipartisan plan that had been under discussion in the Senate -- similar to a measure that Republicans and Democrats supported last year, but that the White House rejected -- that would trade wall funding for legal status for undocumented immigrants facing the threat of deportation, including the Dreamers and people who previously held Temporary Protected Status.

Privately, he told Mr. Graham's group that the president would not support the developing proposal, which would have reopened the government for three weeks while Republicans and Democrats worked to hash out a broader legislative deal on the wall and temporary grants of legal status for the two groups.

""We're kind of stuck,"" Mr. Graham conceded.

Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Democrat of California, also showed no signs of budging, urging the Republican-controlled Senate to take up a measure that the House passed on Wednesday to reopen part of the government. The House passed two more measures on Thursday, this time funding the Departments of Housing and Urban Development, Transportation and Agriculture, as well as the Food and Drug Administration.

A dozen Republicans crossed party lines to support one of the measures -- slightly more than in previous votes, but no indication that the patience of Mr. Trump's own party was wearing thin.

""We say to them: 'Take yes for an answer. This is what you had proposed,'"" Ms. Pelosi said at a news conference. ""Why are you rejecting it at the expense of the health, safety and well-being of the American people? Do you take an oath to the American people, or to Donald Trump?""

The showdown has forced 800,000 federal workers to go without pay and placed federal benefits for millions more in jeopardy, with the fallout being felt across the United States. Without debate on Thursday, the Senate unanimously passed legislation to ensure that workers who go without salaries receive back pay when the government reopens. Senator Mitch McConnell Republican of Kentucky and the majority leader, said Mr. Trump had assured him he would sign the bill.

The partial shutdown will almost certainly become the longest in American history on Saturday, eclipsing a 21-day lapse that began in December 1995. Mr. Trump posted Thursday on Twitter that he would skip a planned trip to the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, slated to begin Jan. 22, because of the impasse.

Republican senators who had called for reopening the government while the debate over border security continues said they were disappointed.

""It's very difficult when we're dealing with people who do not want to budge at all with their positions, and that's the president and Speaker Pelosi,"" Senator Susan Collins of Maine said. ""They're each very dug in on their position, and that's made this very difficult to resolve.""

The implosion of the deal left lawmakers bracing for Mr. Trump to declare a national emergency. The administration was exploring whether it would be possible under such authority for Mr. Trump to divert disaster funds provided after deadly storms away from recovery and rebuilding and toward his border wall. Senior Democrats were exploring both legislative and legal options to challenge the move.

The president is allowed to divert unspent money from projects under a national emergency. But a senior administration official who spoke on the condition of anonymity to describe confidential discussions, questioned the legality of using Army Corps funding, saying it would be subject to restrictions under the Stafford Act, which governs disaster relief. The official said the process was as much a political exercise intended to threaten projects Democrats valued as a pragmatic one.

""That would be a travesty,"" Representative Peter A. DeFazio, Democrat of Oregon and the chairman of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, said in an interview.

""It's all speculative at this point,"" he said, alluding wryly to Mr. Trump's penchant for abrupt announcements at all hours of the day and night. ""Until we get a tweet at 2:30 tomorrow morning, we won't know.""",1037471945
32,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/aponline/2018/12/28/us/politics/ap-us-government-shutdown.html,"WASHINGTON -- The partial government shutdown will almost certainly be handed off to a divided government to solve in the new year, as President Donald Trump sought to raise the stakes Friday and both parties traded blame in the weeklong impasse.

Agreement eludes Washington in the waning days of the Republican monopoly on power, and that sets up the first big confrontation between Trump and newly empowered Democrats. Trump is sticking with his demand for money to build a wall along the southern border, and Democrats, who take control of the House on Jan. 3, are refusing to give him what he wants.

Trump worked to escalate the showdown Friday, reissuing threats to close the U.S.-Mexico border to pressure Congress to fund the wall and to shut off aid to three Central American countries from which many migrants have fled.

""We will be forced to close the Southern Border entirely if the Obstructionist Democrats do not give us the money to finish the Wall & also change the ridiculous immigration laws that our Country is saddled with,"" he wrote in one of a series of tweets.

The president also signaled he was in no rush to seek a resolution, welcoming the fight as he heads toward his own bid for re-election in 2020. He tweeted Thursday evening that Democrats may be able to block him now, ""but we have the issue, Border Security. 2020!""

Incoming acting chief of staff Mick Mulvaney said Trump had canceled his plans to travel to Florida to celebrate New Year's at his private Mar-a-Lago club.

The shutdown is forcing hundreds of thousands of federal workers and contractors to stay home or work without pay, and many are experiencing mounting stress from the impasse. It also is beginning to pinch citizens who count on public services. Gates are closed at some national parks, new farm loans will be put on hold beginning next week, and in New York, the chief judge of Manhattan federal courts suspended work on civil cases involving U.S. government lawyers, including several civil lawsuits in which Trump himself is a defendant.

The Smithsonian Institution also announced that museums and galleries popular with visitors and locals in the nation's capital will close starting midweek if the partial shutdown drags on.

The Environmental Protection Agency will keep disaster-response teams and other essential workers on the job as it becomes the latest agency to start furloughing employees in the government shutdown. Spokeswoman Molly Block says the EPA will implement its shutdown plan at midnight Friday. That will mean furloughing many of its roughly 14,000 workers.

Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla., released a statement applauding a decision by the administration to reverse new guidance issued by the Department of Homeland Security that prevented the Federal Emergency Management Agency from writing or renewing National Flood Insurance Program policies during the current government shutdown. He said it was important that people could continue to get and maintain their flood insurance.

With another long holiday weekend coming and nearly all lawmakers away from the Capitol there is little expectation of a quick fix.

""We are far apart,"" White House press secretary Sarah Sanders told CBS on Friday, claiming of Democrats, ""They've left the table all together.""

Mulvaney said Democrats are no longer negotiating with the administration over an earlier offer to accept less than the $5 billion Trump wants for the wall. Democrats said the White House offered $2.5 billion for border security, but that Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer told Vice President Mike Pence it wasn't acceptable.

""There's not a single Democrat talking to the president of the United States about this deal,"" Mulvaney said Friday

Speaking on Fox News and later to reporters, he tried to drive a wedge between Democrats, pinning the blame on House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi.

""My gut was that (Schumer) was really interested in doing a deal and coming to some sort of compromise. But the more we're hearing this week is that it's Nancy Pelosi who's preventing that from happening,"" he said, alleging that if Pelosi ""cuts a deal with the president of any sort before her election on January 3rd she's at risk of losing her speakership, so we're in this for the long haul.""

Pelosi has all but locked up the support she needs to win the gavel on Jan. 3 and there is also no sign of daylight between her and Schumer in the negotiations over government funding.

Mulvaney added of the shutdown: ""We do expect this to go on for a while.""

Democrats brushed off the White House's attempt to cast blame.

""For the White House to try and blame anyone but the president for this shutdown doesn't pass the laugh test,"" said Justin Goodman, a spokesman for Schumer.

Pelosi has vowed to pass legislation to reopen the nine shuttered departments and dozens of agencies now hit by the partial shutdown as soon as she takes the gavel, which is expected when the new Congress convenes.

Pelosi spokesman Drew Hammill added that Democrats ""are united against the President's immoral, ineffective and expensive wall"" and said Democrats won't seriously consider any White House offer unless Trump backs it publicly because he ""has changed his position so many times.""

""While we await the President's public proposal, Democrats have made it clear that, under a House Democratic Majority, we will vote swiftly to re-open government on Day One,"" Hammill said in a statement.

But even that may be difficult without a compromise because the Senate will remain in Republican hands and Trump's signature will be needed to turn any bill into law.

""I think it's obvious that until the president decides he can sign something -- or something is presented to him -- that we are where we are,"" said Sen. Pat Roberts, R-Kan., who opened the Senate on Thursday for a session that only lasted minutes.

Trump had said during his campaign that Mexico would pay for his promised wall, but Mexico refuses to do so. It was unclear how Trump's threat to close the border would affect his efforts to ratify an amended North American free trade pact.

He has repeatedly threatened to cut off U.S. aid to countries that he deems have not done enough to combat illegal immigration, but thus far he's failed to follow through. Experts have warned that cutting off aid money to El Salvador, Guatemala and Honduras could actually exacerbate the problem by worsening the poverty and violence that push many migrants to leave.

And it is Congress, not the president, which appropriates aid money.

Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador reacted cautiously to Trump's threat to close the border, calling it an ""internal affair of the U.S. government.""

""We are always seeking a good relationship with the United States. We do not want to be rash,"" he said.

33,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/12/us/politics/brexit-shutdown-us-britain-trump.html,"LONDON -- In Parliament, lawmakers are mired in gridlock over Britain's departure from the European Union, with no clear path forward. In Washington, President Trump stormed out of a meeting with congressional leaders who oppose his border wall, hardening a standoff that has shut down much of the government for longer than ever before.

Two governments paralyzed. Two populist projects stalled. Two venerable democracies in crisis.

Rarely have British and American politics seemed quite so synchronized as they do in the chilly dawn of 2019, three years after the victories of Brexit and Donald J. Trump upended the two nations' political establishments. The countries seem subject to a single ideological weather system -- one that pits pro-globalization elites against a left-behind hinterland.

The similarities abound: Brexiteers love to compare their cause to America's war for independence. At a recent right-wing rally, one man marched with a scale model of the Liberty Bell. Mr. Trump has exuberantly backed Brexit, while his friend, the Brexit godfather Nigel Farage, appears on Fox News, invoking Europe's migrant crisis as a reason to back Mr. Trump's wall.

""It's stunning how parallel this is,"" said Stephen K. Bannon, who was an architect of Mr. Trump's immigration policy as his former chief strategist, and is an ally of Mr. Farage. ""If you're going to challenge the system, the system is going to fight back.""

Mr. Bannon likened what he said was the growing possibility that Mr. Trump will declare a state of national emergency to build his wall over the objections of Congress to the once inconceivable but now real possibility that Britain will withdraw from the European Union in March without reaching a deal with Brussels -- a so-called hard Brexit.

""Trump is getting ready for his own no-deal, hard-out,"" Mr. Bannon said, even as Republicans and Mr. Trump's aides and family are urging him not to take such a step.

The trans-Atlantic dysfunction has far-reaching ramifications, given the role the United States and Britain, pillars of the NATO alliance, play in counterterrorism operations, intelligence sharing, sanctions enforcement, and dealing with conflict zones like Syria.

With both countries also turning away from multilateral trade agreements, China has the opportunity to step in and play an even bigger role in the global economy. And Russia has seen an opening to expand its influence in Europe, where rising nationalism has threatened to fracture the European Union.

Mr. Trump and the Brexiteers have ridden a nationalist tide in their countries as well, using a potent anti-immigration message to appeal to voters who yearn for a simpler, more traditional society that no longer exists.

In Britain, immigration has provided an electric current to conservative politics since at least 1968, when the lawmaker Enoch Powell delivered a seminal speech calling for immigrants to be repatriated. Quoting a Greek prophecy of ""the river Tiber foaming with much blood,"" Mr. Powell's speech is credited with propelling the Conservative Party to victory in the general election of 1970, though it also turned Mr. Powell into a political pariah.

Fear of immigration spiked over the last two decades as Britain was hit with a series of terrorist attacks by Islamist militants and watched as migrants from Syria, Libya and other war-torn countries flooded across Europe.

In the United States, where the right was once preoccupied by social issues like abortion and same-sex marriage, immigration surged as an issue because of the changes wrought by globalization. Manufacturing jobs moved overseas, where labor was cheaper, while immigrants took both unskilled and high-tech jobs previously held by Americans.

By 2008, the financial crisis had wiped out millions of jobs, keeping people out of work for years and deepening the sense of grievance among many Trump supporters that immigrants were working for less and robbing them of their livelihoods.

Local politicians in California and elsewhere shot to stardom by introducing anti-immigrant ordinances. The Tea Party movement emerged, with core issues similar to those of Mr. Farage's pro-Brexit U.K. Independence Party.

""The culture war has been replaced by a border war,"" said Michael Lind, a visiting professor at the Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs at the University of Texas. The residents of rural postindustrial areas came to view globalism sourly, he said, as an urgent problem.

""The people in those areas just said: 'O.K., we're not giving them any more time, the people in London and D.C., your time is up. We're not going to wait a few more years for a recovery,'"" said Mr. Lind, the author of ""Land of Promise: An Economic History of the United States."" ""They decided: 'There's a limited pie. This pie is not growing.'""

The urge to solve these problems by walling off the country from its neighbors is not a new one in either Britain or the United States. It partly reflects geography: Both are separated from much of the world by water, allowing them to experiment with isolationism.

""Brexit and the border wall are driven by the same impulse,"" said Robert Kagan, a foreign policy theorist at the Brookings Institution. ""Both reflect the island nation approach to the world, 'Wouldn't it be great if we could just cut ourselves off from everybody else?'""

""Britain, to some extent, is returning to one version of its roots, and America is returning to one version of its roots,"" said Mr. Kagan, whose most recent book is ""The Jungle Grows Back: America and Our Imperiled World.""

Britain has sometimes acted as a political early-warning system for its former colony. Margaret Thatcher took power less than two years before her conservative ally Ronald Reagan; the British voted to leave the European Union five months before Mr. Trump's victory. The reverse was true in the 1990s, when Bill Clinton's election anticipated that of Tony Blair.

If the two countries are both vulnerable to gridlock, that is partly for historic reasons. As two of the world's oldest democracies, they spring from the same, centuries-old model: the electoral system known as first-past-the post or winner-take-all. Democracies that developed later, like Sweden and Finland, introduced proportional representation, which allows for smaller parties to enter Parliament.

Winner-take-all, by contrast, tends to increase polarization between two large parties, and exaggerate geographical divides, setting up stark conflict between sections of society.

And if Britain traditionally had a ""strong, stable, efficient central state"" that wielded control over policymaking, this has been changing, as Parliament reasserts its power to block the government's agenda -- much as a House of Representatives controlled by the Democrats is thwarting Mr. Trump.

""In my lifetime, Britain has never been in a more fragile state,"" said Matthew Goodwin, an author of ""National Populism: The Revolt Against Liberal Democracy."" ""British politics is in an almost nonstop state of crisis. There are very high levels of polarization.""

""Both countries have seen the mainstream center really be squeezed,"" Mr. Goodwin added. ""That moderate, pluralistic marketplace of ideas -- that's really been challenged. Both countries have seen the rise of populist entrepreneurs.""

The most successful of these populist entrepreneurs is Mr. Trump, though he is adapting only fitfully to the realities of divided government in Washington. Mr. Bannon cast the standoff over the wall as a case of the establishment striking back against Mr. Trump's insurgent victory in 2016.

""I call it the nullification project,"" he said. ""They're not going to let you run on those populist themes and then implement them. If you're going to be a disrupter, you're going to have to take it from them.""

Mr. Kagan argued that the paralysis in Washington and London was not a case of populists versus elites, but merely democracies showing their periodic inability to settle deeply rooted divisions in society. And some argue that is not necessarily a bad thing.

""The process of consensus has broken down, but neither side is capable of imposing its will on the other side,"" Mr. Lind said. ""The purpose of having veto points is to build an eventual consensus. It's not to paralyze things forever.""

In Washington, Mr. Trump may break the impasse by declaring his emergency -- a risky assertion of executive power that would be challenged in the courts but would enable the government to reopen. Either way, the fate of the United States will not hang in the balance.

In London, where the political and economic consequences of a chaotic departure from Europe are far more profound, ""it is much more difficult to compromise,"" Mr. Lind said. ""The side that loses is really, really going to lose.""",1038755657

To the Editor:

Re ""The People vs. Donald J. Trump,"" by David Leonhardt (Sunday Review, Jan. 6):

When Richard Nixon resigned, we as a country were still capable of being shocked by corruption, obstruction of justice and abuse of power. During the Vietnam War, I remember how outraged we were when we discovered that the government had been lying to us about what was really happening, about the number of deaths. Now, even though President Trump's abuses of power and lies are far worse than those of Nixon, I don't see his support crumbling.

Too many are now jaded and cynical. No matter what the investigations reveal, the reaction will be a shrug: ""Well, what do you expect -- all politicians are corrupt.""

Impeachment cannot -- and indeed, should not -- go forward unless there is broad public support for it. But the capacity to be shocked and outraged, or even to understand the danger of leaving Mr. Trump in office, is just not there, either in voters, or in Congress. That's what really worries me.

Margrit McIntosh

To the Editor:

David Leonhardt lays out a clear and compelling case for why President Trump is unfit for office. Unfortunately, fitness for office wasn't what got him elected and isn't what's kept him in power. Corrupt politicians in other countries use any means necessary to remain in office because the alternative is jail or worse.

Mr. Trump ran for president not to serve the public, but to serve himself. The power of executive privilege, freedom from prosecution and the possibility of self-pardon no doubt motivate him to cling to power under increasing financial and legal peril.

So here's a deal for a president who fashions himself as a deal maker: Republican and Democratic leaders offer a pardon to Mr. Trump and his family, allowing them to retain their freedom and wealth, in exchange for his resignation. As distasteful as a pardon may be, it pales in comparison to the harm Mr. Trump can do by remaining in office.

Jay Markowitz

Wilson, Wyo.

To the Editor:

I believe that a majority of the electorate agrees with David Leonhardt's observations. However, I fear letting President Trump off the hook, either by impeachment, after which Mike Pence could likely pardon him, or by negotiating his resignation in return for some sort of leniency for his crimes. The notion of his walking free following his despicable presidency is revolting.

So far, he's made a lavish living by dodging the law and common decency, and should not be rewarded for his deviance. Better to vote him (and Mr. Pence) out of office in 2020 so that legal punishment is still available. That may mean we need to endure him for longer, but letting the Trump presidency off the hook by either of the above expedients would be profoundly unsatisfying and damaging to the country and the rule of law.

Andrew Nelson

Bend, Ore.

To the Editor:

The problem with David Leonhardt's analysis is that it suggests that the Republican leadership will return to a fact-based universe, instead of the fact-free one that now prevails. The one where climate science is ignored, where the economic inequities caused by trickle-down are treated as fiction, where every day President Trump takes us all on an excursion into a fantasy land concerning immigration. It is here that the Republican Party has willingly chosen to reside.

Those who have shut their eyes, turned their backs and held their noses for the past two years will not go easily into battle with Mr. Trump. No matter the damage he has done to party or country, they have shown no discernible backbone. While Mr. Leonhardt's heart is in the right place, I fear that his head may unfortunately be in the clouds.

Robert S. Nussbaum

David Leonhardt has written the most articulate, well-documented and soundly crafted argument for the removal of Donald Trump from the presidency. This article should be printed and mass distributed all over America, much as Thomas Paine's ""Common Sense"" once was. I wasted no time sending it to my members of Congress.

Joyce Grater

Pittsburgh

To the Editor:

Should David Leonhardt's powerful, comprehensive indictment of President Trump not be enough to persuade Republicans in Congress that he must be removed from office, I suggest they ask themselves these questions. Would they ever put their children on a plane piloted by someone with little previous flight experience, someone who had refused to read the plane's instruction manuals, someone who had just locked his co-pilots out of the cockpit?

Would they be comfortable if he had said in recent weeks that he felt at ""war every day,"" had seemed to be more and more suspicious of those around him, including, perhaps, even members of his own family, and had a history of hair-trigger rage against those who defied him? And how would they feel if he had begun to make increasingly rash and dangerous decisions?

The terrifying truth is that all of our children, and all of us, Republicans and Democrats alike, are already on that plane. And as Mr. Leonhardt urgently warns, Republicans had better figure out soon what they are going to do about it.

To the Editor:

While I agreed with much of David Leonhardt's article, it saddened me to read this part: ""The biggest risk may be that an external emergency -- a war, a terrorist attack, a financial crisis, an immense natural disaster -- will arise. By then, it will be too late to pretend that he is anything other than manifestly unfit to lead.""

Did Mr. Leonhardt miss the immense natural disaster that was Hurricane Maria? It took almost a year to restore power to all of Puerto Rico, and this certainly proved that President Trump was unfit to lead at a time of disaster.

Jeff Wilson

Englewood, N.J.

To the Editor:

David Leonhardt's article captured the essence of what are perceived as wrongful acts. What I think was missing is the serious issue of President Trump's stability, mental balance and irrational behavior. This, I believe, is what presents the most clear and present danger in his presidency.

A 2017 book by Dr. Bandy X. Lee and colleagues, ""The Dangerous Case of Donald Trump,"" outlines very clearly and persuasively the real threat of Mr. Trump's power as our president.

Donald H. Sauvigne

Wilton, Conn.

To the Editor:

David Leonhardt makes a persuasive case that ample grounds exist for the impeachment of President Trump. But he is far less persuasive in suggesting that the impending impeachment and resignation of President Richard M. Nixon in 1974 is a ""relevant precedent,"" providing grounds for hope that Mr. Trump will be removed or resign.

In 1974, unlike this year, the Democrats had 56 votes in the Senate, plus an independent who caucused with them. Accordingly, only 10 Republican votes were needed to remove Nixon from office. Among the senators likely to provide such votes were liberal Republicans (admittedly an extinct species) like Clifford Case, Jacob Javits and Lowell Weicker, as well as middle-of-the-road Republicans like Howard Baker, Robert Packwood and Bob Dole.

Especially following the departures of Senators Jeff Flake and Bob Corker, one searches in vain among the Republicans now in the Senate for even a handful, much less the 20 whose votes would be required, who show any signs of measuring up to their 1974 predecessors.

Steven B. Rosenfeld

New York

To the Editor:

One point that David Leonhardt didn't mention in his cogent case for impeaching President Trump is that many Republicans in both houses of Congress might well prefer Mike Pence -- who is, after all, one of them -- to Donald Trump, who is decidedly not.

Paul Jellinek

Mercerville, N.J.

To the Editor:

Thanks to David Leonhardt for so neatly summing up the voluminous case against President Trump. My only quibble is that he actually understates the urgency for removal. When Mr. Trump says, as he did the other day, that the current government shutdown could last months if not years, I could not avoid the queasy feeling that his insistence on a demonstrably useless border wall is, in fact, a smokescreen -- that the shutdown itself is his actual endgame.

It is well known that Mr. Trump thrives on chaos, and the shutdown raises that chaos to a new and alarming level. Our systems of law, transportation, tax collection, health care and security (Homeland and otherwise) all risk severe disruption the longer the shutdown lasts. While this could ultimately leave the country vastly weaker and more vulnerable, it would seem to play into Mr. Trump's -- not to mention Vladimir Putin's -- hands.

As we all wait to see when, or indeed if, spineless Republican lawmakers will finally respond to this clear and present danger, it will be interesting to see if long lines at the airport can succeed where principle, ethics and patriotism have so obviously failed.

The Democrats have too much of a good thing: More than a dozen creditable candidates are looking to run for president in 2020. A large field isn't in itself worrisome, since the party needs a strong crop to choose from to oust what will probably be a weakened but still formidable President Trump. The problem is the selection process itself -- and in particular the pre-primary debates from which most voters will form their views of the candidates.

Obviously, it's a recipe for chaos to have 10 candidates, let alone a dozen, on the stage at once -- as the Republican Party learned the hard way in 2016. But you can't ruthlessly exclude candidates, either, at least not without depriving some talented dark horses of the chance to reach the front of the pack.

Tom Perez, the head of the Democratic National Committee, has said he will announce a solution by the end of the year. If he gets it right, the debates will make the voters' job a lot easier. If he gets it wrong, he risks depriving the party of an as-yet unheralded, world-beating talent.

What Democrats desperately need is a balanced, deliberative process. They must let candidates prove that they have the charisma to take on our reality-show president and the experience to repair the country after taking office. And they have to give voters a genuine opportunity to see the contenders' key personal qualities as well as the meaningful policy differences among them.

So what should the Democrats do?

First, they should learn from the Republicans' mistakes in 2016, when flawed debate rules may have helped Donald Trump trounce a raft of seasoned public officials. Faced with more candidates than a single debate could withstand, the Republicans initially relegated lower-polling candidates to an ""undercard"" that aired before the main event. No one watched it, and the participants -- who included senators and governors with as much claim to consideration as those in the top tier -- lost any chance to improve their lots.

Even so, the main debates were still too frenzied to offer any coherent discussion. Making matters worse, other ill-advised rules rewarded Mr. Trump with disproportionate airtime. Favoring fireworks over forensics, the debates catered to the imperatives of cable television, not the voters.

To avoid such a circus, the Democrats should decree that no debate will have more than six participants. In a 90-minute program, even a roster capped at six would allow the candidates just 15 minutes apiece to present themselves to the public.

The party should also recognize that early poll numbers mostly reflect nothing more than name recognition and the recency of someone's appearance in the news. For that reason, establishing tiers is a bad idea, at least until the campaign season is far along, at which point the field will most likely have narrowed, allowing for face-to-face matchups between the heaviest hitters.

If, as seems likely, more than six Democrats enter the race, the whole pool should be randomly sorted into two groups. Group A can debate in prime time during Week A, Group B in prime time during Week B. If the aspirants climb to more than 12, a third debate could be held during Week C.

For the next month's cycle, candidates should be re-sorted into entirely new groups, to create new pairings. This egalitarian format would de-emphasize pre-existing notoriety and highlight the qualities of assertiveness, vision, eloquence and policy fluency that contribute to leadership.

Of course, this six-people-per-stage formula can only accommodate about 18 candidates. The Democratic National Committee will also need rules about who gets to participate at all.

To be as inclusive as possible, it should admit any current or former national officeholders, governors or mayors of big cities. Non-politicians, like the hedge-fund manager and possible candidate Tom Steyer, or politicians of lower rank, like the West Virginia State Senator Richard Ojeda, could still earn a slot by clearing a given threshold in reputable polls.

Democrats should further nix two Republican rules from 2016 that rewarded theater and played into Mr. Trump's hands.

The first rule stationed the highest-polling contender at center stage, reinforcing his advantages. Instead, the candidates' placement should be randomized anew with each contest.

The 2016 rules also held that a candidate attacked by name would always get to respond, allowing Mr. Trump to bluster on before some rivals spoke at all. The 2019 rules should prohibit anyone from speaking twice in a given round until each participant speaks once. At a round's end, anyone called out by name can briefly reply -- once.

Other problems in 2016 stemmed from letting the individual cable news networks sponsor and run debates, instead of covering them. The networks thus geared the broadcasts toward ratings rather than public edification. This time, the Democratic National Committee should partner with groups like the League of Women Voters or the Council on Foreign Relations and invite all broadcast news outlets to cover them. Questioners should be drawn from not just one network's stars but also the vast reservoir of newspaper, magazine and radio journalists who cover politics.

The imperatives of cable television, which thrives on simplified story lines and high-decibel confrontation, don't necessarily align with the goals of the candidates, who seek a fair chance to get their message out, or of voters, who want to size up the candidates as people and educate themselves about salient differences in their policies and values. By choosing a patient, more thoughtful process, the Democratic Party has a chance not just to fight for democracy but also, in doing so, to exemplify its finer values.

36,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/31/us/politics/trump-troop-withdrawal-syria-months.html,"WASHINGTON -- President Trump has agreed to give the military about four months to withdraw the 2,000 United States troops in Syria, administration officials said on Monday, backtracking from his abrupt order two weeks ago that the military pull out within 30 days.

Mr. Trump confirmed on Twitter that troops would ""slowly"" be withdrawn, but complained that he got little credit for the move after a fresh round of criticism from retired Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal and revelations from the departing White House chief of staff, John F. Kelly, himself a retired Marine general, about the president's impulsive decision-making.

""If anybody but Donald Trump did what I did in Syria, which was an ISIS loaded mess when I became President, they would be a national hero,"" Mr. Trump wrote. ""ISIS is mostly gone, we're slowly sending our troops back home to be with their families, while at the same time fighting ISIS remnants.""

For a president who has looked to the military for affirmation throughout his campaign and presidency and boasted about stocking his cabinet with what he called ""my generals,"" his decision on Dec. 19 to withdraw quickly from Syria was a significant split from his military and civilians advisers. The criticism from General McChrystal, who commanded American-led troops in Afghanistan from 2009 to 2010, echoed longstanding denunciations by former senior intelligence officials, who have warned that Mr. Trump's approach to national security is reckless.

But during a surprise trip to Iraq last week, Mr. Trump privately told the commander of American forces in Iraq and Syria, Lt. Gen. Paul J. LaCamera, that the military could have several months to complete a safe and orderly withdrawal, according to two United States officials. And on Sunday, Senator Lindsey Graham, Republican of South Carolina, told reporters that a ""pause situation"" on the troop withdrawal was in effect.

A Pentagon spokesman, Cmdr. Sean Robertson, said on Monday, ""I'll let the president's words speak for themselves.""

By extending the timetable for withdrawal to several months, Mr. Trump stuck to his commitment to untangle the United States from yearslong military commitments but also heeded warnings from current and former military leaders of the danger of a quick exit. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, who resigned in protest over Mr. Trump's decision, said that leaving Syria in 30 days would jeopardize the fight against the Islamic State, betray its Syrian Kurdish-Arab allies on the ground, and cede the eastern part of the country to the Syrian government and its Russian and Iranian allies.

Nevertheless, Mr. Trump's latest plan left open the question of whether an orderly pullout from Syria would happen. Military planners say they need about 120 days, or four months, to carry out a withdrawal that allows time to decide which equipment to move elsewhere in the region, leave behind with allies or disable to prevent it from falling into the hands of the Syrian government or Russia or Iran.

Military officials have declined to specify the timing of the departure, partly for operational security reasons and partly because many details are still quite fluid, and officials recognize that Mr. Trump could change his mind at any moment and speed up the departure.

Mr. Mattis, who will be succeeded in an acting capacity on Tuesday by his deputy, Patrick M. Shanahan, urged Pentagon employees in a farewell message on Monday to remain ""undistracted from our sworn mission to support and defend the Constitution.""

When Mr. Trump first ordered a drawdown within 30 days, his position provoked an outcry, including from some of his political allies like Mr. Graham, who said that such a hasty withdrawal would leave exposed American partners such as the Kurds, who are concerned about a possible attack from Turkey. But after lunch with Mr. Trump at the White House on Sunday, Mr. Graham said he felt ""a lot better"" about the president's plans.

Military officials have scrambled to translate Mr. Trump's shifting directives and comments into actual orders for commanders in Syria and Iraq to carry out.

On Friday, Gen. Joseph F. Dunford Jr., the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, met at the White House with Mr. Trump's national security adviser, John R. Bolton, to get more clarity on the timing and other details of the withdrawal. Mr. Bolton is scheduled to visit Turkey and Israel in the coming days to discuss regional security issues.

General Dunford then spoke to Mr. Graham about the Syria troop withdrawal before the senator's meeting on Sunday with Mr. Trump. Several Pentagon officials had hoped Mr. Graham could change Mr. Trump's mind on the pullout or at least persuade him to extend the withdrawal timetable.

Col. Patrick Ryder, a spokesman for General Dunford, said in an email that the general and the senator had spoken recently, but he declined to comment on their confidential conversation and referred questions about Syria to the White House.

With most of his top advisers on vacation or having left the White House for good, Mr. Trump spent the weekend talking to allies and watching cable news coverage of the partial government shutdown.

He closely monitors the Sunday morning news shows, where General McChrystal warned that leaving Syria would effectively give up any American leverage over the war there.

""If you pull American influence out, you're likely to have greater instability and of course it'll be much more difficult for the United States to try to push events in any direction,"" General McChrystal said, acknowledging that it was not a ""big surprise"" that Mr. Trump had sought to do so.

He was among the most vocal of retired military leaders who have increasingly criticized Mr. Trump, who responded by tweeting on Monday morning about the ""failed generals"" who oversaw American engagements in the Middle East as they continued and were extended.

""I campaigned on getting out of Syria and other places,"" he wrote. ""Now when I start getting out the Fake News Media, or some failed Generals who were unable to do the job before I arrived, like to complain about me & my tactics, which are working. Just doing what I said I was going to do!""

The president's full-throated defense set him apart from past presidents, said Prof. Peter Feaver, a national security official under former Presidents Bill Clinton and George W. Bush who now teaches political science at Duke University.

""Every president has frustrations with retired military who are grading his homework from the sidelines. Think of every Fox News pundit during the Obama years and think of the so-called revolt of the retired generals in 2006 over Rumsfeld,"" Mr. Feaver said.

""What's different is that this president does so much of his grousing and thinking aloud in public on Twitter, so whereas Obama probably said something under his breath to his aides and President Bush did as well, they didn't tweet it out for everybody to see and hear,"" he added.

Mr. Trump's aides are mindful that he needs to maintain support from rank-and-file members of the military, and they have at times pointed to support he has gotten from soldiers, demonstrated when he visited Iraq the day after Christmas, or when he visited Fort Drum in upstate New York several months ago.

""The president has shown that he can break what had been considered longstanding taboos, he can grab the third rails and not pay a political price for it, but he has not disproved the conventional wisdom that says doing this makes it harder to govern,"" Mr. Feaver said.

Mr. Feaver suggested that Mr. Trump is playing with fire as Democrats take control of the House of Representatives. ""His public complaints about the active-duty folks are much more toxic for civil military relations,"" Mr. Feaver said. ""Remember that they must testify before Congress in the coming months. This issue will fester.""

In his three-paragraph farewell message, Mr. Mattis, as he has done before, cited President Abraham Lincoln's telegram to Gen. Ulysses S. Grant on Feb. 1, 1865, as the Civil War ended: ""Let nothing which is transpiring, change, hinder or delay your military movements, or plans.""

While it was difficult to avoid the possibility that Mr. Mattis was making one final veiled criticism of the commander in chief, colleagues who know the secretary well said his message was more focused on telling Pentagon and military personnel to stay the course no matter the challenges.",1030199501

Good evening. Here's the latest.

1. A deal to avert a U.S. government shutdown was teetering after President Trump, above, told House Republican leaders he would not sign a stopgap spending bill to keep funds flowing past midnight Friday if it did not include border-wall funding.

A House Republican leader told reporters that Republicans would try to add $5 billion in funding for the wall to the bill, along with disaster relief money to lure Democratic support. But Representative Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic leader in the House, said any wall funding would be an automatic ""nonstarter.""

The chaos in Washington helped send stock prices lower. And here's what to expect if the government does shut down.

Separately, Mr. Trump's nominee for attorney general, William Barr, criticized the investigation by the special counsel, Robert Mueller, in a memo to top Justice Department officials in June. And a department official said that Matthew Whitaker, the acting attorney general, would not be recusing himself from the Mueller investigation.

2. ""Donald's right, and I agree with him.""

President Vladimir Putin of Russia welcomed President Trump's decision to withdraw U.S. troops from Syria, calling it ""the right decision.""

But at home, Mr. Trump was defending the withdrawal from bipartisan criticism, not least for leaving Syria open territory for the geopolitical ambitions of Russia and Iran. Above, schoolchildren walking past a U.S. patrol in Hasakah, Syria.

America's Kurdish allies in Syria discussed releasing 3,200 Islamic State prisoners in response. And analysts called the decision an abandonment of key allies and a boon for ISIS.

Separately, Defense Secretary Jim Mattis will step down at the end of February, Mr. Trump announced in a tweet.

3. Planned Parenthood is facing accusations of discriminating against pregnant workers.

The organization has been accused of sidelining, ousting or otherwise handicapping pregnant employees, according to interviews with more than a dozen current and former employees. A spokeswoman said the organization was investigating the allegations we reported.

The accusations are a sign that discrimination against pregnant women and new mothers remains widespread in the workplace -- even in organizations that define themselves as champions of women. Above, in Manhattan.

In some cases, managers were accused of considering pregnancy in hiring decisions, for example, or denying rest breaks recommended by a doctor. Some women said they were afraid to announce a pregnancy at work, sensing they would be seen as abandoning their colleagues.

4. Why do people misuse opioids? And why can't many stop?

Overdoses have passed car crashes and gun violence to become the leading cause of death for Americans under 55. Some people are more susceptible to addiction than others. But no one is immune.

Through interviews with drug users and addiction experts, our journalists created a visual representation, above, of how these powerful drugs can hijack the brain, from temptation and tolerance to relapse and recovery.

Separately, a bipartisan criminal justice bill that appears poised to become law could reduce the sentences of some federal inmates. We spoke to a man serving a life sentence for selling crack cocaine that could be reduced to less time than he has already served.

5. Drones shut down Gatwick Airport in London.

Flights at Britain's second-largest airport were halted for nearly 24 hours at the peak of the holiday season after two drones were spotted flying nearby. Passengers were diverted to airports as far away as Paris. Above, waiting to board.

The police used Twitter to ask for the public's help finding whoever was flying the drones, which they described as ""of industrial specification.""

One expert said their flight path ""very much points to this being planned and not just some rogue hobbyist.""

6. Uber's driverless cars are back on the road -- with two drivers apiece.

After one of its cars killed a pedestrian this year in Arizona, the company grounded its autonomous fleet for nine months.

As it eases back into testing the vehicles, they will operate on a limited loop in Pittsburgh, above. Each will have two drivers ready to take over, and no passengers will ride in the cars. Tests will be limited to 25 miles an hour and cars will operate only during daylight.

""We will continue to prioritize safety,"" an Uber spokesman said.

7. Missy Franklin is making a graceful exit.

With Olympic gold medals and a world record, she was a swimming superstar. She was also candid about her struggles with anxiety, depression and disordered eating.

Franklin, 23, above, announced her retirement in a letter posted on ESPN's website this week. ""I choose to look at this as a new beginning,"" she wrote.

Tributes poured in, but many of them sounded like eulogies. Our sports reporter, a former swimmer herself, explains why she thinks fans' sorrow is misguided.

8. Hakuna Matata™?

It's a phrase meaning ""no worries"" in Swahili, a language spoken across much of Africa. Disney's ""The Lion King"" popularized it 20 years ago -- and the company then claimed it as intellectual property. (It was the catchphrase of Timon and Pumbaa, shown above with Simba.)

Now 100,000 people, angry about cultural appropriation, have signed an online petition asking Disney to drop its trademark. ""The term 'Hakuna Matata' is not a Disney creation,"" the petition notes, ""hence not an infringement on intellectual or creative property, but an assault on the Swahili people and Africa as a whole.""

Trademark experts said the issue had been blown out of proportion. The trademark does not mean that the company actually owns the phrase or that it can ban anyone from using it.

9. Think of it as Pop 2.0.

For the first time in decades, our music critic writes, the playbook for pop success has been updated, profoundly reshaping the sound of America.

It used to be that ""going pop"" implied an artistic compromise. But thanks to digital streaming, formerly niche genres -- K-pop, Latin trap, melodic hip-hop and more -- have become the center of the conversation. Above, the K-pop giant BTS.

The new breakthrough artists often work with a common grammar, even though they emerge from different scenes. They both rap and sing. Their moods are melancholic, rarely ecstatic. Some are casually bilingual, other take in musical ideas from around the globe.

And they are, by and large, extremely gifted at self-presentation on social media -- they learned to invent themselves online as much as in a studio.

_____

10. Finally, could someone get the lights?

Children immersed in the digital world are using PowerPoint presentations to lobby their parents for puppies, Pumas or whatever else is on their wish lists. Two siblings even made the case for splurging on a family vacation home.

""With a PowerPoint it was a little bit more impactful because they could see the amount of effort and work I put into it instead of just my usual begging,"" said one girl who tried -- unsuccessfully -- to persuade her parents to buy her a horse.

38,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/26/briefing/stocks-migrants-yemen.html,"Good morning,

Today is Boxing Day in Britain and some Commonwealth countries, but it's back to work in the U.S. We're watching the markets as they reopen, the death of a second migrant child at the southwestern border, and new details about Donald Trump's draft deferment during the Vietnam War.

Eyes are back on the markets

Trading resumes on Wall Street today after a Christmas break and, before that, a four-day sell-off that threatens to end the longest bull market on record. Losses of more than 20 percent are the official marker of a bear market, and the S&P 500 is down 19.7 percent from its high on Sept. 20.

President Trump's repeated criticism of the Federal Reserve chairman, Jerome Powell, and an attempt last weekend by Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin to reassure markets have contributed to the volatility.

Trading in Asia was mostly flat today, and futures markets suggest a mixed day in the U.S.

Explainer: ""The real risk is not that insurmountable challenges knock the economy off course,"" our senior economics correspondent writes. ""It is that poor leadership converts moderate economic shocks into a crisis.""

From Opinion: The columnist Paul Krugman asks whether White House policies ""matter for the economy, or for the stock market (which isn't at all the same thing).""

Another migrant child dies in U.S. custody

On Tuesday, an 8-year-old boy from Guatemala became the second child to die in detention at the southwest border in less than three weeks. It is unclear if his death was the result of the care he received in the U.S., of an arduous journey or of some combination of the two.

The response: A White House spokesman said the boy's death was ""very sad"" and that the administration was seeking more information.

Yesterday: President Trump reiterated his call for $5 billion to fund a border wall, a demand at the center of a partial government shutdown. No legislative action to address the shutdown is expected before Thursday.

The details: Mr. Trump has said his wall is already under construction. We mapped the current fencing and what the administration has done so far.

America's fingerprints on the war in Yemen

For decades, the U.S. has sold tens of billions of dollars in arms to Saudi Arabia on the unspoken premise that they would rarely be used.

But American weapons and support have figured prominently in the Saudi-led air war in Yemen, where strikes have killed more than 4,600 civilians.

That toll has contributed to a debate in Washington about the pitfalls of the U.S. alliance with Saudi Arabia under Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman.

Catch up: Saudi Arabia entered the war in 2015, allying with the United Arab Emirates and a group of Yemeni factions trying to oust Houthi rebels from northern Yemen. At least 60,000 Yemenis have died.

Go deeper: The conflict has pushed millions to the brink of starvation. In October, Times journalists documented the crisis.

A foot doctor's ""favor"" to the Trump family

In 1968, a podiatrist in Queens who rented an office from Donald Trump's father, Fred Trump, diagnosed the future president with bone spurs in his heels, leading to his medical exemption from the military during the Vietnam War.

The podiatrist, Dr. Larry Braunstein, died in 2007, but his daughters told The Times that he often talked of coming to the younger Mr. Trump's aid as a favor to the father. Donald Trump, who had earlier been declared available for service, was 22 at the time.

How we know: No paper evidence has been found to corroborate the version of events described by the Braunstein family, who also suggested there was some involvement by a second podiatrist, Dr. Manny Weinstein. The Times began looking into the president's draft record again when an anonymous tipster suggested that a podiatrist who rented from Fred Trump had provided the medical documentation for a deferment.

Background: An investigation by The Times in October showed the extent to which Fred Trump assisted his son over the years, including by giving him the equivalent today of at least $413 million.

If you have 6 minutes, this is worth itThe relentlessness of modern parenting

Intensive parenting has been the norm in the upper middle class since the 1990s. And people across class divides appear to have adopted it as an ideal, even if they don't have the means to carry it out.

Social scientists say the change has a powerful driver: economic anxiety.

Here's what else is happening

A still-vulnerable Indonesia: Despite progress in detecting tsunamis early, at least 429 people were killed and nearly 1,500 were injured in last weekend's disaster.

Japan defies whaling ban: The country said today that it would withdraw from an international agreement and resume annual whale hunts in the Antarctic. An international moratorium on whaling took effect in 1986.

A message from the pope: During his Christmas Day address, Pope Francis said that all humans are part of an extended holy family that has lost its sense of fraternity.

Protests in Sudan: Widespread demonstrations called for President Omar Hassan al-Bashir to step down. Mr. Bashir has been in power since a military coup in 1989.

Kevin Spacey case advances: The actor will be charged with a felony after an accusation of sexual assault that was made public last year, the authorities said.

Navy scraps an age-old penalty: A law that takes effect on Jan. 1 will, among other things, eliminate the punishment of ""diminished rations"" -- bread and water -- for American sailors.

Snapshot: Above, the annual Hyde Park Christmas Day Swim in the icy waters of the Serpentine lake in London. It's called the Peter Pan Cup because J.M. Barrie, who wrote ""Peter Pan,"" swam the 100-yard course in 1903.

The artists we lost: We offer a tribute to notable actors, musicians, writers and dancers who died this year, using their own words.

Late-night comedy: Our columnist looked back at a year in which the occasional nonpolitical joke felt like water in the desert.

What we're reading: This examination of the Internal Revenue Service by ProPublica and The Atlantic. Albert Sun, an assistant editor, calls it ""an eye-opening look at how the once-feared tax agency has been so strangled by budget cuts from Congress that it no longer has the capacity to make even blatant tax dodgers pay their share.""

Now, a break from the news

Cook: These chiles rellenos combine two classic Mexican preparations.

Listen: Barack Obama lends his voice to the final installment of Lin-Manuel Miranda's ""Hamilton""-related ""Hamildrop"" series.

Watch: Our critics picked the most memorable TV episodes of the year, including from the shows ""Atlanta"" and ""Big Mouth.""

And now for the Back Story on ...Potato chips and the electric diet

Potato chips first showed up in The Times 120 years ago today, in a rather ethnocentric article reprinted from The Baltimore Sun listing typical breakfast menus for upper-class families in Puerto Rico.

If chips before lunch seem slightly unorthodox, a later mention was even more startling. In 1912, The Times reported that a French scientist had concluded that a jolt of electricity -- 1,000 volts -- was equal in food value to a porterhouse steak and potato chips.

Just four months before, an article detailing the theory began with a quotation from the scientist that was shocking on any number of levels: ""If a man is hungry, give him electricity. If he asks for bread or beefsteak, put him in the electric chair and turn on the current.""

The 1,000-volt diet never caught on -- given a choice between the electric chair and potato chips, the hungry invariably go for the chips.

That's it for this briefing. See you next time.

39,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/14/opinion/government-shutdown-trump.html,"There have been many policy disasters over the course of U.S. history. It's hard, however, to think of a calamity as gratuitous, an error as unforced, as the current federal shutdown.

Nor can I think of another disaster as thoroughly personal, as completely owned by one man. When Donald Trump told Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi, ""I will be the one to shut it down,"" he was being completely accurate -- although he went on to promise that ""I'm not going to blame you for it,"" which was a lie.

Still, no man is an island, although Trump comes closer than most. You can't fully make sense of his policy pratfalls without acknowledging the extraordinary quality of the people with whom he has surrounded himself. And by ""extraordinary,"" of course, I mean extraordinarily low quality. Lincoln had a team of rivals; Trump has a team of morons.

If this sounds too harsh, consider recent economic pronouncements by two members of his administration. Predictably, these pronouncements involve bad economics; that's pretty much a given. What's striking, instead, is the inability of either man to stay on script; they can't even get their right-wing mendacity right.

First up is Kevin Hassett, chairman of Trump's Council of Economic Advisers, who was asked about the plight of federal workers who aren't being paid. You don't have to be a public relations expert to know that you're supposed to express some sympathy, whether you feel it or not. After all, there are multiple news reports about transportation security workers turning to food banks, the Coast Guard suggesting its employees hold garage sales, and so on.

So the right response involves expressing concern about those workers but placing the blame on Democrats who don't want to stop brown-skinned rapists, or something like that. But no: Hassett declared that it's all good, that the workers are actually ""better off,"" because they're getting time off without having to use any of their vacation days.

Then consider what Sean Hannity had to say about taxing the rich. What's that? You say that Hannity isn't a member of the Trump administration? But surely he is in every sense that matters. In fact, Fox News isn't just state TV, its hosts clearly have better access to the president, more input into his decisions, than any of the so-called experts at places like the State Department or the Department of Defense.

Anyway, Hannity declared that raising taxes on the wealthy would damage the economy, because ""rich people won't be buying boats that they like recreationally,"" and ""they're not going to be taking expensive vacations anymore.""

Um, that's not the answer a conservative is supposed to give. You're supposed to insist that low taxes on the rich give them an incentive to work really really hard, not make it easier for them to take lavish vacations. You're supposed to declare that low taxes will induce them to save and spend money building businesses, not help them afford to buy new yachts.

Even if your real reason for favoring low taxes is that they let your wealthy friends engage in even more high living, you're not supposed to say that out loud.

Again, the point isn't that people in Trump's circle don't care about ordinary American families, and also talk nonsense -- that's only to be expected. What's amazing is that they're so out of it that they don't know either how to pretend to care about the middle class, or what nonsense to spout in order to sustain that pretense.

So what's wrong with Trump's people? Why can't they serve up even some fake populism?

There are, I think, two answers, one generic to modern conservatism, one specific to Trump.

On the generic point: To be a modern conservative is to spend your life inside what amounts to a cult, barely exposed to outside ideas or even ways of speaking. Inside that cult, contempt for ordinary working Americans is widespread -- remember Eric Cantor, the then-House majority leader, celebrating Labor Day by praising business owners. So is worship of wealth. And it can be hard for cult members to remember that you don't talk that way to outsiders.

Then there's the Trump effect. Normally working for the president of the United States is a career booster, something that looks good on your résumé. Trump's presidency, however, is so chaotic, corrupt and potentially compromised by his foreign entanglements that anyone associated with him gets tainted -- which is why after only two years he has already left a trail of broken men and wrecked reputations in his wake.

So who is willing to serve him at this point? Only those with no reputation to lose, generally because they're pretty bad at what they do. There are, no doubt, conservatives smart and self-controlled enough to lie plausibly, or at least preserve some deniability, and defend Trump's policies without making fools of themselves. But those people have gone into hiding.

A year ago I pointed out that the Trump administration was turning into government by the worst and the dumbest. Since then, however, things have gotten even worse and even dumber. And we haven't hit bottom yet.

40,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/16/world/europe/france-national-front-yellow-vests.html,"HÉNIN-BEAUMONT, France -- While security forces under the control of France's president, Emmanuel Macron, have deployed tear gas, water cannons and mass arrests to quell sometimes violent demonstrations across the country, ""Yellow Vest"" protesters in northern France have found an unlikely sanctuary: under the wing of a far-right mayor who has made his career railing against disorder.

Mayor Steeve Briois, a leader in France's anti-immigrant National Front, has allowed the demonstrators to gather around wood fires in a municipal parking lot, and he put up a sign at the entrance to town declaring its support for the Yellow Vests. He also gave protesters a tent and granted them permission to march along a main road -- in defiance of a ban issued by regional authorities under Mr. Macron.

Mr. Briois's critics say his motivation is obvious: The hundreds of thousands of protesters are France's newest and most powerful grass-roots force, threatening the presidency of Mr. Macron and bringing to the fore the plight of the country's struggling middle class and working poor.

To the far right, they represent a huge pool of potential recruits, and its leaders have moved swiftly to try and capitalize on it.

Among them is Marine Le Pen, the National Front candidate thrashed by Mr. Macron in last year's presidential election. She has offered encouragement to the Yellow Vests, directing her supporters and elected officials to take part in protests that she hailed as ""a revolt"" against Mr. Macron's policy of helping only the rich.

On Friday, Ms. Le Pen visited Hénin-Beaumont, where Mr. Briois has been mayor for four years, to show her solidarity and join him at the official opening of the town's Christmas market.

In an interview last month with Le Parisien newspaper, Ms. Le Pen mocked Mr. Macron's government over its decision, since rescinded, to increase fuel taxes to raise money for eco-friendly projects -- a move that enraged motorists and set off the protests.

She denounced the tax increase as ""punitive environmentalism"" promoted by a bohemian bourgeois Paris elite ""shut in their pretty offices with nice moldings on their ceiling and absolutely no connection to the situation of our compatriots.""

But the National Front may be wielding a double-edge sword.

Should it help the Yellow Vests coalesce into a true political movement in France, that may turn out to be less blessing than curse for the far right.

Polls suggest that the National Front, renamed earlier this year as the Rassemblement National, might lose a significant number of votes in European elections in May if the Yellow Vests put forward their own candidates.

The anger coursing through French streets, which is now about much more than just the cost of driving, has created a highly combustible movement that stands against all political parties, including Ms. Le Pen's, and threatens a plague on all their houses.

""We need to start again from zero,"" said Stephane Bouillez, a long-distance truck driver who joined protesters in Hénin-Beaumont on Saturday. He said he could now barely feed his family because of a severe back problem that left him unable to work. To make ends meet, he set up a small company that sells army surplus clothing but quickly found that taxes and other costs ate up all its revenue and left him burdened with debts.

Last year, Mr. Bouillez said, he voted for Ms. Le Pen, and he said he thinks that Mayor Briois has done a good job since he and his far-right colleagues took over City Hall after local elections in 2014. The National Front now controls 29 of 35 council seats in a town that had been governed for decades by socialists.

But after taking part in weeks of demonstrations and freewheeling debate at protest camps, Mr. Bouillez decided it was time to break with all of France's feuding political tribes. He scrawled that sentiment on the fluorescent yellow hazard vest that has been adopted as a symbol of the revolt: ""France wake up! Stop being sheep.""

Whether the Yellow Vests will maintain their momentum and succeed in reshaping France is far from certain.

Appeals for calm after a terrorist attack in Strasbourg on Tuesday, cold weather, the approaching Christmas holidays and concessions by Mr. Macron are already sapping the enthusiasm of some protesters. Demonstrations in Paris on Saturday were smaller and less violent than on earlier weekends.

But the fury on the street, which has set off a general debate about the country's future unlike any since the student-led Paris protests of May 1968, has given sudden urgency to an old question raised by American revolutionaries in 1776 and then taken up with bloody zeal amid France's 1789 revolution: Who really speaks for ""the people.""

Feeling that they have been left mute by a French political system built around a strong presidency and weak Parliament, many Yellow Vests demand direct democracy through the holding of binding referendums on matters large and small.

And France's far right is not the only political movement to see opportunity in the current turmoil. The radical left represented by the France Insoumise party, or France Unbowed, which is led by the anticapitalist firebrand Jean-Luc Mélenchon, has also tried to weld itself onto the Yellow Vest movement.

The far-right and left alike insist that each has long pursued a more equitable system free from the control of wealthy Paris-based elites out of touch with ordinary people.

""There is not just anger but rage,"" said Mr. Briois, the mayor of Hénin-Beaumont, a town of 27,000 residents in the heart of what, before the pits all closed, was France's coal country.

Mr. Briois, who was recently named Ms. Le Pen's campaign manager for the European elections in May, said the Yellow Vest protests showed that France needed to break with the past, as the United States did in 2016 with the election of Donald J. Trump.

""People like him are needed -- people who have courage, who speak their mind, who don't get stuck in political correctness,"" the mayor said.

Some worry that the Yellow Vests are animated by what the historian Jacques Julliard has described as the ""dangerous ideology of the common man,"" a political philosophy promoted by Guglielmo Giannini, a fringe, postwar Italian populist whose motto was: ""Down with everyone!""

Jean-Yves Camus, director of the Observatory of Radical Politics at the Jean Jaurès Foundation, said Ms. Le Pen's party was best positioned in the scramble now underway across the political spectrum to co-opt Yellow Vest anger.

But about the only thing the proudly leaderless and heterogeneous movement agrees on, aside from its loathing for Mr. Macron, is that it is ""apolitical"" -- though it has lit a Catherine wheel firework of often conflicting political demands.

The Yellow Vest movement, Mr. Camus said, may be too divided to pose a direct electoral threat to the National Front. But he said the protests ""are really something very new,"" and potentially dangerous for all parties because people organized on social media, not through the political parties and trade unions that usually mobilize people onto the street.

The French Communist Party, once a powerful force in northern France, has watched aghast as protests, which it used to excel in organizing, have swept across the country.

David Noël, the party's sole representative on the Hénin-Beaumont town council, said he had been too tied up with work as a professor to join the protesters. But he had a simple message for them: ""You should join the Communist Party.""

Jean-Pierre Carpentier, a local activist in France Insoumise, also voiced dismay that protesters do not see that ""what they want is what we have been promoting for years."" On Friday, he handed out tracts in the town's market urging residents to join his party and mocking Mr. Macron. But he did not join a Yellow Vest rally a day later.

The far right has taken a different tack. It has sent its own activists to join -- critics say infiltrate -- the protests, pushing its line that immigration is the central problem and that Mr. Macron sold out the country by agreeing to a nonbinding United Nations pact on migration recently reached in Marrakesh, Morocco.

""Macron betrayed France in Marrakesh,"" said Marie Therese Morieux, a roadside protester in Hénin-Beaumont and fervent fan of the National Front, whose husband works for the municipal government.

When a car drove by without honking its horn to show support for the Yellow Vests, she stopped it and asked the driver why. He explained that he supported President Macron. ""He must be sick,"" Ms. Morieux told her colleagues.

David Moritz, a protester in Hénin-Beaumont, said he never shared the National Front's hostility toward immigrants and would never vote for it no matter how much support it offers the Yellow Vests. France's big problem, he said, is not immigration but old-boy networks that make it hard to get work.

He said he struggled for years to find a job because he didn't have any connections and finally got hired by an American company that ""did not care what color shoes I was wearing."" He supports France Insoumise.

When the protest movement first erupted, Mayor Briois put up a sign at a major intersection with an unequivocal message: ""The Town of Hénin-Beaumont Supports the Yellow Vests."" Occupied for a time by protesters, the intersection was taken back by the riot police in a melee that left a nearby Burger King on fire.

Marine Tondelier, a local lawmaker from the Green Party and a longtime critic of the mayor, said: ""The National Front has always tried to have a monopoly on anger. This is their niche, so of course it is trying to co-opt the Yellow Vests.""

For the party, she said, this means having to retreat on its traditional emphasis on law and order. ""Our mayor is supposed to be Mr. Security, the new sheriff in town,"" she said. ""The hypocrisy is total.""

Mr. Briois said his only wish was to let ordinary people have their say, and to ""ensure that French people make the right decision"" in the European elections -- namely that they vote for the Rassemblement National, the new look National Front.",1020106896
41,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/31/us/politics/2020-democratic-candidates.html,"Senator Elizabeth Warren's formation of an exploratory committee for president on Monday represents a sort of political ball drop, the beginning of a new year and new campaign that will feature an unusually large number of Democrats seeking the presidency.

Or will it?

As the 2020 Democratic primary gets underway, the defining characteristic of this first stage of the race is the sheer uncertainty about who is even running. More than 30 Democrats are mulling presidential bids, but hardly any of them qualifies as an instant front-runner or a gifted, tested campaigner, and some of the biggest names could pass in the end.

[Elizabeth Warren has entered the 2020 presidential race. Read about it here.]

Even beyond the field of specific candidates, this will be one of the most fluid nominating contests Democrats have had in recent decades. A leaderless party, they are in a moment of transition from center-left politics to a more ideologically pure brand of liberalism.

Democrats are grappling with what they stand for, what their voters expect, and what demographic groups will be most critical in winning an Electoral College majority in 2020. But most of all, they are unified by a once-unimaginable objective that only illustrates how unpredictable American politics has become: ensuring Donald J. Trump is just a one-term president.

Who's going to run?

It is hard to recall a recent presidential primary where, at the outset of the race, there was this much genuine mystery -- not only about who would eventually emerge as the nominee, but who planned to run at all.

Ms. Warren's announcement Monday was expected. And it will not be a surprise when Senators Cory Booker of New Jersey and Kamala Harris of California enter the race in the coming weeks.

But the number of would-be candidates who may ultimately stay out of the race is larger than the list of contenders who are certain to run.

There are the well-known, or at least much-buzzed-about, Democrats who are still deliberating: Former Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. is the most prominent of this group, and leads the field in initial polling in Iowa. But there is also great anticipation over Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont, the runner-up for the Democratic nomination in 2016, and Representative Beto O'Rourke of Texas, whose losing Senate bid this year electrified many grass-roots Democrats.

It is unclear if any of these men will enter the race -- particularly Mr. Biden, who, associates say, is ambivalent about running after over three decades of presidential fits and starts.

[Make sense of the people, issues and ideas shaping American politics with our newsletter.]

There is also great uncertainty about lesser-known potential contenders who could be formidable -- and if the Trump phenomenon proves anything, it is that making any assumptions about candidates is folly.

Will Senators Sherrod Brown of Ohio and Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota -- who both just won third terms in presidential battleground states -- go beyond their flirtation with running? And what of the roster of current and former Democratic governors, like Steve Bullock of Montana or Terry McAuliffe of Virginia?

Meeting the moment

Presidential politics recalls the adage that 80 percent of life is showing up.

Except in the case of primaries. Then, it's about knowing when to show up.

That question, more than anything, is what looms over Ms. Warren's candidacy: Would she be the president today if she had run in 2016, as some liberal activists and admirers urged her to? Mr. Sanders ended up filling the void on the populist left and ran a surprisingly strong campaign against Hillary Clinton.

Ms. Warren was hardly the first White House hopeful to risk waiting. Bill Clinton, for example, opted out of the 1988 campaign and still became president four years later.

But the more recent history of presidential calculations suggests that candidates are wiser to run when the moment presents itself. That is what Mr. Obama did in 2008 after just four years in the Senate, the same period Ms. Warren would have served by 2016. Some Democrats think 2020 is Mr. O'Rourke's moment: He has been in the House for just six years, but many liberals see his energy and freshness as inspiring.

[How early do presidential campaigns start? Earlier than you may think.]

One reason Ms. Warren announced on Monday and declared so early, her allies suggested, was to erase any uncertainty about her intentions among supporters whom she kept waiting -- and ultimately disappointed -- in 2016.

But now, instead of a head-to-head race against Mrs. Clinton, Ms. Warren is entering a wide-open campaign facing questions about her sensitivity on race and her political savvy after the release of a DNA test of her Native American heritage. Her decision to take the test angered some allies on the left and did nothing to stop Mr. Trump's mockery of her roots.

What do voters want?

Timing is also crucial in presidential races because the issues can change so quickly. Mr. Trump's incendiary rhetoric and policies around race and immigration have shifted the political conversation away from matters of economic inequality, which has been the life's work of Ms. Warren and which defined much of the 2016 Democratic primary.

Still, her party has plainly moved to the left on economics and social justice. So as much as anything, Ms. Warren's candidacy will test whether 2020 primary voters will demand that their candidates take unwavering positions on issues like universal health care and Wall Street regulations, much as they have historically expected them to do so on supporting abortion rights.

Mr. Sanders's 2016 candidacy demonstrated that there is hunger among Democrats to confront Wall Street excesses and income inequality. But what's less clear is how much of a premium the voters will put on purity on these issues -- and if they will overlook a softer line from a candidate who inspires them and who they think can defeat Mr. Trump.

A warning shot at big money

Ms. Warren is one of several potential candidates who have crusaded against the influence of wealthy donors and corporations, even to the point of calling out fellow Democrats for taking a more pliant approach to big-dollar fund-raising and business regulation. And she is unlikely to be any less confrontational with rivals in the primary who are heavily backed by billionaire donors, or who are billionaires themselves.

That poses a threat to possible Democratic candidates like Michael R. Bloomberg and Tom Steyer, who are aligned with liberals on important issues like climate change and immigration but embody the kind of capitalist wealth that many despise. She may also cause trouble for non-billionaires like Mr. Booker and Mr. McAuliffe, who have collected enormous sums of money over the years from banks, hedge funds and pharmaceutical corporations. Mr. Booker recently became the first candidate to have a super PAC formed in support of his anticipated campaign.

There is reason to expect Democratic primary voters and activists will be wary of candidates they see as too cozy with big money.

In the 2018 midterms, Democratic candidates who disavowed corporate money fared exceedingly well in primary elections, and the incoming House majority is expected to make ethics and campaign-finance legislation one of its first priorities. Revulsion from a money-soaked political system is one of a few concerns that links Democrats on the activist left, such as Representative-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, with less ideological party favorites like Mr. O'Rourke.

It is not difficult to imagine Ms. Warren emerging as a kind of good-government buzz saw on debate stages dotted with billionaires and super PAC beneficiaries. Whether or not voters thrill to her persona or policies, there may be no candidate better equipped than she is to help set the rules of engagement around political money and the 2020 field -- and to call out those who flout them.

Splitting the screen with Washington

Ms. Warren's step into the 2020 race was one of the biggest political stories of the day, but even a Democrat of her stature had to share the news cycle with an ongoing government shutdown and Mr. Trump's demands that Congress finance a border wall with Mexico. So it is likely to go for most of the 2020 campaign, as a president prone to political brinkmanship and angry outbursts simultaneously navigates divided government and his own battle for a second term.

Crises in government could routinely overshadow the Democratic primary campaign. Democrats' internal debates about ideology and their party's identity could be obscured by louder, more venomous clashes between the two parties. And challengers hoping to beat Mr. Trump on the campaign trail may have difficulty competing for attention when he is in the White House -- or on Twitter.

At times, there could also be moments of friction between the Democrats running for president and the Democrats helming the party in Congress. In the case of the shutdown, there is relatively little daylight, at least so far: Neither legislative leaders like Nancy Pelosi nor candidates like Ms. Warren want to build a border wall. But in other fights -- from cabinet nominations to possible impeachment proceedings -- there may be a wider gap between would-be presidents striving to win primary votes and legislative tacticians aiming to outmaneuver Republicans or cut deals with them.

Candidates like Ms. Warren, and other sitting senators like Ms. Harris and Mr. Booker, will each have to strike their own balance between joining the fights of the day in Washington -- often in reaction to Mr. Trump -- and introducing themselves to voters around the country, outlining their agendas and drawing contrasts with their rivals for the nomination.",1030150954
42,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/29/fashion/tim-kaine-democratic-national-convention.html,"Can we talk, for a minute, about the men?

Not so much President Obama, who in his appearance at the Democratic National Convention on Wednesday was as polished and powerful as ever, extolling the American myth and passing the torch of leadership to Hillary Clinton. Mr. Obama recast himself in the role of elder statesman, complete with silver tie, to match the hair that has silvered in office.

Not so much Michael R. Bloomberg, the former mayor of New York, now an Independent as demonstrated by his neither red nor blue but purple tie, who pointedly declared his allegiance to Mrs. Clinton and called her opponent, Donald J. Trump, a ""dangerous demagogue.""

Not even former President Bill Clinton, who has a complicated road ahead of him building an image of a first man (first spouse?) and who chose, on Tuesday night, the current default Washington option that once upon a time was Mr. Obama's trademark look: dark suit, white shirt, blue tie.

But Tim Kaine. Over the last few nights of the Democratic convention, which was chockablock with national figures, his image was not like the others. It stood out for a reason.

Whenever I write about how women in the political arena dress, I inevitably get accusations of sexism and a number of responses along the lines of: ""Who cares how they dress, you should be writing about what they say!"" It's true that I write about women more than men. But that is because women have more choice in the matter, because they have more choice in general: For them, clothing can become a weapon and a tool in a way it cannot for men, whose options are meaningfully more limited.

That's an asset for a female politician (and happily, the current crop of female leaders are starting to use it), though we tend to tar it as a negative and though all those decisions can also be a pain.

Men really have only the tie and their off-duty wear to telegraph individuality. And, as has been clear over the last few nights in Philadelphia, a kind of general aura that is hard to pin down but creates an impression. That's where Mr. Kaine has come in.

Of all the male power speakers at the convention thus far, he was the least tailored. In fact, he looked kind of schlubby. In his gray suit, which pulled and bunched when he waved his arms, his dull blue shirt, and his tie with the wide red, dark gray and blue stripes that somehow matched his shirt and blended the two together, he looked like the anti-image-consultant guy. And I bet that is all to the good. After all, it is partly the point.

Mr. Kaine may have a lot of experience in government (he does), and foreign policy and military cred (he does), all of which were most material in his selection as vice-presidential candidate, but he is also unshowy; he's the normal guy, in contrast to a woman in extraordinary circumstances. The one who doesn't wear designer duds. The one everyone who doesn't relate to Mrs. Clinton can relate to.

At least, in those clothes he was.

Just consider some of the Twitter reaction:

And the answer to the question in that last tweet: Yes.

Mr. Kaine's role is not unlike the one that Speaker Paul D. Ryan in his too-big suits played for Mitt Romney in 2012, when Mr. Ryan was the guy's guy, the one that brought Mr. Romney down to earth, the -- as Noreen Malone wrote in the New Republic -- ""Midwestern boy next door suddenly thrust into this crazy political world.""

Mr. Kaine is the visual yin to Mrs. Clinton's yang. When you are pitching yourself as the big-tent candidate, you need to make the case every way you can. On Wednesday, the vice-presidential nominee was a meaningful part of that narrative before he even spoke a word.",1040227740
43,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2016/07/21/opinion/pence-versus-trump-kids.html,"CLEVELAND -- Donald Trump arrived here Wednesday with a few words to the fans assembled at the helicopter pad. Really, just a few. Win Ohio ... make America great ... Mike Pence ... unbelievable vice president.

""Welcome to Cleveland,"" said Pence. It was a little peculiar that the governor of Indiana was doing the greeting, but there was, you know, that problem with John Kasich being on strike from the convention. It was Pence's big night, although Trump made it pretty clear he was more excited about his son Eric's turn on stage. (""Eric's going to be great ... amazing job. Kids congratulations. Fantastic job."")

Which Trump child has been your favorite so far? I think you have to give a little credit to Tiffany, who labors under the burden of having been named for a jewelry store and got stuck with the job of telling the long-awaited touching personal anecdotes about her father. Eric, however, seemed to be the schedulers' favorite, given the fact that speaking roles also went to an official from the winery he runs and to the vice president of the Eric Trump Foundation.

The kids have been a relatively heartwarming feature, considering that virtually everybody else, including the conventioneers, has spent a large chunk of time demanding that Hillary Clinton be sent directly to the pokey. (""Lock her up!"")

Donald Trump's Convention: Day 3

Arguments, provocations and observations from Times Opinion writers.

July 20, 2016

This is a whole new world when it comes to nominating a president. The candidate pops up all over the place, like Pokémon. When he's not around, the delegates listen to his relatives, or speakers calling for the imprisonment of his opponent.

Look back nostalgically on the days when you'd hear a description like that and think, maybe, Gambia.

For all the hate-Hillary hysteria, the convention had been a bit of a snooze -- until we got to Ted Cruz. He began with a shout-out to LeBron James, then congratulated Trump ""on winning the nomination last night."" The emotional high point of the evening came when the enraged delegates realized he was never going to mention the nominee again. You have to hand it to Ted Cruz. His ability to drive people crazy is unparalleled.

By the end of the evening, hating Cruz was almost as popular as hating Hillary. But the latter, of course, has more staying power.

A New Hampshire delegate -- who is also a well-known Trump adviser on veterans' affairs -- upped the ante, telling a radio interviewer that Clinton should be ""shot for treason."" State Representative Al Baldasaro is what is known as a colorful politician. There is one in every legislature, where ""colorful"" is a synonym for ""stark raving nuts but still repeatedly elected.""

The leader of New Hampshire's Republican Party called on Baldasaro to take it back, but being a Trumpite means never having to say you're sorry.

Refusal to apologize is definitely one of the overarching themes of the Cleveland experience. We'd still be debating the Melania's Cribbed Quotes crisis if a hitherto unknown Trump employee hadn't finally taken responsibility. (On the plus side, a day and a half of stonewalling gave us the opportunity to hear the Republican spokesman dismiss the whole affair with a quote from Twilight Sparkle in ""My Little Pony."")

But about Mike Pence. His speech is destined to be totally forgotten in the Cruzmania. But he did a grand job of returning the auditorium to the early-evening theme of sleepiness. Every single one of the Trump children turns out to be a more exciting speaker than the prospective vice-president. Tiffany's story about how Donald wrote notes on her report cards suddenly took on new and compelling dimensions.

Even Pence, however, drew a ""Lock her up!"" chant from the floor. It's what they've got.

In case you missed it, Pence promised that his new partner would solve all of our problems, from ISIS to the national debt. There was no explanation of how Trump -- whose current tax-cutting plan would send the debt soaring like a grand new skyscraper -- was going to manage that. This is definitely not a convention that sweats the details.

So far the most interesting look at the Pence-Trump relationship came on ""60 Minutes,"" when Lesley Stahl asked Pence if he thought that as vice president he'd ever be able to go to his boss and say that he'd ""crossed the line"" and needed to apologize. Pence stammered desperately until Trump broke in and said: ""Absolutely. I might not apologize. ... I might not do that. But I would absolutely want him to come in.""

Some people believe the Republican vice-presidential selection is more important than usual because Trump is capable of getting bored with the actual duties of presidency and tossing everything short of declaring nuclear war over to his veep. It's possible. But of course if that happened, he could just as easily put Donald Jr. in charge.

The one thing we know for sure is that if Trump did something terrible, Pence would have no chance whatsoever to get him to say he's sorry. But the vice-presidential nominee has total rights to go into his office and be ignored.",1040187402
44,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/05/opinion/sunday/trump-impeachment.html,"The presidential oath of office contains 35 words and one core promise: to ""preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States."" Since virtually the moment Donald J. Trump took that oath two years ago, he has been violating it.

He has repeatedly put his own interests above those of the country. He has used the presidency to promote his businesses. He has accepted financial gifts from foreign countries. He has lied to the American people about his relationship with a hostile foreign government. He has tolerated cabinet officials who use their position to enrich themselves.

To shield himself from accountability for all of this -- and for his unscrupulous presidential campaign -- he has set out to undermine the American system of checks and balances. He has called for the prosecution of his political enemies and the protection of his allies. He has attempted to obstruct justice. He has tried to shake the public's confidence in one democratic institution after another, including the press, federal law enforcement and the federal judiciary.

The unrelenting chaos that Trump creates can sometimes obscure the big picture. But the big picture is simple: The United States has never had a president as demonstrably unfit for the office as Trump. And it's becoming clear that 2019 is likely to be dominated by a single question: What are we going to do about it?

The easy answer is to wait -- to allow the various investigations of Trump to run their course and ask voters to deliver a verdict in 2020. That answer has one great advantage. It would avoid the national trauma of overturning an election result. Ultimately, however, waiting is too dangerous. The cost of removing a president from office is smaller than the cost of allowing this president to remain.

He has already shown, repeatedly, that he will hurt the country in order to help himself. He will damage American interests around the world and damage vital parts of our constitutional system at home. The risks that he will cause much more harm are growing.

Some of the biggest moderating influences have recently left the administration. The defense secretary who defended our alliances with NATO and South Korea is gone. So is the attorney general who refused to let Trump subvert a federal investigation into himself. The administration is increasingly filled with lackeys and enablers. Trump has become freer to turn his whims into policy -- like, say, shutting down the government on the advice of Fox News hosts or pulling troops from Syria on the advice of a Turkish autocrat.

The biggest risk may be that an external emergency -- a war, a terrorist attack, a financial crisis, an immense natural disaster -- will arise. By then, it will be too late to pretend that he is anything other than manifestly unfit to lead.

For the country's sake, there is only one acceptable outcome, just as there was after Americans realized in 1974 that a criminal was occupying the Oval Office. The president must go.

Achieving this outcome won't be easy. It will require honorable people who have served in the Trump administration to share, publicly, what they have seen and what they believe. (At this point, anonymous leaks are not sufficient.) It will require congressional Republicans to acknowledge that they let a con man take over their party and then defended that con man. It will require Democrats and progressive activists to understand that a rushed impeachment may actually help Trump remain in office.

But if removing him will not be easy, it's not as unlikely as it may sometimes seem. From the beginning, Trump has been an unusually weak president, as political scientists have pointed out. Although members of Congress have not done nearly enough to constrain him, no other recent president has faced nearly so much public criticism or private disdain from his own party.

Since the midterm election showed the political costs that Trump inflicts on Republicans, this criticism seems to be growing. They have broken with him on foreign policy (in Saudi Arabia, Yemen and Syria) and are anxious about the government shutdown. Trump is vulnerable to any erosion in his already weak approval rating, be it from an economic downturn, more Russia revelations or simply the defection of a few key allies. When support for an unpopular leader starts to crack, it can crumble.

[Sign up for David Leonhardt's daily newsletter -- with commentary on the news and reading suggestions from around the web.]

Before we get to the how of Trump's removal, though, I want to spend a little more time on the why -- because even talking about the ouster of an elected president should happen only under extreme circumstances. Unfortunately, the country is now so polarized that such talk instead occurs with every president. Both George W. Bush and Barack Obama were subjected to reckless calls for their impeachment, from members of Congress no less.

So let's be clear. Trump's ideology is not an impeachable offense. However much you may disagree with Trump's tax policy -- and I disagree vehemently -- it is not a reason to remove him from office. Nor are his efforts to cut government health insurance or to deport undocumented immigrants. Such issues, among others, are legitimate matters of democratic struggle, to be decided by elections, legislative debates, protests and the other normal tools of democracy. These issues are not the ""treason, bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors"" that the founders intended impeachment to address.

Yet the founders also did not intend for the removal of a president to be impossible. They insisted on including an impeachment clause in the Constitution because they understood that an incompetent or corrupt person was nonetheless likely to attain high office every so often. And they understood how much harm such a person could do. The country needed a way to address what Alexander Hamilton called ""the abuse or violation of some public trust"" and James Madison called the ""incapacity, negligence or perfidy"" of a president.

The negligence and perfidy of President Trump -- his high crimes and misdemeanors -- can be separated into four categories. This list is conservative. It does not include the possibility that his campaign coordinated strategy with Russia, which remains uncertain. It also does not include his lazy approach to the job, like his refusal to read briefing books or the many empty hours on his schedule. It instead focuses on demonstrable ways that he has broken the law or violated his constitutional oath.

Trump has used the presidency for personal enrichment.

Regardless of party, Trump's predecessors took elaborate steps to separate their personal financial interests from their governing responsibilities. They released their tax returns, so that any potential conflicts would be public. They placed their assets in a blind trust, to avoid knowing how their policies might affect their own investments.

Trump has instead treated the presidency as a branding opportunity. He has continued to own and promote the Trump Organization. He has spent more than 200 days at one of his properties and billed taxpayers for hundreds of thousands of dollars.

If this pattern were merely petty corruption, without damage to the national interest, it might not warrant removal from office. But Trump's focus on personal profit certainly appears to be affecting policy. Most worrisome, foreign officials and others have realized they can curry favor with the president by spending money at one of his properties.

Saudi Arabia has showered the Trump Organization with business, and Trump has stood by the Saudis despite their brutal war in Yemen and their assassination of a prominent critic. A Chinese government-owned company reportedly gave a $500 million loan to a Trump-backed project in Indonesia; two days later, Trump announced that he was lifting sanctions on another well-connected Chinese company.

These examples, and many more, flout Article 1 of the Constitution, which bans federal officeholders from accepting ""emoluments"" from any foreign country unless Congress approves the arrangement. Madison, when making the case for an impeachment clause, spoke of a president who ""might betray his trust to foreign powers.""

Then, of course, there is Russia. Even before Robert Mueller, the special counsel, completes his investigation, the known facts are damning enough in at least one way. Trump lied to the American people during the 2016 campaign about business negotiations between his company and Vladimir Putin's government. As president, Trump has taken steps -- in Europe and Syria -- that benefit Putin. To put it succinctly: The president of the United States lied to the country about his commercial relationship with a hostile foreign government toward which he has a strangely accommodating policy.

Combine Trump's actions with his tolerance for unethical cabinet officials -- including ones who have made shady stock trades, accepted lavish perks or used government to promote their own companies or those of their friends -- and the Trump administration is almost certainly the most corrupt in American history. It makes Warren G. Harding's Teapot Dome scandal look like, well, a tempest in a teapot.

Trump has violated campaign finance law.

A Watergate grand jury famously described Richard Nixon as ""an unindicted co-conspirator."" Trump now has his own indictment tag: ""Individual-1.""

Federal prosecutors in New York filed papers last month alleging that Trump -- identified as Individual-1 -- directed a criminal plan to evade campaign finance laws. It happened during the final weeks of the 2016 campaign, when he instructed his lawyer, Michael Cohen, to pay a combined $280,000 in hush money to two women with whom Trump evidently had affairs. Trump and his campaign did not disclose these payments, as required by law. In the two years since, Trump has lied publicly about them -- initially saying he did not know about the payments, only to change his story later.

It's worth acknowledging that most campaign finance violations do not warrant removal from office. But these payments were not most campaign finance violations. They involved large, secret payoffs in the final weeks of a presidential campaign that, prosecutors said, ""deceived the voting public."" The seriousness of the deception is presumably the reason that the prosecutors filed criminal charges against Cohen, rather than the more common penalty of civil fines for campaign finance violations.

What should happen to a president who won office with help from criminal behavior? The founders specifically considered this possibility during their debates at the Constitutional Convention. The most direct answer came from George Mason: A president who ""practiced corruption and by that means procured his appointment in the first instance"" should be subject to impeachment.

Trump has obstructed justice.

Whatever Mueller ultimately reveals about the relationship between the Trump campaign and Russia, Trump has obstructed justice to keep Mueller -- and others -- from getting to the truth.

Again and again, Trump has interfered with the investigation in ways that may violate the law and clearly do violate decades-old standards of presidential conduct. He pressured James Comey, then the F.B.I. director, to let up on the Russia investigation, as a political favor. When Comey refused, Trump fired him. Trump also repeatedly pressured Jeff Sessions, the attorney general, to halt the investigation and ultimately forced Sessions to resign for not doing so. Trump has also publicly hounded several of the government's top experts on Russian organized crime, including Andrew McCabe and Bruce Ohr.

And Trump has repeatedly lied to the American people. He has claimed, outrageously, that the Justice Department tells witnesses to lie in exchange for leniency. He has rejected, with no factual basis, the findings of multiple intelligence agencies about Russia's role in the 2016 campaign. He reportedly helped his son Donald Trump Jr. draft a false statement about a 2016 meeting with a Russian lawyer.

Obstruction of justice is certainly grounds for the removal of a president. It was the subject of the first Nixon article of impeachment passed by the House Judiciary Committee. Among other things, that article accused him of making ""false or misleading public statements for the purpose of deceiving the people of the United States.""

Trump has subverted democracy.

The Constitution that Trump swore to uphold revolves around checks and balances. It depends on the idea that the president is not a monarch. He is a citizen to whom, like all other citizens, the country's laws apply. Trump rejects this principle. He has instead tried to undermine the credibility of any independent source of power or information that does not serve his interests.

It's much more than just the Russia investigation. He has tried to delegitimize federal judges based on their ethnicity or on the president who appointed them, drawing a rare rebuke from Chief Justice John Roberts. Trump has criticized the Justice Department for indicting Republican politicians during an election year. He has called for Comey, Hillary Clinton and other political opponents of his to be jailed.

Trump has described journalists as ""the enemy of the people"" -- an insult usually leveled by autocrats. He has rejected basic factual findings from the C.I.A., the Congressional Budget Office, research scientists and others. He has told bald lies about election fraud.

Individually, these sins may not seem to deserve removal from office. Collectively, though, they exact a terrible toll on American society. They cause people to lose the faith on which a democracy depends -- faith in elections, in the justice system, in the basic notion of truth.

No other president since Nixon has engaged in behavior remotely like Trump's. To accept it without sanction is ultimately to endorse it. Unpleasant though it is to remove a president, the costs and the risks of a continued Trump presidency are worse.

What now?

The most relevant precedent for the removal of Trump is Nixon, the only American president to be forced from office because of his conduct. And two aspects of Nixon's departure tend to get overlooked today. One, he was never impeached. Two, most Republicans -- both voters and elites -- stuck by him until almost the very end. His approval rating among Republicans was still about 50 percent when, realizing in the summer of 1974 that he was doomed, he resigned.

The current political dynamics have some similarities. Whether the House of Representatives, under Democratic control, impeaches Trump is not the big question. The question is whether he loses the support of a meaningful slice of Republicans.

I know that many of Trump's critics have given up hoping that he ever will. They assume that Republican senators will go on occasionally criticizing him without confronting him. But it is a mistake to give up. The stakes are too large -- and the chances of success are too real.

Consider the following descriptions of Trump: ""terribly unfit;"" ""erratic;"" ""reckless;"" ""impetuous;"" ""unstable;"" ""a pathological liar;"" ""dangerous to a democracy;"" a concern to ""anyone who cares about our nation."" Every one of these descriptions comes from a Republican member of Congress or of Trump's own administration.

They know. They know he is unfit for office. They do not need to be persuaded of the truth. They need to be persuaded to act on it.

Democrats won't persuade them by impeaching Trump. Doing so would probably rally the president's supporters. It would shift the focus from Trump's behavior toward a group of Democratic leaders whom Republicans are never going to like. A smarter approach is a series of sober-minded hearings to highlight Trump's misconduct. Democrats should focus on easily understandable issues most likely to bother Trump's supporters, like corruption.

If this approach works at all -- or if Mueller's findings shift opinion, or if a separate problem arises, like the economy -- Trump's Republican allies will find themselves in a very difficult spot. At his current approval rating of about 40 percent, Republicans were thumped in the midterms. Were his rating to fall further, a significant number of congressional Republicans would be facing long re-election odds in 2020.

Two examples are Cory Gardner of Colorado and Susan Collins of Maine, senators who, not coincidentally, have shown tentative signs of breaking with Trump on the government shutdown. The recent criticism from Mitt Romney -- who alternates between critical and sycophantic, depending on his own political interests -- is another sign of Trump's weakness.

For now, most Republicans worry that a full break with Trump will cause them to lose a primary, and it might. But sticking by him is no free lunch. Just ask the 27 Republican incumbents who were defeated last year and are now former members of Congress. By wide margins, suburban voters and younger voters find Trump abhorrent. The Republican Party needs to hold its own among these voters, starting in 2020.

It's not only that Trump is unfit to be president and that Republicans know it. It also may be the case that they will soon have a political self-interest in abandoning him. If they did, the end could come swiftly. The House could then impeach Trump, knowing the Senate might act to convict. Or negotiations could begin over whether Trump deserves to trade resignation for some version of immunity.

Finally, there is the hope -- naïve though it may seem -- that some Republicans will choose to act on principle. There now exists a small club of former Trump administration officials who were widely respected before joining the administration and whom Trump has sullied, to greater or lesser degrees. It includes Rex Tillerson, Gary Cohn, H.R. McMaster and Jim Mattis. Imagine if one of them gave a television interview and told the truth about Trump. Doing so would be a service to their country at a time of national need. It would be an illustration of duty.

Throughout his career, Trump has worked hard to invent his own reality, and largely succeeded. It has made him very rich and, against all odds, elected him president. But whatever happens in 2019, his false version of reality will not survive history, just as Nixon's did not. Which side of that history do today's Republicans want to be on?

45,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/11/magazine/gay-conservative-trump-era.html,"Hannity is a buffoon,"" Ben Holden said, perhaps a bit too loudly. Holden was drinking disappointing sangria with a friend at the bar of the Trump International Hotel in Washington, where he had come last February more out of curiosity than reverence for the president. He was in town for his first Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC), an event that he took seriously enough to dress up for (dark suit, American-flag tie) but that he was also interested in for its anthropological weirdness. A 23-year-old student at Suffolk University in Boston who is gay and ""leans conservative,"" Holden planned to take copious notes and write a gonzo-style journalistic piece about a political gathering known as much for its raucous parties as its provocative speakers.

Holden wasn't the only young L.G.B.T. person in the Trump lobby that night. A few feet away, several conservative gay and bisexual journalists and activists reclined on couches. Among them was Charlie Nash, a tweed-wearing 21-year-old British reporter for Breitbart who described himself to me as a pagan, an absurdist and a right-wing environmentalist. Next to Nash was Lucian Wintrich, the 30-year-old former White House correspondent for The Gateway Pundit, a conspiracy-peddling far-right website founded by another gay man, Jim Hoft, to ""expose the wickedness of the left."" Wintrich is perhaps best known for his Twinks4Trump photo series, in which he photographed lithe young men wearing Make America Great Again baseball caps.

At the bar, Holden and a fellow Suffolk student were joined by a heavyset man in a colorful checkered shirt. Before telling them his name (and asking that I not use it), the man introduced himself by way of a toast: ""We're going to build that wall! We're going to make America great again!""

Holden's friend challenged the man to an arm-wrestling contest before having second thoughts. ""Actually, my masculinity is not worth sweating over in a zero-sum situation,"" he said.

""That's nonsense!"" the man told him. ""There's an economic benefit to masculinity.""

This led to some back-and-forth about economics and gender theory before Holden's friend relented and assumed an arm-wrestling position at the bar. The showdown didn't go his way. ""I think you got help from the Russians,"" he said.

""Collusion!"" the man shouted with delight.

Before long, it became clear why he had joined the students in conversation: to hit on Holden, who is tall and broad-shouldered and has big, protruding ears that add to an aura of youthful affability. But even as the man flirted he confided that he was deeply closeted and, in fact, saw his same-sex attractions as a kind of affliction. Still, he wanted Holden's phone number.

Holden couldn't relate to someone with shame about his sexual orientation, nor to those he called the ""loud gay Trump fanboys,"" referring to people like Wintrich and the former Breitbart senior editor Milo Yiannopoulos, who are both categorized by the Anti-Defamation League as ""alt lite,"" a designation given to those the organization says ""are in step with the alt-right in their hatred of feminists and immigrants, among others."" Wintrich and Yiannopoulos have made careers out of social media trolling and incendiary campus speeches tailored to outrage progressive students. (Wintrich titled a 2017 talk ""It's O.K. to Be White."") Holden saw them as gay minstrels producing a kind of garish, campy performance art meant more to shock than to make a cogent argument. He wasn't sure what they actually believed.

For his part, Holden said he believed his sexual orientation was one of the least interesting things about him. ""Being gay is not an accomplishment in and of itself,"" he told me, ""so I'm reluctant to lead with it or believe that it should dictate how I think about health care."" Holden was increasingly skeptical of tribalism and extremist elements of both parties; he seemed almost traumatized after attending the live CPAC taping of ""Hannity,"" describing some in the crowd as ""maladjusted and mindless"" and ""dredged up from the savage American hinterlands.""

Though he said he is liberal on most social issues and wishes the Republican Party would take climate change seriously, Holden aligns himself with conservatives and libertarians in many other ways -- he's anti-abortion, free-market-oriented and skeptical of big government. But perhaps above all else, Holden rejects what he considers a bedrock of contemporary liberalism: that, as he put it, your ""immutable characteristics"" -- race, ethnicity, sexual orientation -- ""should determine what your position is on every political issue, or what you're allowed to express an opinion about."" He added that he feels alienated from progressives on his campus and across the country, many of whom he believes are unwilling to debate issues ""without resorting to shaming or name-calling.""

Holden certainly didn't endear himself to most students on his campus when he showed up to classes wearing a MAGA hat a week before the 2016 presidential election. In retrospect, he said, he wasn't proud of his support for Trump. ""I think I did it mostly out of spite,"" he told me. ""It was a kind of 'F you' to the left and the Democratic Party, which is doubling down on intersectionality and identity politics.""

After barely an hour at the bar, Holden and his friend returned to CPAC's host hotel, the Gaylord National Resort in National Harbor, Md. Holden considered the Gaylord a fitting name for a conference with many openly gay attendees, including Log Cabin Republicans (a conservative L.G.B.T. group founded in 1977), Fox News analysts, transgender women and students from across the country.

Gregory T. Angelo, a 40-year-old longtime communications specialist who until recently was the president of the Log Cabin Republicans, told me that he had never seen so many openly gay conservatives at CPAC. ""They're coming out in recent years in a way they have not before,"" he said. Guy Benson, 33, a conservative writer and Fox News on-air contributor who came out publicly in 2015, told me that the conservative gay movement has become diverse enough in the past few years ""to have multiple constituencies with vastly different priorities and political styles.""

Many L.G.B.T. conservatives say they feel newly relevant and accepted in the Republican Party, which has long opposed L.G.B.T. rights. And, perhaps counterintuitive, some attribute this in part to Trump himself. ""The narrative on the left tends to be that Trump is horrible for L.G.B.T. people in every way imaginable, but that's not how many gays on the right see it,"" Benson told me. ""As a candidate, Trump signaled that L.G.B.T.-related culture wars are not ones the G.O.P. needs to be fighting anymore, and much of the base noticed. As flawed as Trump is, and despite some of his unfortunate policy moves on this front, he might actually represent a fulcrum point within the party on gay issues.""

Some gay conservatives feel so emboldened, in fact, that they ""shout about their love of the president and their L.G.B.T. identity from rooftops,"" Angelo told me. (By ""rooftops,"" he mostly meant Twitter.) Standing in front of the Log Cabin booth at CPAC, next to a poster affirming the organization's support for the Second Amendment, Angelo didn't shout, but he did beam as he showed me a letter Trump wrote in 2017 congratulating the group on its 40th anniversary. Trump is the first sitting Republican president to publicly commend the organization.

What a difference three years can make. In 2015, CPAC wouldn't even let the Log Cabin Republicans set up a booth at the conference. But now here they were, snapping pictures in front of their booth and poster (""This will be sure to trigger my entire school at once,"" a Log Cabin intern said) and basking in enthusiastic thumbs-ups from convention attendees. Though Angelo conceded the Republican Party ""still has work to do"" on L.G.B.T. issues, he insisted the future has never looked brighter. ""It's a good time to be a gay conservative,"" he said.

The reality, I would come to learn, is a bit more complicated than that.

There have historically been few good times to be a gay conservative. Gay Republicans have spent the better part of several decades being excoriated from all sides, largely rejected by their party and alternately mocked and reviled by many in the L.G.B.T. community. When I asked Rob Smith -- a 36-year-old Iraq War veteran and former Democrat who is now a conservative -- about the longtime narrative associated with gays in the G.O.P., he didn't hesitate. ""Self-hating queens,"" he said.

Gay conservatives have offered endless fodder for comedians. David Letterman took a shot during the 2004 Republican National Convention: ""You know the Log Cabin Republicans -- they hate Hillary Clinton, but they love what she's done with her hair."" Jimmy Dore, co-host of the Young Turks' ""The Aggressive Progressives"" web series, joked during a 2007 standup routine, ""They're gay Republicans -- they're people who are gay and, on purpose, are Republicans.""

When not mocking gay conservatives, comedians -- as well as many in the L.G.B.T. community -- have delighted in the sex scandals of closeted gay Republican lawmakers across the country, who often voted against gay rights even as they solicited gay sex in restrooms, hired male escorts or hooked up with men in their congressional offices. But gay Republicans have also long been seen by many in the L.G.B.T. community as no laughing matter. They're routinely denounced for supporting a party that only 4 percent of L.G.B.T. people view as ""friendly"" toward the L.G.B.T. community, according to a 2013 Pew poll.

Gay Republicans have typically offered two reasons for remaining loyal to a party that offers little reciprocation. The first is that while they wish the party were better on L.G.B.T. issues, they prioritize other concerns more. ""Why should I be a Democrat when I disagree with Democrats on most issues?"" Sarah Longwell, the 38-year-old chairwoman of the Log Cabin Republicans, asked me. ""I became interested in conservative ideas, particularly economic ideas, in high school. I knew I was conservative before I knew I was gay."" In a video on the home page of PragerU, a conservative video site, Guy Benson explained his political priorities: ""I'm a Christian, a patriotic American and a free-market, shrink-the-government conservative who also happens to be gay.""

But gay conservatives also speak of their party affiliation as a kind of public service. Many have insisted for decades that their presence in the G.O.P. (their ""place at the table,"" as some put it) has helped it evolve, however slowly, on L.G.B.T. rights. In recent years, gay and lesbian conservatives have been especially eager to take partial credit for the legalization of same-sex marriage. ""You weren't going to have the cultural shift on gay marriage without Republicans talking to Republicans about gay dignity and why gay marriage is important,"" Longwell said.

In a new documentary about the Log Cabin Republicans produced by the organization, longtime members also champion their 2004 lawsuit to overturn ""don't ask, don't tell,"" the Clinton administration policy on gay, bisexual and lesbian service members, which the organization opposed because it required service members to conceal their sexual orientation. ""It was Clinton and the Democratic Party that passed 'don't ask, don't tell,' "" a Log Cabin member says on camera. ""We fought that for 20 years.""

Listening to gay Republicans take credit for gay civil rights victories is a mind-bending exercise for many L.G.B.T. people. The writer and sex-advice columnist Dan Savage, who has publicly called gay Republicans ""house faggots,"" told me that ""the G.O.P. continues to be an anti-queer political movement, and these useful idiots continue to let themselves be used by the party to inoculate itself against charges of homophobia and transphobia.""

Though L.G.B.T. activists have never had particularly nice things to say about gay Republicans, the rhetoric has been dialed up in the Trump era. Kevin Sessums, a magazine writer and author who prolifically rails against Trump and Republicans on his popular Facebook page, has called gay Trump supporters ""Vichy gays"" for what he describes as their ""collaboration with a fascist and deeply homophobic regime."" Recently, when a gay and formerly liberal power couple from New York were profiled in The Times as Trump supporters, the reaction was fierce. ""These people are vile, despicable gay men,"" the writer and gay activist Michelangelo Signorile wrote on Twitter.

[Read how a gay and liberal couple became two of N.Y.'s biggest Trump supporters.]

Savage, Sessums and Signorile don't lack for evidence when it comes to the Republican Party's continued L.G.B.T. problem. Though Trump claimed while a candidate that he would be a ""better friend"" to L.G.B.T. people than Hillary Clinton would, gay rights advocates insist that he has failed to govern that way. ""The coordinated, systematic onslaught of attacks on L.G.B.T.Q. civil rights has been unprecedented in scale and scope,"" says Chad Griffin, the president of the Human Rights Campaign, an L.G.B.T. civil rights organization, adding that in Trump's first year alone, ""there were dozens of rollbacks, rescissions and executive orders attacking basic rights and protections.""

Transgender Americans have borne the brunt of those efforts. Trump has tried to block transgender people from serving in the military and reversed several Obama-era policies that protected transgender Americans from discrimination in workplaces, schools and prisons. But gays and lesbians haven't escaped unscathed. In addition to more symbolic gestures, like failing to recognize L.G.B.T. Pride Month, Trump has taken a plethora of anti-gay actions ""to pacify the intolerant base of his party,"" says Jimmy LaSalvia, a longtime gay conservative activist who left the G.O.P. in 2014. On the same day as the transgender military ban announcement, for example, the Trump administration landed two other blows against L.G.B.T. rights: The Justice Department argued that the 1964 Civil Rights Act's ban on sex discrimination doesn't protect American workers on the basis of sexual orientation, and Trump nominated a longtime gay rights foe, Sam Brownback, as his ambassador at large for international religious freedom, a State Department position. (As governor of Kansas, Brownback signed an executive order in 2015 prohibiting the state government from penalizing religious groups that deny services to married same-sex couples.)

Still, many of Trump's L.G.B.T. supporters dispute that Trump is bad for gay people; at CPAC, a Log Cabin Republicans flyer boasted of ""fighting the 'fake news' about our president."" Gay conservatives like to cite Trump's nomination of the openly gay Richard Grenell as ambassador to Germany as evidence that Trump has ""no personal animus toward L.G.B.T. people,"" as Angelo put it.

Critics of the party's positions on L.G.B.T. issues have other targets besides the Trump administration. The most obvious is the G.O.P.'s breathtakingly anti-L.G.B.T. 2016 platform, which implicitly affirms conversion therapy for minors, claims that allowing transgender people to use the restroom matching their gender identity is ""dangerous"" and argues for the superiority of heterosexual households. Angelo called it ""the most anti-L.G.B.T. platform in the party's 162-year history.""

And yet, many L.G.B.T. conservatives -- including Angelo -- insist the party today is no longer an inhospitable place for gay people. Some, like Lucian Wintrich, go so far as to say that ""it's liberal propaganda to suggest that the right today is anti-gay."" Others are more cleareyed about their party's shortcomings but say the platform, which is voted on by a committee dominated by social conservatives, is, as Angelo told me, ""functionally meaningless"" and ""doesn't represent the views of the Republicans I know.""

Angelo, who said the Log Cabin Republicans had a spike in membership and social media followers in 2016, believes that this greater G.O.P. openness largely explains why increasing numbers of young conservatives are coming out of the closet and ""speaking their minds."" But other gay conservatives told me that Trump has simultaneously had an opposite effect. Andrew Sullivan, arguably the most influential (and controversial) conservative gay voice of the last three decades, told me he knows many politically moderate gay conservatives who have decided to ""keep their heads down"" during the Trump era. ""Because they know that during this period of the Great Awokening, opposing Trump is not enough to satisfy the far left,"" said Sullivan, who still considers himself center-right politically even though he has supported Democratic presidential candidates since 2000. ""Anything less than completely accepting the far left's worldview will get you attacked as racist, or misogynistic, or ableist, or whatever slur the mob settles on.""

Considering how much criticism L.G.B.T. conservatives face from outside their ranks, I was surprised by how often I heard them disparage one another. The assimilationist-minded Log Cabin Republicans, the Trump critics like Sullivan, the deliberately trollish Yiannopoulos acolytes and the conservative-leaning college students coming of age in an era of greater social acceptance have seemingly little in common besides their sexual orientation -- and their oft-stated distaste for identity politics. I routinely heard conservative gays criticize other conservative gays as ineffective, boring or empty vessels. ""What I see right now in the conservative L.G.B.T. community are a lot of Twitter trolls and some social media celebrities,"" Rob Smith, the Iraq vet, told me. ""What I don't see are a lot of movement leaders.""

Not long before CPAC last year, I asked Doug Hattaway, a gay Democratic strategist who was a senior adviser to Hillary Clinton's 2008 presidential campaign, if he counted any gay conservatives as good friends. He did not, he told me, though he recently had gone on a Tinder date with a Trump appointee. ""It did not go well,"" he said. But Hattaway was friends with a gay former conservative -- a 32-year-old named Ryan Newcomb, who worked in the White House during the George W. Bush administration and whom Hattaway describes as now being a ""raging progressive."" Hattaway invited Newcomb to join us that night for a drink at a bar in Washington's Logan Circle neighborhood.

The same day, I spoke by phone with a longtime gay conservative who served in Trump's presidential campaign. (Though he is out of the closet, he asked me not to use his name so he could speak freely about his personal life. I'll call him C., the first letter of his first name.) C. was having a rough week. His liberal boyfriend of about a year, whom C. was ""head over heels for,"" had decided, after much consternation, that he couldn't continue seeing a Trump-supporting Republican. Though C. was devastated, he said he'd had plenty of practice being rejected by gay Democrats. He'd had men storm out of first dates with him, yell at him in bars and pour drinks on his head.

I didn't expect anything that dramatic to happen when I invited C. to join Hattaway, Newcomb and me at the bar. As we waited for C. to arrive, Newcomb reclined in his seat with a drink and scrolled through his cellphone contacts, amazed at how many right-leaning gays he knew. I heard something similar from Tim Miller, a gay former communications staff member for Jeb Bush, who told me he was surprised by how quickly a community of mostly young, openly gay conservative men has formed in recent years in Washington. (Conservative lesbians often have less luck finding community. Sarah Longwell told me that she personally knew only a handful of conservative lesbians, and that her spouse and all her close lesbian friends are Democrats.)

When C. finally arrived, it didn't take long for talk to turn to Trump. ""I still can't believe he's president,"" Newcomb said, shaking his head in disbelief.

""Why?"" C. asked.

""Because he's not worthy of the title.""

""Well, he won,"" C. said, annoyed.

Awkward silence ensued. Before long, C. left. ""I can stomach gay Republicans,"" Hattaway said once C. was out the door. ""But a gay Trump supporter? They know it's indefensible, so off they go.""

But many gay Trump supporters aren't so quick to run from a fight. In late 2017 I visited Chadwick Moore, a 35-year-old former liberal and writer for the national gay magazine Out who is now one of the most combative L.G.B.T. conservatives on social media and on Fox News, where he is Tucker Carlson's go-to gay on the supposed hysterics of the gay left. During a June segment about a Huffington Post piece calling for a boycott of Chick-fil-A for its past donations to groups opposing L.G.B.T. rights, Moore gleefully drank from a Chick-fil-A cup as he mocked ""pearl-clutching lefty gays"" he deemed ""desperate for villains"" because they have ""no one left to hate.""

Moore -- who has repeatedly defended the Proud Boys, a far-right men's group of self-identified ""Western chauvinists"" that was banned on Facebook and Instagram after 10 members were arrested on charges of riot and attempted assault in New York in October -- insists that the real threat to gay people comes from Islam. A strain of Islamophobia is common among some gay conservatives here and abroad, including in France's far-right National Rally party (formerly called the National Front), which, though it opposes same-sex marriage, reportedly had more gay people in leadership roles in 2017 than any other major party in the country. ""Pray for Le Pen,"" Moore tweeted in support of National Rally candidate Marine Le Pen before last year's French presidential election.

This current iteration of Moore would likely come as a surprise to the old version, who voted for Hillary Clinton. Moore ""came out"" as a conservative not long after he wrote an October 2016 Out cover story about Yiannopoulos that was harshly criticized as too sympathetic by many L.G.B.T. journalists. When I met with Moore on the patio of a bar in Williamsburg, Brooklyn, to talk about his political metamorphosis, he had come directly from a taping of Carlson's show and was still on an adrenaline high. Though he was friendlier and more introspective in person than he is on social media, it was difficult to take him seriously when he said things like ""David Duke is actually a leftist"" and ""What's not to love about Trump? He's a drag queen. He's a cartoon character. He's fabulous. He's a Kardashian!""

I was curious how much of Moore's persona was Yiannopoulos-inspired performance art that he didn't actually believe but that was gaining him more notoriety than he enjoyed as a writer for Out. I also wondered whether Moore's schoolyard mocking of the gay left (sample tweet to Glaad, a group focused on L.G.B.T. media coverage: ""Grow a pair, ladies"") was retribution for being publicly rebuked by his L.G.B.T. colleagues and eventually shunned by his longtime gay friends.

Unsurprisingly, Moore rejected both theories, insisting that as a member of the mainstream media, I couldn't possibly understand him or portray him positively. ""I like myself so much more and am so much happier"" as a conservative, he said, but that's ""going to be left out of your article, because it's too uplifting."" He no longer supports Democrats, he explained, because the contemporary left is dishonest, hysterical and obsessed with policing speech. Worse yet, the left is no fun anymore. ""If you love mischief, if you love upsetting delicate people, I don't know where else you would be right now than the gay right,"" he told me.

Though Moore and Lucian Wintrich rarely passed up an opportunity to throw shade at each other when I spoke with them -- Moore calls Wintrich ""the dumbest person on the internet,"" while Wintrich says Moore is ""stealing Milo's tired act"" -- they share a belief that their contemporary brand of conservatism is channeling a subversive, old-school gay spirit.

""Being gay used to be about being transgressive and pushing the culture,"" Wintrich told me in late 2017 in the Washington apartment he lived in at the time, which was decorated with huge framed Twinks4Trump photographs. Wintrich, who attended Bard College and could even now pass for a brooding student at the famously liberal school, smoked a cigarette near an open kitchen window. ""When did gay men get so boring?""

In April I traveled to northwest Oklahoma to meet Colton Buckley, a 24-year-old gay cowboy in the midst of a Republican primary campaign for a seat in the Oklahoma House. A self-described ""God-fearing, gun-toting gay,"" Buckley hoped to represent Ellis County, a sparsely populated area that may have more feral pigs than Hillary Clinton supporters. Of the 1,766 county residents who voted in the 2016 presidential election, only 155 backed Clinton.

That was good news for Buckley, one of the youngest Trump delegates to the 2016 Republican convention and one of more than 20 Republican L.G.B.T. candidates who competed in federal or local races in the 2018 election, according to the LGBTQ Victory Fund, a political action committee. (Five of these candidates won.)

Buckley, who came out publicly after the deadly 2016 terrorist shooting at the Pulse nightclub in Orlando, told me that his primary opponents were trying to use his sexual orientation against him. ""There's a whisper campaign going on,"" he said, as he drove around Ellis County in his pickup truck, wearing jeans and a cowboy hat. Buckley told me he opposes both same-sex marriage -- ""for biblical reasons,"" he said -- and what he calls ""the homosexual agenda."" (When I asked for sample agenda items, Buckley said it was less of an actual list and more of a ""catchall phrase for a liberal doctrine."") Buckley summarized his political beliefs this way: ""I'm one of the most conservative gay people you'll ever meet.""

Buckley lives in Arnett, a small, barren town with only one place to get a beer -- a dive bar called the Longhorn with signage you might expect to find at the after-party for a women's rodeo (""Cowgirl Motto: Party 'til He's Cute""). The Longhorn's chatty owner, Stacy McCartor, had also outfitted the place with Buckley campaign signs. She didn't care that he was gay, she said, though she worried that others would. ""If only you were a lesbian -- guys can wrap their heads around that!"" she told him.

I watched Buckley give a short version of his stump speech to three men in their 30s sitting around a table drinking. Then Buckley pulled out his phone to play a video from his campaign website, in which he shoots an AR-15 rifle after defiantly asking, ""What part of 'shall not be infringed' do you not understand?""

The most talkative of the three men didn't know that Buckley was gay, and finally he asked why I was there taking notes. ""This is a journalist,"" Buckley told him, ""and he wants to know how a young man who lives in rural Oklahoma and who is running for office as a Republican is also a fag."" (Buckley told me he often used derogatory terms ""to disarm voters who would potentially shut down based on my sexual orientation."")

The man looked confused. ""I'm going to need a couple more beers,"" he said finally.

After gathering his thoughts, he told Buckley that he was ""in the wrong area to be doing this. People around here ain't gonna vote for you."" He said he didn't personally have a problem with gay people before suggesting, a few minutes later, that Buckley might eventually learn to appreciate the opposite sex. ""You don't have no interest in a woman?"" he asked.

""Nope,"" Buckley said, adding that he didn't choose to be gay. ""Why would I live in a rural area and be a Republican and a Christian and choose something where everybody's gonna hate me?""

""I don't hate you,"" the man said. Before long, in fact, he almost seemed ready to play matchmaker. ""Do you have any interest in anyone here in town? Any fellas?""

Buckley offered him a choice. Would he prefer a candidate who is straight but who wants to raise taxes, as Buckley suggested one of his opponents did? Or would he prefer ""a faggot that's going to fight for your gun rights and make sure your taxes don't get raised""? The man didn't hesitate. ""The faggot,"" he said. Buckley turned toward me. ""See? That's why I'm going to win this race.""

Buckley turned out to be wrong about that -- he finished in third place with just 26 percent of the vote. When I texted him after the primary to ask if he thought he would have made the runoff had he not been openly gay, he didn't hesitate. ""Yes,"" he wrote back. But Buckley didn't regret coming out. ""The fact that I'm running honestly, bringing all of myself to the table, is a testament to how things are changing in this country for gay people,"" he told me. He suspected that had he been born five or 10 years earlier, he would have run as a closeted candidate. ""That's what most gay conservatives did until now,"" he said. ""Or they didn't run at all.""

If an openly gay cowboy running for office was a surprise to Republicans in Ellis County, conservative transgender activists were an equally unexpected sight at last year's CPAC. Three transgender women, including Jennifer Williams, a 50-year-old government contractor from Trenton, walked around the Gaylord holding an L.G.B.T.-pride flag and small signs that read: ""Proud to be Conservative. Proud to be Transgender. Proud to be American. #SameTeam.""

They knew they had their work cut out for them. Williams, who is running for the state's General Assembly, told me that while most mainstream Republicans wouldn't dare be openly contemptuous of gays and lesbians anymore, there's no similar reprieve for transgender people. She described an endless barrage of antitransgender rhetoric from conservatives, including from some gay men (both Wintrich and Moore used the transgender slur ""tranny"" in their conversations with me) and from prominent voices like Ben Shapiro, who has called transgenderism a ""mental disorder."" At CPAC, Shapiro told the crowd that ""you don't get to tell little boys they can become little girls just to avoid offending people.""

The day after Shapiro's speech, I watched the transgender women engage in a lengthy discussion with several young men, including Ben Holden and another conservative gay college student. In what occasionally felt like a debate, Williams tried to get them to understand that transgender people face many of the same smears -- that they're mentally unstable and a threat to children in restrooms -- that were aimed at gay men not long ago. Their conversation was momentarily interrupted when a young white nationalist walked between them, handing out his business card and suggesting that his organization ""is going to be the future, because we have stuff like this"" -- meaning transgender people -- ""we have to deal with."" Though jarring, the disruption offered Williams and the students something they could agree on: White nationalism is bad.

I could think of few lonelier identities than that of transgender conservative activist, and I wondered whether Williams considered leaving the party after she transitioned in 2015. She had, she said, but she decided against it partly because ""I was a Republican long before I was transgender,"" adding that her politics -- including limited government, a strong military and free-market policies -- still align her more closely with Republicans.

Like many L.G.B.T. conservatives, she also held out hope that her party might change. Jimmy LaSalvia, the longtime gay conservative who left the party in 2014, told me that he had watched several waves of gay conservatives have similar hopes dashed over the decades: ""I've seen so many fight the good fight, then become disillusioned that the party isn't changing and become independents or Democrats,"" he said. ""Then a new group of young gay conservatives appears, and they know almost nothing of this history, and they again insist that the party will change.""

Williams's initial optimism in 2016 was shared by many L.G.B.T. conservatives, who watched as candidate Trump ""made rather unprecedented public moves for a Republican to declare himself on the side of L.G.B.T. voters,"" recalls Patrick J. Egan, a political scientist at N.Y.U. who researches L.G.B.T. voting behavior. Trump hawked ""LGBTQ for Trump"" T-shirts on his campaign website, held up a pride flag during a campaign event and presided over what Angelo, the former Log Cabin president, called ""the most gay-friendly convention in G.O.P. history."" That's a low bar, to be sure, but for some Log Cabin members who witnessed Pat Buchanan's virulently anti-gay speech at the 1992 Republican convention, Trump's willingness to say the term ""L.G.B.T.Q."" from the stage and to offer the PayPal co-founder and openly gay conservative Peter Thiel a prime speaking slot was ""deeply meaningful,"" Angelo said.

But it wasn't meaningful enough to earn Williams's support -- or that of many L.G.B.T. people. Trump received just 14 percent of the community's vote, according to exit polling, significantly less than the 22 percent who backed Mitt Romney in 2012. One reason, Williams said, was Trump's selection of Mike Pence, who has a long history of opposing L.G.B.T. rights, including suggesting that same-sex marriage might cause ""societal collapse,"" as his running mate.

Still, Trump's announcement as president that he would block transgender people from serving in the military came as a surprise to Williams. ""It felt like somebody sucker-punched me,"" she said. But many gay conservatives I spent time with played down the importance of Trump's record on transgender rights. ""I think the trans issue gets more attention than it warrants,"" says Jamie Kirchick, a center-right gay writer and visiting fellow at the Brookings Institution who opposed Trump's military ban but who believes ""the gay movement has been overtaken by transgender issues affecting a minuscule percentage of the population."" Rob Smith, the Iraq veteran, channeled the feelings of many gay conservatives I spoke to about transgender rights when he tweeted: ""A 'good' gay in 2018 must: Diffuse his masculinity at all costs. Never question a trans person. Ever.""

The unwillingness of many gay conservatives to prioritize the struggle of transgender people comes as little surprise to Richard Goldstein, a gay former executive editor for The Village Voice who published ""Homocons,"" a scathing book about gay conservatives, 17 years ago. Though Goldstein doesn't view them with the same scorn he once did (he sees their ability to live openly gay lives as proof of ""the gay left's success making it possible for every gay person to be themselves""), he remains disappointed by what he sees as their inability to empathize with marginalized communities. ""These are mostly white gay men who are pretty comfortable and who can't seem to understand that many in the L.G.B.T. community are still not safe and need protection,"" Goldstein said.

That seeming lack of compassion also struck Alexander Chalgren, who for a time was arguably the most famous young Trump supporter in America. The former deputy director of Students for Trump, Chalgren, now a 21-year-old student at Cornell, was featured on a 2016 episode of ""This American Life,"" during which he said that just because he was gay and black didn't mean he had to be a Democrat. But by the time I met Chalgren at CPAC, he had begun to sour on the president. He was particularly disheartened by Trump's reaction to the 2017 white-supremacist marches and violence in Charlottesville and by his transgender military ban, which Chalgren called needlessly cruel. ""I don't have respect for a draft dodger who won't allow other people to serve,"" he told me.

When I talked to Chalgren again in November, he said he had lost all faith in Trump -- and was disgusted by the Republicans' ""complete capitulation"" to him. ""I don't consider myself a Republican anymore,"" he told me. ""I'll be voting for Democrats in 2020.""

Among some L.G.B.T. conservatives there's a contention that Chalgren's experience is rare, and that the real movement is among people -- both straight and gay -- fleeing the Democratic Party, though the only evidence for this is anecdotal. In the 2018 midterms, in fact, 82 percent of L.G.B.T. voters supported their Democratic candidate for the House of Representatives, an increase over the three previous midterm election cycles, according to NBC News exit polling. The same polls show a decline since 2014 in Republican Party identification among L.G.B.T. voters, though the proportion who identify as ""conservative"" has held steady at 14 percent.

A leading proponent of the Democratic-flight theory is Brandon Straka, a gay 41-year-old hairstylist and longtime liberal from New York who became disillusioned with the Democratic Party and announced in a YouTube video last May that he was walking away from it. The #WalkAway hashtag became a sensation on right-wing social media, and Straka organized a #WalkAway march and rally in Washington 10 days before the midterm elections.

I met Straka the morning of the event at the Trump International Hotel; he had come from an appearance on ""Fox & Friends,"" which apparently caught the attention of Trump, who promptly tweeted about the march. Though it was raining, about 500 people (the crowd would later at least quadruple, by my estimate) gathered for a premarch rally at a park. Some came bearing signs. One read ""I never dreamed I'd grow up to be a deplorable, but here I am killing it. #WalkAway,"" while another read ""Not a Bot,"" a reference to reports contending the movement's popularity was inflated by Russian social media accounts and other agents of disinformation.

Many of those in attendance at the premarch rally said they were longtime conservatives -- or ""WalkWiths,"" as they called themselves. But I also met longtime Democrats and formerly ""closeted conservatives,"" people like Lynzee and Michelle Domanico, a married lesbian couple who in 2018 launched The Closet on the Right, a website for ""people living in fear"" of being ""shunned, abandoned and vilified"" for their conservative beliefs. As I spoke with Lynzee and Michelle, another lesbian walked by and said: ""More lesbians for Trump. We love Daddy!""

The most interesting conversation I had that morning was with a married lesbian couple in their 60s who had until recently lived in San Francisco. The quieter of the pair, Jill, seemed surprised and not altogether comfortable that her recent political metamorphosis (from ""San Francisco liberal"" to political independent) had brought her here, only feet from a man holding a sign critical of Planned Parenthood. ""I'm walking away -- I'm just not sure what I'm walking away toward,"" Jill told me. ""I'm not a Democrat anymore, but I'm not ready to embrace Trump or to align myself with Republicans. I'm a Jew, I'm pro-choice. The evangelical wing of the party would keep me away.""

Attending the rally had been the idea of Jill's wife, Ann, who expressed frustration with a contemporary Democratic Party she insists has lost its mind -- and its priorities -- in the Trump era. ""I don't hear any coherent vision for what the Democratic leadership believes in -- most of what I hear is constant demonizing of Trump and his supporters,"" she said. ""I told Jill: 'Let's say I had a MAGA hat on. I wouldn't, but let's say I did. How far do you think I'd get down the street in New York, San Francisco or Berkeley before somebody spit on me or hit me?' That's not my Democratic Party. Old-school Democrats -- we fought for the right of people we disagreed with to be able to speak, even when we thought their positions were offensive and wrong.""

Among the gays and lesbians I spoke with at the rally, there was a prevailing belief that while the L.G.B.T. community's loyalty to the Democratic Party may have made sense in the past, it doesn't now and won't in 2020. As many gay conservatives see it, most L.G.B.T. people are now fully assimilated and are as secure as any other Americans.

Whether L.G.B.T. people feel secure in this country could have profound implications on the future of the community's vote, says Patrick Egan, the N.Y.U. political scientist. He believes that as L.G.B.T. people feel increasingly assimilated, they could go the way of one or the other of two traditionally Democratic constituencies: Jewish voters, who have by and large remained loyal to the Democratic Party as they have assimilated, or non-Hispanic Catholics, who gradually shed their partisanship. He suspects that will depend partly on the degree to which L.G.B.T. people continue to see themselves as outsiders.

Egan notes that marginalized groups can feel insecure even when protected by law, as L.G.B.T. people increasingly are. In a 2015 Washington Post article, he proposed asking ""any legally married gay couple this question: Where do you feel comfortable holding your spouse's hand in public?"" For most gay couples, he suggested, the list of safe places is a short one. Until that changes, Egan suspects L.G.B.T. voting behavior won't.

There's another factor that could curb any meaningful L.G.B.T. migration toward the Republicans. The L.G.B.T. community, Egan says, has been ""deeply infused with the notion of coalitions with other disenfranchised groups. There's a sense among many rank-and-file voters that these fates are linked.""

Egan suspects that's partly why Trump got so little L.G.B.T. support. Longwell, the Log Cabin chairwoman, agrees. ""For many L.G.B.T. people, it didn't matter how positive candidate Trump's posture was on gay issues,"" she says. ""It couldn't compensate for the alarming way Trump talked about women and minority and immigrant communities,"" adding that many L.G.B.T. people are also members of those groups. Though Longwell can envision the day L.G.B.T. young people don't automatically vote Democratic, she told me that will depend on what the Republican Party looks like after Trump. ""I don't believe that the party at this moment is compelling for many young people, gay or straight. In fact, I worry that we're losing a generation.""

In October, Ben Holden sat with three other conservative students at a table in a student center on the campus of Suffolk University behind a banner promoting their chapter of Young Americans for Freedom (Y.A.F.), a national conservative student activist organization.

The four club members were white men, a stark contrast to the diverse students at tables around them. Holden recognized the optics problem while also lamenting that he had to think that way. What you look like shouldn't make your argument any more or less valid, he said: ""Demographics shouldn't be destiny.""

During the hour I sat with the club members, only one person -- a reporter for The Suffolk Voice, the school's online student publication -- stopped to chat with them. ""You guys causing drama?"" the young reporter said with a smile. (Y.A.F. is used to ruffling feathers. In April the group invited Christina Hoff Sommers, a critic of contemporary feminism, to campus.)

""Not enough, unfortunately,"" Holden told her. ""We're just here showing people we're still alive.""

""Oh, they know,"" she said. ""Especially after your little Twitter escapade.""

The reporter was referencing a short video Holden and Y.A.F. posted to Twitter on Oct. 11, National Coming Out Day, during which Holden said he was ""coming out as a conservative."" Almost as an afterthought he added, ""Also, I'm gay. Not that that really matters anymore."" The video drew some outrage on Twitter, with one young woman writing that ""this parasite is mocking a day that was created to spread awareness about a community that is oppressed every single day.""

Despite making the Coming Out Day video, Holden played down the relevance of his sexual orientation to his politics. Most conservatives his age ""couldn't care less that I'm gay,"" he told me. Though he conceded that ""the left is responsible for most of the progress on gay issues,"" he believes that ""now it's more a generational issue than a left vs. right one.""

Holden was keener to discuss his favorite class this semester, ""Fyodor Dostoyevsky and the Great Philosophical Novel."" He said that the course was causing him to re-evaluate his motivations and those of everyone else in the world. It was also making him even more suspicious of conversations (political or otherwise) ""where one or both people have a predetermined conclusion,"" he said.

He reminded me that he's only 23, and that though he leans politically conservative at this moment in his life (and plans to return to CPAC in late February), he doesn't want to be forever wedded to one ideology. ""But we live at a time when you're expected to pick a side, and to stick to it without giving an inch or admitting that the opposing side might not have malicious intent,"" he said. Nearly every time we spoke over the past year, Holden lamented this polarization, which he said had an impact on students on his campus, cable-news commentators and seemingly everyone else. Holden had hoped to put together a ""smart and nuanced"" panel at Suffolk about immigration policy, for example, but he wasn't sure such a thing was possible.

""Trying to engage people in a thoughtful debate about ideas during the Donald Trump era seems like something very few people want to do,"" he said. ""I spend a lot more time thinking about how to exist during this time of political lunacy than I do about being a gay conservative.""",1038075449
46,the new york times,https://www.nytimes.com/reuters/2018/12/18/us/politics/18reuters-usa-congress-budget.html,"WASHINGTON -- The White House said on Tuesday it was searching for ways to unilaterally fund the building of a controversial wall on the U.S.-Mexico border that Congress is balking at, possibly easing chances of a government shutdown this weekend.

White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders told reporters President Donald Trump has asked his Cabinet agencies to ""look and see if they have money that can be used"" to begin building the wall.

Previously, Trump had demanded that Congress approve $5 billion in new funds for the wall that he argues is needed to stop illegal immigrants and drugs from entering through the southwest border.

On Tuesday, Trump said it was too early to say whether a partial government shutdown will be averted by a Friday midnight deadline when existing funds for several agencies expire. ""We'll see what happens,"" he told reporters.

But some Republican senators said they thought the president could be persuaded to sign a bill that does not fund his wall.

Earlier on Tuesday, Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell had proposed a new plan that would have had Congress approve $1 billion in unspecified money that Trump could use to advance his border security priorities.

Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer called it a ""slush fund"" that was promptly rejected.

Democrats, along with some Republicans, oppose the wall as a costly, ineffective border security tool.

Even some Republicans balked at the $1 billion fund. ""I'm not sure I would insist on that,"" Senator Roger Wicker told reporters.

Now, lawmakers could move to a short, stop-gap bill that simply would continue current funding levels for several government agencies until early next year, when a new Congress would grapple with the budget impasse.

""It might be the only route forward considering the time constraints we face,"" said Republican Senator Marco Rubio. Schumer said Democrats would ""very seriously consider"" such a move.

Congress has been trying to approve around $450 billion in funds to keep a variety of federal agencies operating beyond Friday. Included is the Department of Homeland Security, which is responsible for border security.

Failure to agree to new appropriations by that deadline could leave about a quarter of the federal workforce without paychecks and some federal programs shuttered until the impasse is resolved.

Last week, in a heated exchange at the White House with Democratic leaders in Congress, Trump declared he would be ""proud to shut down the government"" if he did not get his demand for $5 billion to build a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.

Trump has demanded $5 billion as a down payment on construction of a wall, which was a key pledge of his 2016 presidential campaign. Trump had originally said Mexico would pay for the wall, but leaders of the United States' southern neighbor have repeatedly said it would not.

It was unclear whether any Cabinet heads would find money in their existing accounts to funnel to a wall, or whether they even had the authority to do so.

Earlier on Tuesday, in an interview with Fox News, Sanders said ""absolutely,"" when asked whether the White House was exploring the use of funds, including from the Defense Department, for the project and whether that would be legal.

But Senate Appropriations Committee Chairman Richard Shelby, a Republican, was less certain.

In response to a reporter's question on whether Trump could order the Pentagon to shift some of its funds to wall construction, Shelby said: ""I don't know about that."" He added, however, that Trump ""does have the power to defend the country"" and ""the power to protect the border.""

Thank you to classes from Beverly, Mass., Danvers, Mass., Hoggard High School and Silverton, Ore., for getting us off to a strong start this year with excellent comments on living without a phone, making career choices, facing rejection and more.

To kick off the new year, in addition to our most popular writing prompts of the week, we're also including a special bonus look at student predictions for 2019. We had so much fun reading them that we couldn't not share them here.

And though we usually only highlight comments from our writing prompts in this feature, this week we also want to acknowledge a class from Massachusetts, who left especially thoughtful responses to our Article of the Day, ""Learning With: 'Heroin Addiction Explained: How Opioids Hijack the Brain.'"" As a student named Ilana wrote, ""I've been told time and time again that opioids are highly addictive. But, that is the only thing I've been told, leaving the crisis of addiction to seem non-applicable to me. I never understood why anyone would take them in the first place but this article shed on light on the 'euphoric first time' [and] helps me understand the driving of force of their addiction.""

Finally, welcome to new classes from Stevens Point, Wis., and Warsaw, Poland. We're so glad to have you.

What Are Your Predictions for 2019?

At the beginning of every new year, we ask students to make predictions about the year ahead. What do they think will happen nationally, globally or locally? What's in store for technology, sports, culture, food, economics and politics? What do they have to look forward to in their own lives?

Only 10 students so far have told us what they think 2019 will hold, but we enjoyed both the range and the specificity so much we're quoting much of what we got. How many of these do you agree with?

2019, according to teenagers

donald trump will be impeached

kansas city chiefs will win the super bowl

5G wifi is goint to be awesome

fortnite will die off

the mc rib with an extra rib will come back

-- Lucas, united states

... This years Stanley Cup final will consist of the Tampa Bay Lightning defeating the Nashville Predators in 6 games.

-- Calvin Mansfield, Danvers, Mass.

2019 will much like 2018, with the same sort of soap opera-esque drama present in 2018. Why should it be any different? The same officials are in the same offices that they had been and since there are no upcoming elections, they have no incentive to change anything.

-- Jake Hession, Hoggard High School, Wilmington, N.C.

I predict in 2019 the fate of Trump's border wall will be decided, there will be a lot of partisanship within Congress, there will be the beginning of another loud election cycle(weird that is has been almost 4 years since I read that Donald Trump was running for president), Chinese smartphone companies will overtake Apple, Pewdiepie will be overtaken by T-series (he dodged a bullet, but still has it coming), Avengers 4 will be a good movie, but it will prove difficult to live up to the giant hype, Kendrick Lamar will release another great album, Terminator 6 is either going to be a major letdown or it will re-vitialize the franchise(either way it is going to be under a lot of pressure, the president in Brazil is going to persecute whoever he wants, while I doubt that country is going to get safer(maybe I'll be wrong), and much much more.

-- Gregory A., NY

I think 2019 will be a year of major technological achievements. I think that electronic-based learning will become more dominate in schools, expanding children's knowledge of technology. I think our society will plunge deeper into mainstream social media, disconnecting younger generations from physical connections with other people. I'm hoping the U.N. will take some major strides to help the refugees displaced due to the raging war in Syria. After recently watching a documentary on it, you can really see how in need these people are and how little attention they get. I believe that more countries around the world will raise awareness to the rising problem in our world's oceans. I believe that there will be more advances made in the productivity in driverless cars, and in faster, easier transportation.

I hope there will be more empathy and understanding of other people's pain, and that 2019 will be a good year for all.

-- Sophie Riley, Beverly, Mass.

Kanye West shall seize power of the US government through a military coup and establish a dictatorship under the tr7e god Kanye West.

Could You Go a Year Without a Smartphone?

In ""In Search of Lost Screen Time,"" Paul Greenberg writes that, in 2018, Americans who owned mobile devices spent a total of $1,380 and 1,460 hours on them. He wonders, if we were to forgo our smartphones in 2019, what else could we do with that money and time?

We posed the question to students: Would they go a year without their phones? Could they? Commenters estimated that they spent anywhere from 30 minutes to 7 hours on their phones each day. Some said they would gladly give up staring at their screens all the time. Others, though, weren't so sure it could be done.

My phone is part of my life

I honestly could not go a year without my smartphone, even though I wish I could. I hate my phone and what it does to my work ethic. It causes way too many distractions, causing me to either not do my work or forget about it ...

A main reason I could not go without my phone is because of communication. My parents like to use an app called Life360 that tracks where I am, so I need my phone with me at all times.I would be fine without social media, it would be good for all of us, but it is one of the only ways I keep track of my friends that go to different schools, make new friends, and make plans.

Homework is also why I could not go without my phone for a year. Sometimes I don't always have my laptop with me, and so I do my work on my phone. I watch the videos we have to watch for math on my phone rather than on my laptop because I find that I pay attention better since my phone isn't sitting off to the side.I believe no one in todays time could go without their phone for a year because now, smartphones are apart of everyone's lives, jobs, schools, and parents all have apps for everything.

-- Evan Barefoot, Hoggard High School

On the average I spend about 7 hours a day on my phone, I will text friends, play games and check my social media. Could I go a year without my phone? No, not at all. I wouldn't know what's going on, i wont be able to text my friends. My phone is what i use to talk to people because its hard for me to talk to someone about my feelings face to face. When I want to hangout with my friends i use my phone, when I'm done doing my chores I go on my phone, I use my phone for music on the bus, when i'm playing my PS3, when i'm doing the dishes, and many more stuff. My phone is part of my life.

I should spend less time on my phone, but ...

Personally I'd say I spend about 1-2 hours on my phone everyday. The majority of the time spent on my phone is on Social Media and Music apps. I think if I wasn't exposed to social media, and had another was of listening to music, I could go a year without a smartphone ...I do think this article persuades me to give up my phone for a year because it showed me all the good I could do for myself and the world. The best examples given were the plant, purify, save, and heal. If I didn't have a smartphone for a year, I would probably spend most of my time reading and growing my knowledge to do better in school and in life and going on adventures around the world.

-- Krystian30, Silverton

The benefits that my phone has on my life is that I can easily get in touch with my friends and I can keep up with what's going on with the world and other peoples life's. Yes I think my phone does have a negative impact on my life. I am a very stressful person and I have heard that your stress levels go up when you use your smartphone. Also no amount of light hitting your eyeballs 1 foot away is good for eyes or your brain. I also tend to get really bad headaches from looking at my phone took much and that's a major problem. Lastly I love my phone and the connection I can get with my friends over it, but I do think I need to spend less time on my phone and enjoy another persons company.

-- leialoha, silverton23

I spend lots of time on my phone. On average maybe 30-40 hours per week. I am trying to cut down on the usage because I know I have more important stuff to do then just staring at my phone. When I heard what we could do to change this, I knew I needed to follow these ...

The benefits to not having a phone, (from my experience) is that you are in a better mood. You do more stuff with people and do more things that are active and healthy for you. I think it's good to drop your phone once in a while to be more open. Open to the world, open to more activities. You are happier when not staring at your phone, and you are more talkative to a person. I think in general we should drop our phones for a week, and just experiment with the fun.

-- Madison2019, Silverton

A year without a phone? I could do it.

The benefits my phone has for my life is that I can stay connected with a lot of my peers around Oregon or my friends at my school. My phone keeps me entertained and helps me contact anyone at any time if its crucial or really important, it also keeps me in reach with my parents so that they know where I am at all times.

But, the negative affects my phone has in my life is that it draws my attention so that whenever I have homework or something really important to do I don't do it because I'm so focused on my phone. I make excuses that I don't have time, but usually I roughly have 2 hours of free time to get all my homework done but instead I just go on my phone. Also, I do many sports and I always use the excuse that school is to hard or that sports are making it difficult but it really is just me choosing that my phone is more important than my education.

So, yes I do think that I could go a year without my cellphone and that it would benefit me to get all the things I need to get done so that I can be successful as I get higher and higher at school.

-- Melia, Silverton23

I probably could go a year without my smartphone because I don't use it that much. It benefits me because if my parents need to contact me or I want to reach my friend, I can with the smartphone. The disadvantages with it are mainly that I don't pay attention to my surroundings when focused on the screen ... If I were to spend a year without my phone I wouldn't really miss it, considering most of my electronics time is spent on my laptop or console, rather then my phone. If I didn't spend any time on electronics however I would probably spend more time with family.

-- Clayton, Silverton

I only spend around 30 minutes on my phone on a daily basis so most of the things said in the article don't really matter as much to me ...I could go a year without my phone because i don't really use it for anything but texting and if i needed i could just talk to people in person. If i didn't have a phone i guess the positive side would be that i wouldn't be tempted to look at a screen constantly.

Would You Pursue a Career If You Knew You Likely Would Not Make Much Money?

In ""Does It Pay to Be a Writer?"" Concepción de León reports that professional writing pays far less than it used to -- barring many aspiring writers from pursuing their dream job. This sad news inspired us to ask students how important money is in their own career aspirations.

The question revealed a deep philosophical split in teenage opinion: while some consider choosing a career just for the money to be a ""death sentence,"" others felt that blindly pursuing one's passion was ""no longer a viable life plan"" in today's economy. Many, however, are planning ahead to try to have it all -- a career they love that also earns enough to pay the bills.

Get real and choose a career that earns a reasonable wage

""Do what you love"" is cute advice for after school activities and hobbies, but when it comes to finding a job, especially in today's economy where real estate prices and the cost of college is getting significantly higher, it becomes necessary to sacrifice a dream job (like being an author) to something with steady pay, even if you do not enjoy it as much.

-- Julie Kee, Danvers, Mass.

While I personally revel in the practice of writing, I bar myself from entering a career as an author or journalist simply because it is no longer particularly financially lucrative as the Amazon business leviathan consolidates its hold over the publishing industry, and the influence of institutions such as newspapers and magazines wanes, a process detailed in Concepción de León's article, ""Does it Pay to Be a Writer?"" In short, careers in creative spheres are no longer a viable life plan. While it is possible to achieve success, the probability of gaining true economic stability is dwindling.

-- Jake Hession, Hoggard High School, Wilmington, N.C.

Our modern marketplace makes it very difficult to pursue certain careers, and insight like ""just do what you love"" teaches nothing but how out of touch a lot of us still are about these issues.

-- Vanessa Ellis, Danvers, Mass.

I would not choose to go in a career if it did not pay well, no matter how much I was interested in it. Ultimately, the most efficient way to promote physical and mental well being is to have money - not in abundance, but a liveable salary is something hard to live without. I feel like the hassle of playing catch-up with bills, payments, etc., would spoil the fun of the interest anyways, since it attracts so many hardships. When thinking about a career, the advice I would give is to think practically. Career advice typically includes something around ""following your passion"" or your interests. But, interests change drastically through time.

-- Emily Whalen, Massachusetts

Do what you love

A job should not just be for a source of income. Your career should give you a sense of fulfillment in what you are doing for the world. I know what I want to do and I am willing to put in my everything to get there. Are you willing?

-- Madison Kelley, Danvers, Mass.

In today's world, not many adults really enjoy their occupation as a part of their ""lifestyle"" or even ""hobbie"". Most of the time, these people are seen walking around miserably on the weekdays, as they are solely focused on reaching the weekend.

However, making not a lot of money comes with sacrifices. I would not be able to live as luxuriously as maybe preferred. I might not be able to have my dream car, or dream house, or dream vacations. Nevertheless, all of these things bought with large amounts of money can only take you so far in life. A ""dream"" car can take you all the same places a mediocre car could, and a ""dream"" house is the same four walls and a roof that a mediocre house could provide. Also, a ""dream"" vacation only lasts for so long, until you must return home. My goal is to have my weekdays be as enjoyable as my weekends because we only live for so long. If that means not making a huge amount of money, so be it.

-- Gabriela Ferullo, Danvers, Mass.

You don't need money to be happy in life, you just need to do something that makes you happy. That's why people work lower-paying careers despite having opportunity to easily make more money. Teachers are another prime example. No one would become a high school teacher based on the amount of money they're going to make, yet there are still enough people who want to be teachers in the world that schools can actually function. This is because people want to be teachers because they're passionate about teaching. If I were offered two jobs -- a job that I would love to do for low pay, and a job that I would absolutely hate for higher pay -- I would take the former.

-- Jack Murray, Danvers, Mass.

Waking up everyday to go to an average 9-5 job that I hate would be a death sentence. I'm only 17 years old, and I am a junior in high school. I really haven't thought about money much in my life, so maybe its a little premature to say that I do not care about it much. However as I sit here an right this, I want to do what I love, and love what I do.

-- Tom Walfield, Danvers, Mass.

I would rather live in a little hut on the water with only what I needed to live, go to work everyday that is something I love to do, and then go back to my little hut and surf.

-- Dan Rossitto, Danvers, Mass.

I look at people who sit behind desks from 8-6, five days a week, counting other people's money, or creating advertisements, looking at a computer screen all day long. And some of them are happy, and like their job. But if I were offered a job like that, even if it were for triple my original salary, I would have to turn it down. We sit behind desks for sixteen or so years, why would anyone want to do that for the rest of their lives.If I'm not doing something I love, I don't try as hard.

-- Madeline Butler, Danvers, Mass.

Can't you have both?

In my family, my single mother used to search endlessly for a job to provide for my sibling and I. Her current job wasn't what she attended university for, but it would be enough for our home and necessities. Looking back at those times, I hope to find a career I love, but within reason. I have a wider scope of understanding that money needs to be made, but I have hopes that the field of journalism is still alive by the time I graduate. I fully intend to pursue what I love and is interesting to me: journalism. By reading this article I am faced with the reality that not everyone makes it into The New York Times or uncovers a scandal like the Spotlight team in 2001. There is still hope that I can write about the major stories of our society and support myself and a future family.

-- Grace Donahue, Danvers, Mass.

I hope to go to college to become a pediatric nurse. The salary of this job was an important part in deciding this career choice. Working with children is something I am passionate about, but the nursing field was chosen based on the salary. I want to be able to support myself and my potential family without struggle.

-- Casey Masterson, Danvers, Mass.

Ever since I first started thinking about what I wanted my job to be when I get out of college, it was always a mixture between what I want to do and how much I get paid for doing it.

From an early age I've wanted to go into the medical field and as I got older my sights have been more focused on physical therapy. I knew that I wanted to be able to help people one way or another and physical therapy had seemed like the perfect fit for me. I want to be able to have a sustainable life while also being able to enjoy it at the same time. Overall, I don't really think that there is a perfect job out there, but I do think that if you choose something that you're good at, enjoy doing, and has a good salary that's fit for you, then you'll be able to lead a good and happy life.

How Well Do You Handle Rejection?

In our most popular Picture Prompt of the week, ""Facing Rejection,"" we asked students to look at the illustration above and reflect on a time they were rejected or failed at something they had worked hard for. How did they handle it? Like the person in the picture? Or with a little more frustration?

They told us stories of heartbreak, humiliation and, ultimately, resilience. Read on to see what advice they have for their future selves and others on how to deal with rejection.

Turn failure into fuel

When I was ten years old I fell in love with soccer. I worked hard and would look forward to every practice. When I was ten though, during tryouts the top ten girls would make an early travel team. This of course, became my big goal. I went to all three days and worked very hard, yet there was some girls who only showed up to two, one, and some who didn't even go. The coaches in the end, picked them. I was the eleventh pick. When my father told me this the day after thanksgiving I was heartbroken. I had worked so hard and tried my best, how could girls who didn't even come to tryouts get in, and not me?

This was when I learned just how strong rejection can make you. I ended up working even harder the next few years to prove that I should not have been the eleventh pick ... Getting rejected when I was young helped me become determined and pushed me to be a better player, a leader, and a better person. To my future self, turn the negative into fuel to do good things and become better. Do not beat yourself up if you don't have your best race, or your best test. Prove to others and to yourself that you are better than what others may believe.

-- Gabrielle Sherrick, Danvers, Mass.

I have faced rejection before. I was a little league baseball player when I was younger and wanted to really badly make the all star team. Sadly, I wasn't accepted to the team and I grew angry because I thought that I was going to make the team for sure. It turns out that this rejection made me realize that hard work and dedication is what you need to put into something that you love to be good at it.

A piece of advice that I would give somebody because of this would be If you think you are the best you could be then push yourself even harder because you can be better than you are already are it will just take commitment. I have told myself many times when I feel like I reached my max potential that I just feel like this, but I could still push myself harder and make it so I am even better than I thought I could be. It changed the way I look at things and how I act in my life.

-- Jacob Stone, United States

Don't take it personally

As an aspiring actress, I have learned that rejection is a part of life. I have been rejected from theaters so many times that it is hard to count at this point, but I feel as if that has built me up to the person I am. When I was younger, I would respond to rejection by going up to my room, locking the door, and just crying for hours straight. I really just wanted to give up. At that age, you truly almost can't control it. Even when I wasn't auditioning, I would still go through these phases when I just felt hopeless ...

For me, trying to look at what I can improve on helps, but even so, there are so many factors that go into casting. From not being the right height to not having the right vocal range, so many things that go into it, and for me, learning to not take it personally is one of the most important things anyone can learn.

-- Sophia Buonanduci, Beverly, Mass.

As a kid who plays three sports, I've been told no and been criticized a lot in my life. When I was younger I was always offended by the answer ""no"" and I saw it as a sign of negativity. I did and still do hold very high standards for myself. The only thing that's changed is how I take the criticism, whether or not it's delivered nicely with a warm and cozy feeling.

When I get the answer ""no"", get criticized, or get a bad grade, I look back on the test I failed or the moment on the field in which I messed up and I do some self reflection. I try to first identify the problem then decide how I can work on and fix that problem. As a matter of fact, now that I know how to take criticizm and no for an answer, I like to have friends and coaches who criticize me more so that I can continue endlessly working and self improving.

-- Ian, Beverly, Mass.

Learn to move on

This situation may not seem like much, but I recall when I was about 8 years old, I had a Lego set that I got for Christmas. It was a star wars set that I had to build by following the instructions, and every time that I got to this one step, the whole thing would fall apart. It was really frustrating going through this process over and over again just to fail repeatedly. Obviously, being only 8 years old, I did not take this well, I would get angry and maybe even throw some of the pieces across the room.

Looking back on it now, I can see that it was silly to be upset over Legos. But I think I did learn how to control my anger, after all of these failures, I started to ease into getting less and less frustrated ...I was able to understand that if you get too frustrated from failure, you will never succeed. For the next time I face rejection, I would tell my future self to pull it together, not to get upset, and move on from that rejection so it doesn't stick with you and drag you down.

48,the guardian,http://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/dec/31/elizabeth-warren-president-democratic-nomination-contenders,"Elizabeth Warren had long been expected to announce a run for the Democratic nomination for president, from the progressive wing of the party. On Monday morning, the Massachusetts senator duly made it official.

The field of confirmed contenders is not yet crowded: the Maryland congressman John Delaney is the best known of those who have already formally pitched in, and he isn't well known at all. But as the saying goes, no US senator ever looked in the mirror and did not see a president gazing back: a positively enormous group of politicians - senators, congressmen and women, governors, mayors - waits in the wings, seasoned with a few business billionaires, all seemingly fancying their chances of taking on Donald Trump and winning the White House back.

Here are 10 of the leading names in the spotlight ... and some of those bubbling under.

Kamala Harris

The junior senator from California is building campaign machinery and has been visiting states that hold their nominating contests early. A former district attorney and state attorney general who has gained national attention for, among other things, her tough questioning of Trump supreme court pick Brett Kavanaugh, Harris is popular among young Democrats in Washington, internships in her office keenly sought and fought for. In a contest in which diversity is sure to play a key role - the party won sweeping House victories in the midterms by standing explicitly against Trumpism and attracting women and minorities - Harris's African American and Indian ancestry could well be as much of a plus as her political fire and skill.

Cory Booker

The first African American senator from New Jersey and a former mayor of the city of Newark has also been building campaign operations and speaking in early voting states. In Iowa in October, the Guardian listened as he warned against ""sedentary agitation"" and received rave reviews from his crowd. In New Hampshire in December, the Guardian watched as Booker tested out a ""moral"" message, avoiding a focus on Trump and telling his audience in Manchester: ""This is not a time to meet hate with hate. It is not a time to meet darkness with darkness. The call of our country has always been love."" In a country bitterly divided by the indignities or otherwise of the Trump presidency, how effective such inspirational speechifying can be will be a fascinating thing to consider.

Kirsten Gillibrand

The junior New York senator, a formidable fundraiser with a strong record on progressive priorities, is openly preparing a run. It has been reported that she is having surprising difficulty in attracting donations because of her role in the resignation of Al Franken, the popular Minnesota senator who faced allegations of sexual misconduct and resigned while heavyweight Republicans facing similar accusations, not least the president himself, stayed in their seats of power. Gillibrand, who arrived in the Senate when Hillary Clinton joined the Obama administration, remains a strong voice at the centre of the Democratic party.

Bernie Sanders

It pays to remember that Sanders isn't actually a Democrat: an independent, self-proclaimed democratic socialist senator from Vermont, his run for the 2016 nomination against Clinton was a genuine surprise, an insurgency that gathered momentum, perhaps damaged the favourite and, at least in hindsight, seems to have offered clear signs of what the party was missing in the post-industrial states which flipped for Trump, handing him the presidency in the electoral college despite a beating in the popular vote. Sanders is now a progressive figurehead but also a Washington veteran used to how it all works. Some think that at 77, he's too much a veteran. But Trump is 72, which suggests that these days, age is just a number.

Joe Biden

Barack Obama's vice-president was a long-term Delaware senator before he went to the White House and is a Mount Rushmore-sized figure in the Democratic party. He has openly flirted with a run and gleefully engaged Trump in rather undignified arguments about who could beat up whom, perhaps showing in doing so the popular touch that has him leading early polls in important places like Iowa. On the downside, such leads may simply be down to name recognition, his status as the embodiment of the white, male party establishment may now not be the bonus of old, and by inauguration day in 2021, Biden will be 78. He has also run twice for president before, in 1988 and 2008. Neither ended well.

Sherrod Brown

An intriguing Senate outsider, the Ohioan won re-election in November as Republicans dominated his Trump-voting state, partially as a result of openly proclaiming his ""populist"" bent. No president has won the White House without Ohio since Kennedy, a fact regularly trotted out in lists such as these, but Brown's appeal to blue-collar voters should not be taken lightly and is part of regular talk-show discussions about whether or not he'll run. He has some of the rumpled, outsiderish charm of Sanders, a factor which may or may not have informed Clinton's consideration of him for her VP pick. He's also not particularly well known nationally, which may have counted against him then and may do again this time. Similar things could be said, bar the bit about being rumpled, about the Minnesota senator Amy Klobuchar, another who shone in grilling Kavanaugh and who has admitted she's thinking about a run.

Beto O'Rourke

The soon-to-be former congressman from El Paso is leaving Congress because he relinquished his House seat to challenge liberal bogeyman Ted Cruz for his seat in the Senate. O'Rourke lost, more narrowly than might be expected in such a deep-red state as Texas, yes, but all the same a defeat, something Trump has been quick to highlight as presidential talk swirls. A former punk rocker with a common touch and a half-Spanish, half-Irish name - which he has had to defend from allegations of seeking unearned authenticity - O'Rourke is also, by current Democratic standards and not surprisingly given his coming from Texas, something of a centrist prone to voting with Republicans. On the left of the party, that is attracting rising approbation.

Julian Castro

A former mayor of San Antonio and a Housing and Urban Development secretary under Obama, the Texan twin of congressman Joaquin Castro was another touted as a possible running mate for Clinton. Like O'Rourke, he is relatively young and could conceivably enter VP territory this time around. He has said he is exploring a run and will announce either way in January. If successful, he would be the first Hispanic nominee for president. A charismatic speaker, his moves will be worth watching, though he remains an outsider for now.

Michael Bloomberg

The billionaire former New York mayor is openly considering a run, which he could obviously fund formidably, has registered as a Democrat and has been visiting early voting states. Driven by the need for the US to assemble a coherent plan to tackle climate change, he has had little difficulty ranging himself against the coal-friendly, regulation-ripping president. On Sunday, Bloomberg told NBC he will make climate change a leading issue in the 2020 race, whether or not he runs. He might not be the only billionaire to do so: Tom Steyer is funding ads demanding Trump's impeachment while he decides whether to pitch in, while even the Dallas Mavericks-owning, rugby-loving Mark Cuban has said he's considering a go. The former Starbucks chief Howard Schultz also seems to fancy his chances. Oprah Winfrey, alas, has said she is out.

Eric Garcetti

Garcetti, son of Gil, the harassed district attorney in The People vs OJ Simpson, is the man in charge of Los Angeles, the biggest city in the most populous state that is now almost all-blue, a bastion of progressive policies - not least in the face of the frightening effects of climate change - and fierce opposition to Trump. A run from such a platform could be interesting. There are other mayors and ex-mayors out there: from New York could come Bill de Blasio, a Clinton ally whose view of himself as a national figure angers some in his city, while from New Orleans may come Mitch Landrieu, his centrist reputation burnished by his sure handling of controversy over the city's Confederate past and statues. From South Bend, Indiana, meanwhile, there is Pete Buttigieg: young, gay, progressive, determined, from the Rust Belt and quite likely not a strong candidate this time around at least.

And the rest...

As mentioned, the Maryland congressman John Delaney has declared his bid for the Democratic nomination. So, as it happens, has Andrew Yang, an entrepreneur from New York state, and Richard Ojeda, a military veteran who lost a bid for Congress in West Virginia.

Everyone else is either discussing the issue with their wife/family/loved ones/pets, exploring it actively or not, considering it or archly refusing to comment. Among senators there is also Jeff Merkley of Oregon, a progressive stalwart. Eric Holder, Obama's attorney general, hasn't ruled it out; nor has John Kerry, a former Massachusetts senator, the 2004 Democratic nominee against George W Bush and Obama's second secretary of state.

The Ohio congressman Tim Ryan has said he is interested, as has the Hawaii representative Tulsi Gabbard. The media has enjoyed talking up Stacey Abrams, beaten narrowly in a controversial Georgia gubernatorial election this year, and Andrew Gillum, narrow loser in a similarly nasty fight for the governorship in Florida. Among governors and former governors, Steve Bullock, of the otherwise resolutely red state of Montana, seems to be very interested; so does John Hickenlooper of Colorado, a cross-party pal of John Kasich, the Ohio Republican who looks set to primary Trump. Former Maryland governor and 2016 candidate Martin O'Malley told the Guardian he was thinking about another run; former Virginia governor Terry McAuliffe, a pillar of the party and former Clinton fundraiser, all but told CNN he was in on Sunday.

That, believe it or not, is not everyone. But one more name seems worth a mention. Some allies and aides have said Hillary Clinton might consider a third run for the White House. No, really.",1030091648
49,the guardian,http://www.theguardian.com/environment/2019/jan/16/andrew-wheeler-climate-change-trump-epa-hearings,"A former coal lobbyist Donald Trump has nominated to run the Environmental Protection Agency on Wednesday touted rolling back pollution standards and declined to identify climate change as a crisis requiring unprecedented action from the US.

Andrew Wheeler, the deputy administrator who took over when his predecessor Scott Pruitt resigned after months of controversy, said in his confirmation hearing that he is carrying out the president's ""regulatory reform agenda"". Wheeler called the US the ""gold standard for environmental progress"".

Protesters interrupted Wheeler's remarks, with two escorted out by security and more chanting outside: ""Shut down Wheeler, not the EPA."" Most EPA staffers are furloughed and all but the agency's most critical functions are on hold as the partial government shutdown continues.

Democrats said Wheeler's policies have been as damaging to the environment as Pruitt's, just without the high-profile scandals.

Although Wheeler is likely to be confirmed, they sought to pin him down on climate change, in a show of how the environment could become a top issue in the 2020 presidential race.

The Vermont senator Bernie Sanders said it was Wheeler's job to lead on climate, noting that some Republican senators do not believe humans are causing rising temperatures.

Asked if he agreed with the president's past statements that climate change is a Chinese ""hoax"", Wheeler said he would ""not use the hoax word, myself"".

But Wheeler said he would ""not call it the greatest crisis"".

""I consider it a huge issue that has to be addressed globally,"" Wheeler added.

Wheeler also told the New Jersey senator Cory Booker, a likely presidential contender, that he is ""still examining"" a November report from US government scientists showing the country will suffer from heat-related deaths, coastal flooding and infrastructure damage.

Booker said Wheeler's regulatory changes ""fly in the face"" of that science, and the Massachusetts senator Ed Markey called it ""unacceptable"" that Wheeler would seek confirmation without being familiar with the report.

Wheeler has said the report was based on the ""worst-case scenario"", although the analysis considered what might happen if emissions slow down or continue to grow.

Wheeler's predecessor, Pruitt, frequently questioned climate science but ultimately resigned not because of his policies but because months of reporting revealed he rented a condo from lobbyists, spent millions on security and travel and asked aides to help his wife get a job.

Republicans defended Wheeler, saying he had been unfairly vilified for his industry experience and was rewriting regulations that the EPA did not have the authority to propose.

The panel's Republican chairman, John Barrasso of Wyoming, asked Wheeler how the EPA will help support technology to reduce greenhouse gas pollution from fossil fuels.

""One thing that's important on a regulatory side is that we don't try to tip the scale one way or another on, for example, energy sources."" Wheeler said.

Wheeler is easing a rule that would have effectively required any new coal plants to capture carbon. He is also replacing carbon standards for the current power fleet with far weaker efficiency goals for coal plants.

Wheeler was a lobbyist at Faegre Baker Daniels, where he represented coal company Murray Energy until August 2017. Murray Energy wrote the administration a list of rule changes that would help the industry, and they are largely under way.

Wheeler is recused from certain interactions with his former employers, but he is coordinating rollbacks that benefit coal companies, including on climate change rules and the legal findings that underpin restrictions on toxic mercury pollution.

Senator Kevin Cramer, a North Dakota Republican, defended Wheeler's background, saying that no one would prevent a banker from running the Federal Reserve or a doctor from leading the health department.",1041989872
