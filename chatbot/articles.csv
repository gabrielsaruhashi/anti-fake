0,the new york times,"WASHINGTON -- Hours after he was sworn in as America's 45th president, Donald J. Trump and his wife, Melania, swayed together to a rendition of the Frank Sinatra classic ""My Way,"" as hundreds of their wealthiest and most influential supporters held aloft smartphones to capture the Trumps' first dance following the inauguration.

Serhiy Kivalov, a Ukrainian lawmaker known for pro-Russian initiatives, took photos of the dance, as well as of his coveted tickets and passes to the soiree where it took place, the Liberty Ball at the Walter E. Washington Convention Center, posting them on Facebook and declaring that ""it was an honor"" to attend.

He was one of at least a dozen Ukrainian political and business figures who made their way to Washington for the inauguration, several of whom attended the Liberty Ball. Most had more on their dance cards than just parties.

They attended meetings and orchestrated encounters at Trump International Hotel with influential Republican members of Congress and close allies of President Trump. Representing a range of views, including a contingent seen as sympathetic to Moscow, they positioned themselves as brokers who could help solve one of the thorniest foreign policy problems facing the new administration -- the ugly military stalemate between Russia and Ukraine and the tough sanctions imposed on Moscow following its seizure of Crimea.

The transition of power in Washington attracted officials and business executives from around the world seeking entree and influence with the new administration. While many parties and other gatherings during that period were open to anyone, packages for more exclusive events organized by Mr. Trump's presidential inaugural committee started at $25,000 for two tickets to one of the official black tie balls and other events, according to a brochure listing inaugural committee ""underwriter benefits.""

Evidence of the Ukrainians' presence eventually prompted interest from the special counsel, Robert S. Mueller III, as he investigated Russian interference in the 2016 election, and has spawned a number of related inquiries by federal prosecutors. The investigations are playing out against growing indications that some of the Ukrainians who came to Washington for the inaugural, or their allies, were promoting grand bargains, or ""peace"" plans, that aligned with Russia's interests, including by lifting sanctions.

Such a deal would not just have given the new administration additional flexibility to bring Moscow into American diplomatic efforts in the Middle East, but could also have eased the way for a cast of characters with ties to Mr. Trump -- some of whom in turn had ties to the Ukrainians who came to Washington -- to move ahead on business deals that had been complicated by the sanctions.

Federal prosecutors have asked witnesses about how some of the Ukrainians gained access to inauguration events, whom they met with while they were in the United States, and what they discussed -- including questions about various peace plan proposals -- according to people with direct knowledge of the questions and others who were briefed on the interviews.

As recently as last month, prosecutors were asking witnesses about illegal foreign lobbying related to Ukraine. Another subject of questions has been whether foreigners from Ukraine and other countries used straw donors to disguise donations to the inaugural committee. Federal law prohibits foreigners from contributing to an inaugural committee, although they can attend events if Americans buy the tickets.

Elements of the investigations have gotten new visibility in recent weeks.

Lawyers for Paul Manafort, the former Trump campaign chairman who was paid tens of millions of dollars over the last dozen years by Russia-aligned Ukrainian interests, inadvertently revealed on Tuesday that he had communicated about a Ukraine-Russia peace plan with a business associate believed to have ties to Russian intelligence.

The associate, Konstantin V. Kilimnik, is a Russian citizen who has been charged by Mr. Mueller with obstruction of justice for trying to shape the testimony of witnesses to the events that led to charges of illegal foreign lobbying against Mr. Manafort.

Mr. Kilimnik was said in the inadvertently disclosed portions of the court filing to have received political polling data from Mr. Manafort in 2016. Mr. Manafort relayed a request to have Mr. Kilimnik pass the polling data to two Ukrainian oligarchs who had arranged or provided financing for Russia-aligned Ukrainian political parties for which Mr. Manafort had worked. One of the oligarchs, Serhiy Lyovochkin, attended the Liberty Ball, according to one person familiar with the guest list and another who saw him there.

Last month, prosecutors made a move that was seen as signaling the continuing cooperation of Sam Patten, an American consultant who had worked with Mr. Kilimnik and Russia-aligned Ukrainians looking to build ties to the Trump administration.

Mr. Patten had pleaded guilty in late August to charges including funneling $50,000 in money from an unnamed foreigner who matched the description of Mr. Lyovochkin but was described in court papers only as ""a prominent Ukraine oligarch"" to buy tickets to exclusive Trump inauguration events for the oligarch, Mr. Kilimnik and someone described only as ""another Ukrainian.""

Other Ukrainians who came to Washington during the inauguration said prosecutors had been asking wide-ranging questions.

""I have been interrogated twice by the F.B.I. and Mr. Mueller,"" said Andrii V. Artemenko, who came to the inauguration as a Ukrainian member of Parliament bearing a peace proposal that was later criticized as pro-Russian.

Mr. Artemenko said he had testified before Mr. Mueller's grand jury last summer and had answered questions from the Mueller team ""about what is my purpose of this trip, how I can get there, and what I did, how I got invitations and tickets and stuff.""

On Capitol Hill, investigators from the House Oversight Committee, now under Democratic control, are looking into Michael T. Flynn, Mr. Trump's first national security adviser, who was a central player in the effort to build a new relationship with President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia.

How active a role Mr. Flynn played in the discussions about a peace plan for Ukraine is unclear, but congressional investigators have been pursuing whether he or his former business partners might have gained financially if the sanctions on Russia were ended.

The committee, whose chairman is Representative Elijah E. Cummings of Maryland, is continuing to pursue its investigation of Mr. Flynn's business dealings and ""his potential misuse of his public position when he was national security adviser,"" a committee spokeswoman said.

In 2017, a whistle-blower told committee investigators that Mr. Flynn had mentioned to a business associate around the time of the inauguration that the Russia sanctions would be ""ripped up"" as one of the administration's first acts. Mr. Flynn believed that ending the sanctions could allow a business project he had once participated in to move forward, according to the whistle-blower.

Mr. Flynn had been part of a business venture to partner with Russia to build nuclear power plants in the Middle East until June 2016, but after his direct involvement ended, he remained close with people involved in the project.

In a December 2017 letter to the Oversight Committee, an officer of the company that hired Mr. Flynn as an adviser on the project, ACU Strategic Partners, said that the allegations of the whistle-blower were ""false and unfounded.""

Mr. Flynn subsequently intersected with one of the Ukrainian efforts to resolve the problems with Russia.

Mr. Artemenko, the former Ukrainian lawmaker, said in an interview that he did not attend any inaugural balls or other events that required paid tickets. Instead, he said he watched Mr. Trump's inaugural address, which was free, and met with various Republicans to discuss his peace plan, which would have lifted sanctions against Russia and which he said had some support from the Kremlin.

Days after the inauguration, Mr. Artemenko traveled to New York to discuss his peace plan with Michael D. Cohen, who was then Mr. Trump's lawyer, and a former business partner of the president's, Felix H. Sater, who had helped Mr. Trump scout deals in Russia. Mr. Cohen subsequently hand-delivered the peace plan to Mr. Flynn a week before Mr. Flynn was forced to resign after being caught lying about his own discussion of sanctions with the Russian ambassador.

Within days of the inauguration, the White House made inquiries to the State Department and Congress about what might be required to ease the sanctions. Resetting relations with the Russian government and Mr. Putin had been central to Mr. Trump's foreign policy approach during the campaign, the transition and the first days of the new administration, and it is unclear what role, if any, the back-channel Ukrainian entreaties might have played.

The official inquiries about an abrupt policy shift set off alarms at the State Department and in Congress.

""I heard from various sources that there was a plan to summarily lift sanctions on Russia,"" said Daniel Fried, a veteran diplomat who stayed on for the first several weeks of the Trump administration as the State Department's coordinator for sanctions policy. ""I was approached by people who were nervous that the United States was about to do something irretrievably stupid.""

Several other officials, some of whom would speak only on the condition of anonymity, also recalled jarring questions from the new National Security Council under Mr. Flynn, including whether Ukraine was really part of Russia and whether Crimea wanted to be part of Russia.

Even among Republicans, the idea of easing sanctions found little support. ""If there's any country in the world that doesn't deserve sanctions relief, it's Russia,"" Senator Mitch McConnell, the majority leader, said in an interview with Politico a week after the inauguration.

By March 2017, the White House's sanctions relief trial balloon had wilted amid opposition from congressional leaders.

But that has not stopped the prosecutorial scrutiny of those pushing plans to lift the sanctions around the inauguration, and their roles in prospective business deals that might have benefited from the lifting of the sanctions.

Mr. Cohen has pleaded guilty to a number of charges, including lying to congressional investigators about negotiations to build a Trump skyscraper in Moscow. While Mr. Cohen had initially echoed Mr. Trump's claim that talks about the Moscow project had ended before the 2016 presidential campaign, Mr. Cohen admitted in his guilty plea that they extended into the summer of 2016.

By then, Russia was engaged in a surreptitious hacking and social media campaign to bolster Mr. Trump, who was publicly pressing for warmer relations with Russia, including signaling a willingness to consider lifting sanctions.

The sanctions posed a potential obstacle for the Trump Tower Moscow project, in which Mr. Sater, who is Russian-American, had positioned himself as a key player. Mr. Sater and Mr. Cohen discussed financing from two Russian banks, VTB and GenBank, but the sanctions prohibited American citizens and companies from doing business with either of them, according to reporting by The New York Times and BuzzFeed.

Another prominent businessman who had worked with Mr. Trump years earlier to try to erect a Trump building in Moscow, the Ukrainian-Russian developer Pavel Fuks, also was in Washington for the inauguration.

Mr. Fuks, who has since fallen out of favor in Moscow and was placed under sanctions by the Kremlin, stayed at Trump International Hotel, and spent time with Vitaliy Khomutynnik, a businessman and parliamentarian who had been a member of the Russia-aligned party for which Mr. Manafort worked. Mr. Fuks and Mr. Khomutynnik talked with Representatives Kevin McCarthy and Ed Royce, both influential California Republicans at the time.

Mr. Khomutynnik's party posted photos of him with the congressmen on Facebook, and suggested that he extracted assurances that American-Ukrainian relations would grow stronger under Mr. Trump, without detailing any specific policy discussions.

Mr. McCarthy's office said that the encounter was random, and that the conversation was brief and perfunctory, and noted that Mr. McCarthy has supported sanctions against Russia.

In Ukraine, a parliamentarian affiliated with the president, Petro Poroshenko, who is generally regarded as pro-Western, accused rival politicians of paying as much as $200,000 for inaugural tickets.

Mr. Kivalov, the Ukrainian lawmaker who posted photos of the Trumps' dance, did not respond to requests for comment about how he got his tickets to the Liberty Ball. Borislav Bereza, a Ukrainian lawmaker who posted a photo of himself in a tuxedo at the ball, said he got his tickets free from someone ""connected to Illinois,"" though he said, ""I don't remember for sure.""

He attributed the claims about Ukrainians' paying for tickets to jealousy from those who were not invited, and in a Facebook post he characterized the ball as ""a place where, over a glass of champagne, you are introduced to people who have influence in the new administration of the White House. These are the traditions of the United States.""",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/10/us/politics/ukraine-donald-trump-inauguration.html
1,the new york times,"LANSING, Mich. -- On both sides of Lake Michigan this month, Republican-dominated legislatures pushed forward measures aimed at hamstringing Democrats who will take over their statehouses in January. On the Wisconsin side, Gov. Scott Walker shrugged at accusations of dirty politics and partisan overreach and signed them into law.

In Michigan, all eyes are on Gov. Rick Snyder.

A term-limited Republican, Governor Snyder is hardly beloved by the legislature's Democrats. But as a lame-duck legislative session draws to a close this week, he has become their best hope to halt an unprecedented effort by Republican lawmakers to lock their priorities into place before Democrats take over the governor's office and other major state offices next month.

With the session set to end on Thursday, Republicans already have sent legislation to Mr. Snyder that would make it much more difficult for executive-branch agencies to issue regulations that are stricter than federal ones.

Michigan Republicans are expected to take up bills this week to strip campaign-finance regulation authority from the new Democratic secretary of state, give the legislature an unchallenged voice in lawsuits overseen by the new Democratic attorney general, and prevent Democratic officials from forcing nonprofit political advocacy groups to disclose who bankrolls their campaigns.

In a state whose political traditions might be called radically moderate -- George Romney and William Milliken are famous examples of Republican governors who bent over backward in search of compromises -- the legislature's moves are unsettling to some members of both parties.

Some Democrats say it is no accident that the three state offices targeted by the male-dominated legislature will all be occupied by women in January. The state's incoming Democratic governor, Gretchen Whitmer, is a former Senate minority leader; the new attorney general, Dana Nessel, is a Detroit lawyer and LGBTQ activist. Jocelyn Benson, an associate law professor, will become secretary of state.

Republican leaders in the House and Senate, who did not respond to requests for interviews, have called the chambers' actions politics as usual, albeit bare-knuckled. Yet even some veteran Republicans say the moves, which echo similar power plays by Republican lawmakers in Wisconsin and North Carolina, shatter the old notion that losing parties should cede power gracefully.

[Read: Wisconsin's Scott Walker Signs Bills Stripping Powers From Incoming Governor]

""The political DNA is this country has changed so dramatically that if you're in control, you're going to use it to the utmost and beyond,"" said Kenneth R. Sikkema, a Republican consultant who held leadership positions in both the State Senate and House.

Governor Snyder already has signed other lame-duck bills that have infuriated his critics, including two that contain increases in the minimum-wage and in paid sick leave that the legislature itself had enacted this summer. Republicans passed the bills to shortcut citizen initiatives that would have placed the issues on the November ballot..

Mr. Snyder has not tipped his hand on his views of legislation that would curb his successors' power.

""People should not expect that I'm just going to sign things or I'm just going to veto things,"" he said at an end-of-term news conference last week. ""If I believe it's in the best public-policy interest of the state, I'll sign it, and if it's not, I won't.""

He dodged questions about whether Republicans were being overzealous in their rush to cripple incoming Democrats, but suggested that lack of comity was not confined to his party. ""I think there's a civility issue across the board,"" he said, taking an apparent swipe at the crowds that have jammed the state capitol to protest the legislature's actions. ""One of the ways people are trying to convince me why I should veto bills or be against them is to come yell at me. I'm not sure that I follow the logic of it.""

The governor's depiction of himself as a policy wonk who is above petty politics is vintage Snyder, but it is not without support.

Mr. Snyder is measurably less partisan and conservative than the legislature's Republican majority. He has been comparatively uninvolved in the state Republican Party organization, and refused to endorse Donald J. Trump for president in 2016. This year he even refused to back the Republican candidate for governor, attorney general Bill Schuette, a Trump supporter whose high-profile investigation of the Flint water crisis led to criminal charges against members of Mr. Snyder's administration, including his health secretary.

Mr. Snyder also has rankled Republican lawmakers with vetoes of pet measures large and small, from issuing anti-abortion license plates to allowing concealed firearms in places like day-care centers and sports arenas to an article of partisan Republican faith, stiffening the state's voter ID requirements.

The bills coming to his desk now are no less politically freighted, the product of Republican legislators who moved rightward under Tea Party leadership early this decade, then lurched more sharply to the right after the 2016 election.

Michigan voters seemed to take issue with that in November, electing Democrats to the top three state offices over opponents aligned with Mr. Trump.

They also overwhelmingly approved a trio of ballot initiatives with broad Democratic support. One legalized recreational marijuana use; two others overhauled election laws to make it easier to vote and shifted redistricting authority from the legislature to a new nonpartisan citizens' commission.

To its critics, the legislature is effectively using the lame-duck session to settle scores with both voters who refused to elect Republicans and the Democrats they chose.

One bill passed by the state House targets future ballot initiatives, imposing complex rules on petitions that would make it far harder to collect signatures required to bring an issue before voters.

Other bills place so-called implementing requirements on the citizens' redistricting commission and the new voting measure that the measures' supporters say are unnecessary and potentially harmful.

But it is the proposals to rein in executive powers that have drawn the most attention.

""These guys have never not been in power. They've had all three branches of government the whole time they've been here,"" said James Ananich, a Democratic senator from Flint who is the chamber's minority leader. ""They can't grasp that the things they've been doing, most people don't like, and so there's got to be some way to protect the state from these horrible Democrats.""

Such objections are naïve, say some Republicans.

""Is it partisan? I don't think there's any doubt about that,"" said Robert LaBrant, a Republican strategist, who defended the constitutionality of the measures.

""I wish we could conduct public policy under sterile lab conditions,"" he said. ""But we're probably back to the 1880s as far as extreme partisanship goes.""",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/17/us/rick-snyder-bill-whitmer.html
2,the new york times,"Two weeks after Hillary Clinton accepted the Democratic presidential nomination in Philadelphia, beaming through a hail of gigantic balloons, her campaign's ""Latinos con Hillary"" program began in five cities in Virginia. One of the kickoff parties took place at Todos Supermarket in Prince William County, in a modest white room where about 40 people gathered around three tables draped in cheap blue cloth to hear a speech by Clinton's national Latino-vote director, Lorella Praeli. When she was 2, Praeli, now 28, lost one of her legs in a car accident, but with her crutches, she commanded the room more adroitly than any of the speakers who preceded her, moving among the tables as she rallied her troops. Though the party was advertised on Facebook, most of the men and women in attendance were seasoned Democratic politicians, staff members and volunteers.

""I'm not here to make it pretty,"" Praeli said. ""The work ahead of us, the task and challenge ahead of us for the next what -- 96 days -- is huge."" She ticked through the efforts needed to register and turn out Latinos: knocking on doors, hosting phone-bank parties, convincing friends, haunting markets, teaching Spanish-speakers the how and the when and the where of voting. In her speech, the job sounded herculean. Near the end of her pitch, she asked everyone to stand and feel the energy in the room while they said, in Spanish, ""We will be the difference.""

""I want you to say it and to believe it,"" Praeli instructed. ""I want you to say it and to commit yourself."" She smiled, but these were marching orders. ""If we don't believe it, other people won't believe,"" Praeli said in Spanish. ""If we don't believe it in this room, we won't be the difference in November.""

Latinos have been hearing that they will be the difference for decades. In Spanish-language media this year, the rhetoric around the election has often gone so far as to imply that Latinos will decide the result on their own. Telemundo's election coverage runs under the slogan ""Yo Decido,"" ""I Decide."" The Univision news anchor Jorge Ramos told The Times last year that ""the new rule in American politics is that no one can make it to the White House without the Hispanic vote.""

It's true enough that 800,000 Latinos turn 18 every year, and both parties burn millions of dollars trying to woo Hispanic voters. This year, 27 million will be eligible to vote. But the idea of a fearsome Latino political power remains more myth than reality. Journalists have been writing about the so-called ""sleeping giant"" of Hispanic voters since at least the 1970s, but the fact is that voter turnout among Latinos remains dismal. It can run almost 20 percentage points lower than that of African-Americans and non-Hispanic whites. Exactly the same percentage of eligible Latinos, 48 percent, showed up for Romney versus Obama in 2012 as turned out for Bush versus Dukakis in 1988. While the raw number of Latino ballots cast has tripled since 1998, so has the number of Latino citizens who don't vote. Only once in the past 28 years, during the 1992 match among George H.W. Bush, Bill Clinton and Ross Perot that spurred a jump in overall turnout, has Latino turnout exceeded 50 percent. More often than not, ""Yo Decido"" to stay home.

This year, the new spin on the old dream is that Donald Trump will finally shake the giant awake. He opened his campaign last summer by calling Mexican immigrants ""rapists,"" has repeatedly proclaimed that he will build a wall between Mexico and the United States and, until recently, has made the deportation of 11 million undocumented immigrants a cornerstone of his platform. As early as September 2015, Javier Palomarez, the president and chief executive of the U.S. Hispanic Chamber of Commerce, told Politico: ""I think the greatest thing to ever happen to the Hispanic electorate is a gentleman named Donald Trump. He has crystallized the angst and anger of the Hispanic community."" He added, ""I think we can all rest assured that Hispanics can turn out in record numbers.""

Perhaps. But achieving record turnout for a demographic with a lackluster voting history isn't so simple as watching them take themselves to the polls. In June, Mi Familia Vota and the National Council of La Raza, two nonprofit groups devoted to organizing Latinos, warned that they needed more cash to match their voter registration numbers from 2012. In July, the Pew Research Center noted that ""Hispanic voters lag all registered voters on several measures of engagement"" -- they aren't paying attention to election news as closely as other citizens and they aren't thinking about the election as much. At a conference on the Hispanic vote held in New York City in January, the big unanswered question was ""Why have Latinos never really turned out in force?""

Looking for answers, I spent six months interviewing scores of Latinos in Virginia, a battleground state where the Latino share of the population has more than tripled since 1990. I met with Latino Catholics, Pentecostals and Mormons, with legal residents, citizens and undocumented immigrants. I frequented a church and a community center, soccer fields and a dance club. I lurked around Republican and Democratic events and a skateboard park. I interviewed custodians and construction workers, lawyers and real estate agents, restaurant owners and community organizers, college students and political staffers. In all, I spoke with more than 100 Virginians of various ethnic backgrounds.

For all the energy that activists, especially on the Democratic side, have put into turning out the Latino vote, I met strikingly few Latinos outside the upper-middle class who talked about voting as if it were something they did regularly. The exceptions tended to be people like Lucía Rodriguez, 61, who cleans houses and has voted regularly for more than a decade -- even in 2008 after she and her husband, a custodian, saw all their savings vanish in the mortgage crisis. For years afterward, they scrambled to keep their family afloat, working every available hour. Yet she kept on voting. Why? ""It's a civic duty,"" she said. Rodriguez explained that in Bolivia, where she had been an accountant, she learned the habit of voting because nonvoters could be penalized with fines. In her Mormon church in the United States, she was surrounded by friends who voted. To pass her citizenship test, she had to study American government and learn English. Her voting behavior entailed years of effort and experience. Through all my conversations, I began to fear that the real roots of political engagement, which lie not in quadrennial outreach programs but around dinner tables and in churches and classrooms, are far more absent from Latino life in America than most people understand.

""A person on the fence needs to be activated to turn into a voter,"" Marvin Figueroa, 30, said one humid Friday in July as he stood before a crowd of white-collar professionals at a ""Happy Hour for Hillary."" These borderline voters, he said, often need ""13 touches"" -- calls, door knocks, texts, etc. -- before they would turn out. Figueroa is Clinton's political director for Virginia. His spreadsheets contain not only Latinos but also African-Americans, millennials and Muslims: any constituent group that might be pulled into a pro-Clinton coali­tion. This evening, inside the Arlington home of a defense contractor who turned Democrat after the Tea Party swept into Congress in 2010, the audience was mostly female, mostly Caucasian and only marginally Latino. The doors to the screened-in porch were open; the air-conditioning was off; the margarita machine was on. The Spanish speakers blended into the crowd.

Statistically, the Latinos most likely to cast ballots are almost identical to other reliable American voters. They are over 40. They've lived in the United States for at least 20 years. They are Puerto Ricans and Cuban-Americans with long cultural histories of citizenship. They are college graduates.

The Latinos least likely to vote represent a different demographic slice altogether. They are under 30, single and Mexican-American. Their families earn less than $50,000 a year. They may not have completed high school.

Data capsules like these suggest that the Latino vote is simply hamstrung by the same factors that impede the Election Day turnout of all Americans: poverty, youth, lack of schooling. Political scientists showed long ago that voting goes hand in glove with affluence and education. Generally speaking, the wealthier you are, the more degrees you earn, the more likely you are to turn out. But if these were the only relevant factors, Latino voting would most likely rise naturally over time as more Latinos enrolled in college and as the age of the average American-born Latino increased. (In 2012 their average age was 18.)

Causality unravels, however, when you start picking at the numbers. Take income, for example. While nearly a quarter of Latinos live in poverty, as a group they are slightly better off than African-Americans. Yet in 2012, African-Americans had the highest turnout rates in the nation. They, not Latinos, have arguably been the decisive bloc in our last two presidential contests and in this year's Democratic primary. So poverty alone can't explain the weak Hispanic vote.

Youth and education also prove to be red herrings. Hispanics are America's youngest and least-educated major racial or ethnic group. Nearly a third of foreign-born Latinos never reached ninth grade. Some have never had a day of schooling in their lives. But if age and learning were the decisive catalysts, we would expect to find the highest voter turnout among Asian-Americans, who are our second-oldest and best-educated group. More than half of Asian-Americans hold bachelors degrees. Yet Asian-Americans tend to vote at even lower rates than Latinos. In 2012, 53 percent of their eligible voters did not go to the polls.

So what do Asians and Hispanics, two vastly different groups in terms of age, education and culture, have in common? It's obvious once you look for it: For the past 30 years, most of America's immigrants have arrived from Asia and Latin America. Both groups struggle with English. Roughly a third of Hispanic adults and a 10th of Hispanic children say that they cannot speak English ""very well."" Among Asians, the numbers are similar.

The American political system once efficiently trained immigrants in how to pull electoral levers. For all their flaws, urban political machines like Tammany Hall did an extraordinary job of recruiting poor, undereducated Irish and Italian immigrants, then shepherding their political incorporation into local and national affairs. But immigrants from Latin America and Asia were largely excluded from the old machines, both by laws limiting their naturalization and enfranchisement and by racism. The Voting Rights Act of 1965 was not extended to Hispanics and Asians until 1975. By then most of the urban machines had been dismantled, and the leading edge of our current wave of Asian and Hispanic immigrants began unpacking their bags in Los Angeles, San Francisco, New York, Atlanta and Washington.

The immigrants from Latin America immediately found themselves lumped together under the label ""Hispanic,"" even if they spoke Portuguese or an indigenous language, even if they had no ancestral link to Spain. It's tough to galvanize such a heterogeneous group. The panethnic, multilingual category of ""Hispanic"" is a uniquely American invention, created by congressional legislation in the 1970s. In her book ""Making Hispanics,"" G. Cristina Mora shows how bureaucrats, media executives and political activists built the notion to combine Mexican-Americans, Cuban-Americans, Puerto Ricans and others in census counts and federal programs. The term was always deliberately ambiguous, Mora notes, so that it could accommodate varied origin stories. There are Hispanics who swam the Rio Grande hoping for a living wage, Hispanics who flew business class to enroll in Ivy League schools, Hispanics who disembarked as Cold Warriors in Florida. There are even Hispanics whose families owned land in the Southwest before it was ever part of the United States. (These ""Hispanics"" like to joke that they didn't cross the border; the border crossed them.) Unlike African-Americans, most of whom can trace a connection to slavery, Latinos have no single common history. Trump, Figueroa once told me, ""makes us more Latino"": His threats and insults provoke a unifying sense of indignation.

Sifting thorough the numbers and this complicated history makes the 52 percent of nonvoting Latinos look rather different. The problem isn't their youth, poverty or lack of education. The problem is that when you're poor, young or undereducated, it takes more effort to overcome your immigrant family's low levels of political socialization. For first-generation Americans, politics is often just one more cultural expression that they must decipher on their own. It's rarely a priority. The immigrant parents that I spoke with swam rivers and boarded airplanes to escape violence, to earn money, to educate their children. Learning to play American politics was never on the agenda.

In Virginia, I found that serious political talk was so rare among the American-born children of Spanish-speaking immigrants that they would often ask me questions like ""What is the Tea Party?"" and ""Who is my mayor?"" Alicio Castañeda, a student at George Mason University whose parents are from Mexico, told me that after we had lunch in April, he began reading more news articles and researching deeper into the presidential candidates. He voted on Super Tuesday. His love for the soccer team Manchester United had led him to The Guardian newspaper, which reminded him that it was a big day in America. ""I've always been personally interested in politics,"" he told me, ""but I haven't had anyone to talk to about it.""

Until the 1960s, high schools often taught courses on democracy, civics and government. At the turn of the 21st century, most teenagers received one such class, or none. This drought in civics hurts all Americans, but for Latinos it's devastating. Several studies have found that merely hearing parents chat about politics or watching them cast a ballot improves the odds that a child will later vote as an adult. Yet a national survey directed by Mark Hugo Lopez in 2002 found that young Latinos were the least likely to have discussed politics with their parents. They were also the most likely to believe that voting is ""difficult.""

On Super Tuesday, I glimpsed what was missing among so many of the Latino families I spoke with when I met Kat Heller, a non-Hispanic mother, exiting a polling station with two children. Growing up in Minnesota, Heller had always tagged along with her parents when they voted. Once, when she was about 12, her father took her to watch the ballots being counted. ""I just remember feeling it was really exciting,"" she told me. ""It was seeing history happening. Everyone was waiting breathlessly."" Inside the voting booth on Super Tuesday, Heller put her 3-year-old son on her hip and asked him: ""Which do you think we should vote for?"" His 13 touches had already begun.

Absent Tammany Hall and civics in schools, the work of turning ""new Americans"" into voters often falls to volunteers like Keisy Chavez. Several weekends this summer, Chavez, 45, has stood outside of Todos Supermarket and other locations in Northern Virginia, clipboard in hand, fishing for Latinos who haven't registered to vote. On the Saturday morning that I joined her, she looked surprisingly stylish for the occasion: gold-toned sandals, brilliant white capri pants, fiery nails and a bright orange T-shirt blazoned with the words ""New Virginia Majority."" You could not engineer a better volunteer than Chavez to help turn out the Latino vote. Political appeals, social scientists have found, work best when delivered by co-ethnics. Chavez meets other requirements as well: She's bilingual, outgoing and frank.

A good rate for voter registration is two new registrations an hour. Chavez and her colleague hit the mark with four new registrations between them (the colleague waited for Chavez every time someone's dominant language was Spanish). Still, most passers-by ignored them. One 20-something with jet black hair who did stop told Chavez, in Spanish, that he was a citizen but not registered. She tried to reel him in.

""O.K.,"" she responded with a smile, ""what is the problem?""

He said that he would come back to register next week, that she should give him her phone number.

""What happens if you don't come next week?"" she asked him.

""I promise you.""

""You know what happens,"" she said. ""If you don't do it now, four more years will go by, and you won't vote.""

Back and forth they went for several minutes. Finally, seeing that Chavez wouldn't give him her number, the man walked away without registering. Winning votes, Lola Quintela of the Fairfax County Democratic Committee told me, is ""trabajo de hormiga"" -- ants' work, performed grain by grain.

The political scientist Lisa García Bedolla proposed a different method in a 2005 paper for The Harvard Journal of Hispanic Policy. Because political engagement is strongly influenced by social ties, she argues, Latinos should improve their participation by politicizing their existing social networks. (She also pushes for civics in schools.) Several of the Latinos I met seemed to vote only because they were connected to a political junkie. Manuel Fernandez, 25, a Mexican-American born in New York State, prefers rebuilding and drifting cars to reading politics, but he has voted in local and presidential elections since he turned 18 because his father, Guadencio, a businessman, persuaded him to register to vote and tells him when and how to cast his ballots. ""Dad is really into it,"" he said. ""Whenever my dad says it's voting time, we go vote.""

The Clinton campaign is splitting its strategy between the tactics. After analyzing which programs worked best during the primaries, Praeli began pushing an expansion of Nevada's bilingual Mujeres in Politics program in battleground and ""expansion"" states across the country. Mujeres in Politics marshals Latinas for the ant work of canvassing and phone banking, but it also relies on social ties to deepen the campaign's reach into Latino communities. Each Latina who participates is tasked with the responsibility of drawing in five more Latina volunteers.

""The theory for us was if you target Latinas and then you have Latinas talk to other Latinas, they're the best communicators to do that,"" Praeli told me. ""We see them as the C.E.O.s of their family and their communities. Part of my program description is you need to know that bodega with the highest foot traffic or the church secretary that can give you access to a faith community or who are the comadres in the neighborhood that have the largest influence. All you have to do is talk to a Latina to really understand that."" Of course, it doesn't hurt that Latinas have voted in higher numbers than Latinos or that they were a key base for Clinton in the primaries.

Chavez herself was lured into politics by a Latina friend. For years after she settled in Virginia from Peru, she earned money washing dishes, waitressing, cleaning bathrooms, cleaning offices, ""cleaning anything,"" she says. At one point she held three jobs: a full-time job, a part-time job and a weekend job cleaning the airport at night. In 1996, she earned her real estate license. Then in 2009, after a friend asked her to walk with Terry McAuliffe in a parade, she was so smitten by his concern for Latinos that she decided to volunteer for his campaign for governor. For Chavez, the experience was intoxicating: ""I was like, 'Whoa, I did not know any of this existed.' "" She has volunteered for Virginia Democrats every year since then. Election season feels like a party to her. ""I have the best time,"" she told me. When Praeli spoke at the ""Latinos con Hillary"" event at Todos, Chavez was there, dressed head to toenails in blue.

The widespread assumption has been that rising numbers of Hispanic citizens will turn Virginia and other states in the South permanently Democratic. Certainly, with each election since 2001, Virginia Democrats have expanded their network of experienced Latino staff members and volunteers. Praeli and Figueroa's work depends on these veterans, a fact that Clinton tacitly acknowledged before Figueroa was even hired. On June 11, five days after The Associated Press called the Democratic primary for Hillary Clinton, the former president Bill Clinton held a closed-door round table in Arlington with about 20 key Latino leaders from all over the state. He, like Praeli after him, was rallying troops.

But Latinos aren't natural Democrats, any more than they are natural Republicans. In 1984, Ronald Reagan won the presidency with nearly half their vote in California. In 2004, George W. Bush won a second term with 40 percent of the national Latino vote, setting off panic in Democratic circles. And even in 2012, 33 percent of the Latino vote in Virginia went to Mitt Romney. He also took 39 percent of the Latino vote in Florida and 42 percent in Ohio.

From the beginning, Latino voters have been up for grabs. The national electoral bloc that we now call the Hispanic vote was created by middle- and upper-class Mexican-American Democrats who wanted more clout in government and politics. According to the historian Ignacio M. García's book on the subject, they organized ""Viva Kennedy"" clubs in Texas, California, New Mexico, Indiana, Illinois and elsewhere. Working together under an absurd logo of John Kennedy riding a grinning burro, these grass-roots clubs turned out thousands of Spanish speakers in delegate-rich states, helping Kennedy squeak into the White House by a margin of less than 1 percent of the popular vote. But Republicans pushed the strategy further: In ""Making Hispanics,"" Mora shows how members of Richard Nixon's 1972 re-election campaign, who nicknamed themselves the ""Brown Mafia,"" ran Spanish-language ads on radio and television. They crafted three distinct campaigns to bring in not just Mexican-Americans but also Puerto Ricans and Cuban-Americans. With their help, Nixon was re-elected by a landslide, taking about 35 percent of what was then known as the ""Spanish speaking"" vote. The real loss for Republicans since President George W. Bush left office is that their candidates have frittered away the affections that he and Reagan earned among Latinos.

Many conservative Hispanics I spoke with in Virginia told me that they don't fit neatly into either party. They would prefer a candidate who legalizes undocumented immigrants, outlaws abortion, makes college education free, wipes out drugs and gangs, rolls back the legal right to gay marriage, supports small-business credits and raises the minimum wage. Immigration reform might be a distinguishing concern for Latinos, but a recent report from Pew found that, as in previous presidential contests, it is not the top issue for Latino voters. More Latino voters say that the economy, health care and terrorism are very important.

Several of the Catholic Latinos I met said that abortion laws were their top priority. ""If we can close that one clinic,"" Iris Chavez told me with a sparkle in her eye, referring to a Planned Parenthood-like women's clinic that was once located in Manassas, ""we can set fire to the nation."" Chavez, 26, was brought into the United States illegally from El Salvador when she was 11 and was protected by Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, which Obama created in 2012 for undocumented millennials who came to the United States as children. She works part-time as a secretary at All Saints Catholic Church, where so many Latinos attend the Sunday afternoon, Spanish-language Mass that they spill from the pews to stand three to four deep against the walls. She doesn't much like Donald Trump, she told me, but if she could vote, she would vote for him based on her belief that abortion is murder.

Chavez is the kind of Latino that Nixon's ""Brown Mafia"" was after -- the same kind that Reagan tried to embrace with his 1986 amnesty, which legalized 2.7 million Hispanics who had no criminal history, and the kind that Reince Priebus had hoped the Republican National Committee's 2012 election autopsy would provoke Republicans to seek again. If the party had followed George W. Bush's lead, Todos Supermarket might have become a site for G.O.P. events. Carlos Castro, its owner, considered himself ""almost 100 percent Republican"" until 2007, when the Republicans of Prince William County championed an anti-Hispanic ""Immigration Resolution,"" and he began to reconsider. He's now an independent. Other conservatives in the county told me that they would keep their votes out of everybody's reach until a candidate arrives whom they can fully support.

The specter of Trump has roused many Latinos to change their minds about registering; spikes have been documented in North Carolina and Georgia. In California, the rise in registrations early this year was almost double what it was during the same period in 2012. Jairo Castillo, a Nicaraguan-American construction worker in Virginia, complained to me in April that the vote ""doesn't count,"" but after Trump secured the Republican nomination in June, he registered to vote for the first time.

Even if a ""Trump effect"" among Latinos this year does help put Clinton in the White House, will those new voters stay engaged? History suggests they might not. According to the political scientists Matt Barreto and Gary M. Segura, more than a million Latinos in California registered to vote for the first time in the years after the state passed Proposition 187, a 1994 ballot initiative. Prop. 187 prohibited undocumented immigrants from state-funded institutions, like schools, and required police officers to report their arrests to federal immigration authorities. In a statewide election, the initiative passed with 59 percent of the vote. Pete Wilson, the Republican governor who had championed the measure, won re-election that same fall. Prop. 187 was soon tied up in federal court, which ruled many of its elements unconstitutional, but California's electorate soon went on to pass a ban on affirmative action (Prop. 209) and a reduction in bilingual education (Prop. 227). Both measures were widely regarded as anti-Hispanic.

Prop. 187 and its cousins had notoriously partisan effects in California. In a paper published in The American Journal of Political Science in 2006, the political scientists Shaun Bowler, Stephen P. Nicholson and Segura found that before 1994 Latinos split their votes almost equally between the two parties. By contrast, after the passage of these propositions, the probability that a Latino would identify as Republican fell by more than two-thirds, erasing all the gains that Republicans made since Ronald Reagan's 1980 campaign. Data also revealed that the propositions moved many non-Hispanic whites in California into the Democratic column. Attacking undocumented immigrants and Latinos had provoked a white backlash against Republicans that mirrors the disaffection that Trump's nomination has stirred among many party moderates this season.

But as time went on, Prop. 187's effect on Latino turnout revealed itself to be not a turning point but a blip. Last September, The Los Angeles Times noted that only 17 percent of eligible California Latinos voted in 2014. Turnout was similar among Asian-Americans, while all other racial and ethnic groups combined voted more than twice as much. ""By all accounts, the Central Valley is a place where Latino candidates should win elections,"" the reporter Kate Linthicum noted. ""Yet Latino candidates' election losses have piled up here in recent years -- in large part because Latinos aren't turning out to vote.""

Among those defeated in 2014 was Amanda Renteria, now the national political director for Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign. Renteria ran for Congress in a Central Valley district that was 74 percent Hispanic. She grew up in the Central Valley and taught math at her old high school in Woodlake before attending Harvard Business School and becoming the first Latina chief of staff in the history of the Senate. She lost her 2014 bid for Congress by 17 points. If Latinos had turned out for her at the levels that African-Americans turned out for Obama, it's possible that today she would sit in Congress.

This March, the Public Policy Institute of California released a report that detailed the gulf that has opened up in California politics since the Prop. 187 surge. ""Voters in California,"" it noted, ""tend to be older, white, college educated, affluent and homeowners. They also tend to identify themselves as 'haves' -- rather than 'have-nots' -- when asked to choose between these two economic categories. Nonvoters tend to be younger, Latino, renters, less affluent and less likely to be college educated than likely voters -- and they generally identify themselves as have-nots.""

California may be a majority-minority state in terms of its population, the report observed, but its electorate is not: 60 percent of its likely voters are white, while only 18 percent are Latino. It would be naïve, however, to expect Democrats to throw themselves wholeheartedly into the project of turning out the state's Hispanics given that they already control solid majorities in California's State Assembly and State Senate.

""We have to be honest,"" María Teresa Kumar, the president and co-founder of Voto Latino, a nonpartisan organization, told me last fall. ""When it comes to voter registration, each party is looking to the Latino community and the African-American community for enough votes. They don't need us all."" From her office in Washington, she directs efforts to engage young Latinos who are often navigating the political system for their families. ""Our job,"" Kumar said, ""is to do true political empowerment: It's mass mobilization and mass participation. And for parties, it's about how little do they need to spend to get over the top.""

If Virginia's battleground status suggests a triumph of the Latino vote, it also provides a cautionary tale about its limitations. In early August, Senator Tim Kaine, Hillary Clinton's running mate, appeared in the green-and-yellow gymnasium of Huguenot High School in Richmond. ""Yes, we Kaine!"" the crowd shouted under the floodlights. His homecoming rally doubled as a history lesson. Kaine pointed out that Virginia had gone 170 years without a president or vice-president. When he moved to Virginia in 1984, he said, neither Republicans nor Democrats bothered to campaign in the state, a situation that he attributed to a conservative lock on power that depended upon marginalizing women and minorities. ""We pushed you away from the table,"" he said. But since Barack Obama turned Virginia into a battleground, it has become a campaign stop for every would-be president. ""It's much better to live in state where no one can take you for granted,"" Kaine said.

The shift that brought volunteers like Keisy Chavez to the Democratic table actually began long before Obama. When Mark Warner was elected governor in 2001, his campaign strategy relied on winning rural, Nascar-loving Republicans, not on including minorities. But Kaine's own gubernatorial victory in 2005 used an urban-suburban strategy that relied upon the participation of Northern Virginia's fast-growing, multiethnic communities. Given Kaine's experiences arguing civil rights cases and his work as a missionary in Honduras, the shift may have reflected personal affinities. It was also a canny response to Virginia's changing demographics. According to the University of Virginia's Demographics Research Group, in 1970 only one in 100 Virginians were born outside of the United States. By 2012, that ratio had increased to one in nine. Such demographic transformations are hardly unique to the state. Between 1990 and 2008, the number of Latinos living in Arkansas, Alabama, Georgia, North Carolina, South Carolina and Tennessee grew by 602 percent, prompting political scientists to dub the region the ""Nuevo South."" ""If you put your faith in the Virginia voter,"" Kaine recalled telling the candidate Obama in 2008, ""You're going to win Virginia.""

Yet the majority of Virginia's General Assembly is still Republican, and only two of its state-level representatives, the delegates Alfonso Lopez and Jason Miyares, are Latino. Harry Wiggins, the chairman of Prince William County's Democratic Committee, described the problem like this: ""We win the presidential. We won for Mark Warner. We won for Tim Kaine. We won for Terry McAuliffe. Yet the county board we lose, because they have off-year elections, and we have very light turnout.""

Figueroa is already preparing for the inevitable drop. ""The numbers are going to plummet next year in places that count, like Prince William,"" he told me. In 2015, the Census Bureau weighed Prince William County at 22.3 percent Latino, 21.8 percent African-American and 8.7 percent Asian. The chairman of its board of supervisors, however, is Corey Stewart, a Republican, who is also chairman of Donald Trump's campaign in the state. ""When he is president and I am governor, you're going to see one helluva tag team in Virginia, and we're finally going to remove illegal immigrants,"" Stewart told The Richmond Times-Dispatch in June. The gubernatorial race will occur next year, when no other state in the country except New Jersey will be holding elections.

While Kaine spoke, Figueroa stood near the press box, tapping at his phone and taking in the scene. In the days leading up to the rally, he mentioned several times that he was working to make the event ""blacker and browner."" His handiwork was evident in the V.I.P. bleachers directly in front of the television cameras, where a group of people sat, many of them wearing the unmistakable bright blue-and-white jerseys of El Salvador's national soccer team. They were students, parents and teachers associated with the English-as-a-second-language program at Huguenot High School and its International Club. Their V.I.P. seating had come from Figueroa. Their homemade red, white and blue sign ""Juntos Se Puede!"" (""Together we can!"") gave Kaine a camera-ready opportunity that he seized, pointing to them and leading a round of ""Sí se puede!"" -- a chant that will always have special resonance for those who know that it originated not in 2008 with Obama but with Cesar Chavez and Dolores Huerta in 1972.

After Kaine finished his speech, as ""Shake It Off"" blasted through the gym, several of these students joined the throng vying for an opportunity to snap a selfie with him. I asked two of them what they knew about Kaine. ""He was mayor of Virginia,"" one said. The other added that he had lived in Honduras and was a friend of Latinos. That was all that they seemed to know. Two parents I spoke with told me, in Spanish, that they understood only pieces of Kaine's speech, which was in English. This explained why one father appeared so poker-faced through much of the rally. Unless his son translated the speeches for him, he couldn't form an opinion. He didn't understand what was being said.",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/18/magazine/27-million-potential-hispanic-votes-but-what-will-they-really-add-up-to.html

Good morning. U.S. shift on Syria, higher interest rates, DNA from Aboriginal bones. Here's the latest:

* President Trump ordered a full withdrawal from Syria.

U.S. officials said they were ordered to pull all 2,000 U.S. ground troops from Syria within 30 days.

Top generals are against the move, saying it would betray Kurdish allies who have fought alongside American troops there. And the White House has yet to officially announce the withdrawal.

""We have defeated ISIS in Syria, my only reason for being there during the Trump Presidency,"" Mr. Trump wrote on Twitter. He offered no details on his plans for the military mission, nor a larger strategy, in Syria.

* U.S. Federal Reserve raises interest rates.

The widely expected quarter-point increase signaled confidence in the health of the U.S. economy. U.S. stocks pared early gains.

Financial markets were well prepared for a rate increase, so attention was focused on the Fed's plans to continue slowly raising rates.

* Facebook shared private user data with tech giants.

A Times investigation found the social network gave major technology firms far more access to users' personal data than it had disclosed, effectively exempting some partners from its privacy rules.

Facebook let Spotify and Netflix read, write and delete users' private messages. It permitted Amazon to obtain users' names and contact information through their friends. In all, Facebook shared data with more than 150 companies, including The Times.

The data-sharing deals may have violated a 2011 agreement with the Federal Trade Commission that banned Facebook from sharing user data without explicit permission. Here are the five main takeaways from our investigation.

* ""Our old people's spirits won't rest until they're back on their own country.""

For decades, Aboriginal Australians have been pressing for the return of bones and body parts, many of them stolen, held in museums around the world.

In recent years, museums have tried to comply. But progress has been slow, partly because the institutions don't know where many of the bones came from.

Now geneticists may have a solution.

Scientists say they can use fragments of DNA from bone or hair to determine where in Australia they came from, making it possible to return them to the right Aboriginal group.

Back Story

Clare Macdonald, a reader from Keene, N.H., asked us when the first electric lights were used on a Christmas tree.

It was in 1882, just three years after Thomas Edison filed a patent for his light bulb. The tree became a fixture in the experiment-filled home of an executive at his company.

Eighty walnut-size red, white and blue bulbs covered the tree, which sat on a revolving box. A newspaper article described it: ""As the tree turned, the colors alternated, all the lamps going out and being relit at every revolution. The result was a continuous twinkling of dancing colors, red, white, blue, white, red, blue, all evening.""

President Grover Cleveland popularized electric Christmas lights in the 1890s by installing them on the White House tree. Above, the tree in Rockefeller Center in 1949.

But it was not until (relatively) inexpensive strings of Christmas lights began to be sold a few years later that the tradition really caught on.

4,the new york times,"BEIRUT, Lebanon -- Turkey is threatening to invade Syria to eradicate Kurdish fighters. Syrian forces are rolling toward territory the Americans will soon abandon. Israel is bombing Iran-backed militias deep inside Syria. And Russia could soon move to crush the last vestige of the Syrian anti-government insurgency.

The Syria that the United States military is vacating on President Trump's orders is a Balkanized version of the country that plunged into a calamitous civil war nearly eight years ago.

Now, with the American troop withdrawal and the demise of the insurgency against President Bashar al-Assad, Iran and Russia will be even freer to flex their power in Syria.

""Welcome to the post-American Middle East,"" Richard N. Haass, a longtime diplomat and president of the Council on Foreign Relations, said in a Twitter post on Wednesday.

A look at the changing complexities of the Syria conflict:

What could postwar Syria look like?

After years of bloodshed set in motion by the Arab Spring protests that had inspired hope for democratic change, the most likely Syrian future, Middle East analysts project, is a far more brittle version of what existed before the war: Mr. Assad leading a repressive government puppeteered by Russia and Iran.

Both countries are longtime allies of Mr. Assad's. By rescuing him with Russian airpower and Iranian manpower, they have embedded themselves even further.

Shiite Iran, which competes with Sunni powers led by Saudi Arabia for influence across the region, has sent tens of thousands of Iranian and proxy fighters to Syria. It is building Shiite shrines and strengthening Shiite militias that it hopes to use as leverage against Israel.

Russia, which already exerted considerable political influence in Syria, holds sway over its foreign policy, military and security services. That is part of the price Moscow exacted for having protected Mr. Assad, a brutal autocrat once described by Western leaders as finished.

What do Russia and Iran get in return?

Although they may find staying in Syria costly, frustrating and unpopular back home, Russia and Iran have secured an advantage from outlasting the United States: regional clout.

For both countries, this is ""the dream scenario,"" said Daniel Benaim, a fellow focusing on the Middle East at the Center for American Progress, a liberal research group in Washington. ""They get to tell the story that they've been telling to every actor on the ground -- America's friends and America's foes alike -- that America is no longer a reliable partner in the Middle East.""

Why were American soldiers in Syria?

Two thousand Americans were deployed in northeast Syria, collaborating with Kurdish-led forces to wipe the Islamic State from the area. But that partnership angered neighboring Turkey, which sees the autonomy-minded Kurds as a dangerous enemy.

How -- or even if -- the fight against the Islamic State in Syria will now proceed remains unclear. An estimated 30,000 Islamic State adherents are believed scattered in the country.

Many experts anticipate that a hasty American pullout could spawn another major battle, either as Turkey moves to crush its Kurdish foes, or as Mr. Assad's forces retake the northeast, or both.

It is possible that the Kurds and Mr. Assad could come to a deal first. If not, a new round of fighting could send new waves of refugees -- Kurds and others -- fleeing toward Iraq in a new round of mayhem that could also help incubate the Islamic State's revival.

""That's absolutely a possibility, the risk of total chaos,"" said Aron Lund, a Syria analyst and fellow at the Century Foundation, a think tank, ""when the thing that's been keeping the situation stable -- not saying it was good or bad, but stable -- just disappears in a puff of smoke.""

Who will occupy the territory vacated by the Americans?

According to the Institute for the Study of War, Russia, Iran and Iran-backed militias, including the Lebanese Shiite group Hezbollah, are well-positioned to seize territory in northeast Syria abandoned by the United States. They occupy 29 nearby positions, according to the group, and a further seven across the Iraq border.

The Britain-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights, which tracks Syria's war via a network of citizen monitors, said on Sunday that the Syrian government had dispatched thousands of fighters toward the Islamic State's last patches of territory in the northeast.

What remains of the anti-Assad insurgency?

The last major redoubt of the rebels opposed to Mr. Assad are crowded into Idlib Province in northwestern Syria, neighboring Turkey. Russia may help Mr. Assad's forces retake the province eventually. But Russia also is expected to first negotiate with Turkey, which has supported anti-Assad groups and has a vested interest in what happens along its border with Syria.

How have the changes affected Israel?

Analysts say Iran can now link Shiite partners in Iraq, Syria and Lebanon in a unified front against Israel. In Syria, Iran and Hezbollah aim to strengthen a military presence near the Golan Heights, annexed by Israel after it was captured in the 1967 war.

Israel has made clear it will not tolerate an increased threat from Syria, which the Israelis demonstrated on Tuesday with airstrikes near Damascus.

The Russians, who have good relations with Israel, have tacitly allowed it to conduct such operations in the past. Still, the Kremlin protested on Wednesday what it called Israel's ""gross violation"" of Syrian sovereignty.

How is Iran Changing Syria?

The Iranian-led Shiite partnership in Syria faces a basic shortcoming: few Shiites in a Sunni-majority country. Still, Iran has extended its influence among both Syrian fighters and civilians.

In some parts of Syria, Iran has distributed cash to pay for housing to people displaced by the war; in others, it has established Shiite shrines that, according to the Observatory, have drawn visitors from Iran, Iraq and Syria.

Defying the Syrian government's historic secularism, Iran and Hezbollah have infused parts of the country with a strikingly religious tint. It was rare in the past, for example, to see celebrations for Ashura, a major Shiite holiday, in non-Shiite areas of Damascus. Now, however, Ashura parades and rituals are much more visible.

Some soldiers in the historically secular Syrian army have become more religious after joining Iran-backed Shiite militias. Others have switched to such militias for nonreligious reasons. Fighters in Iran-backed groups receive better pay and more days off than the army offers, and joining a Shiite militia does not necessarily mean converting to Shiism. But it is a marked shift from the old way.

""It's no longer purely secular,"" said Ali Rizk, a Beirut-based analyst who writes about Iran. He said Iran and Hezbollah have spread their Shiite beliefs among some of the Syrian forces. ""It's only human -- after all, these units were coordinating with each other, fighting side by side.""

Are Russians welcomed in Syria?

Russia has cemented ties with Syrian leaders, strengthened relations with Turkey and eclipsed the United States as the power to contend with in the Middle East.

The Russians have also demonstrated a canny understanding of Syrian sensitivities -- dispatching military policemen from Russia's predominantly Sunni Muslim Chechnya region, for example, to negotiate rebel withdrawals and keep the peace in Sunni areas retaken by Mr. Assad's side.

On a visit to the formerly insurgent-held southern suburbs of Damascus in October, three Russian military policemen were patrolling with a green armored vehicle that bore the Russian flag. Syrians greeted them in Arabic, sometimes throwing in a ""privyet"" -- ""hi"" in Russian.

Many have welcomed the Russians, preferring them to the government's security enforcers or to Shiite militiamen backed by Iran. Those in the area who still opposed the government said they were heartened in the spring, when a YouTube video showed Russian military policemen arresting Syrian soldiers accused of looting. Then, in June, when Shiite militiamen arrested two Sunni men, the Russians pressured the militias into releasing them, residents said.

The incidents helped persuade residents that Russia has no interest in stoking Sunni-Shiite frictions, and could counter any moves by Mr. Assad's forces to exact revenge on the opposition.

""Iran has a sectarian project,"" said Ahmed al-Buqa'a, 55, who had three sons fight with the rebels, ""but Russia doesn't care about people's ethnic and religious backgrounds.""

Could Russia and Iran diverge over Syria's future?

Iran and Russia are already in a competition, with Russia wanting a self-supporting Syrian government weaned from Russian military and financial help, and Iran preferring something weaker, analysts said. Both countries have already begun placing advisers in Syrian security agencies, said Joost Hiltermann, the Middle East program director for the International Crisis Group.

But both face challenges to staying in Syria. Neither can afford Syria's reconstruction, which by some reckonings could exceed $200 billion.

The Russians ""want to find an exit from Syria basically, militarily, leaving in place their two bases and their own people within the security apparatus, and Russian companies to help with reconstruction,"" Mr. Hiltermann said. ""They don't want to get bogged down militarily.""

The Iranian government has faced opposition to its military adventures in Syria at home, where the economy has been deeply strained by American sanctions.

Danielle Pletka, senior vice president for foreign and defense policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative Washington research group, said the Iranians had so far exercised power deftly in Syria, ""but it's going to be a lot harder for them to do that given the economic straits they're in.""

Both patrons may find Syria's stability hard to re-establish under Mr. Assad. Already, peaceful protests against him have been staged in areas where he has reasserted control, analysts said.

""Peacetime will present challenges that the war let him paper over,"" said Alexander Bick, a lecturer and research scholar at Johns Hopkins School of Advanced International Studies who oversaw Syria issues at the National Security Council under the Obama administration.

""The Russians are very keenly aware,"" he said, ""that Assad's position is fragile, the economy is totally destroyed, and politically it's a mess.""",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/26/world/middleeast/syria-future.html

This includes H.R. 1, a 571-page bill that addresses voting rights, corruption, gerrymandering and campaign finance reform as well as the creation of a Select Committee on the Climate Crisis -- a first step toward a ""Green New Deal.""

Proponents of this ambitious project face a determined adversary, however -- the top ranks of the interest group establishment, skilled in co-opting liberal members of Congress and converting initiatives to square with the interests of corporate America.

The upper stratum of the Washington lobbying community often exercises de facto veto power over the legislative process, dominating congressional policymaking, funneling campaign money to both parties and offering lucrative employment to retiring and defeated members of the House and Senate.

Lobbyists exercise this power across the course of a member's career. ""Whoever is elected is immediately met with a growing lobbying onslaught by the same big players,"" write Lee Drutman, a senior fellow at New America, Matt Grossmann, a political scientist at Michigan State and Tim LaPira, a political scientist at James Madison University, who have contributed a chapter to ""Can America Govern Itself?"" a book edited by Francis Lee and Nolan McCarty that is coming out in June.

Within the federal lobbying community -- a $3.37 billion industry in 2017 -- Drutman, Grossmann and LaPira write

a limited number of organizations at the very top of the resource distribution have escalated their political investments in ways that increasingly distinguish them from the rest of the pack.

This population of groups at the top of the distribution is becoming increasingly stable over the last two decades. This group of top organizations -- which we call the top tier -- is positioning itself as a distinct class.

The authors argue that the first tier lobbying organizations

are analogous to the current generation of very wealthy families who now pay for every conceivable tutor so that their children can be advantaged in applying to elite prep schools and colleges, which are now more and more essential to getting ahead in our increasingly economically stratified society. In both circumstances, financial resources and social connections build up over time, reinforcing stratification. Money does not guarantee outcomes. But it helps reinforce inequalities by widening the gap between the very top and everyone else.

The ability of this elite constituency to meet politicians' demands for campaign contributions and other resources, the authors argue, has allowed Congress to ignore traditional ""populist concerns regarding dominant economic interests"" as members of the House and Senate ""continue their high-dollar fund-raisers and constant meetings with lobbyists.""

Despite his right-wing populist campaign and his September 2017 promise -- ""Our framework includes our explicit commitment that tax reform will protect low-income and middle-income households, not the wealthy and well-connected"" -- Trump supported and signed into law the $1.5 trillion Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017. This extraordinarily regressive legislation decisively favors the rich and corporate interests.

As the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center has noted, as a result of the Trump tax bill higher income households will receive

larger average tax cuts as a percentage of after-tax income, with the largest cuts as a share of income going to taxpayers in the 95th to 99th percentiles of the income distribution. On average, in 2027 taxes would change little for lower- and middle-income groups.

The Trump administration's drive to deregulate workplace safety rules and to undermine unions also reflects the impact of the Washington lobbying elite.

By definition, lobbies at the highest rungs of the ladder spend more than those lower down, but ""the differences are staggering,"" Drutman and his colleagues write. The top 100 lobbying groups represent 0.89 percent of the 11,272 registered lobbies, but they ""consistently have at least one-third of the in-house lobbyists in Washington, and hire about one in five contract lobbyists from multi-client lobbying firms."" The way it plays out over time, according to Drutman, is that 90 to 95 percent of the top 100 associations and firms represent business interests, as opposed to labor, consumers, or environmentalists. The top 100 spent $1.047 billion in 2017, or a little less than a third of total lobbying dollars that year, according to data provided to The Times by the Center for Responsive Politics.

The upper ranks of the Washington lobbying community are most effective at blocking enactment of legislation, as opposed to winning approval of new laws. This is the very power -- the crucial power -- that prevents successful legislative initiatives from improving the lives of those in the bottom half of the income distribution.

Raymond La Raja and Brian Schaffner, political scientists at the University of Massachusetts and Tufts, in their 2015 book, ""Campaign Finance and Political Polarization: When Purists Prevail,"" argue that legislative inaction inherently benefits the affluent and hurts the less advantaged: ""A strong case has been made that policy gridlock exacerbates wealth inequality through a basic failure to adjust policies to new economic and demographic realities,"" they write, like globalization and automation, which have disproportionately penalized unskilled and semiskilled labor.

La Raja and Schaffner add that

Partisan polarization tends to exacerbate problems of economic inequality because political stalemate makes government less responsive to the needs of poorer citizens.

In 2017, the most recent year with complete data, the top 10 lobbying associations -- which include the United States Chamber of Commerce, the National Association of Realtors, the Business Roundtable and the Pharmaceutical Research & Manufacturers of America -- spent a total of $291.2 million on lobbying, according to Open Secrets.

In the simplest terms, the pattern of campaign contributions (calculated by Open Secrets) provides insight into the motives of the interest groups and corporations -- those represented by the major lobbying groups -- that are most concerned with shaping public policy.

In the 2017-18 election cycle, securities and investment firms gave a total of $60,566,716, split 53-46 percent between Democrats and Republicans; real estate gave $52,205,352 (51 to 48); accountants, $11,807,757, (46 to 51); the health industry, $159,255,037, (54.6 to 45); and lobbyists themselves contributed $25,828,243, (46 to 53).

The stakes of this competition are substantially higher than those involved in picking individual candidates because ultimately they determine entire classes of winners and losers.

Instead of building solidarity, study after study shows that as the gulf between rich and poor widens, voters become increasingly mean spirited and hostile to the welfare state, progressive taxation and regulations designed to protect consumers, workers and the environment.

""People who have experienced higher inequality during their lives are less in favor of redistribution,"" write Christopher Roth and Johannes Wohlfart, economists at the University of Warwick in Britain and Goethe University in Germany, in their November 2018 paper, ""Experienced Inequality and Preferences for Redistribution."" They are ""less likely to support left-wing parties and to consider the prevailing distribution of incomes to be unfair.""

In another essay from November 2018, ""Inequality and Participative Democracy. A Self‐Reinforcing Mechanism,"" Ioannis Theodossiou and Alexandros Zangelidis, economists at the University of Aberdeen in Scotland, describe the way income inequality leads to political apathy and back again:

Greater income inequality alienates and discourages people from engaging with common affairs, thus leading to lower political participation. Yet, lower electoral participation leads towards a less equitable distribution of income. Hence, this study reveals a self‐reinforcing mechanism where the unequal distribution of income leads to political exclusion, which in turn leads to more inequality.

In other words, increasing inequality undermines support for a progressive agenda -- the agenda most likely to improve the life chances and conditions of the least well off.

Steven Pearlstein, a columnist at the Washington Post, in his 2018 book ""Can American Capitalism Survive?"" describes this negative feedback loop succinctly:

As a society, we are now caught in one of those self-reinforcing, downward spirals in which the erosion of social capital, government dysfunction, rising inequality and slowing rates of economic growth are all feeding off each other, with more of one leading to more of all the others.

Pearlstein continues:

Income inequality and political polarization have become mutually reinforcing, creating the vicious circle that now manifests itself daily in the erosion of norms around civility and truth telling, the declining trust in political institutions, legislative gridlock and political dysfunction.

Unsurprisingly, such problems lead to ever more disquieting outcomes.

Anthony Chen, a sociologist at Northwestern, wrote by email:

Weakened opposition is one reason why business influence over political and regulatory decisions seems greater today than it did before.

In addition, Chen argued,

one of the big political advantages that business enjoys is that it is continually able to recruit good players and send them to play every game worth playing in the American political and legal system. And there are a lot of games worth playing. Those games might entail having key language inserted into a piece of legislation as it gets finalized by Congress, or sending a top-notch legal team to Federal District Court when a favorable way of interpreting a particular statutory provision is potentially at stake, or making sure that business views are amply reflected in the EPA's notice-and-comment rule-making process. And those are just some of the games that are being played at the federal level.

Still, the newly elected Democratic House majority does not enter the fray without some effective tools of its own. Perhaps most important is the changing source of campaign money.

Earlier this month, two reporters for The Times, Stephanie Saul and Rachel Shorey, reported that

Democratic candidates in the general election collected nearly $296 million in small donations, more than three times the $85 million collected by Republicans.

ActBlue, a liberal internet-based nonprofit fund-raising organization, told Saul and Shorey that

it helped raise $1.6 billion in the 2017-18 election cycle, including money it collects for interest groups and state candidates. The average donation was $39.67.

The growth of small donor contributions online has lessened the dependence of Democratic candidates on the network of Washington-based PACs and lobbyist-run fund-raisers. The question now, Walter Shapiro, a fellow at the Brennan Center, writes, is whether Democrats ""can withstand the inevitable pressure to adapt to business as usual in Washington by resisting the traditional advice to court big-money contributors.""

La Raja of warned in an email that

A potentially larger challenge in any Democratic effort to reduce inequality is that allied interest groups and individual donors -- as progressive as they are -- focus on issues that are not necessarily about reducing inequality for the poor and working class. Instead, the emphasis is often on social issues such as abortion and civil rights, or protecting the environment.

Jesse Rhodes, also a political scientist at the University of Massachusetts, questioned in an email whether Democratic donors support the goal of reducing economic inequality:

I think that, all things considered, there is probably more tension than alignment with this goal. To be sure, donors tend to be more ideological than non-donors, so donors to Democratic candidates and/or the Democratic Party are going to be fairly liberal on average. At the same time, donors, particularly significant donors, are likely to be fairly affluent, and therefore heavily invested in the status quo.

Democratic campaign contributors, Rhodes continued, would in all likelihood be

supportive of progressive policies that would reduce economic inequality at the margins -- e.g. shoring up Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, supporting increases in the minimum wage, and so forth -- but I'm skeptical that they would be enthusiastic about more dramatic policy proposals that would require large tax increases on high incomes.

The larger question in the wake of the 2018 elections is whether the forces that propelled Democrats into the majority in the House are powerful and persistent enough to force a shift from the rightward direction of policymaking that has held sway over a significant stretch of the past 40 years.

The 2018 election outcome demonstrated that the left has regained momentum and enthusiasm, but the interest group elite -- the prime movers of the regressive distribution of income described by Drutman, Grossmann and LaPira -- have demonstrated exceptional staying power.

""Business groups are simply more numerous and better resourced than any other type of interest group,"" Chen writes in ""In the Private Interest? Business Influence and American Democracy,"" which also appears as a chapter in ""Can America Govern Itself?""

Corporations and trade groups are far more likely than citizen groups to employ hired lobbyists and former government officials, and the average spending of corporations and trade groups on lobbying and campaign contributions routinely exceeds that of citizen groups by several multiples.

Especially in the case of the finance industry, Chen writes,

there is rapidly accumulating evidence that campaign contributions deliver a definite and non-trivial improvement in the probability of obtaining a favorable vote.

According to Bloomberg, three major business groups -- the United States Chamber of Commerce, the Business Roundtable and the National Association of Realtors -- invested over $50 million in lobbying to win passage of the trillion dollar Trump tax cut.

If newly ascendant Democrats are to have a chance in their struggle against the power brokers of the lobbying community, they will have to maintain and expand their current House majority and eventually win the Senate. Perhaps most important, the party must avoid the repetition of past flameouts.

Previous implosions include the elections of 1978 and 1980 that crushed the Democratic surge in the wake of Watergate and the 2010 Republican wave election that brought an abrupt halt to the idea that a new Democratic majority had dawned after President Barack Obama's victory in 2008.

Democrats need a leader who can power through the internal contradictions that their multihued, multicultural rainbow coalition presents.

They need their own populist playbook and a presidential candidate equipped to forcefully campaign on it, someone whose personality -- bravura, charisma, and bullheadedness -- can seal for even a short while the cracks and schisms that push the party in a hundred different directions.

My guess is that this will require the Democrats and their presidential nominee to resourcefully confront -- to creatively reformat -- issues of race and immigration, gender and sexual identity that Republicans have exploited with great success to peel away swing voters. This may be where a candidate's charisma -- his or her ability to elicit committed followership -- becomes indispensable. The issue is less whether the party should or should not move left, but how a party of the left presents itself to and recruits an Election Day majority from a heterogeneous and deeply conflicted national audience.

The danger for Democrats is that intensifying public hostility to President Trump may hand them the White House in 2020 before they have fully cultivated a leadership cadre equipped to address the conflicts that have torn the party apart in the past -- a cadre that must also be strong enough to do battle with the increasingly powerful moneyed class and its voracious lobbying elite.

6,the new york times,"MOSCOW -- The lawyer for a United States citizen charged with espionage said on Thursday that he had found his client in an upbeat mood in solitary confinement in Moscow's notorious Lefortovo Prison, despite the long legal road that he faces.

""I was surprised to see him being so confident,"" said Vladimir A. Zherebenkov, a high-profile criminal defense lawyer who described spending much of Wednesday with the American, Paul N. Whelan.

Mr. Zherebenkov noted that Russia's criminal code allows for a suspect to be held without trial for 18 months while investigations proceed.

Mr. Whelan, 48, the head of global security for the Michigan auto parts maker BorgWarner and a Marine Corps veteran, was arrested last Friday. Russia's domestic security agency, the F.S.B., issued a brief statement on Monday saying that Mr. Whelan had been caught in ""an act of espionage"" but provided no other details.

Mr. Zherebenkov said that he had not seen all the evidence, but that he suspected that the American had been under surveillance for some time.

""I presume that he is innocent, because for now I haven't seen any evidence against him that would prove otherwise,"" said Mr. Zherebenkov, who said that Mr. Whelan would petition the court for bail.

Rosbalt, a Russian news agency close to the security services, quoted an unidentified intelligence source on Wednesday as saying that Mr. Whelan had been apprehended during a meeting with a Russian citizen in his room at the Metropol Hotel in Moscow. He is accused of trying to recruit this person to obtain classified information about staff members at various Russian agencies, the account said.

Mr. Whelan was arrested five minutes after receiving a USB stick containing a list of all the employees at a classified security agency, the report said.

Unusually for an occasional visitor to Russia, Mr. Whelan had an account on Vkontakte, the Russian version of Facebook, for about a decade. The account showed that he was last active at 4:55 p.m. on Dec. 28, the day the F.S.B. said he was arrested.

Rosbalt quoted its security source as saying it was considered odd that Mr. Whelan did not use the social media site to try to meet women. Rather, he sought to ingratiate himself into the lives of his contacts on the site.

Most of those contacts seemed to be men with some sort of connection to academies run by the Russian Navy, the Ministry of Defense or the Civil Aviation Authority, Rosbalt said.

Mr. Whelan's family said that he had been in Russia to attend the wedding of a friend from the Marine Corps who was marrying a Russian woman at the storied Metropol Hotel. Mr. Whelan knew his way around Moscow, they said, and offered to help wedding guests navigate the city.

Russians who knew him via social media sites over the past decade said he seemed to pop up every six months or so and enjoyed traveling around Russia, especially by train. Not all of them met him in person, however, so it remained unclear just how often he had visited. One contact said that on this trip, Mr. Whelan had written that he had planned to stay in Moscow through the New Year and then head for St. Petersburg.

There has been widespread speculation that Russia seized Mr. Whelan to exchange him for Maria Butina, a Russian citizen jailed in the United States. Ms. Butina, 30, pleaded guilty on Dec. 13 in Federal District Court in Washington to a single charge of conspiring to act as a foreign agent. She admitted to being involved in an organized effort, backed by Russian officials, to lobby influential Americans in the National Rifle Association and the Republican Party.

She faces six months in prison, most likely followed by deportation. An espionage conviction in Russia carries a sentence of 10 to 20 years.

Russia has denied that Ms. Butina acted in any official capacity. While there is no apparent connection between her case and Mr. Whelan's, Russia has a history of arresting foreigners to exchange them for its citizens held elsewhere.

Mr. Whelan's lawyer said that he would welcome an exchange, but that it would take time. The shortest possible timetable for the legal case would be six months to a year, he said, after which the issue of an exchange might be broached. Such a deal would require a pardon from President Vladimir V. Putin.

""This is a long process,"" Mr. Zherebenkov said. ""I myself hope that we can rescue and bring home one Russian soul.""

He said it was standard procedure for a new inmate facing espionage charges to be held in solitary confinement. Mr. Whelan has access to a library at Lefortovo, a rare prison in Russia to have been at least partly refurbished.

Lefortovo has long served as the main place to hold suspects arrested by the domestic security agency, the F.S.B., and its predecessor, the K.G.B. Numerous famous Russians and foreigners have been jailed there, including Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn, the Nobel laureate and dissident sent into exile abroad by the Soviet Union.

Mr. Zherebenkov said that Mr. Whelan spoke conversational Russian, but that the legal work was done through a translator.

The American ambassador to Russia, Jon M. Huntsman, Jr., visited Mr. Whelan in prison on Wednesday, the State Department said in a statement that did not provide further details.

Mr. Zherebenkov described his client as ""a sociable man.""

""He wanted to learn more about Russia, he was interested in the country, its culture and the Orthodox faith,"" he said, noting that Mr. Whelan had visited Sergiyev Posad, the spiritual seat of the Russian Orthodox Church, north of Moscow.

Mr. Whelan's military career ended badly. He was court-martialed in 2008 on charges related to larceny and discharged from the Marine Corps for bad conduct, his rank demoted to private from staff sergeant.

He had done two tours in Iraq, and one of his initial trips to Russia seemed to come in 2006, when he visited for two weeks as part of a special furlough program.

Mr. Whelan had at least 70 friends on Vkonyakte, the social media website, although the number dropped rapidly as word of his arrest spread. He did not post often, but wrote congratulatory notes in Russian on various major holidays and occasionally voiced his opinions about American politics.

""GOD SAVE PRESIDENT TRUMP!!"" he wrote on the day of the president's inauguration, in January 2017, bracketing the sentence with two American flags. After Russia annexed Crimea in 2014, he posted a Russian cartoon suggesting that Alaska might be next, as it was once a Russian territory. ""Putin can have Alaska, as long as he takes Sarah Palin, too!!"" Mr. Whelan wrote.

Last August, he wrote that his cat, Mittens, a pet for 16 years, had passed away. ""Farewell to a loyal friend of many years,"" Mr. Whelan posted.

He shared some biographical information as well, saying he was a native of Ann Arbor, Mich., and had graduated from the University of Michigan. Oddly, both Mr. Whelan and Ms. Butina, the Russian arrested in the United States, seemed to be true fans of the countries that threw them in jail.

Some of the Russians who befriended Mr. Whelan on Vkontakte did not want to speak at all, one offered to sell information about him and a few offered some details about their encounters.

Sergei Artyomenko, 26, a Moscow hair stylist, said Mr. Whelan had followed him on Instagram six years ago while he was doing his military service. They had never met in person, although they had a running joke about him getting a haircut. ""I am not sure how he found me, but he would initiate small talk every six months or so,"" Mr. Artyomenko wrote, adding that they mostly discussed cool places to travel.

Mr. Whelan contacted him last Friday, but the Russian was again too busy to meet. ""He didn't tell me why he came here, but has been always saying that he likes Russia and Siberia,"" he said.

Most of those he reached out to said he seemed like a friendly, open American interested in learning the Russian language and traveling around the country. He liked traveling by train, one man said, even collecting the distinctive metal tea glass holders used on Russian railways, often with images from Russian history stamped on them.

Another man, who did not want to be identified by name, said that he had shown Mr. Whelan the sights around his provincial city a decade ago, but had not seen him since.

""We spoke English and discussed some broad topics -- life in Russia and the U.S., culture, language, personal things,"" the acquaintance said. He added that Mr. Whelan talked about many of the details in his life that have since emerged in public.

""I never had any suspicions about Paul,"" he said.",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/03/world/europe/us-spy-suspect-whelan-russia.html
7,the new york times,"Letty Cottin Pogrebin, a founding editor of Ms. magazine, and other readers wonder: What about that unity thing?

To the Editor:

Re ""Anti-Semitism Accusations Roil Women's March"" (front page, Dec. 24):

For more than 35 years I've witnessed leftists form a firing squad in a circle while our mutual enemies ride off into the sunset unscathed. In 1982 I wrote an investigative article for Ms. magazine that detailed many of the same fevered schisms among Jewish women and women of color that your article discussed. Louis Farrakhan, the Nation of Islam leader, was the ignition switch back then, too.

Some Women's March leaders say they've been educating themselves about the evils of anti-Semitism, as if they missed the memo until Jewish women expressed pain and shock at their exclusion from organizing efforts and their omission from the published ""unity principles"" enumerating which groups of women in particular should be ""free.""

Many anti-racists continue to insist that only people of color can be oppressed and that most Jews, being white, benefit from ""white skin privilege."" Yet somehow our ""privilege"" didn't save the 11 people massacred in a Pittsburgh synagogue this fall by a man with the same color skin.

Since the first Women's March, in 2017, a number of feminist intermediaries have tried to help bridge the organizers' ideological and political gaps, with scant success. Until all of us understand that racism and anti-Semitism are the same toxic madness split at the root, and until we embrace intersectionality without defining any woman out, our struggle against sexism and racism will be hobbled by our squabbles with one another.

To the Editor:

I was horrified to learn that there are apparently insurmountable fissures in a once seemingly unified Women's March, a march I was honored to participate in last year.

As a supporter of women's rights and a citizen deeply concerned with human rights, I now plan not to march at all, because of the disgraceful decision to separate the New York March into two marches -- one ""being led by women of color,"" the other ""stressing its denunciation of anti-Semitism."" I suspect that many others will feel the same.

Eva Mekler

New York

To the Editor:

I helped organize marches that occurred across America in January 2017. If you are questioning whether to participate in a local march next month, know that the marches that took place -- in all 50 states and all over the world -- were organized by thousands of women who are leaders in their own communities, many of them first-time leaders.

We need to change the perception that four women who worked on the Women's March on Washington represent all of us. And for those who believe that reporting on anti-Semitism is dividing the movement, I say it's not. It's about calling out bad behavior and letting the real work continue.

To the Editor:

Tamika Mallory, one of the Women's March organizers, disqualified herself as a leader of a group dedicated to upholding human rights when she stated that ""white Jews, as white people, uphold white supremacy.""

To the Editor:

Great. For two years, millions of women came together in marches around the country to show their opposition to an anti-immigrant, anti-Muslim, misogynistic and divisive president. Now there's a rift among founders of the original march amid allegations of anti-Semitism. Women united in their opposition to Mr. Trump are divided and sniping at one another.

Congratulations -- he couldn't have hoped for a better outcome.

Has any other word in 2018 been as responsible for so much as ""caravan""?

By definition, a caravan is a company of people traveling through a hostile region. You travel in a caravan for protection. When you feel powerless, traveling in a group gives you some sense of power. But there is no protecting the caravan of migrants who have journeyed to Donald Trump's America.

To President Trump and his supporters, a caravan is made up of invaders and criminals. A caravan carries drugs and diseases. A caravan must be stopped at all costs, even if it means shutting down the United States government.

As a word, ""caravan"" is a politically expedient bludgeon, part of a decades-long project started by anti-immigrant groups (NumbersUSA, Center for Immigration Studies and Federation for American Immigration Reform, to name a few) using dehumanizing vocabulary to describe immigrants in nefarious, fear-inducing ways. ""Illegal aliens"" having ""anchor babies"" arriving in a ""caravan."" At its most effective, this is language as a barrier. It says: ""You're an alien -- you're nothing like me."" It's also a source of misinformation, as it is not illegal to apply for asylum. This is language as a weapon.

Defending the use of tear gas on the caravan that trekked up from Central America this year, which included children, President Trump said, ""First of all, the tear gas is a very minor form of the tear gas itself -- it's very safe."" Then he asked, ""Why is a parent running up into an area where they know the tear gas is forming and it's going to be formed and they're running up with a child?""

Because as long as parents love their children, they will run toward anything that may, just may, give them a shot at a better life, even if it means hurting them.

The history of the United States is a history of caravans arriving from different parts of the world. Why did they have to leave? What did they leave behind when they left what they had to leave? What did they take with them? How do they hold on to hope?

Good morning.

Thank you for reading this edition of the Morning Briefing. And special thanks to those of you who wrote in with comments and ideas on improving it. We're taking a break next week, and we'll be back on Jan. 3 with an even better briefing.

Now, back to the news: Vladimir Putin's approval of Donald Trump, #MeToo in Australia and a look at the year in news. Here's the latest.

* ""Donald's right, and I agree with him.""

President Vladimir Putin, above, welcomed President Trump's decision to withdraw American troops from Syria, calling it ""the right decision.""

But at home, Mr. Trump was defending the withdrawal from bipartisan criticism, not least for leaving Syria open territory for the geopolitical ambitions of Russia and Iran. America's Kurdish allies in Syria discussed releasing 3,200 Islamic State prisoners in response. And analysts called the decision an abandonment of key allies and a boon for ISIS.

→ Go deeper: Mr. Trump doesn't believe U.S. forces can alter the strategic balance in the Middle East, a view shared by Barack Obama, our national security correspondent writes in an analysis.

_____

* Will the U.S. government shut down?

A deal to avert a U.S. government shutdown was teetering as the White House called an emergency meeting with House Republicans and President Trump fumed over not getting border-wall funding in a bill passed by the Senate late Wednesday.

Separately, Mr. Trump's nominee for attorney general, William Barr, criticized the investigation by the special counsel, Robert Mueller, in a memo to top Justice Department officials in June. He objected to the notion that the president may have obstructed justice.

If you missed it: In a farewell speech to Congress on Wednesday, Speaker Paul Ryan said American politics were ""broken."" A former rising star in the Republican Party, Mr. Ryan, above, oversaw the enactment of a tax overhaul that many welcomed -- but that also contributed to a growing deficit.

_____

* Tensions with China grow.

China acknowledged that it had detained a third Canadian citizen, a teacher from Alberta, making her the most recent casualty in a diplomatic standoff between the two countries. The three detentions appear to be in retaliation for Canada's arrest of Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer of Huawei, the giant Chinese technology company.

And in a wide-ranging indictment, the U.S. Justice Department described what it called a yearslong campaign by Beijing to steal American technological secrets, to allow Chinese companies to undercut competitors and to help bolster its military.

And North Korea said it would not dismantle its nuclear weapons program until the U.S. lessened its military capacity, confirming that the North's position on denuclearization remains unchanged despite President Trump and Kim Jong-un's meeting in Singapore in June.

_____

* #MeToo in Australia

The actress Yael Stone's allegations of sexual misconduct against Geoffrey Rush were widely discussed because of her story's complexity of complicity -- and because of strict Australian libel laws that keep many victims silent.

Ms. Stone, above, confided in our Op-Ed editor and writer Bari Weiss. Join Ms. Weiss and our Australia bureau chief, Damien Cave, from 10-10:45 a.m. Sydney time for a phone conversation about the case.

* Climate change: Wildfires, hurricanes, drenching rains -- as in India, above -- and drought ravaged communities around the world. Temperatures reached new highs (check the change in your own area). Arctic ice melted more rapidly than ever. Will nations follow through on a global climate framework agreed upon in Poland?

* Trade: The U.S. and China, two of the world's largest economies, spent the year engaged in a tit-for-tat trade war. The global economy appears to be slowing down, and rising U.S. interest rates are worrying markets.

* Privacy: A Times investigation revealed that a consulting firm, Cambridge Analytica, used private Facebook data to help President Trump's campaign, raising alarming questions about Silicon Valley's privacy practices. Months later, we found that the social network gave Microsoft, Amazon, Spotify and others far greater access to people's data than it had disclosed. And we learned that location data pulled from your phone apps is more personal (and public) than companies say it is.

* Migration: A record 68.5 million people, including people fleeing war in Syria and persecution in Myanmar, were forcibly displaced by the end of 2017. Venezuela's misery is causing a refugee crisis in South America, above, and migrants are piling up at the U.S. border with Mexico. Migration may increase with climate change, and migrants are the targets of anti-immigration rhetoric around the world.

* President Trump's legal troubles: getting more serious. Many of the investigations into Mr. Trump's business dealings, potential campaign finance violations and whether his campaign had connections to Russia could come to a head in the new year, particularly with Democrats taking control of the House.

* Russia: The country's increasingly aggressive behavior, including the attempted assassination of a former Russian spy, Sergei Skripal, and his daughter on British soil, worsened relations between the Kremlin and many Western allies.

* Saudi Arabia: The brutal killing of a dissident journalist, Jamal Khashoggi, shone a harsh light on Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, who is believed to have ordered the assassination, and also on Saudi Arabia's broader human rights abuses, particularly in the Yemen war. None of this was good optics for the prince's plans to engage international investors and move the Saudi economy away from oil.

* Brexit: Prime Minister Theresa May tried to steer Britain through one of its biggest political crises, but Parliament still has to vote on the deal she struck with the E.U. on the country's planned departure from the bloc in March. The throughline is ""uncertainty.""

* North Korea: This year saw the first one-on-one between a sitting U.S. president and a leader of North Korea, at a splashy summit meeting in Singapore. But progress toward the denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula has since stalled.

* Nationalism: From Hungary to Brazil, the march of nationalism and populism continued. But in some arenas -- Canada, for instance, and much of the business world -- affirmations of global engagement countered the narrative.

#MeToo: The testimonies of Judge Brett Kavanaugh and Christine Blasey Ford, who accused the U.S. Supreme Court nominee of sexual assault, along with Judge Kavanaugh's subsequent confirmation, highlighted the country's deep, lingering gender divide.

Back Story

Today is the Northern Hemisphere's winter solstice, also known as the shortest day of the year -- shorthand for the day that gets the least sunlight.

Some of us earthlings may grumble about the darkness. But without it, we might not be alive.

Seasons occur because most planets do not spin perfectly upright like a top. The earth's ""axial tilt"" is a jaunty 23.5 degrees, for example, while Uranus, above, spins at 98 degrees, or nearly sideways.

The earth's tilt is good for humans because it helps to moderate our sun exposure. Our four seasons are comparatively mild and, thanks to our proximity to the sun, fairly brief.

Much of Uranus, by contrast, spends winters in permanent darkness and summers under constant sunlight. And those seasons last decades in Earth years.

""If there were creatures on Uranus -- and I don't think there are -- seasonal affective disorder would be a lifetime thing,"" the planetary scientist Heidi Hammel told The Times.

Mike Ives, a reporter in our Hong Kong office, wrote today's Back Story.

10,the new york times,"The editorial board represents the opinions of the board, its editor and the publisher. It is separate from the newsroom and the Op-Ed section.

Three Canadian citizens being detained by China appear to have become pawns in a political impasse between the two countries and, by extension, the United States. They should be released immediately.

China, already an aggressive rising power known to flout the rule of law and disregard human rights, now seems to be using hostage-taking to resolve economic and diplomatic disputes.

Making matters worse, President Trump has chosen to get involved, seemingly playing his own games to gain leverage in bitter trade talks with China.

The president suggested that he might intervene to secure the release of a prominent Chinese businesswoman arrested in Canada at the request of American authorities on Dec. 1 if it would lead to a favorable trade deal with Beijing.

That reinforced the suspicions of many in China who think that the United States is using the businesswoman, Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer of the giant Chinese technology company Huawei, as a hostage, too.

As acknowledged by the Chinese government on Thursday, Beijing is now holding a ""female Canadian citizen,"" identified as Sarah McIver, in addition to Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, who were detained earlier this month.

Although Mr. Kovrig is understood to have been seen once by a Canadian consular office, few details about the three Canadians, their conditions and the charges against them have been released. It is not unusual for prisoners detained by China to be held in solitary confinement with the lights on 24 hours a day and be subject to prolonged interrogation, even torture.

China's legal system is opaque and weighted overwhelmingly in favor of the government and against the ordinary people who get caught up in it.

The Foreign Ministry said Ms. McIver had been working illegally, and it's not clear that her case is related to that of the two others. Mr. Kovrig, a former Canadian diplomat working for the International Crisis Group, a Washington nongovernmental research group, and Mr. Spavor, an entrepreneur specializing in business with North Korea, were reportedly being investigated over ""activities that endanger China's national security.""

Such moves are likely to chill the atmosphere in China for other diplomats and foreign businesspeople trying to work there.

But the detentions appear to be less a function of the personal activities of the three Canadians than retaliation for Canada's arrest of Ms. Meng. She was picked up in Vancouver at the request of the United States while she was traveling to Mexico from Hong Kong.

At a bail hearing, Canadian prosecutors said Ms. Meng was suspected of helping banks violate United States sanctions against Iran. She is now out on bail while awaiting extradition to the United States, a process that could take weeks or even months.

The arrests have added a complicating layer to an already bitter trade war between the United States and China. They have drawn a sharp protest from the Chinese government, rattled financial markets and raised suspicions among Chinese officials that at least some Trump administration officials were trying to sabotage a trade deal.

Huawei and Ms. Meng, the daughter of the company's founder, are part of China's corporate elite, and her detention has brought huge domestic political pressure on President Xi Jinping.

Global Times, a newspaper aligned with the Chinese Communist Party, said that the impasse could be resolved quickly by Canada's dropping all charges against Ms. Meng. ""It is quite simple to end the crisis between China and Canada by giving back Meng's complete freedom,"" the newspaper wrote, most likely echoing the views of top officials.

There is so far no evidence that Ms. Meng's arrest is anything more than a part of the Trump administration's aggressive enforcement of the sanctions regime against Iran.

But Mr. Trump recently gave doubters an opening when he suggested he would intervene with the Justice Department in the Huawei case if it would help secure a trade deal with Beijing. The implication was that he might trade her for the two Canadians held at the time he made that statement.

""If I think it's good for the country, if I think it's good for what will be certainly the largest trade deal ever made -- which is a very important thing -- what's good for national security -- I would certainly intervene if I thought it was necessary,"" Mr. Trump told Reuters in an interview.

Such interference in a judicial process would undermine the rule of law and encourage countries to detain each other's citizens as a weapon of economic and political warfare.

11,the new york times,"Many of Ahmed Abdulwahab's family members have made it out of Yemen, but his wife is stuck in Djibouti because of the travel ban, and his modest income is no match for the expenses.

Ahmed Abdulwahab's family has survived airstrikes and firefights. They endured daylong drives across crumbled roads and on mountain ledges so steep it felt as if gravity would surely bring them tumbling down.

Mr. Abdulwahab has crossed into Yemen territory controlled by various factions: Al Qaeda, Houthi rebels and the government, all to get his wife, mother and young daughter out of the country and into the United States. An American citizen, Mr. Abdulwahab described the weekslong journey as the most terrifying travel of his life.

But now he's up against one final obstacle: the United States State Department.

Mr. Abdulwahab, 32, is one of hundreds of Yemeni-Americans in New York who were separated from non-U. S. citizen spouses or children following the Trump administration's so-called travel ban, which severely restricts entry into the United States by people from seven countries, five of them Muslim-majority.

Some, like Mr. Abdulwahab's wife, Aisha Mahyoub, 30, were approved for a visa only to have it revoked once the ban went into effect. Such an action violated the terms of the ban, according to a lawsuit filed on Monday by the Center for Constitutional Rights, a legal advocacy organization based in New York. Three other Yemeni-Americans are involved in the case, which follows a similar class-action suit filed in September on behalf of more than 100 others.

(The New York Times was able to verify much of Mr. Abdulwahab's story, though parts of his family's travel within Yemen cannot be independently verified.)

For many Yemeni-Americans, like Mr. Abdulwahab, the cost of supporting family members in countries like Djibouti, home to the nearest American consulate, has been crippling.

In July, one Yemeni-American man committed suicide in Louisiana after succumbing to the economic strain of supporting his wife and five children after they were denied visas in Djibouti -- located across the Red Sea in the Horn of Africa -- where rent can be six times as much as in Yemen.

Mr. Abdulwahab estimates the process of getting family members out of Yemen has already cost him $40,000. To care for his wife in Djibouti, he pays $1,500 a month for rent (such a high cost because the city caters to the foreign community), $400 for electricity, $300 for food and $200 to a woman who sometimes lends Ms. Mahyoub a hand.

In New York, he pitches in $700 for rent at his brother's apartment, pays $500 for his own shared apartment and sends whatever money remains to relatives in Yemen, where goods have become prohibitively expensive -- and children are starving as a result.

In Yemen, Lavish Meals for Few, Starvation for Many and a Dilemma for ReportersNov. 29, 2018

The expenses mostly exhaust the $3,500-$4,000 on average he earns per month as an Uber driver in New York City.

""I don't know what else to do,"" said Mr. Abdulwahab, his watery brown eyes framed in thin-rimmed, rectangular glasses. ""I can't bring her here, I can't bring her back to Yemen. I just keep hoping that one day it will be over and we will be together.""

A soft-spoken man, Mr. Abdulwahab lives in a one-bedroom apartment he shares with two roommates in Bay Ridge, Brooklyn. Every morning, he wakes up at 3:30 a.m., showers, dresses and checks his wife's status on the consulate website. He also checks the pictures of her on his phone -- her delicate cheekbones and perfectly pink lips simultaneously at his fingertips and 7,000 miles away.

Mr. Abdulwahab was born in Yemen. Because his father is an American citizen and lived in New York, Mr. Abdulwahab moved to the United States in 2006 and was eventually granted United States citizenship. He frequently traveled between the United States and Yemen, often spending time with his sister's friend, who would become his future wife.

The couple finally married eight years ago in a wedding hall in Al Hudaydah, Yemen's main port city and her hometown.

When Mr. Abdulwahab left later that year to go back to the United States, he planned to complete a certificate program in Queens, get a job and then apply for his new bride to join him in America. In the meantime, Ms. Mahyoub settled in with her in-laws in Taiz, waiting patiently for years as Mr. Abdulwahab came and left, and their first daughter, Areg, was born.

But when the war between Houthi rebels and government forces broke out in early 2015, the security in Taiz deteriorated. The changes came slowly at first: A few airstrikes hit the town. Houthi rebels set up checkpoints. Then one night, airstrikes rained down, destroying apartment buildings just blocks from Ms. Mahyoub's home.

""We were very afraid, it was like death was staring at us,"" she said in a phone interview from Djibouti.

As the strikes briefly subsided, Ms. Mahyoub and her parents-in-law went to Mr. Abdulwahab's grandfather's house in the mountains. There Ms. Mahyoub finally called her husband for the first time in several days.

Mr. Abdulwahab panicked. They could not wait, he thought.

The application process took two years, but in 2017 Mr. Abdulwahab was notified that his mother, wife and daughter were scheduled for an interview at the American consulate in Djibouti, the final step of the visa application process. With commercial flights to Aden temporarily suspended because of the fighting, Mr. Abdulwahab booked a flight to Oman and made his way by bus and taxi to his family in Taiz, traversing Al Qaeda-controlled land and then into government territory.

By the time they all reached Djibouti, he thought the worst was behind them. His mother, Areg and his wife, now pregnant with their second child, completed their interviews in October 2017. Ms. Mahyoub was issued a document that stated that she had been approved for a visa and just needed to wait for it to be printed.

Areg and Mr. Abdulwahab's mother, Saoud Khaled, 70, were issued their travel documents within nine days, but Ms. Mahyoub received nothing. Finally, in February 2018, she was told that her visa approval was being overturned because of the travel ban.

""I never even dreamed they would approve Areg and not me,"" said Ms. Mahyoub. ""How was I supposed to be left behind?""

Now Areg and her grandmother live a block away from Mr. Abdulwahab with his brother, his brother's wife and their five children. There is more space in their apartment, more cousins around to help care for Areg, now four years old, but she still yearns to be with her father.

One recent December afternoon, Areg sensed that her father was preparing to leave the apartment. She jumped into his lap, tiny tears trickling down her cheeks.

Mr. Abdulwahab relented and, taking her hand, led her to Yemen Cafe, a few blocks down the road on 5th Avenue. At the cafe, Areg asked where her mother was. Mr. Abdulwahab never knows how to respond. Squirming in the corner booth, she was blissfully unaware that her mother was in Djibouti and that her father was spending every dollar he had to care for her there.

""Now I can't save money, whatever I earn I spend on my family,"" he says. ""Sometimes I feel like I can't handle it, how can I handle it? It is too much.""

Mr. Abdulwahab calls his wife every morning from his car, the sound of her soft voice cutting in and out over Djibouti's unreliable network. As they talk, the unspoken questions hangs in the air: Will they ever be reunited in America?

""Inshallah,"" he says. God willing.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/17/nyregion/uber-driver-yemen-wife-trump.html
12,the new york times,"Hi. Welcome to On Politics, your guide to the day in national politics. I'm Lisa Lerer, your host.

During the Trump era, Democrats have largely been able to avoid making tough choices. With little power, their most pressing question has been whether to object to everything the president does or just, you know, most things.

That all ends in two weeks.

When they take over control of the House in January, Democrats will gain real legislative and investigative power -- and will carry the burden of making decisions. And the three dozen Democrats flirting with a presidential run will quickly have to decide whether to actually take the plunge.

With all of those decisions over the next year, there's sure to be a robust debate about what the future of the Democratic Party looks like. A big part of that discussion will center on the progressive wing -- what they want, what they believe and how they're shaping the presidential race.

We were curious what the conversation inside that progressive wing sounds like. So we spoke to three people who have recently taken the helm of some of the country's biggest liberal groups: Nina Turner of Our Revolution, Maurice Mitchell of the Working Families Party and Yvette Simpson of Democracy for America.

It was an expansive, 45-minute conversation, which we had to condense quite a bit for the newsletter. Here's what they had to say about their new roles, 2020 and how progressivism is changing.

LISA: So you three are all relatively new in your jobs. Nina, you took the helm at Our Revolution about 18 months ago. Maurice, you started as the director of the Working Families Party in April. And Yvette, you'll become the CEO of Democracy for America next year.

What do your appointments say about the state of the progressive movement?

NINA TURNER: One of the top goals of this movement is first recognizing that it is a truly multiracial movement. A lot of times when people see the faces of the ""progressive movement"" they tend to think that the movement is very white, but the movement is really, you know, to borrow from Reverend Jesse Jackson, the ""rainbow coalition."" To have at this moment in history three very dynamic African-American leaders leading organizations in the progressive movement, just our very presence is a symbol.

MAURICE MITCHELL: What I would also add is that this movement is not about one election. I think a role for our movement is expanding people's understanding of what democracy is and making sure that they see themselves in it. This idea that Bernie (Sanders) said -- in fact both Bernie and Trump said -- that the system is rigged, right? So in order to un-rig the system, we need a new type of politics that confronts the systemic challenges and is willing to do big things. We don't want to play small ball.

YVETTE SIMPSON: The shift for our organizations hopefully will be a rallying cry for what we should see in the Democratic establishment. We want to see people of color represented not just at the bottom, but we expect to see those individuals in leadership. And then when you do that, not only do you get average results, but you get even better results.

It's the idea that when brown and black people lead us, we not only take care of brown and black people, we take care of all the people.

You all mentioned that there's this perception that ""progressive"" means white. Why do you think that has persisted?

MM: It's a historical inaccuracy. Our presence at the helm of these organizations is a corrective one because black folks have always played this critical role. But I think the reality is black folks haven't always been in leadership.

If you look at a traditional Democratic Party, unfortunately, black folks and the issues of black folks haven't always been front and center, even though our vote and our movements and our strategies have been utilized in order to get elected. But I feel like this is a political realignment that we're experiencing, where black leadership is central.

YS: The face of the progressive movement, in my experience, has been very white, and I think that was less the reality and more maybe what was put out front. People most associated that with white, traditionally, maybe more male.

But what Maurice is saying, and what Nina said, is that is just not true.

NT: I'm amen-ing everything that my sister and my brother said. You know, there is a saying that said that if the hunter writes the story, then the lion's story is never told. So that's the same thing I feel about this movement. The lens by which it is written about leaves out so many people because the hunter -- i.e. the neoliberal class, or the class of people that have the most power -- they tell the story. It benefits folks to write that story in that way.

But I would argue that progressivism is by its very nature black, because you have to be progressive when you fight against the system that is treating you like a second-class citizen. Hopefully our very presence as the leaders of three very strong organizations says to the world, you need to tell the story differently. Now the lion is telling the story.

We're having a conversation that's a lot about representation. And we could see a presidential field with multiple African-American candidates and multiple female candidates. What advice would you be giving those people?

YS: Black women matter. We want to see candidates who are engaging with black women, with black people on the ground, making sure that those in these communities are not only heard but are front and center in the work that you plan to do, in your calculus as you think about how you're going to navigate this country over the course of the campaign. We don't want you just knocking on the door when you're running.

Number two, this is the time to be bold and be unapologetic in your agenda. And we want to see that. People who have been on the bubble too long, they use words like bipartisanship. The person down on the ground could care less about how you would get along with the person next to you. They want to know whether you're going make a change, if you've got to do that by hook or by crook, by any means necessary. They want to see change in their real lives.

I was preaching there a little bit, Nina, did you see that?

NT: So it's no secret, you know, if Bernie Sanders decides to run, who I will support. But amen to everything that Yvette just said. She's absolutely right -- the only people who talk in terms of who's Republican and who's Democrat are people here in this Beltway. But the average, everyday person in this country does not have that conversation when they're talking about how to pay their bills. They're not talking about those issues when they still have dirty water in Flint.

And in 2020 we have a pivotal opportunity to do some course-correction in the country and hopefully give people a real choice. And I'm going to say to Democrats not to equivocate at all who they are standing for, because we already know who the Republican president is standing for. So this 2020 opportunity, this is real in the field. It's go time.

MM: Man, I'm getting excited.

What I would say is we're not going to fall for the ""okie dokie,"" in the sense that somebody could just signal through cultural signifiers and identity that they're down with a particular set of politics or a movement. People have to show and prove, not just based on the fact that they might occupy a certain identity. We need to see it in their voting record, in the issues that they champion.

It's easy in the moment of the ""resistance"" to signal that you're down with the resistance. But I'm less interested in what you're against -- I'm interested in what you're for. The prerequisite for sanity in this country is to have an opposition to the Trump movement. What sways me is what you're trying to build. Which side were you on previous to the moment that you decided to take the mantle?

NT: Can I just say, amen. I'm sorry Lisa, I am shouting across the office right now because my sister and my brother just put ten thousand exclamation points. We will be rolling the tape.

Trump vs. the Fed

The Federal Reserve raised interest rates on Wednesday, against the wishes of President Trump. We were curious about Mr. Trump's history with the Fed, so we asked Binyamin Appelbaum, who covers economic policy for The Times, for the back story. Here's what he told us:

It was only last November that President Trump and Jerome H. Powell walked together into the White House Rose Garden, where Mr. Trump introduced Mr. Powell as his choice to become the chairman of the Federal Reserve.

""He's strong,"" said Mr. Trump. ""He's committed. He's smart.""

But that was before Mr. Powell started raising interest rates.

Now Mr. Trump has taken to describing Mr. Powell as a ""good man"" who keeps making mistakes. The Fed, he says, should stop raising rates. Its march toward higher rates is ""crazy,"" ""foolish,"" ""out of control.""

What happened to the warm regard Mr. Trump expressed just one year ago? The short answer is that Mr. Trump fears Mr. Powell, who holds a job sometimes described as the second-most powerful in Washington.

Two key facts: The Fed is an independent agency; it answers to Congress, not the president. And it has considerable influence over the re-election prospects of any president, because it can drive the economy into a recession.

Unlike many past Fed-White House duos, Mr. Trump and Mr. Powell do not have a personal relationship. They have rarely spoken with each other, although they have plenty of mutual acquaintances. Most notably, Mr. Powell regularly eats breakfast with the Treasury secretary, Steven Mnuchin.

Presidents often seek to put pressure on the Fed through such private channels, although it sometimes takes decades for the details to emerge.

Mr. Trump, unusually, has decided to go public with his grievances, and Mr. Powell has responded with public displays of grim-faced, insistent indifference. The Fed, he says, does not take advice from politicians. It does not answer to the president. ""Nothing,"" he said on Wednesday, after announcing another rate increase, ""will deter us from doing exactly what we think is the right thing to do.""

Mr. Trump, in his more reflective moments of public commentary, has said that he misjudged a man he barely knew. As Mr. Trump said of Mr. Powell in October, sounding rather glum, ""He was supposed to be a low interest rate guy.""

13,the new york times,"During his campaign, President Trump captured the imagination of his supporters with the promise of a 1,000-mile-long wall on the border with Mexico. Though construction of an actual wall has not begun, and funding for it has yet to be provided by Congress, the symbolism and reality of what it means has grown. In many ways, a wall already exists and it takes many forms. Since March, when Mr. Trump visited San Diego to view prototypes of the wall, New York Times photojournalists have traveled to the border to document the struggle of migrants trying to reach the United States and the efforts of the authorities to stop them. We asked six of those photojournalists -- Mauricio Lima, Todd Heisler, Meghan Dhaliwal, Tamir Kalifa, Lynsey Addario and Victor J. Blue -- to write about their experiences at the border and what the notion of a border wall means to them.

By Mauricio Lima

Orange bracelets worn as identification. An asylum seeker grasping a number on a tiny piece of paper. Makeshift shacks. Flooded, muddy fields. Wet belongings. Inadequate meals. Improvised, open-air communal showers. Children, women and men living together in overcrowded tents miles from home.

Among nearly 4,000 migrants living in precarious conditions in an athletic center-turned-shelter near the United States border, there was a surprising spirit of generosity and mutual respect. Despite their traumatic tales of violence and persecution at the hands of drug traffickers, and political instability in their home countries, many of the families I came across still dreamed of crossing the border and starting life anew.

By Todd Heisler

In addition to razor wire, fencing and other physical barriers, a vast network of technology and law enforcement guards the United States' southern border. And beyond that long, meandering line that runs east to west are the poverty, violence and political oppression that drive migrants north, to an economy that is dependent on their labor. There are walls, real and metaphorical, that separate most Americans from the people cooking in kitchens and working in fields, from the children living in shelters, making it hard to comprehend how any of this actually works. There is a great chasm between the rancher in New Mexico who crosses paths with smugglers on a regular basis and Americans who live hundreds of miles from a port of entry. Talk to any of them and you probably won't hear what you expected. It's complicated.

It was just after dark, on the banks of the Rio Grande in Laredo, Tex., just a couple of hundred yards from an outlet mall. Border Patrol agents were walking slowly along the river, following several men on inner tubes trying to cross over from Mexico. ""¿Dónde están?"" the agents called into the dark. Voices responded, giving their location. They knew full well they would be caught if they made it to the other side, so they turned back. I was struck by the banter, the banality of this recurring game of cat and mouse along the southern border.

Many of the Border Patrol agents I have met come from the communities they serve and have family on either side of the border. Some are immigrants themselves.

I remember the first time I saw people turning themselves in at the border. It was broad daylight and about 30 women and children from Central America crossed the Rio Grande and walked right up to Border Patrol agents. One woman had a child who was merely months old.

This summer, even after the policy of separating immigrant children from their parents became well known, families were still crossing the border to request asylum. And those who didn't cross the border illegally, either out of respect for the law or a lack of means to hire smugglers, lined the dozen International Bridges in the Rio Grande Valley. They waited in the scorching heat, sometimes for days, to make their pleas.

Trump Wants a Border Wall. See What's in Place Already.Feb. 5, 2018

By Meghan Dhaliwal

The United States-Mexico border wall in Tijuana is just that: a wall. But it is also a gathering point, a swirling sea of people waiting for their opportunity to cross -- be they commuters heading to work in the morning or asylum seekers curled in blankets.

Words are spoken, cried, screamed and sung along the length of the fence. Prayers rise up into the night sky from a group of Central American asylum seekers near one of the ports of entry. Tears stream quietly down the faces of those who know that a new, unknown journey is beginning when United States Customs and Border Protection officers finally accept them in to begin the asylum process.

Miles away, on the beach, pressed up against the part of the wall in Mexico that juts into the Pacific Ocean, whispers intermingle with the sound of the waves. A group of teenagers examine the wall, stretching their hands through the bars to touch the chain-link fence reinforcing the other side, while talking about ocean tides. Their eyes measure how far the wall stretches into the sea.

Conversations pass through the bars of the wall, the speakers separated by a few feet and an entire world. Their faces sandwiched between the cold bars of the wall will be the closest some families can get for years -- voices reaching one another but still too far to feel the touch of their loved one.

The wall is just a wall, but it is also a silent witness to all those who cross or wait in its shadow.

As the Trump administration's ""zero tolerance"" immigration policy occupied the nation's attention in June, Ismael Grimaldo stood quietly in the shadow of the United States-Mexico border fence that runs through Brownsville, Tex., sipping a soft drink from a foam cup. Mr. Grimaldo wanted to get a closer look at the Rio Grande while he waited to meet his uncle at a downtown park. He rested his foot on the rust-colored steel fence, constructed a decade ago to stem illegal immigration, as he passed the time.

Days later and less than a mile away, a group of Central American migrants fleeing political turmoil and gang violence waited patiently before a different type of barrier: two Customs and Border Protection officers and a bronze plaque marking the boundary of the United States and Mexico. There, on the Brownsville & Matamoros International Bridge, they hoped for a chance to cross and ask for asylum.

That bridge and others across the border between Texas and Mexico have become the last stop on an arduous journey for migrants who choose not to cross illegally and instead are seeking a path to protection in the United States. Many arrive only to be told that entry ports are full. This so-called metering policy forced dozens of men, women and children to wait until there was space for them. In June, the wait lasted days. Months later, with new migrants still arriving, the wait was significantly longer.

I visited these bridges in June while on assignment for The New York Times. As temperatures rose with the sun, individuals and families sought shelter from the heat beneath colorful umbrellas. Plastic tarps were tied to the razor-wire-topped fences to block the afternoon sun. People used water bottles for showers and dental hygiene.

I asked one 30-year-old man, who left Honduras with his wife and four children, why he had chosen to wait. He told me he wanted to do the right thing and provide a positive example for his children.

Conditions were grim but spirits were not. A steady flow of supplies and food donations from passers-by and local aid groups boosted morale. As temperatures fell, laughter punctured the tense atmosphere and children turned the bridge's narrow walkway into a playground. At one point they saw a Border Patrol boat passing below them and waved enthusiastically. The agents waved back.

Eventually, an officer's voice would cut through the noise and in a moment, there would be a few less people on the bridge the only reminder of their passing, the piles of blankets left behind on the pavement.

For these migrants, the hope of asylum was more effective at preventing illegal entry than a physical obstacle. Still, those desperate for a better future will continue to risk everything, including the possibility of deportation, for a chance at life in America.

I used to imagine the wall as an infinite line of two-story-high concrete that traced the United States-Mexico border without a break. But when I finally went south, I realized that a wall can take many forms. There are places -- roughly 700 miles of the almost 2,000-mile border -- where the wall is indeed a hulking structure of concrete or steel, shooting up into the sky along invisible lines that divide towns, property and, sometimes, extended families. This wall appears as abruptly and jarringly as it disappears, simply giving way to the rigors of the terrain: a natural reserve, someone's backyard, private land, a berm.

But along other parts of the border, the ""wall"" is a patch of dense, gnarled thorn brush. Or a blimp or a drone in the sky. Or a movement-triggered device tethered to a tree at common crossing point. Sometimes it seems as if the wall is the Rio Grande itself. I often also felt that the wall was human: At any given hour, thousands of Border Patrol agents drive along the periphery of the United States in trucks and A.T.V.s, or they ride atop horses led by dogs trained to sniff out migrants running for their lives.

As I trailed agents to-and-fro at all hours of the day and night through the southern edge of the Rio Grande Valley, the vigilant hunt for people reminded me of the countless military patrols I accompanied while embedded in Afghanistan and Iraq. Information is passed from Border Patrol command centers through earpieces and radios. When the orders came and the chase began, we jumped fences, ran through opaque fog, crawled on our hands and knees through the woods guided by a headlamp or flashlight. Instinctively, I tried to avoid nonexistent land mines and improvised explosive devices by following precisely in the steps of the agents running ahead of me -- a habit I haven't shaken from my years covering war, where I.E.D.s killed and maimed soldiers and journalists routinely.

Sometimes we scrambled for hours, and sometimes the chase was quick. As we crisscrossed people's properties and searched abandoned sheds -- often used as temporary safe houses for cover -- local dogs betrayed migrants' positions with their frenetic barking. Once, we found an abandoned ladder on the American side of the wall, and several times we happened upon footprints across a grassy field, headed toward the unknown. They made it.

A wall -- in whatever form it takes -- may be a deterrent to those trying to enter the United States illegally, but after covering refugees and migrants for almost two decades, in countries all over the world, I know there is a common thread that binds them all: No wall can stop a person fleeing violence or persecution or extreme poverty -- or pursuing the dream of a better life.

There has long been a wall in place between the United States and Mexico, and it's made of many things. Steel, concrete, gravel, sand. Scrubland, mountain, river.

In some places the wall is made of excess, in others it's made of privation. It's been built up by the uncertainty of our future, and rises from the accretion of our history.

Vice and virtue. Innocence and experience. Irony and paradox, mendacity and protection. The wall is the cartels and the coyotes and our darkest impulses. It's our appetites and addictions. It's made of promise and fantasy and hard, hard reality. The wall is protests and detention centers and car chases and sorties. It travels on horseback, on A.T.V.s, in white and green Suburbans; it is raised by the surveillance of drones and spotter planes and helicopters.

Maybe more than anything, the wall is made of longing.

When you drive west out of El Paso across the New Mexico line and follow State Road 9, then turn south a bit after Puerto Palomas, you will run into the border. Drive long enough on the dirt road and you will come to where the wall grows. From a distance it looks like a thin row of dark, rusting pines joined at the top. It replaces a long, low barrier stretching east. The panels of the new sections lie stacked on the other side of the road like a long freight train frozen in the dust. Harsh and beautiful treeless desert spills out on all sides, indistinguishable in flora or feature from one side of the border to the other. Depending on your perspective, the new wall gapes like a wound or binds like a bandage as it rises against the falling sun.

If you spend any amount of time reporting on the border and the people living on either side of it, eventually you are struck by the realization that it's much wider than it is long. The actual wall -- the sum of official and unofficial policy, of economic and family ties, of criminality and enforcement, of deprivation, and plenty -- stretches much farther north to south. I've seen it reach deep into misty mountain towns like Todos Santos in rural Guatemala, 1,000 miles from the Rio Grande, where Mam-speaking villagers have scrambled along it for decades to build new communities in Grand Rapids, Mich., and Oakland, Calif. Or wind its way north, across the Idaho plains to St. Anthony, 1,100 miles away, where it divides families living between there and Jalisco, Mexico.

We have built this wall over decades. Whether this new phase of it rises or falls, the wall will continue to grow or diminish according to our fears and values. It remains an expression of our most public and darkly private ideas of what it means to be a citizen, an American, a foreigner, a family, a neighbor or a stranger.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/20/us/mexico-border-photos.html
14,the new york times,"BRENTWOOD, Md. -- Tomas Guevara fell in love with Ruth Ayala years before they met. Her brothers -- like Mr. Guevara, Salvadoran immigrants living outside Washington -- talked about her at church. She was hardworking and kind, they said, devoted to her family and her faith.

Then Mr. Guevara saw Ms. Ayala's photo; her big brown eyes, her warm smile. He decided to give her a call.

At the time, Mr. Guevara had been living in the United States for six years. Bright and ambitious, he left El Salvador in 1999, at age 18, thinking there were few opportunities for him at home. His country had been a casualty the year before of Hurricane Mitch, which decimated Central America, leaving more than 10,000 dead.

Mr. Guevara trekked through Mexico, stopping in towns along the way to pick up odd jobs. In 2001, he swam across the Rio Grande, and applied and was approved for temporary protected status, a program that allows citizens of certain countries affected by natural disasters, armed conflict or other strife to live in the United States.

He settled near relatives in Maryland and worked construction jobs by day while studying English, earning a high school equivalency diploma and learning plumbing at night. He became a licensed plumber and sent money back to his family in El Salvador. But he was lonely. Then he called Ms. Ayala.

The conversation flowed easily. ""I could tell she was sincere,"" Mr. Guevara, now 37, said through an interpreter in an interview last month at his family's home, outside Washington.

Soon the couple was talking for hours each night before bed. Four years later, Mr. Guevara traveled back to El Salvador with a ring in his pocket. The couple married in 2011 in San Salvador and spent three happy months together before Mr. Guevara had to return to the United States.

Mr. Guevara returned to El Salvador about once a year to see his wife. After she became pregnant, the distance between them took on new poignancy.

""It was a very emotional time,"" Ms. Ayala, 35, recalled, through an interpreter. ""I was so happy to finally become a mother, but, of course, it was difficult because you want your husband to be there to support you.""

In 2013, Ms. Ayala gave birth to a son, Isaac, while Mr. Guevara, 3,000 miles away, waited for news. During their nightly chats, Ms. Ayala would put the phone to Isaac's ear so he could hear his father's voice. She sent photos and videos each day. When Isaac was 9 months old, Mr. Guevara traveled to El Salvador to meet his son, holding his hands as the child took his first toddling steps along the beach.

When Mr. Guevara returned to Maryland, he began researching ways to bring his wife and child to his new home. He turned to the International Rescue Committee, one of the eight organizations supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund.

A caseworker told him about the Central American Minors program, begun in 2014, which allowed the children of parents with temporary protected status to apply for permanent residency as refugees. As Isaac's mother and Mr. Guevara's wife, Ms. Ayala was also eligible.

""The program for refugees was a light for us,"" Ms. Ayala said. She felt unsafe in El Salvador as gang violence and crime increased. The country's homicide rate in 2015 was more than double the 2013 rate, though it has since decreased.

In the fall of 2016, Ms. Ayala and Isaac boarded a plane to the United States. It was the first trip to America for both of them. ""I felt so many emotions,"" she said. ""Great joy and excitement, but also sadness to leave everyone behind. All I had was my suitcase and my son.""

Mr. Guevara, meanwhile, had been working to prepare a home. He rented a small apartment and bought furniture, cooking utensils and toys. ""It was a dream come true,"" he said. ""I got everything ready for us to start our lives as a family.""

Ms. Ayala registered for English classes at a community college. She soon found a job with Hispanos Sin Fronteras, or Hispanics Without Borders, which helps people with career placement. Isaac adjusted easily, learning English, becoming enamored with ""Paw Patrol"" and racing around the parking lot behind their home.

Early last year, the family grew again with the birth of a daughter, Rebecca. Now cans of baby formula sit next to plumbing manuals and English textbooks in the family's sparse apartment.

But the family fears their safe and stable home is threatened. In January 2018, the Trump administration announced that temporary protected status for people from El Salvador would end in September 2019. More than 200,000 Salvadorans who have lived in the country since 2001 would be affected by the decision. They must either return to El Salvador or be approved for another immigration program.

In October, a federal judge blocked the termination of the protected status for Salvadorans, but the administration is appealing.

Mr. Guevara and Ms. Ayala have again turned to the International Rescue Committee for assistance. Mr. Guevara has applied for permanent residency. If his application is not approved, they are not sure what they will do. Friends from El Salvador also living in the United States have begun selling off belongings to prepare to move to Canada.

The family believes they belong in their adopted country, where their daughter is a citizen. They dream of buying a home in the suburbs with a big lawn for the children. Mr. Guevara hopes to start his own plumbing company and teach others the trade. They try to protect Isaac from their worries about Mr. Guevara's immigration status.

""We're very hopeful that my husband's application will be approved,"" Ms. Ayala said. ""God has been very good to us. We're very hardworking people, and we just want to continue working hard for our family.""",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/05/neediest-cases/immigrants-el-salvador-irc.html
15,the new york times,"A Yemeni mother who fought to obtain a visa waiver to travel to California to see her terminally ill 2-year-old son was finally reunited last week with her only child.

On Friday night her son, Abdullah, died at the U.C.S.F. Benioff Children's Hospital in Oakland, where he was being treated for hypomyelination, a genetic degenerative brain condition, a spokesman for the Council on American-Islamic Relations, a Muslim advocacy group known as CAIR, said on Saturday.

""We are heartbroken. We had to say goodbye to our baby, the light of our lives,"" Abdullah's father, Ali Hassan, said in a statement. ""We want to thank everyone for your love and support at this difficult time.""

The family's plight received widespread attention in the news media and drew support from three members of Congress who wrote a letter to the State Department asking for an expedited decision on the visa waiver.

In October, the boy and his father journeyed from Cairo to Stockton, Calif., in search of better care. Mr. Hassan is an American citizen and a resident of Stockton.

Abdullah's mother, Shaima Swileh, a Yemeni citizen, could not go to California because people from Yemen were barred from entering the United States under President Trump's travel ban. Seven countries are included in the ban, most of them predominantly Muslim.

Obtaining a visa to visit the United States can be a long and arduous process.

The couple were married in Yemen in February 2016, and the next year they traveled to Cairo to apply for an I-130 visa, or a visa for a relative who is not American. Ms. Swileh had her first interview at the United States Embassy in Cairo in November 2017.

Ms. Swileh went to the embassy for her second interview in January, when she was told that because of the travel ban, her application could not proceed unless she qualified for a waiver, according to Mr. Hassan's lawyer. In August, she had a third interview and was told that the State Department was reviewing her eligibility.

During this time Abdullah's condition worsened, so Mr. Hassan brought his son to the United States without his wife.

In December, the Sacramento Valley office of CAIR and a law firm specializing in immigration filed a lawsuit in federal court stating that the embassy in Cairo had purposely delayed a decision on Ms. Swileh's application before the travel ban went into effect.

""This case is a perfect example of how the waiver process is a sham,"" Jennifer Nimer, one of the family's lawyers, said in a statement this month, adding that the embassy had ""callously ignored over 28 desperate pleas for help from the family over the past year and even the expedite requests filed by the prior attorney, which contained medical documentation showing that the child was on the verge of death.""

The State Department granted her a visa waiver on Dec. 18.

On Dec. 19, Ms. Swileh arrived in California and traveled to the hospital to visit her dying son, who was on life support.

""Dearest Abdullah, you will never be forgotten,"" CAIR Sacramento Valley wrote on Friday on Facebook. ""We belong to God and to Him we shall return.""",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/29/world/abdullah-hassan-yemeni-toddler-dies.html
16,the new york times,"[What you need to know to start your day: Get New York Today in your inbox.]

On late Sunday night a scuffle broke out between a New York police officer and five homeless men at a subway station in Manhattan. The officer single-handedly fended off all five with just his feet and his baton.

The scene was captured on video by a bystander and shared on social media, where it was viewed hundreds of thousands of times. But the officer, Syed Ali, had no idea the video had gone viral.

Then, at 5 a.m. on Monday, a fellow officer called Officer Ali and asked him if he had seen himself online.

Officer Ali, who does not use social media, did not know he had even been filmed.

""Holy cow, what the hell is this?"" he said he thought to himself after watching the video.

Many in New York and elsewhere had similar reactions.

""What extraordinary professionalism and bravery by NYPD Officer Syed Ali,"" Mayor Bill de Blasio said on Twitter on Tuesday. Bill Bratton, Mr. de Blasio's former police commissioner, agreed. And Councilman Chaim M. Deutsch, a Democrat from Brooklyn, presented Mr. Ali with a certificate and thanked him for showing ""restraint and discipline in how he de-escalated the situation.""

Officer Ali said he remembered certain things about the encounter: the trickle of sweat that ran down his neck, and the tension he felt during it.

But Officer Ali said he was glad it was filmed because it allowed him to reconstruct the episode.

""The tension and the adrenaline was at full throttle, where I couldn't even tell you the details the video is showing,"" he said. ""It may have saved me. Officers get crucified for garbage sometimes.""

The episode began when a woman at the East Broadway subway station on the Lower East Side told Officer Ali she was scared because a group of people were bothering her. He said he told the men to leave the station.

""That's when I saw they started becoming a little aggressive, more combative,"" he said. ""The video kind of shows what happened after that.""

As the men approached him, Officer Ali repeatedly told them to stay back. Officer Ali kicked one man to the ground who had gotten too close. That man got back up and started throwing punches. Officer Ali responded with his baton. Then the other men began to approach him.

A bystander helped separate Officer Ali from his assailants. But then a different man broke through the informal barricade and lunged at Officer Ali. The man tripped over his own leg, stumbled and fell onto the tracks.

Officer Ali remembered calling to have the power shut off to the third rail after the man fell onto the tracks. (Even as the men were attacking him, Officer Ali said, he was worried about their safety.)

But many other details caught on the video were lost to him in the fog of adrenaline.

""Looking at the video now from the outside, I'm like, 'Whoa, that was a pretty ugly situation,'"" he said.

The video was not the first time Officer Ali had gotten noticed online. He had achieved a small measure of attention after Customs and Border Protection detained him at Kennedy Airport in the early months of the Trump administration, even though he was a citizen, a New York police officer and a combat veteran who had spent two years in Kuwait.

Officer Ali credited that military training with helping him maintain his cool when the group of men were coming at him. He said he never even considered drawing his gun, because he didn't think the situation called for it.

""We've been taught to properly use a piece of equipment based on the situation,"" he said.

Three of the men involved in the episode will be charged with riot and obstructing governmental administration, the New York Police Department said in a statement Wednesday. One will also be charged with attempted assault.

Two of the men had been arrested by Wednesday night.

After the attack Sunday night, the men, who were highly intoxicated, were taken to a hospital, treated and released, the department said. They were not initially charged in connection with the attack but were arrested the next day when officers observed them sleeping in the subway station.

At the time of the arrests, the district attorney's office was not aware they were also connected to the attack in the video, the police department said.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/26/nyregion/nypd-homeless-attack-video.html
17,the new york times,"The mother of a child on life support in California was granted a visa waiver to enter the United States after her application was stalled because she is from Yemen, one of the countries included in President Trump's ban on travel from several predominantly Muslim countries.

The mother's plea to see her dying child received widespread news coverage in recent days, as the boy's father begged the federal government to allow his wife to enter the country.

The waiver was approved on Tuesday morning, and the mother, Shaima Swileh, 21, will land in San Francisco on Wednesday evening and see her son for the first time in months.

The boy, Abdullah, 2, has a degenerative brain condition and has been hospitalized at the U.C.S.F. Benioff Children's Hospital, in Oakland, Calif., since October.

The boy and his father, Ali Hassan, arrived in Stockton, Calif., from Cairo that month in search of better care. Mr. Hassan is an American citizen and a resident of Stockton.

Doctors realized soon after they arrived that Abdullah's condition was worsening and that his chances of survival were rapidly decreasing. They decided to place him on life support.

""I was hopeless,"" said Mr. Hassan, 22, in an interview. ""I literally did not know what to do with my life. My son was on life support, my wife was in Cairo and I was lonely.""

Mr. Hassan said he talked to his wife every day to update her on their son's deteriorating health.

""I would send her photos. I even made the doctors have a conference call with her, and they told her our son is not getting any better,"" Mr. Hassan said. ""It was a nightmare. All I got from her was pain and crying.""

Omar Jadwat, the director of the ACLU's Immigrants' Rights Project, said had it not been for the media attention surrounding the case, Ms. Swileh's visa application would likely still be pending.

""There is this waiver process that people can apply for, so you can apply to be essentially excluded from the ban,"" Mr. Jadwat said. ""But until there was a lot of news coverage with this family's situation, they didn't consider this a case that was worthy for a waiver.""

The couple married in Yemen in February 2016 and the following year they traveled to Cairo to apply for an I-130 visa, or a visa for a relative who is not American. Ms. Swileh had her first interview at the United States Embassy in Cairo last November.

""They got indications that things were going well,"" Saad Sweilem, Mr. Hassan's lawyer, said. ""They would check their case online and would reach out because of their sick baby.""

Ms. Swileh went to the embassy for her second interview in January, when she was informed that because of the travel ban, her application could not proceed unless she qualified for a waiver, Mr. Sweilem said. In August, Ms. Swileh was asked to come in for a third interview, where she was told that the State Department was reviewing her eligibility for the waiver.

As the couple waited, Abdullah's condition worsened, so Mr. Hassan made the harrowing decision to bring his son to the United States without his wife.

Last week, Mr. Hassan began considering removing his son from life support.

""I didn't know what to do, to be honest,"" Mr. Hassan said. ""He was on life support for a month and it isn't good for him.""

A social worker from the hospital reached out to the Council on American-Islamic Relations, a Muslim advocacy group known as CAIR. The organization put Mr. Hassan in touch with Mr. Sweilem on Friday.

Mr. Hassan received a call early Tuesday morning telling him that his wife had been granted a waiver. ""That was the best feeling I've ever had in my life,"" Mr. Hassan said.

He has not yet decided how he wants to proceed with his son's medical care, and plans to speak with his wife. ""I will let her make that decision.""",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/18/us/yemen-mom-travel-ban-dying-son.html
18,the new york times,"MEXICO CITY -- The deaths of two Guatemalan children in Border Patrol custody raised a furor in the United States, but drew a far more muted response in their own country, where a government focused on its survival is afraid that antagonizing the Trump administration could end American support.

The children, Felipe Gómez Alonso, 8, and Jakelin Caal Maquín, 7, fell ill and died this month after they crossed the southwestern border into the United States with their fathers, in separate events, and were detained by the Border Patrol.

Their deaths prompted outrage in the United States over the conditions that migrants, especially children, endure in Border Patrol custody, putting the Trump administration on the defensive as the president insists that Congress approve $5 billion toward building a wall he says will thwart illegal immigration.

But the Guatemalan government's response has been cautious. Aside from sending diplomatic notes to the State Department requesting an investigation into each child's death and offering to pay for the bodies' return home, the government has sidestepped the issue. There has been no formal protest against the American crackdown on migrants or condemnation of the hardships that even children are facing in detention centers.

President Jimmy Morales of Guatemala has made no public statement, leaving it to Foreign Minister Sandra Jovel to issue updates on her ministry's efforts to learn why the children died and bring their bodies home.

""The government of Guatemala regrets that a citizen has lost her life in this journey and points out that the places where migrants cross now are more dangerous and the distances they travel are longer,"" the foreign ministry said in announcing Jakelin's death.

The reason for the government's reticence, analysts suggest, is a combination of Guatemala's centuries-old discrimination against its indigenous Mayan communities, into which both children were born, and a careful political calculation ahead of next July's presidential election.

Mr. Morales has cultivated relations with the Trump administration and its allies to assure their support in his fight against an international panel on corruption that has accused him of campaign finance violations and filed charges against a wide array of political and economic power brokers in Guatemala.

His efforts have been largely successful, and the United States has fallen silent as Mr. Morales has defied rulings from Guatemala's highest court and barred members of the panel, including its head, from the country.

This is a marked break with precedent: For years, the United States unequivocally supported the International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala, the United Nations-backed panel known as Cicig, which has been working alongside Guatemalan prosecutors to bring corruption cases since 2007. Americans saw in its efforts a way to combat the corruption that has crippled Guatemala's political and economic development -- and, in part, fueled the migration of its citizens.

But the Trump administration has remained supportive of Mr. Morales even as his actions to shut down Cicig have taken Guatemala to the brink of a constitutional crisis. Now, with migration becoming a growing irritant in that relationship, Mr. Morales is anxious to smooth over the tensions.

When a caravan of thousands of mostly Honduran migrants crossed through Guatemala on its way to Mexico in October, the exodus angered President Trump, who fired off messages on Twitter blaming Guatemala and Honduras for allowing them to move north, said Fernando Carrera, a former foreign minister in Guatemala.

Despite the deaths of the two children, ""the government of Guatemala doesn't want to give more ammunition to that argument,"" Mr. Carrera said. ""They stay quiet and they don't react.""

The Guatemalan government's solicitous approach may not be enough to deter Mr. Trump's anger, though, given his single-minded focus on migration. On Friday morning, Mr. Trump, citing reports of a new caravan, repeated a threat to cut off aid to Guatemala, Honduras and El Salvador for not blocking the flow.

Aid may be less of a worry for Mr. Morales, though, than continued United States support for his effort to oust the Cicig panel. For more than a year, Mr. Morales and his government have been carefully developing allies in Washington, nurturing ties with evangelical groups and conservative legislators and moving Guatemala's embassy to Jerusalem, soon after the Trump administration did.

The Morales government is keen to protect its relationship with the Trump administration, said Quique Godoy, who resigned last year as a senior planning official in the Morales government in protest of the attacks on Cicig.

""They are more worried about Cicig than trying to denounce the United States government of mismanaging"" its treatment of migrants, Mr. Godoy said.

Mr. Carrera, the former foreign minister, said the Guatemalan government and its allies saw Cicig -- which has insisted on controls in campaign finance -- as a threat before the election next summer.

The results of the July vote will determine what happens to the panel. It will also affect Mr. Morales's future. He is not eligible to run for re-election and will lose his immunity from prosecution after stepping down, leaving him open to the Cicig-backed investigation into illicit campaign financing. The president's son and brother have also been targeted by the panel.

What has guided the Guatemalan government's response to the migrant children's deaths is a consular protection program that the foreign ministry has had in place for many years to provide support for migrants, including legal help and, when deaths occur, the return of bodies, Mr. Carrera said.

Marta Larra, a spokeswoman for the foreign ministry, said that Ms. Jovel, the minister, had spoken frequently with the secretary of Homeland Security, Kirstjen M. Nielsen, in recent months to emphasize the importance of protecting migrant children.

The children's deaths have also underscored the deep failures of successive Guatemalan governments to improve conditions for the country's poorest people, particularly the indigenous Maya who make up at least 40 percent of the population.

Jakelin, who died in an El Paso hospital a few days past her seventh birthday, was buried on Christmas Day in her small village, a cluster of thatched-roof houses where Q'eqchi'-speaking families struggle to survive by growing corn and beans.

Felipe, who died on Christmas Eve in a New Mexico hospital, had left his isolated Chuj-speaking village with his father. The village is near the Mexican border in the province of Huehuetenango, which sends more migrants to the United States than any other in Guatemala. Four out of five people in his rural municipality live in poverty, official statistics show.

""We have a de facto apartheid society,"" said Anita Isaacs, a Guatemala scholar at Haverford College. ""This country continues to be almost as racist as it has been historically.""

The result is that the death of an indigenous child barely registers, she said: ""These lives are worth less, and these people are fundamentally invisible.""

Alongside that indifference, Ms. Isaacs said, is an interest in developing the regions where indigenous people live. Palm oil plantations have begun to encroach on the Q'eqchi' lands north of the village where Jakelin's family lives.

Historically, these communities have been evicted to make way for cash crops like sugar or coffee, Ms. Isaacs said.

""What better form of eviction than them leaving the country completely?"" she asked. ""That's a major reason why the Guatemalan government doesn't care.""

The money that Guatemalan migrants send back, which helps support communities that are largely neglected by government services, is also an important resource. Remittances sent by Guatemalans working abroad accounted for 11 percent of Guatemala's national income in 2017 and were the economy's second most important source of foreign exchange, according to the International Monetary Fund.

The contribution is likely to rise as the number of Guatemalans seeking to reach the United States surges -- the result, Ms. Isaacs said, of ""a perfect storm"" of poverty, violence and environmental crises.

In a region with little investment in infrastructure, education or health care, like the remote areas on the border of Guatemala and Mexico where these two children were from, a temporary hardship -- like this year's sharp drop in coffee and sugar prices -- can provide the final push to people who are thinking of migrating, said Mr. Godoy, who is now the director of Propuesta Urbana, an organization that works on urban development and migration.

""The main reason why people keep migrating is because we are not generating the right conditions locally for people not to migrate,"" Mr. Godoy said.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/28/world/americas/guatemala.html
19,the new york times,"Adou Kouadio, a citizen of Ivory Coast, arrived at the Texas border in early 2016 and asked for asylum, claiming that he had been threatened after supporting a political opponent of his country's president.

But for the nearly three years that his request has remained under consideration, Mr. Kouadio, 43, has been detained by the American authorities, first in Texas and later in New Jersey. In August, he petitioned a court for help.

On Thursday, a federal judge in Manhattan said the government had violated Mr. Kouadio's rights.

""This nation prides itself on its humanity and openness with which it treats those who seek refuge at its gates,"" the judge, Alvin K. Hellerstein of Federal District Court, wrote. ""By contrast, the autocracies of the world have been marked by harsh regimes of exclusion and detention. Our notions of due process nourish the former spirit and brace us against the latter.""

Detaining Mr. Kouadio for 34 months without a bail hearing violated his due process rights as an nonresident immigrant arriving at the border, ""limited as those rights are,"" the judge said in a ruling some legal experts also considered a rebuke of the Trump administration's strict immigration policies.

Mr. Kouadio, who was first detained under the Obama administration, is now entitled to a bond hearing within 14 days, the judge ruled, at which the government has to show he poses a danger to the public or is a flight risk in order to continue his detention.

The judge added that Mr. Kouadio's detention without an opportunity for bail was too long. ""His right to liberty is as valuable to him as it is to any U.S. citizen, and he has a constitutional right to a bail hearing that should no longer be denied to him.""

In February, the United States Supreme Court ruled that under the immigration laws, people held in immigration detention, even for years, were not entitled to periodic hearings on whether they may be released on bail. But the Supreme Court did not decide whether the Constitution required such hearings, and sent the case back to a lower court to consider that issue.

Judge Hellerstein, a 1998 Clinton appointee, noted that Mr. Kouadio's case ""squarely presents the constitutional question"" which the Supreme Court had not answered: ""whether an indefinitely lengthy detention of a nonresident alien seeking asylum without a bond hearing violates the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment.""

Mr. Kouadio was detained on Feb. 21, 2016, at the El Paso border crossing, the judge noted, where he expressed his desire to seek asylum. Several weeks later, an asylum officer found that Mr. Kouadio had demonstrated a credible fear of persecution in Ivory Coast based on his political opinions, the judge said.

That March, the government initiated proceedings to deport Mr. Kouadio, but the process was subjected to repeated delays, Judge Hellerstein noted. (The case was moved to New York so Mr. Kouadio could have better access to an interpreter and to his family, the opinion says.)

The judge noted that Mr. Kouadio had never been arrested or convicted, there was little risk of flight and the case did not present national security concerns.

Mr. Kouadio's lawyers, Craig Relles and Steven Haskos, have said that their client, who had once worked for his country's former president, Laurent Gbagbo, had his life threatened by supporters of Mr. Gbagbo's successor, Alassane Ouattara, the current president.

Mr. Relles said on Thursday that Judge Hellerstein was ""sending a message to the Trump administration that fundamental due process is alive and well.""

Legal experts agreed that the ruling was important.

Lucas Guttentag, who teaches law at Stanford and Yale and was a former top adviser in the Department of Homeland Security under President Obama, said the ruling recognized that ""asylum applicants at our border are constitutionally entitled to due process and cannot be jailed for years without any hearing.""

Stephen Legomsky, a law professor at Washington University in St. Louis and the former chief counsel for Citizenship and Immigration Services in the Obama administration, added that the decision was an ""implicit criticism"" of the Trump administration's policies, ""in the sense that it is a clear rejection of the administration's preference for long-term detention of asylum seekers.""

The United States attorney's office in Manhattan had argued in court papers that Mr. Kouadio had been lawfully detained, and under Supreme Court precedent was not entitled to a bond hearing. ""Under the circumstances of this case, Kouadio has received all of the process he is due,"" the office wrote.

The office had no comment on the ruling. The United States Immigration and Customs Enforcement said it could not respond to a request for comment because of the government shutdown.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/27/nyregion/trump-asylum-immigrants-ban.html
20,the new york times,"Juan Cifuentes and his family never knew when the call would come.

For nine years, he, a sister and their parents waited in Pereira, Colombia, their hometown, outside Medellin. When he was 17, just after he finished high school, the approval for their visas came through. They were going to join his grandmother in New York City.

""It was challenging, but it was very, very exciting,"" Mr. Cifuentes, 25, said of arriving in the United States in 2010. ""Being an immigrant, you encounter things you never expect and feel things you don't know about. It's all part of the process.""

Mr. Cifuentes's family was happy in Colombia, but they wanted a better life in America.

""It's all about the future, about the opportunities,"" he said. ""Both of my parents, they wanted me to have more opportunities. There's no better place than the United States. I would never get the same opportunities in Colombia.""

Mr. Cifuentes said he was proud that he and his family had arrived legally and was eager to apply for citizenship. When the time came in 2017, he turned to the nonprofit agency the Jacob A. Riis Neighborhood Settlement for help preparing.

The agency, based in Queens, provides a range of services to the predominantly immigrant community of Queensbridge, including English language classes, after-school programs and senior services. It is supported by F.P.W.A., one of eight organizations supported by The New York Times Neediest Cases Fund, which received $20,000 from the fund last year to help its immigrant legal services program.

With free legal counsel from the program, Mr. Cifuentes was able to navigate the complicated system, and in September, he was sworn in as a citizen.

In 2017, Mr. Cifuentes graduated from the State University of New York, Albany, where he majored in accounting; he now works at Ernst & Young as an auditor. On the weekends, he helps out at his father's restaurant in Astoria, Los Perros De Chucho.

""My family and I are very proud of everything we've done so far,"" he said. ""We don't take it granted.""

The family still lives together in a house in Corona, Queens. His mother and sister have also become citizens, and his father is in the process of applying, too

The legal services program was started in 2009 in order to meet the needs of a growing immigration population. As it began offering English language classes, it became apparent that those students ""had a lot of barriers in their lives outside of learning English,"" said Sophie Simon, the agency's immigrant services director.

""One of the biggest ones was legal status and not having access to have affordable legal services,"" she said.

Since 2009, Paula Forero, an immigration lawyer, has spent 5 to 10 hours a week meeting with Riis Settlement clients to help guide them through their issues. The grant last year went toward her services. Her clients include some in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, known as Dreamers, and others like Mr. Cifuentes, who are trying to obtain citizenship.

""We're very lucky that New York City is very open to immigrants,"" Ms. Forero said. ""It understands and thrives on an immigration population. It gives people peace of mind.""

Ms. Forero sees about 200 clients every year, a number that has grown since the Trump administration, as more people face deportation or are concerned about their status.

Alberto Perez Smith first came to the Riis Neighborhood Settlement for its English language program. He arrived in New York in 2016 from Cuba after eight months of travel across South and Central America.

He left Havana to come to New York to see his father, who had lung cancer, and arrived just a month before he died. At the time, Mr. Smith did not speak any English and had no form of identification. Ms. Simon and Ms. Forero helped him obtain a city ID card.

His first attempt at applying for citizenship through another service failed because it was mishandled, they said, but Ms. Forero was able to untangle the problem after he learned about the agency's legal services.

Mr. Smith received his green card in November and is on track to apply for citizenship in the next few years.

""Thank you, thank you, thank you,"" he said to Ms. Forero. ""That process is not easy.""

Ms. Forero said, ""It could have gone very differently,"" adding that under current procedures, Mr. Smith could have been referred to an immigration judge.

Mr. Smith now works for a cleaning service in Manhattan and is in the process of applying to LaGuardia Community College to study technology.

He said his advice for others coming to America is to remember: ""There's always someone who has it worse than you. Try to make things good for other people.""",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/07/neediest-cases/helping-immigrants-find-their-path-to-citizenship.html
21,the new york times,"TORONTO -- Canada tried to turn up pressure on China on Saturday over the detention of two Canadians caught up in a struggle between global superpowers, with its foreign minister calling their imprisonment ""arbitrary"" and ""a precedent that is worrying not only for Canada but for the world.""

China seized the two Canadians, the former diplomat Michael Kovrig and the entrepreneur and writer Michael Spavor, shortly after Canada detained a Chinese telecommunications executive at the behest of the United States. The detentions of Mr. Kovrig and Mr. Spavor have rattled Canadians, many of whom do business and have family in China, and the government stressed that it was working feverishly for their release.

""We also believe this is not only a Canadian issue,"" Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland said in a conference call on Saturday. ""It is an issue that concerns our allies.""

Canada is in a tricky spot, boxed in between its two largest trading partners and worried about having to choose sides. After feeling burned by negotiations to replace the North American Free Trade Agreement, the country is trying to strengthen trade relations with China to lessen dependence on economic ties to the United States.

Ms. Freeland said that on Friday she met with the Chinese ambassador to Canada, Lu Shaye, for a second time and that Canadian ambassadors around the world are rallying their counterparts for support. The United States State Department, the European Union and British Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt have all said they are concerned about the arrests.

Both were detained after Canada arrested Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer of Huawei, a powerful Chinese telecommunications equipment company. She was arrested on Dec. 1 while she was transferring flights in Vancouver.

Canadian authorities arrested Ms. Meng at the request of American prosecutors who want to extradite her on charges of fraudulently convincing banks to facilitate transactions that breached United States sanctions against Iran. Ms. Meng was granted bail after a three-day hearing, and if a Canadian court agrees to an extradition request, she can still appeal.

""Canada is a rule-of-law country and has been behaving according to the rule of law,"" Ms. Freeland said. ""Our allies understand what is at stake, and it was good to have them come out and say that publicly.""

Chinese authorities arrested Mr. Kovrig on a street in Beijing. Mr. Kovrig has worked since early 2017 for the International Crisis Group, an organization that tries to resolve international conflicts.

Soon after, the police in China arrested Mr. Spavor, a Canadian writer and businessman who runs an organization that promotes tours of North Korea. The Chinese government has accused both men of ""endangering national security,"" but it has not laid out more specific allegations.

A person familiar with Mr. Kovrig's case, who requested anonymity to discuss sensitive details about it, said he has been questioned morning, afternoon and evening by Chinese investigators, and is not allowed to turn the lights off in his cell when he wants to sleep at night.

The Canadian ambassador to Beijing, John McCallum, and two Canadian consular officers visited Mr. Kovrig for about a half-hour four days after he was arrested, and he will be allowed one consular a visit a month, the person said. But Mr. Kovrig has not been allowed to see a lawyer, or family and loved ones. Nor has he been allowed to sign a letter that would allow him to retain a lawyer, the person said.

Chinese officials have not said outright that they would release Mr. Kovrig and Mr. Spavor in exchange for Ms. Meng's return to China. But they have left little doubt that their arrests were in reprisal.

""Those who accuse China of detaining some person in retaliation for the arrest of Ms. Meng should first reflect on the actions of the Canadian side,"" the Chinese ambassador to Ottawa, Mr. Lu, wrote last week in an op-ed article in The Globe and Mail.

Ms. Freeland said Chinese officials had not made that direct connection.

""It would, of course, be highly inappropriate for there to be any connection,"" she said in the conference call. But she also painted a sharp contrast between Ms. Meng's legal protections in Canada and the secretive arrests of the Canadians in China.

""Canada has been behaving scrupulously,"" Ms. Freeland said. ""Ms. Meng has been given absolute access to due process.""

But China has cast Ms. Meng as the victim of human rights abuses.

""I wonder if, when Canada illegally detained a Chinese citizen at the behest of the United States, you were concerned about her treatment and rights,"" Hua Chunying, a spokeswoman for the Chinese Ministry of Foreign Affairs, told reporters on Friday.

Complicating the situation, President Trump mused in an interview that he might intervene in Ms. Meng's case, if it would result in trade concessions from China.

Ms. Freeland insisted politics were not involved.

""As we've made very clear in the case of Ms. Meng, the issue is Canada abiding by its extradition treaty commitments and following rule-of-law procedures,"" she said. ""We've also made clear a number of times that Canada does not believe it is appropriate to use extradition proceedings for any sort of politicized end.""

In the past week, a third Canadian was detained by the police in China, on accusations of working illegally in the country. Canadian officials have not considered the detention in the same light, and Ms. Freeland did not mention the case on Saturday.

A Chinese foreign ministry spokesman told reporters that the third Canadian, Sarah Donata McIver, a teacher from Alberta, was under administrative detention for working illegally in China.

That's a kind of punishment that the police can impose in cases that fall short of criminal charges. Ms. Hua didn't say how long that detention would last, but in the normal run of such cases it would be up to 15 days.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/22/world/canada/canada-china-detention.html
22,the new york times,"Voting rights and partisan gerrymandering, traditionally the preoccupation of wonky party strategists and good-government groups, have become major flash points in the debate about the integrity of American elections, signaling high stakes battles over voter suppression and politically engineered districts ahead of the 2020 presidential race.

When Democrats take the majority in the House on Thursday, the first bill they plan to introduce will be broad legislation focusing on these issues. Early drafts of their proposals include automatic voter registration, public elections financing and ending gerrymandering by using independent commissions to draw voting districts.

But action and anger go far beyond Congress. With voters increasingly aware of the powerful impact of gerrymandering and doubtful about the fairness of elections, voting issues have become central to politics in key states including Florida, Georgia, Michigan, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin.

Questions about the health of American democracy are being raised in areas once thought to be wholly nonpartisan, as reflected in a court battle over whether the Trump administration is trying to use a question about citizenship on the 2020 census to undercount Democratic constituencies and limit their political clout.

Voters in five states last year passed ballot questions shifting the power to draw political districts away from partisan lawmakers.

In widely criticized lame-duck sessions of the Wisconsin and Michigan Legislatures, Republicans raced to strip powers from new Democratic governors, partly to protect their ability to gerrymander after the 2020 census.

In Florida, voters approved a ballot initiative to restore voting rights for more than a million convicted felons, while in Georgia, questions about the legitimacy of the victory by the Republican governor, Brian Kemp, revolved around allegations that his office suppressed the votes of minorities in the state.

At issue, many voting experts say, is a momentous clash between demographic changes that are slowly and powerfully reshaping the American electorate, making it younger, more diverse and more favorable for Democrats, and the entrenched power of Republican lawmakers, who see restrictions on voting and partisan redistricting as ways to hold on to political power.

""What they're trying to do is construct a system where a minority of the voters can actually obtain majority power,"" said former Attorney General Eric H. Holder Jr., who sued states over voting rules during the Obama administration.

Republicans say the influence of gerrymandering is overblown. They argue that Democrats fail to win seats in proportion to their popular votes because Democratic voters are clustered in urban districts. Republicans defend voting restrictions like ID laws as popular with majorities in both parties and needed to ensure confidence in elections.

That concerns about gerrymandering have gone mainstream was underlined last month when President Barack Obama said he would join forces with a group Mr. Holder leads, the National Democratic Redistricting Committee. It was formed in 2017 in response to many state legislatures shifting sharply to the right on abortion, taxes, education and collective bargaining. Democrats contend those shifts were built on Republicans' securing majorities at the state level through extreme gerrymandering after the 2010 census.

The Republican State Leadership Committee, which helped secure many of those statehouse victories, argues the initial races were run in districts drawn by Democrats in previous decades. Matt Walter, the committee's president, said some of the 2018 ballot measures to make redistricting less partisan were quietly backed by groups that seek to elect more Democrats.

""Cleverly worded ballot measures regarding redistricting are often nothing more than Democrat politics wrapped in some sort of illusion of citizen-participated good government,"" he said.

Indeed, Democrats have also benefited from partisan maps in states like Maryland. Still, when Democrats in New Jersey recently sought to benefit from midterm gains and overhaul how legislative maps are drawn, Mr. Holder and other fair-voting groups opposed it. The proposal was scrapped.

In the November elections, Democrats gained more House seats than they have in any midterm since Watergate, picking up 40 seats. But the gains might have been even bigger, election experts said, if Republican gerrymanders hadn't been drawn to withstand a blue wave.

In Ohio, Republicans won 52 percent of the overall votes for Congress, but they retained 11 of the state's 16 House seats.

In North Carolina, Republicans won 50 percent of the popular congressional vote, but 9 out of 12 seats, not counting one still in dispute.

""It's the result of digitally diabolical gerrymandering,"" said Gov. Roy Cooper, a Democrat.

North Carolina has been ground zero for what critics call aggressive Republican attacks on democracy, including a strict voter ID law, extreme partisan gerrymandering and a power grab during a lame-duck session of the legislature after Mr. Cooper's election in 2016. Courts have overturned many of these efforts.

The governor echoed critics of gerrymandering who say that putting lawmakers in safe districts leads to partisan polarization, because incumbents fear only a primary challenge from the extremes and lack any incentive to reach across the aisle.

""It has prevented progress in North Carolina on closing the health care gap,"" Mr. Cooper said. ""I think in Washington it has torpedoed common sense immigration reform."" In June, the United States Supreme Court sidestepped the question of whether partisan gerrymandering was unconstitutional.

Republican supermajorities in both of the state's legislative chambers have overridden 22 of Mr. Cooper's vetoes. In November, Democrats flipped enough seats in the General Assembly to limit Republicans to simple majorities, restoring the governor's veto authority. Rather than wait for the new legislature to convene in January, Republicans met this month to override two of Mr. Cooper's vetoes of voting laws.

Phil Berger, the president of the State Senate, said critics accusing North Carolina Republicans of undermining democracy ignore the fact that the party won its majorities in 2010 using maps drawn by Democrats. The laws enacted since then, including voter ID, reflect the will of the majority, he said.

""The Democrats have a geographic problem,"" Mr. Berger said, referring to the clustering of Democratic voters in a handful of cities. ""Our view is we were returning North Carolina to more of the mainstream.""

If North Carolina was the template, Republican lawmakers in Wisconsin and Michigan both met in lame-duck sessions last year to strip powers away from incoming Democratic governors. Speaker Robin J. Vos of the Wisconsin State Assembly was candid about his motives for checking the incoming governor, Tony Evers, the former state superintendent of schools. ""We are going to have a very liberal governor who is going to enact policies that are in direct contrast to what many of us believe in,"" he said in early December.

Wisconsin's legislative maps, drawn in 2011, protected Republican supermajorities even after Gov. Scott Walker, a Republican, was defeated last year. Republican candidates for the State Assembly won just 46 percent of the popular vote, but they captured 64 percent of the chamber's seats.

Barry Burden, a political scientist at the University of Wisconsin, called the results ""a beautiful gerrymander"" because Republicans were protected even in a bad year for their party.

In Michigan, however, most of the Republican pushback against the election results fizzled, either because bills died in the legislature or were vetoed by former Gov. Rick Snyder.

According to the Brennan Center for Justice, 24 states, most Republican-led, have introduced restrictions that have made access to voting harder since 2010.

Wendy R. Weiser, director of the Democracy Program at the Brennan Center, said there was a correlation between states that have restricted voting and those with high African-American turnout in 2008, the first year Mr. Obama was elected, as well as those that recorded large increases in Hispanic population in the 2010 census.

""The more a state saw an increase in political participation by African-Americans or an increase in the Latino population, the more likely they'd introduce new laws cutting back on voting access,"" she said.

At the same time, many states have expanded voting access in recent years. Midterm voters in Nevada passed automatic registration for those receiving a driver's license, and Maryland authorized same-day registration at the polls. In New York, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo is calling for an overhaul of the state's voting laws, considered among the most archaic in the country.

At the opposite end of the spectrum, advocates of restrictions such as voter ID laws say they are needed to prevent fraud, despite multiple studies showing in-person fraud is extremely rare. A federal appeals court that struck down North Carolina's voter ID law in 2016 said it was drafted to target blacks ""with almost surgical precision.""

One of the Republicans defeated at the polls last year, Kris W. Kobach, lost a race for Kansas governor after being rebuked in federal court for insisting without evidence that noncitizen voting was widespread. Mr. Kobach had led the commission to look into President Trump's baseless claim that millions of undocumented immigrants voted in 2016. It disbanded without documenting his claim.

Polls show Americans are increasingly concerned about the structure of elections. Only 51 percent believed that elections are fair and open in a July Ipsos poll. A Pew Research Center survey in October found wide partisan gaps over easing access to voting, with more Democrats than Republicans favoring the ability to register on Election Day, the restoration of felons' voting rights and the automatic registration of all eligible voters.

The issue has become a galvanizing one for Democratic candidates.

Kamala Harris, the senator from California and a likely Democratic presidential candidate, tweeted last week: ""As states across the country are actively making it harder for Americans to vote, my Democratic colleagues are committed to strengthening access to the ballot box. Reinvigorating the Voting Rights Act, expanding early voting, and automatic registration are a place to start.""

In November, voters in Colorado, Missouri, Michigan and Utah approved changes to limit the role of partisanship in drawing congressional and legislative districts. Ohio passed a similar measure in May.

But in Missouri, Gov. Michael L. Parson, a Republican, opposed the popular vote to turn over mapmaking to a ""nonpartisan state demographer,"" which could increase Democratic representation. The governor called for the measure's repeal.

Missouri reflects the way even popular elections often fail to settle voting-related disputes. In Florida, Democrats say Republicans are already looking for ways to avoid carrying out the initiative allowing people convicted of felonies to vote.

Mr. Holder, who is among the Democrats considering a presidential run, said issues about voting and democracy are now central to American politics.

""Health care will clearly be the primary issue,"" he said. ""But I think if you're looking for a top-five issue, this one has broken through and will be something people will talk about and make their decision about who they're going to vote for.""",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/02/us/politics/voting-gerrymander-elections.html
23,the new york times,"From the government shutdown to the start of a new Congress, it's been a busy week in American politics. Here are some of the biggest stories you might have missed (and some links if you'd like to read further).

The shutdown is entering its third week

Early in the week, House Democrats agreed on a proposal to end the partial government shutdown that would extend current levels of funding for the Department of Homeland Security, but that didn't include money for President Trump's border wall. Mr. Trump rejected the idea in a White House meeting on Wednesday, saying he would look ""foolish"" if he compromised.

After the Democrats took control of the House on Thursday, they passed two bills to reopen the government, knowing they would likely go nowhere in the Senate. The majority leader, Senator Mitch McConnell, said he would not bring up any legislation Mr. Trump did not support. Few Republicans called for an end to the shutdown.

On Friday, the president threatened to keep agencies closed for ""months or even years."" Mr. Trump also said he was considering declaring a national emergency to build a border wall without congressional approval.

As the president holds firm on the shutdown, he hasn't publicly addressed the 800,000 federal workers going without pay. The administration said it would freeze pay raises for Vice President Mike Pence and other high-level officials.

The new Democratic majority

The 116th Congress was called to order on Thursday, with ebullient Democrats taking control of the House of Representatives and electing Nancy Pelosi as speaker.

Ms. Pelosi is the first lawmaker to win two separate terms as speaker in more than half a century, cementing her place as the highest-ranking and most powerful female elected official in the history of American politics. To win back the gavel, the California representative had to put down a rebellion in her caucus -- and there are still dissenters in her ranks.

Wasting no time, House Democrats on Friday unveiled details of ambitious legislation devised to lower barriers to the ballot box and require presidents and candidates for the nation's highest offices to release their tax returns. But their new agenda is being overshadowed by the shutdown.

The race for president has begun

Senator Elizabeth Warren, a sharp critic of big banks and unregulated capitalism, entered the 2020 race for president on Monday. Ms. Warren said she was forming a presidential exploratory committee, which allows her to raise money and hire staff before a formal kickoff.

An unusually large number of Democrats may (or may not) be seeking the presidency. The question is: Who, if anyone, matches the political moment?

As Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont ponders a second presidential run, complaints of sexual harassment and pay disparity by staff members on his 2016 campaign have started to circulate, possibly hindering his chances.

We still don't know if Joe Biden will be a candidate. But with a series of careful financial decisions and the creation of nonprofits and academic centers, the former vice president has paved the way for a possible run.

Re ""How the Wall Has Boxed In the President"" (news analysis, front page, Jan. 6):

The current shutdown is only superficially about a wall and national security. After all, President Trump and Senate Republicans were fine with the continuing spending resolutions until right-wing pundits started objecting. What this is really about is the first battle in the war between Mr. Trump and the now Democratically controlled House for the soul of this country.

The president is trying to compel House Democrats to vote for his wall. It is a pure and unmitigated battle for power. In this battle he has no empathy for the suffering of others. No lie is too small or cruelty too harsh.

At stake is the future of our democracy. The biggest threat to national security is Mr. Trump himself. If Mr. Trump is not defeated in this battle, he will only be emboldened to do it again whenever he doesn't get his way.

To the Editor:

Sorry, but your description of President Trump's position as ""boxed in"" is mistaken. The president is not a politician. He is a show-off who found his niche as a television entertainer. Now he has had the good fortune to become entertainer-in-chief.

The government shutdown is not a political crisis in the president's eyes; it is a gripping cliffhanger, one that carries over from episode to episode, perhaps not to be resolved until the end of the season. As the shutdown causes more suffering for more people, the drama will become more tense, ensuring that more and more Americans will tune in.

Re ""Trump Prepared to Have Impasse Last for Months"" (front page, Jan. 5):

President Trump has a long and dishonorable history of stiffing workers -- not paying them for work done for him, at his casinos, golf courses or other projects -- when he was a private citizen. He had no consideration for what that loss of pay did to them or their families.

But the 800,000 workers he is stiffing now through the shutdown he forced -- many of whom are being required to work -- are being used as pawns in a game in our names. And it is unconscionable. Our taxes are continuing to pay him and members of Congress, while the workers struggle to provide for the daily needs of their families, and are increasingly in danger of losing their cars or homes because they have no income.

The Talmud says that payment of a worker's wages should not be delayed even overnight because the worker may be in need. Mr. Trump and congressional Republicans: Have you no shame? Not in my name!

""How the Wall Has Boxed In the President"" describes the origin of the president's fixation on building a wall along our southern border. There is a really simple solution to his (and our) problem: We need one or more Potrumpkin walls.

Surely, the Hollywood people who give us credible dinosaurs and interstellar spacecraft could easily assemble a credible wall, to which the president could be transported, and where enthusiastic crowds could be assembled to cheer him. There could even be several variations of the wall, each of which could give him a new frisson of excitement, and us surcease from his mania.

26,the new york times,"JERUSALEM -- The American decision to withdraw from Syria has abruptly scrambled the geopolitics of the Middle East, clearing the way for Iran to expand its influence across the region, leaving Israel virtually alone to stop it, and raising the prospect that thousands of Islamic State prisoners could be set free.

Beyond the region, President Trump's announcement ricocheted Thursday from Moscow, where it was praised, to Washington, where it was the catalyst for the resignation of Defense Secretary Jim Mattis.

The decision shows that even a relatively small move -- the United States has only about 2,000 troops in Syria -- can have far-reaching consequences in a complex war, leaving allies struggling to cope and adversaries pleased and emboldened.

""Donald's right, and I agree with him,"" said President Vladimir V. Putin of Russia, whose influence over Syria can only grow more dominant as the United States exits.

Turkey, Iran and the Syrian government of President Bashar al-Assad also stand to reap enormous immediate benefits from the American withdrawal.

On the other hand, allies like the Kurdish forces who fought alongside the United States in Syria feel betrayed and are threatening to free thousands of Islamic State prisoners if the United States abandons them.

Israel, which hoped the American presence in Syria would block Iran from completing its corridor to the sea, now has to reckon with a new reality.

""This leaves us alone in the arena with the Russians,"" said Michael Herzog, an Israel-based fellow of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy and a former Israeli defense official. ""We are alone in the battle against Iran in Syria.""

As the American decision ripples across the region, many countries will be forced to reassess their relationships. The result could be a series of new balancing acts: Israel trying to tilt Russia against Iran, Turkey playing Russia and the United States off one another, and Syria balancing the Kurds against Turkey, among others.

""You look at any country in this region, and they can't trust us, and they don't want to trust the Russians, but who else is there?"" said Daniel C. Kurtzer, a former ambassador to Egypt and Israel who now teaches at Princeton.

The American presence in Syria was particularly vexing for Iran, preventing Iranian-backed militias from crossing into Syria from Iraq. A pullout would free Tehran to treat the Iraqi border as fully porous, easing the movement of fighters and weapons -- and potentially of the advanced missiles and other weapons through Syria to Hezbollah, Iran's partner in Lebanon.

That freedom of movement could also ease the pain of American sanctions, which are damaging Iran's economy. ""The area is oil-rich,"" said Lina Khatib, a Middle East expert at Chatham House in London. ""So removing U.S. troops could increase the chances of Iran getting its hands on oil fields in the northeast.""

No constituency stands to lose more from a United States withdrawal than its Kurdish allies in eastern Syria. As if to signal that it would not go quietly, the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces are discussing the release of 3,200 Islamic State prisoners, a prominent monitoring group and a Western official said Thursday.

Mostapha Bali, the spokesman for the Syrian Democratic Forces, denied there was any discussion of releasing prisoners from the Islamic State. ""Any news coming from such sources is not reliable and is not coming from us,"" he said.

But a Western official from the United States-led coalition fighting in Syria, which includes more than a dozen countries, confirmed that such discussions had taken place.

""The best result of terrible options is probably for the Syrian regime to take custody of these people,"" said the official, who insisted on anonymity because he was not permitted to speak publicly. ""If they are released it's a real disaster and major threat to Europe.""

Some analysts played down the threat as a bluff, or a cry for attention, saying that if the Islamic State prisoners were freed they could sooner be expected to turn on the Kurds than thank them.

But a report by the Syrian Observatory on Human Rights said the Syrian Democratic Forces leadership was discussing the prisoners' release because many of their home countries had refused to take them back. The Observatory, a London-based group with a network of citizen monitors throughout Syria whose work is widely considered credible, said the militia was also concerned that it would need all of its fighters to defend against a possible Turkish military invasion.

That invasion became more likely with Mr. Trump's announcement, which was seen as giving Turkey a green light to carry it out. The American withdrawal helps Turkey in two ways: it abandons the Kurds, whom Turkey sees as a threat, and removes American troops from northeastern Syria, which President Recep Tayyip Erdogan said he will invade to attack Kurdish positions there.

An invasion, however, would not be free of risk.

""The problem for them is that if they do go in, there is always the possibility that they run into a protracted guerrilla struggle,"" said Steven A. Cook, a Middle East expert at the Council on Foreign Relations.

The greater likelihood, analysts said, was that the Kurds seek an agreement with Syria's president, Mr. Assad, that grants them limited autonomy in eastern Syria in exchange for their loyalty. Such an agreement would put Turkey into greater conflict with both Mr. Assad and the Russians.

To Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel, Mr. Trump's decision came as a deep embarrassment heading into an election year in which his national-security credentials, closeness with Mr. Trump and obsessive focus on stopping Iranian expansion were central to his argument for another term. Mr. Netanyahu said he learned of the withdrawal decision in talks with Mr. Trump on Monday.

""This caught the Israeli government by surprise,"" said Ofer Zalzberg, an Israeli analyst at International Crisis Group. ""I don't know whether indeed Trump called Netanyahu two days ago or not, but that's a very short time between two close allies. That's barely a heads-up.""

Mr. Netanyahu seemed to reach the height of his influence in Washington earlier this year when Mr. Trump moved the United States Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem and then abandoned the Iran nuclear agreement, which Mr. Netanyahu had railed against for years.

But Mr. Netanyahu ends the year ""appearing to have mismanaged Israel's relations with the two global superpowers, the U.S. and Russia,"" Mr. Zalzberg said. Mr. Putin has refused to meet with him since the accidental downing of a Russian military jet in Syria during an Israeli airstrike in September.

While Israeli military experts played down the tactical dangers of being left alone to fight Iran in Syria, many said an American retreat was debilitating to Israeli morale.

""It's all of 2,000 soldiers,"" said Eyal Zisser, an expert on Syria and Lebanon at Tel Aviv University. ""Psychologically, though, they were there, which to a degree put the others -- the Russians, the Iranians -- on notice.""

But an abrupt American pullout gives credibility to the idea, increasingly pervasive in the Middle East, that the United States' support for its allies is not what it once was, Mr. Zalzberg said. ""And that narrative is very harmful for Israeli power and deterrence, irrespective of the veracity of it,"" he said.

Russia may be the biggest beneficiary of an American departure, which would leave it as the major global power in Syria and restore its Soviet-era role as a player in the Middle East.

Mr. Putin's praise for Mr. Trump aside, he is likely to use an American withdrawal to ""tell the world that Russia's won against the U.S. in this proxy war,"" said Ms. Khatib of Chatham House. And with good reason, she added: ""Russia will take advantage of the vacuum to set the terms for the trajectory of the Syrian conflict as it wishes. It paves the way for Russia to treat Syria as part of its virtual territory.""

But while Moscow and Tehran may both gain in the short term, the end of the war in Syria is likely to bring them into conflict, as their alliance in support of Mr. Assad will give way to competing interests: Russia wants a strong government in Damascus that is loyal to Moscow, while Tehran wants a weak regime on which it can impose its will.

""It seems to me we're seeing the rise of a new axis in the Middle East, aligning Russia, Israel and countries like Saudi Arabia against Iran,"" Ms. Khatib said. ""But this will take a while to play out. And it does not remove the immediate danger that is now going to increase when it comes to Israel's own security.""",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/20/world/middleeast/syria-us-withdrawal-iran.html
27,the new york times,"Jakiw Palij, a former Nazi concentration camp guard who lived for decades in New York City and resisted deportation for 14 years, died on Thursday in a retirement facility in Ahlen, Germany. He was 95.

German officials confirmed the death, according to an American Embassy official. No cause was cited.

Before investigators traced him to the borough of Queens in 1993, Mr. Palij had lived for decades in anonymity, a Polish-born draftsman in one of the most diverse neighborhoods of a city famous for its immigrant communities. He had arrived in the United States in 1949 in his 20s, after receiving a visa meant for people left homeless by World War II, according to Peter Black, the former chief historian for a Justice Department unit devoted to deporting former Nazis.

On his application, Mr. Palij claimed to have worked on his father's farm and then as a factory worker in Germany during the war.

Mr. Palij told the truth on one account -- he was born on Aug. 16, 1923, in the village of Piadyki, then part of Poland and now Ukraine -- but lied about his life during the war.

In reality, Mr. Palij had volunteered to serve in Hitler's Schutzstaffel, or SS, in February 1943, according to records unearthed by the Justice Department. He went through training at the Trawniki labor camp in Poland, where the Nazis prepared for Operation Reinhard, the planned extermination of Poland's two million Jews.

With two other Nazi soldiers who also emigrated to the United States, Mr. Palij served in the Streibel Battalion, guarding forced laborers who made uniforms and brushes, according to court documents. On Nov. 3, 1943, Nazis at the death camp executed an estimated 6,000 Jews in a single day, according to the historian Christopher Browning's book ""Ordinary Men."" Mr. Browning called it ""the largest killing operation against Jews in the entire war.""

Mr. Palij received United States citizenship in 1957, and with his wife bought a home in Queens from a Polish Jewish couple who had survived the Holocaust and were not aware of Mr. Palij's past.

A decade after investigators identified Mr. Palij, a federal judge stripped him of his American citizenship, based on the Justice Department's findings that he had lied on his visa application and served as a Nazi guard in the concentration camp. A year later, a judge ordered him deported -- but neither Poland nor Ukraine would agree to take him.

Germany also refused to accept Mr. Palij, who was never a German citizen.

In limbo in Jackson Heights, he denied participating in any killings and said the SS forced him into service. ""I was never a collaborator,"" he told The New York Times in 2003. He also dared the government to arrest him: ""Let them come and get me.""

""What will they do? Shoot me? Put me in the electric chair?"" he asked. ""What country is going to take an 80-year-old man in poor health?""

The men who emigrated with Mr. Palij were also pursued by American officials: One died in Queens in 2007 with a case pending against him; the other was stripped of his citizenship in 2001, and died in Florida nine years later.

After other former Nazis died or were deported, Mr. Palij became the last known Nazi war crimes suspect residing in the United States. On Holocaust Remembrance Day, for years, students and faculty members from Rambam Mesivta high school in Lawrence, N.Y., protested outside his house.

The Trump administration made his deportation a priority, and in August 2018 announced that Germany would receive Mr. Palij. The same day, officials escorted him from his home, and he was flown to Münster, in northwestern Germany.

He had no children, and his wife was reported deceased by The Associated Press.",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/10/world/europe/jakiw-palij-dead.html
28,the new york times,"On what moral grounds can we deny others rights, privileges and opportunities that we did not earn ourselves?

Late last month, 19-year-old Maryury Elizabeth Serrano-Hernandez reportedly scaled a wall along the United States-Mexico border while eight months pregnant and gave birth within hours of placing her feet on American soil. She was part of a widely publicized Central American caravan and traveled more than 2,000 miles from Honduras propelled by the dream of giving her new baby, as well as her 3-year-old son, a life free from the violence and grinding poverty she endured back home. She views her child's birth in the United States as a ""big reward"" for her courage, perseverance and faith. As she explained to Univision, which documented parts of her family's journey, ""With faith in God, I always said my son will be born there.""

For some Americans, Ms. Serrano-Hernandez's story is nothing short of heroic, given the suffering she endured and the extraordinary obstacles she overcame to give her children a chance at a better life. For others, her story represents everything that's wrong with our immigration system. The Border Patrol said that Ms. Serrano-Hernandez and her family were released on their own recognizance. Her newborn is, for many, just another ""anchor baby,"" proof that a more aggressive and unforgiving approach to illegal immigration is warranted and that Trump is right to call for an end to birthright citizenship.

No matter what side of the debate one gravitates toward, stories like Ms. Serrano-Hernandez's highlights the moral quagmire that we've created by treating the migration of desperately poor people as a problem that can best be addressed by border walls, tear gas, detention camps, militarized policing and mass deportation -- except, of course, for the relative few, truly ""deserving"" individuals who may be granted legal citizenship (typically after years of waiting and hundreds or thousands of dollars in attorney's fees) if they can win asylum.

Questions abound: Does Ms. Serrano-Hernandez's baby son deserve citizenship because he was born here but not his 3-year-old sibling? Does everyone in the family deserve citizenship now that one member has been born here? Or does no one in the family deserve citizenship, even the baby, because the parents crossed the border illegally?

Answering these questions may be easy legally, but they're more difficult morally. After all, none of us born here did anything to deserve our citizenship. On what moral grounds can we deny others rights, privileges and opportunities that we did not earn ourselves?

Jose Antonio Vargas's powerful book ""Dear America: Notes of an Undocumented Citizen"" wrestles with the moral, emotional and psychological dimensions of America's perennial question: Who deserves citizenship? With remarkable sensitivity to the extraordinarily wide range of people whose lives are affected by our nation's immigration policies, he writes from the perspective of someone who was brought to this country illegally at the age of 12 to live with his grandparents, leaving his mother in the Philippines. Ever since his grandfather confessed to him, at age 16, that ""you are not supposed to be here,"" he has battled deep feelings of unworthiness and has striven to earn the right to belong. Yet no matter how much he achieved or contributed -- indeed, even after winning a Pulitzer Prize for journalism -- he still had the nagging feeling that he didn't deserve to be here. Only after being arrested near the border and held in a cell with a group of terrified undocumented boys who had been separated from their families did he have an awakening: It was suddenly obvious to him that the boys huddled near him deserved safety, security and a place they could call home -- a place where they could not only survive but also thrive. If they deserved such a thing, he did too. ""Home is not something I should have to earn,"" he wrote. It's something we all have a right to.

Many people will sympathize with Mr. Vargas's story but recoil at his bold conclusion, as it seems to imply support for open borders -- a position that no Republican or Democratic member of Congress supports or even takes seriously. This reaction seems misplaced. The deeper question raised isn't whether our borders should be open or closed (generally a false dichotomy) but rather how we ought to manage immigration in a manner that honors the dignity, humanity and legitimate interests of all concerned.

Reaching for a radically more humane immigration system is not pie-in-the-sky, utopian dreaming. But it does require a certain measure of humility on the part of those of us who have benefited from birthright citizenship. Rather than viewing immigrants as seeking something that we, Americans, have a moral right to withhold from them, we ought to begin by acknowledging that none of us who were born here did anything to deserve our citizenship, and yet all of us -- no matter where we were born -- deserve compassion and basic human rights.

It's tempting to imagine that our position as gatekeepers is morally sound -- since we're frequently reminded that ""all nations have a right to defend their borders"" -- but our relationship to those who are fleeing poverty and violence is morally complex. Not only does birthright citizenship bestow upon us a privileged status that we haven't earned; our nation's unparalleled wealth and power, as well as our actual borders, lack a sturdy moral foundation. But for slavery, genocide and colonization, we would not be the wealthiest, most powerful nation in the world -- in fact, our nation would not even exist. This is not hyperbole; it's history. There's good reason some Mexicans say: ""We didn't cross the border. The border crossed us."" That is, in fact, what happened.

Of course, it can be argued that virtually all modern nation-states were created through violence, exploitation and war. But we claim to be unlike most nation-states; indeed, we insist that we're ""exceptional."" We are the only nation that advertises itself as ""a nation of immigrants"" and the ""land of the free,"" an advertising campaign complete with a Statute of Liberty whose pedestal includes a plaque of a poem that reads in part:

""Give me your tired, your poor,

Your huddled masses yearning to breathe free,

The wretched refuse of your teeming shore.

Send these, the homeless, tempest-tost to me,

I lift my lamp beside the golden door!""

The founders of our nation did not merely wax poetic about the virtues of liberty; our nation was birthed by a Declaration of Independence, a document that insists that ""all men are created equal"" with ""certain inalienable rights"" including ""life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness."" After centuries of struggle, including a Civil War, we now claim to understand that all people -- not just propertied white men -- are created equal with basic, inalienable human rights. If this is true, on what moral grounds can we greet immigrants with tear gas and lock them in for-profit detention camps, or build walls against the huddled masses yearning to breathe free? After all, what was Ms. Serrano-Hernandez doing if not pursuing life, liberty and happiness for herself and her family? Did she not display a level of courage, fortitude and determination to win freedom for herself and those she loved comparable to that of those who helped birth our nation?

Even if we're tempted to treat as irrelevant the circumstances of our nation's founding, we cannot ignore the fact that our recent and current foreign policies, trade agreements and military adventures -- including our global drug wars -- have greatly contributed to the immigration crisis that our nation is now trying to solve through border walls and mass deportation. Would Ms. Serrano-Hernandez and her family even be knocking at our door today if it weren't for the disastrous policies our government has pursued in Honduras for decades?

The anthropologist Margaret Mead famously said, ""Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful, committed citizens can change the world; indeed, it's the only thing that ever has."" Today a relatively small group of courageous noncitizens -- people like Mr. Vargas, Ms. Serrano-Hernandez, the Dreamers and the thousands who joined the caravan -- are challenging us to see immigrants not only as fully human, created equal, with certain inalienable rights but also morally entitled to far greater care, compassion and concern than we have managed to muster to date.

29,the new york times,"HARLAN, Ky. -- Gov. Matt Bevin skillfully worked the room at the old courthouse building here in Harlan, one more town-hall meeting in the long campaign toward next year's election. He deplored the parlous state of a half-mile stretch of U.S. 421 and said $802,000 would be spent to rebuild it. He commiserated with the man who wanted to know how he should deal with the bears tearing through his trash bins, now that it's forbidden to shoot them.

The line that got the governor a standing ovation, however, was about Medicaid. More precisely, about his plan -- so far frustrated by the courts -- to require thousands of able-bodied Medicaid recipients between 19 and 64 to work, get training or perform community service for 20 hours a week to keep their health insurance.

""Yeahs"" rippled across the room as the governor extolled the value and dignity of work, which propelled him from a hardscrabble youth in rural New Hampshire to the governor's mansion in Frankfort. ""People tell me it's too much to ask,"" he noted, incredulously, about his plan to demand that people on Medicaid get a job. ""Baloney.""

And the line from Ronald Reagan got chuckles all around: ""The worst thing you can hear,"" the governor told Harlan's gathered residents, is ""I'm from the government and I'm here to help.'""

Mr. Bevin's distaste for government is not news. His insurgent campaign to take the Kentucky governorship in 2015 was heavy on attacks on government spending. What's more notable is the people's applause. Harlan County residents rely on government programs more than pretty much anybody else.

Harlan County is the nation's fifth most dependent on federal programs, according to the government's Bureau of Economic Analysis. In 2016 some 54 percent of the income of the county's roughly 26,000 residents came from programs like Social Security and Medicaid, food stamps -- formally known as SNAP, the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program -- and the earned-income tax credit. That is up from 28 percent in 1990.

Where Government Assistance Has Grown

Federal assistance has grown all over the U.S., but particularly in Appalachia and the South, where many people now get more than a third of their income from the government.

Surrounding counties are similarly dependent. Part of a coal-mining region in long, inexorable decline, this pocket of the nation exemplifies a political paradox: Why are so many American voters hostile to the government hand that feeds them?

""The SNAP card works every month; the kids eat two meals a day, but people don't think about where the food comes from and go vote for Republicans,"" said Larry King, a farmer who is chairman of the Democratic Party in nearby McCreary County, whose residents get 55 percent of their income from federal transfers.

It's not just about Kentucky. Research by Dean Lacy at Dartmouth College on the presidential elections in 2004, 2008 and 2012 found that states receiving more federal spending for every tax dollar they contributed were more likely to go Republican.

The phenomenon produced a 2004 best seller, Robert Frank's ""What's the Matter With Kansas?"" It argued that Republicans drew working-class voters to their platform against taxes and spending not with economic arguments, but by appealing to their conservative cultural preferences -- against gay rights, abortion rights, affirmative action and gun control.

The contradiction has only become more pronounced over time. As Americans have grown more reliant on federal programs over the last 50 years, they have increasingly embraced the Republican Party, a trend put in stark relief by President Trump's 2016 victory. Of the 10 states in which government transfers account for the largest share of income, seven voted for Mr. Trump. Speaking to the economic and social anxieties of blue-collar white voters over immigration, trade and demographic change, Mr. Trump has championed tax cuts for the well-to-do paired with benefit cuts for the struggling voters in his base.

Nowhere has the strategy worked better than Kentucky. In a new book, ""The Government-Citizen Disconnect,"" Suzanne Mettler, a political scientist at Cornell University, observes that Mitch McConnell was known as a pro-civil rights, union-friendly moderate as a county executive in Louisville in the late 1970s. As federal transfers grew from around 10 percent of the income of the average Kentuckian in 1970 to 24 percent in 2016, seven percentage points more than the national average, the ideology of Mr. McConnell, the Senate majority leader -- and the rest of Kentucky's congressional delegation -- moved sharply to the right.

And local Democrats -- who once thrived in heavily unionized mining towns -- gradually lost ground. In 2015 Mr. Bevin became only the second Republican since the 1970s to take the governorship. And in 2016, Republicans captured the State Assembly and for the first time gained full control of Kentucky's executive and legislative branches.

Transfers from the federal government account for more than half of residents' personal income in 11 counties across the country. Ten are in eastern Kentucky; another is in West Virginia. Nine of those sit in Kentucky's Fifth Congressional District, which was the first in the nation to declare a winner on election night, Nov. 6: Harold Rogers, a Republican who has held the seat since 1981. He won 79 percent of the vote.

Even excluding health insurance -- which some experts argue should not count -- people in this patch of Appalachia draw between a fifth and a third of their income from the public purse.

Perhaps the politics of welfare is changing -- up to a point. Democrats made big gains this year in elections for the House and several statehouses, running largely on the promise that they would protect the most recent addition to the safety net: the Affordable Care Act, including the expansion of Medicaid in many states. But championing the safety net does not necessarily resonate in the places that most need it.

Take Daniel Lewis, who crashed his car into a coal truck 15 years ago, breaking his neck and suffering a blood clot in his brain when he was only 21. He is grateful for the $1,600 a month his family gets from disability insurance; for his Medicaid benefits; for the food stamps he shares with his wife and two children.

""Every need I have has been met,"" Mr. Lewis told me. He disagrees with the governor's proposal to demand that Medicaid recipients get a job. And yet, in 2016, he voted for Mr. Trump. ""It was the lesser of two evils,"" he said.

About 13 percent of Harlan's residents are receiving disability benefits. More than 10,000 get food stamps. But in 2015 almost two-thirds voted for Mr. Bevin. In 2016 almost 9 out of 10 chose Mr. Trump.

Conservative values surely run strong in this county of many churches and only one liquor store. But the politics of Harlan, a storied Democratic enclave whose yearlong strike against the Duke Power Company's coal-mining interests in 1973 is seared into union lore, can't be explained simply by voters' cultural leanings.

As Professor Mettler points out, the people who rely most on government transfers are least likely to vote. Only 31 percent of Kentucky's electorate voted in 2015; only 16 percent voted for Mr. Bevin. Participation was lowest in the counties most dependent on federal aid. The governor's victory was not propelled by the neediest Kentuckians.

A cognitive disconnect is at play: People often don't link benefits they rely on with the idea of government welfare. Professor Lacy's research, for instance, suggests that ideology and identity influence how people perceive their benefits, and can outweigh their personal experience of such assistance. He finds that Democrats and African-Americans, but not whites or Republicans, were much more likely as groups to feel they were benefiting from government programs in 2012, when Mr. Obama was president, than during the George W. Bush administration in 2008.

But Harlan's experience suggests that the steepest barrier keeping voters from embracing the government payments that help them get through the day comes from fundamental mistrust. It's not necessarily that people here don't understand they benefit. They fear that Washington -- so distant from rural America -- does not understand their plight or have their interests in mind.

""People in Harlan County have been on the front lines of the war on poverty for 50-plus years and can see its actual effects,"" said Preston Jones, the 31-year-old assistant director at the Pine Mountain Settlement School, over the mountain from Harlan. ""It is degrading.""

Mr. Jones, a Republican who not long ago was a Democrat, speaks from a deep well of grievance over the fact that generations of Harlan residents have had to turn to the government for sustenance. That sentiment mixes in with a vague but powerful resentment across the county toward a political system that people here blame for allowing, encouraging even, the decline of coal, its economic backbone.

Harlan is one of the poorest counties in the nation. It has been poor for a long time. The typical household takes in barely $25,000 -- less than half the national median. Opiate abuse is rampant. Over the last century or so, the population has shrunk by more than two-thirds.

Coal still provides some of the best jobs in the county, paying about $1,550 a week, on average -- more than twice the average county wage. But it employs fewer than 600 people. Fewer than 4,000 work the coal mines in all of eastern Kentucky, down from over 15,000 in the early days of the Obama administration. In Harlan County, little more than a third of working-age residents have a job.

Data from Mark Muro and Jacob Whiton at the Brookings Institution's Metropolitan Policy Program shows that as the coal industry has withered since 2010 -- squeezed out by natural gas as cheaper fuel for power generation -- productivity in terms of economic output per Harlan County worker has shrunk by an average of 8.6 percent a year.

There are few open storefronts downtown, mostly occupied by disability lawyers and pawn shops. ""The biggest business for a long time was the U-Haul rental business as people moved out of state,"" said Jay Nolan, who runs a string of newspapers based in London, some 70 miles northwest. ""In Harlan you had to wait for days to get one.""

Many people blame Mr. Obama's Clean Power Plan for killing coal and credit their vote for Mr. Trump to his promise that he would revitalize the industry. Some are skeptical of a government that saved Detroit's automakers but not Appalachia's lifeline. And this feeling is going to be hard to shake.

Harlan has few answers to its economic tribulations: few roads linking it to the world's markets, few good broadband links, few college graduates, few investors willing to risk their money there. ""Most of the kids from here who have a chance to go to university never come back,"" said Colby Kirk, executive director at One Harlan County, a nonprofit economic development group serving the area.

Success, when it happens, happens on a small scale. This year, the Harlan County Chamber of Commerce gave its business-of-the-year award to a fledgling coal-mining company that has grown to 220 jobs, almost twice as many as last year.

Therein lies a monumental obstacle to transforming the politics of America's safety net. As small towns lag behind prosperous urban centers along the coasts, as rural communities shed businesses and jobs, and as their residents turn to welfare as a last line of sustenance, the more they will resent Washington's inability, or unwillingness, to stem the decline.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/21/business/economy/harlan-county-republican-welfare.html
30,the new york times,"WASHINGTON -- Senior Pentagon officials are voicing deepening fears that President Trump's hawkish national security adviser, John R. Bolton, could precipitate a conflict with Iran at a time when Mr. Trump is losing leverage in the Middle East by pulling out American troops.

At Mr. Bolton's direction, the National Security Council asked the Pentagon last year to provide the White House with military options to strike Iran, Defense Department and senior American officials said on Sunday.

The request, which alarmed then-Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and other Pentagon officials, came after Iranian-backed militants fired three mortars or rockets into an empty lot on the grounds of the United States Embassy in Baghdad in September.

In response to Mr. Bolton's request, which The Wall Street Journal first reported, the Pentagon offered some general options, including a cross-border airstrike on an Iranian military facility that would have been mostly symbolic. But Mr. Mattis and other military leaders adamantly opposed retaliating, arguing that the attack was insignificant -- a position that ultimately won out, these officials said.

Such a strike could have caused an armed conflict and could have prompted Iraq to order the United States to leave the country, said a senior American official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss internal policy deliberations.

Since Mr. Bolton took over from H.R. McMaster in April, he has intensified the administration's policy of isolating and pressuring Iran -- reflecting an animus against Iran's leaders that dates back to his days as an official in the George W. Bush administration. As a private citizen, he later called for military strikes on Iran, as well as regime change.

Mr. Bolton has made headway on some issues, like persuading Mr. Trump to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal, but has had less success with others, like maintaining an American military presence in northeastern Syria to counter Iranian influence -- something Mr. Bolton vowed to do only weeks before the president announced in December that he was pulling out.

In asking for military options, a senior administration official said, Mr. Bolton was merely doing his job as national security adviser. He pointed out that the Iranian-backed militants also targeted the American Consulate in Basra.

""The N.S.C. coordinates policy and provides the president with options to anticipate and respond to a variety of threats,"" said a spokesman for the National Security Council, Garrett Marquis.

Mr. Bolton, 70, is not the only Iran hawk in Mr. Trump's circle of top advisers. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo declared in a speech at the American University in Cairo last week that ""countries increasingly understand that we must confront the ayatollahs, not coddle them.""

Earlier this month, he warned Iran against launching three spacecraft, describing them as a pretext for testing missile technology that is necessary to carry a warhead to the United States and other nations. His statement appeared aimed at building a legal case for diplomatic, military or covert action against the Iranian missile program.

It was surprising because Iran has used these modest space missions, mostly to deploy satellites, since 2005. The senior American official said that the Pentagon and the intelligence agencies disagreed with Mr. Pompeo's interpretation of the threat posed by the satellite launches.

Speaking on Sunday on CBS's ""Face the Nation"" during a visit to Abu Dhabi, in the United Arab Emirates, Mr. Pompeo discounted the argument that Mr. Trump's decision to withdraw 2,000 American troops from Syria in the coming months undercuts Washington's ability to achieve its other goals in the region.

""That certainly includes in Syria,"" he said. ""It certainly includes into Iran, if need be.""

But Mr. Pompeo also opposed the idea of an airstrike on Iran after its attack on the embassy, according to a former senior administration official. On Sunday, he declined to comment about The Journal's report. On each stop of his Middle East trip, Mr. Pompeo, a former Army officer, has spoken of the need to counter Iran, but has not talked of military action.

When Mr. McMaster, then a three-star Army general, took over as national security adviser in early 2017, he ordered a new overall war plan for Iran. Mr. Mattis, who is himself an Iran hawk from his days as a Marine Corps commander in the region, delivered options. But those plans were not for the kind of pinpoint strikes that Mr. Bolton envisioned after the attack on the American Embassy on Sept. 6.

On the Sunday following the attack, the senior American official said, Mr. Bolton's deputy at the time, Mira Ricardel, convened an emergency meeting of national security aides to Mr. Trump, called a deputies committee meeting, and asked for retaliatory options.

On Sept. 11, the White House said in a statement, ""The United States will hold the regime in Tehran accountable for any attack that results in injury to our personnel or damage to United States government facilities. America will respond swiftly and decisively in defense of American lives.""

What happened next illustrates Mr. Bolton's management style. As the president's national security adviser, he has largely eliminated the internal policy debates that could air high-level disagreements.

Mr. Bolton does not want to hear opposing views, these officials said, abhors leaks and wants to control everything that flows to the president. But the result is that there is not much consideration of options and, more important, the risk of escalation, according to these people.

The Pentagon declined to comment on Mr. Bolton's request for military options, saying in a statement, ""The Department of Defense is a planning organization and provides the president military options for a variety of threats; routinely reviewing and updating plans and activities to deal with a host of threats, including those posed by Iran, to deter and, if necessary, to respond to aggression.""

A senior administration official said the United States would continue to pursue the withdrawal of Iranian-backed forces from Syria and a political solution in that country. He said the United States was leaving a contingent of American troops at the Al Tanf base in south-central Syria, as a deterrent to Iranian movements in that region.

The past few days have been turbulent for Mr. Bolton. He traveled to Turkey to present a list of conditions for the Syria withdrawal, including a pledge by the Turks not to attack America's Kurdish allies in Syria. President Recep Tayyip Erdogan rejected that demand and refused to see Mr. Bolton.

On Sunday, Mr. Trump backed up his national security adviser, declaring on Twitter that the United States would ""devastate Turkey economically if they hit Kurds.""

With Mr. Pompeo overseeing the nuclear negotiations with North Korea and taking a prominent role on China policy, Mr. Bolton has made Iran the heart of his focus as national security adviser. He scored an early victory when Mr. Trump withdrew from the nuclear deal negotiated by his predecessor, Barack Obama.

Mr. McMaster, backed by Mr. Mattis and former Secretary of State Rex W. Tillerson, had talked Mr. Trump out of withdrawing from the deal on multiple occasions. Even Mr. Pompeo tried to salvage the deal with the Europeans in the days before the president's decision.

In March 2015, when Mr. Obama was negotiating the agreement, Mr. Bolton called for a military strike on Iran, writing in The New York Times that diplomacy would never prevent it from acquiring nuclear weapons.

""The inconvenient truth is that only military action like Israel's 1981 attack on Saddam Hussein's Osirak reactor in Iraq or its 2007 destruction of a Syrian reactor, designed and built by North Korea, can accomplish what is required,"" Mr. Bolton wrote. ""Time is terribly short, but a strike can still succeed.""

Before he joined the Trump administration, Mr. Bolton advocated ""the overthrow of the mullahs' regime in Tehran."" Once in office, he told Voice of America that leadership change was ""not the objective of the administration.""

The news of Mr. Bolton's effort to find a way to strike back at Iran comes as evidence is rising that Tehran is considering -- or at least threatening -- to leave the nuclear agreement.

The chief of Iran's nuclear program, Ali Akbar Salehi, an M.I.T.-educated physicist who helped negotiate the deal, said on Sunday that Tehran had begun ""preliminary activities for designing"" a process for enrichment of uranium.

The actual enrichment -- which he said would be at 20 percent purity, just short of being sufficient to build a nuclear weapon -- would violate the accord. Under its provisions, Iran could not enrich uranium at any significant quantities until 2030.

But the Iranian government has been under pressure to respond to Mr. Trump's withdrawal and the reimposition of sanctions by the United States. European powers have been urging Iran not to leave the deal, fearing it would give the United States an excuse for military action.

Mr. Salehi did not say what the ""preliminary activities"" were, or give a timetable for action. But he said the country wanted to produce ""modern fuel"" for its Tehran Research Reactor, a small, aging reactor that was given to it, during the shah's reign, by the United States.",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/13/us/politics/bolton-iran-pentagon.html
31,the new york times,"Why Berhanu Nega traded a tenured position for the chance to lead a revolutionary force against an oppressive regime.

Berhanu Nega was once one of Bucknell University's most popular professors. An Ethiopian exile with a Ph.D. from the New School for Social Research in Manhattan, he taught one of the economics department's most sought-after electives, African Economic Development. When he wasn't leading seminars or puttering around his comfortable home in a wooded neighborhood five minutes from the Bucknell campus in rural Lewisburg, Pa., Nega traveled abroad for academic conferences and lectured on human rights at the European Parliament in Brussels. ""He was very much concerned with the relationship between democracy and development,"" says John Rickard, an English professor who became one of his close friends. ""He argued that you cannot have viable economic development without democratization, and vice versa."" A gregarious and active figure on campus, he rooted for the Philadelphia Eagles and the Cleveland Cavaliers, campaigned door-to-door for Barack Obama in 2008 and was known as one of the best squash players on the Bucknell faculty. He and his wife, an Ethiopian-born optometrist, raised two sons and sent them to top-ranked colleges, the University of Pennsylvania and Carnegie Mellon. On weekends he sometimes hosted dinners for other Bucknell professors and their families, regaling them with stories about Abyssinian culture and history over Ethiopian food he would prepare himself; he imported the spices from Addis Ababa and made the injera, a spongy sourdough bread made of teff flour, by hand.

Nega remained vague about his past. But students curious enough to Google him would discover that the man who stood before them, outlining development policies in sub-Saharan Africa, was in fact intimately involved in the long-running hostility between Ethiopia and neighboring Eritrea, a conflict that has dragged on for half a century. By the start of the millennium, its newest incarnation, a border war over a patch of seemingly worthless ground just 250 square miles in size, devolved into a tense standoff, with the two nations each massing along the border thousands of troops from both official and unofficial armies. One proxy army fighting on the Eritrean side, a group of disaffected Ethiopians called Ginbot 7, was a force that Nega helped create, founding the movement in 2008 with another Ethiopian exile, Andargachew Tsege, in Washington. The Ethiopian government, which had previously detained Nega as a political prisoner for two years in Addis Ababa, now sentenced him to death in absentia. Bucknell students who did learn about their teacher's past were thrilled. ""It made his classes exciting,"" Rickard says.

In Ginbot 7, Tsege served as the political leader based in Eritrea; Nega was the group's intellectual leader and principal fund-raiser, collecting money from members of the Ethiopian diaspora in Europe and the United States. That all changed one day in June 2014, when Tsege, known to everyone as Andy, made a brief stopover in Sanaa, the capital of Yemen, on his way to Asmara, the capital of Eritrea. As he sat in the airport transit lounge, waiting to board his flight, Yemeni security forces, apparently acting in collusion with Ethiopian intelligence, arrested him and put him on a plane to Addis Ababa, where he was paraded on state television and currently faces a death sentence.

Days after Tsege's arrest and extradition, Nega volunteered to replace him in Eritrea. ""Was I going to remain an academic, sitting in an ivory tower criticizing things?"" he told me. ""Or was I going to do something as an engaged citizen?"" Nega put his house up for sale and took an indefinite leave of absence from the university. It was an extended sabbatical, he told his colleagues. Only a handful of close friends, his wife and his two sons knew the truth.

On a hot July afternoon in 2015, Nega packed a suitcase, bade his wife farewell and was driven by comrades to John F. Kennedy International Airport. He carried a laissez-passer from the Eritrean government, allowing him a one-time entry into the country. Nega was heading for a new life inside a destitute dictatorship sometimes referred to as the North Korea of Africa; the regime was notorious for having supported the Shabab, an Islamist terrorist group in Somalia, and for a military conscription program that condemns many citizens over age 18 to unlimited servitude. Nega also believes he has drawn the scrutiny of the Obama administration and was worried about being stopped and turned around by Homeland Security. It wasn't until the wheels on the EgyptAir jet were up and he was settling into his seat over the Atlantic Ocean, bound for one of the most isolated and repressive nations on Earth, that he was able to relax.

The lights cut out above Nega one chilly night this July, and the rebel chief sat in darkness in a bungalow in Asmara, Eritrea's 7,600-foot-high capital. Nega had spread a map on a coffee table, and he was showing me the route for a clandestine mission that he planned to undertake the following morning. At dawn, he and a comrade would drive 300 miles southwest to the mined, militarized border between Eritrea and Ethiopia to rendezvous with intelligence sources at a rebel base camp. His contacts were smuggling across the border ""highly sensitive information"" about Ethiopian troop positions and about the strength of resistance cells inside Ethiopia, whom Nega was hoping to link up with his own fighters on the Eritrean side of the border.

""They've got documents, and they insist on handing them over only to me,"" Nega told me. ""When there is sensitive material, they first want me to see it and then filter the information to the rest of the organization."" Nega, a burly, balding 58-year-old with a rumpled facade and an appealingly unassuming manner, rubbed his forehead as the lights flickered and then returned. In recent years, Ginbot 7 has grown, and it is now guided by an 80-member council of representatives spread around the world. As commander, Nega oversees several hundred rebel fighters in Eritrea as well as an unknown number of armed members inside Ethiopia who carry out occasional attacks in the movement's name. During his frequent visits to the front lines, he spends his time meeting with fellow commanders, observing training and -- ever the professor -- leading history and democracy seminars using chalk and a blackboard in a ""classroom"" in the bush.

Nega turned back to the map and traced a straight line leading to the Tekeze River, the westernmost border between Ethiopia and Eritrea. The stream was a main crossing point for Ethiopian Army deserters fleeing to the rebels, and in recent weeks it had come under threat from advancing Ethiopian troops. ""They are moving a sizable force into this area, because we are their main target now,"" he said, referring to Ginbot 7, now known as Patriotic Ginbot 7. ""And they are pushing a large part of their army, artillery and tanks into this zone. They haven't started shelling us yet.""

The two nations, now ferocious enemies, were once joined. Eritrea, an Italian colony from 1890 until 1941, was annexed by Ethiopia after World War II; it took a three-decades-long war for the Eritreans to finally liberate themselves, in 1991. The neighbors remained at peace until 1998, when a simmering dispute over the Yirga triangle, a piece of rocky land along the border that had never been clearly demarcated in colonial maps, exploded into two years of tank and trench warfare in which 100,000 died. Today, despite a United Nations-supervised mediation that awarded the disputed territory to Eritrea, Ethiopia continues to occupy the border village Badame. Tens of thousands of troops face each other across a landscape of mines, bunkers, sniper posts and other fortifications.

Violence on the border, while infrequent, can be both sudden and brutal. In mid-June, according to the Eritrean government, Ethiopia launched a full-scale attack along the frontier at Tsorona, the first major incursion since 2012, possibly in retaliation for attacks on its forces by Ginbot 7. Eritrea claimed that it had killed 200 enemy soldiers and wounded 300, though Ethiopia downplayed its losses. ""They almost always deny it,"" Nega told me. ""As far as the Ethiopian government is concerned, nobody ever dies.""

Ethiopia, while an American ally and an economic leader by African standards, is notoriously repressive. The minority Tigrayan regime has jailed hundreds of bloggers, journalists and opposition figures, keeping itself in power by intimidating political opponents, rigging elections and violently putting down protests. Since November of last year, according to Human Rights Watch, state security forces killed more than 400 protesters in the Oromia region, which surrounds Addis Ababa. Protests have recently spread to the Amhara region, as well; in August, security forces shot dead roughly 100 demonstrators and injured hundreds more. Thousands of Oromos, a minority group that makes up about a third of the population, have been jailed without trial on suspicion of supporting the Oromo Liberation Front, a secessionist group. The Ethiopian marathoner Feyisa Lilesa, who won the silver medal at the Olympics this year, drew global attention to the government's abuses when he held his crossed arms over his head at the finish line in solidarity with his fellow Oromos; he says he fears returning home and is seeking political asylum.

Across the room in Nega's bungalow, four fellow rebel commanders, all members of the Ethiopian diaspora, were finishing their supper. The men tore off pieces of injera and dipped the bread into a thick sauce called shiro, washing down the meal with bottles of the local Asmara beer. Esat, an Ethiopian opposition satellite channel broadcast from Europe and the United States, played softly on a television in the corner. The men were part of a revolving contingent of commanders who returned to Asmara from time to time to check their email and escape the primitive conditions in the bush. ""We are five right now,"" Nega said, introducing me to his comrades from Dallas; Arlington, Va.; Calgary, Canada; and Luxembourg. ""Another, from the United Kingdom, is returning here tomorrow morning. We'll be six when he comes. Last week we were eight -- at one point we were 11.""

The house also serves as an infirmary for rebels who become ill or are wounded in combat, and it provides a temporary sanctuary for Ethiopian Army defectors who cross the front lines. One recent arrival was a former Ethiopian Air Force officer, an Oromo who had traveled north 42 hours by bus and on foot, then swum across the Tekeze River to Eritrea. He made the decision to defect while sitting in an Addis Ababa jail cell on ""false charges,"" he told me, of being a member of the Oromo secessionist movement.

""We have many like him,"" Nega said.

Nega put on his jacket to head off in search of diesel fuel for the morning journey to the border. With another rebel comrade from Virginia, we drove down the deserted, lightless streets of Asmara, searching for an open filling station, but the one we found had run out of diesel; Nega would have to return the next morning, delaying his departure for the front lines. When we returned to his home, Nega pointed to a pile of medical supplies in the hallway -- bandages, splints, antibiotics, antimalarials -- that he was planning to ferry to his fighters, and three cardboard boxes packed with solar cells that would provide some rudimentary electricity in the bush. While in the camps, Nega was dependent on his mobile phone for contact with the outside world, but even that was not guaranteed. ""They have shut off phone coverage since the incursion"" by the Ethiopians at Tsorona, he told me. ""I'll be out of touch for days.""

When I first met Nega, in late May 2016, the conditions were decidedly more comfortable. After 10 months in Asmara, Nega had flown back to the United States to attend meetings and the graduation of his younger son, Iyassu, from the University of Pennsylvania. Given his deepening involvement in a rebellion against an American ally, it was possible that this would be the last time he could visit the United States. Indeed, Nega, who is not an American citizen, had his State Department-issued ""travel document"" suspended three years ago, and his application for United States citizenship has been put on indefinite hold. He now travels on an Eritrean passport; together with his green card, it gained him entry into the country -- this time. The State Department would not comment on Nega or Ginbot 7, but Nega surmises that the Obama administration does not look favorably on his activities. Still, he insists, ""nobody is saying, 'Back off.' I think they know that this is not about being against the U.S. We are upholding the basic principles under which the U.S. was established.""

We met over Memorial Day weekend on the terrace of the upscale Café Dupont on Dupont Circle in Washington, joined by his sister Hiwot, who runs a technology start-up in New York, and Iyassu, a 21-year-old former high-school track star who was starting work at a New York investment bank in the fall. Over white wine and chicken salad, the conversation touched on Lin-Manuel Miranda's commencement address and Nega's excitement over crossing paths, after the ceremony, with Donald Trump and Vice President Joe Biden. (Trump's daughter and Biden's granddaughter were members of Iyassu's graduating class.) I asked Iyassu if he had reconciled himself to the idea of his father's new life on the front lines, and he said that he had. ""Ultimately he should continue to pursue what he believes in,"" he told me. He expressed little interest, though, in visiting his father at his Eritrean rebel camp or delving deeper into the raison d'être of the Ginbot 7 movement. ""I just got out of college -- my life has its own direction,"" he said. ""I can't take time off. ... I'm a little bit removed generationally as well.""

The elder Nega is part of a generation of Ethiopians who grew up amid violence and tumult. Over lunch, he recalled what it was like to be a high-school student when a Marxist junta, the Soviet-backed Derg, overthrew Emperor Haile Selassie and ushered in a brutal dictatorship. Nega had grown up privileged, the son of a wealthy entrepreneur, and he watched as his father's vast commercial corn and soybean farms were seized and security forces began arresting, imprisoning and executing thousands of dissidents, including many students. He and his two older sisters joined a resistance movement called the Ethiopian People's Revolutionary Party (E.P.R.P.). They went underground, living in safe houses, eluding the police. His eldest sister was later captured and disappeared in the Derg's prisons. His family searched for her everywhere.

""We had people coming to our house and telling my parents, 'I saw her at this place.' My mother used to go out all over looking for her,"" Nega recalls. Her former cellmates later told him that she had died in prison, probably by committing suicide with a cyanide capsule that she wore around her neck. ""It was common to have cyanide with you because if you were caught, you would be tortured and executed, and through torture you might be forced to betray people,"" Nega said. As the crackdown in Addis intensified, the E.P.R.P. sent Nega north to Tigray province, the center of a growing guerrilla war against the Derg; there, he carried out attacks on government forces. In 1978 a power struggle erupted within the E.P.R.P. leadership, and Nega was thrown into prison. He was released one day before guards turned their guns on the remaining prisoners, killing 15. Nega escaped to Sudan, living as a refugee in Khartoum for nearly two years, then obtained political asylum in the United States in 1980.

He earned his bachelor's degree from the State University of New York at New Paltz, where he also played on the soccer team. While studying for his doctorate at the New School for Social Research, he lived in Brooklyn and wrote his dissertation on the failures of Ethiopian agriculture under the Communist regime. Meanwhile, Ethiopia was sliding deeper into calamity. When the guerrilla movements increased their attacks in Tigray in the mid-1980s, the Derg dictator, Mengistu Haile Mariam, blocked food supplies to the region, creating a devastating famine in which one million people died. Photographs of starving children, disseminated by the news media, catalyzed an international relief effort, Live Aid, and inspired the pop hit ""We Are the World,"" making Ethiopia a worldwide synonym for hunger. The famine had wound down, and the rebel war was escalating, when Bucknell hired Nega as an assistant professor in 1990. ""He never trumpeted his background, the fact that he had been a guerrilla fighter,"" says Dean Baker, a former Bucknell colleague who now heads the Center for Economic and Policy Research in Washington.

In 1991, after a decade's struggle, three rebel groups -- the Tigrayan People's Liberation Front, the Oromo Liberation Front and the Eritrean People's Liberation Front -- defeated the Derg and marched into Addis Ababa. The new government, led by the Tigrayan rebel leader Meles Zenawi, set about rebuilding the war-shattered nation. Nega finally had reason for optimism. He knew Meles well -- the prime minister had been in the same university class as his dead sister -- and after the Tigrayans consolidated power, Nega obtained a leave of absence from Bucknell and flew with his wife and two sons, both toddlers, back to Addis, determined to help rebuild the country. Nega believed that Meles ""had good intentions,"" he told me.

But Nega's enthusiasm for the new government wore off quickly. At Addis Ababa University, where he taught part-time (he had also taken over several of his father's businesses), administrators cracked down on dissent, banning the student government and the school newspaper. When Nega encouraged his students to press for academic freedoms, police assaulted them and other demonstrators; later, as unrest spread through the city, they shot 41 people dead. Nega spent a month in jail for abetting the protests. ""At night I was hearing prisoners being tortured, beaten,"" he says.

In May 2005, with the economy growing rapidly and the government's popularity appar­ently high, Ethiopia held elections, the first truly multiparty vote in Ethiopia's history, and invited international observers to attend. But the results were not to Meles's liking. Nega's Coalition for Unity and Democracy won 137 of the 138 seats on the City Council in Addis Ababa. Nega was poised to become mayor, but the government denied his party the victory and jailed him along with other C.U.D. leaders. American colleagues began a campaign to free Nega. ""The Bucknell faculty approved a motion to support him and call attention to his plight,"" Rickard says. ""We talked with journalists, ambassadors, trying to make sure that he stayed on the front burner."" International pressure helped to secure Nega's release after 21 months, and he returned to the United States. The experience ""hardened him,"" says Samuel Adamassu, a member of the Ethio­pian diaspora who has known Nega and his family since the 1980s. ""It made him realize these people are not willing to change without being forced.""

After our lunch in Washington, I attended a fund-raising rally for Ginbot 7 at the Georgetown Marriott, attended by about 500 members of the Ethiopian diaspora. Nega stood before a backdrop of Ethiopian and American flags. It would be a fight to the death, he assured the cheering crowd. ""There is no negotiation with someone who is coming to rape you,"" Nega went on in Amharic, the principal language of Ethiopia. ""We have to stop them."" The contrast between the mild-mannered academic I had met on the patio of the Café Dupont and the fiery rebel leader was striking. Nega announced that he had brought news from the front lines: Guerillas claiming loyalty to his movement had carried out their most significant attack to date, outside the town Arba Minch, in southern Ethiopia, formerly the site of an American drone base. ""We killed 20 soldiers and injured 50 of them,"" he said, calling it ""a new stage in the struggle."" (The Ethiopian government claimed they foiled the attack and killed some of the gunman.)

When Nega helped found the Ginbot 7 movement in 2008, the year he returned to teaching at Bucknell, he explained that the movement would seek to ""organize civil disobedience and help the existing armed movements"" inside and outside Ethiopia and ""put pressure on the government, and the international community, to come to a negotiation."" Yet the Ginbot 7 platform advocated destabilizing the government ""by any means necessary,"" including attacks on soldiers and police. It was a discordant message coming out of a liberal American university whose first class was held in the basement of the First Baptist Church of Lewisburg in 1846. ""It's a line that he has crossed,"" says Rickard, the English professor, who finds Nega's advocacy of violence ""troubling"" but understandable. ""He has never been a pacifist, never renounced armed struggle,"" he says. ""He has seen elections overturned, hundreds of people murdered on the streets. His sister died, and his best friend is in prison, in peril of his life. He sees violence as viable and necessary. It's kind of shocking, in a way.""

While Ginbot 7 started to foment its resistance, Ethiopia was busy rebranding itself as an economic success story. Following South Korean and Chinese models of state-directed development, Meles borrowed from state-owned banks and used Western aid money to invest heavily in dams, airlines, agriculture, education and health care. Ethiopia's economy took off, averaging nearly 11 percent growth per year for the last decade, one of the highest rates in Africa. Addis Ababa became the showpiece of the country's transformation, with a light rail system, ubiquitous high-rise construction and luxury hotels, high-end restaurants and wine bars packed with newly minted millionaires. At the same time, the country was becoming a bulwark against the spread of radical Islam in the Horn of Africa. Today Ethiopia provides 4,400 peacekeepers to an African Union force in Somalia and helps keep the peace along the tense border between North and South Sudan. In July 2015 President Obama, on an African tour, paid the first visit ever to Ethiopia by a sitting American president.

Yet in the classroom and abroad, Nega argued that Ethiopia's transformation was a mirage, created to placate Western observers troubled by the lack of democracy. ""In 2005, it became clear that legitimacy would not come through the political process, so they started this new narrative -- development,"" he told me. Nega insists that Ethiopia has ""cooked the books,"" and that its growth rate is largely attributable to huge infrastructure projects and Western development aid, with little contribution from the private sector. ""The World Bank is throwing money at Ethiopia like there's no tomorrow,"" he told me. The actual growth rate, he insists, is closer to 5 to 6 percent -- per capita income is still among the lowest in the world -- and the weakness of the country's institutions will mean that even this rate cannot be sustained.

Two months before Obama arrived, the government presided over what was widely considered a sham election, in which the ruling party won all 547 seats in Parliament, But Obama, making it clear that security trumped other concerns in the Horn of Africa, stood beside Meles's successor, Prime Minister Hailemariam Desalegn, and described the government as being ""democratically elected.""

""I was shocked,"" Nega told me. "" I understand the reality of power and why he supports the Ethiopian government, but to say it is 'democratically elected'? I was disgusted.""

Three days after my first meeting with Nega in Asmara, and shortly after he returned from his border rendezvous, we drove in the late afternoon in his white Hilux pickup truck through the landscape of his new life. We passed the run-down and nearly deserted Asmara Palace Hotel, formerly an Intercontinental Hotel, and a large Catholic church that Nega couldn't identify. ""I'm a lousy tourist guide,"" he said apologetically. While in Asmara, he spends most of his time hunkered down either in his residence or at a borrowed office in the center of town -- one of the few places in the city with a high-speed internet connection. Eritrea has the lowest internet penetration in the world, with only about 1 percent of the population online, and this rare broadband connection allows him to catch up regularly on Skype with his sons and his wife. ""I don't think she's very happy about my being here,"" he admitted, shifting uncomfortably. ""We have really stopped talking about it.""

Immediately following its independence in the early 1990s, under the rebel-leader-turned-president Isaias Afwerki, Eritrea was briefly considered one of the hopes of Africa. When I visited the country in 1996, five years after it won its liberation from Ethiopia, the former rebels were starting to revive the wrecked economy -- rebuilding roads, bridges and a railway to the coast, calling on the Eritrean diaspora to invest. But after the border war between 1998 and 2000, Eritrea's leadership turned inward, growing increasingly suspicious of the outside world. Afwerki suppressed dissent, expelled Western journalists and NGOs, turned down foreign aid, nationalized industries and discouraged foreign investment; according to the World Bank, per capita income is about $1,400 a year. In 2009 the United Nations Security Council imposed sanctions on Eritrea, including an arms em­bargo and a travel ban and a freeze on the assets of top Eritrean officials, for providing weapons to the Shabab, the radical Islamist group that has carried out hundreds of terrorist attacks in Somalia and neighboring Kenya. (Eritrea called the allegation ""fabricated lies."") A June 2016 United Nations report accused the Eritrean government of committing ""crimes against human­ity,"" including torture, jailing dissidents and the open-ended military conscription program that the government justifies as preparation against another Ethiopian invasion.

With virtually no investment coming into the country, Asmara has become a city frozen in time. Two donkeys meandered down Harnet Avenue, the capital's main boulevard, stopping to nibble at a patch of grass around a palm tree. As we watched the crowds walk down the tidy avenue lined by an imposing red brick cathedral, a 1930s-era Art Deco movie theater and crumbling Italian bakeries and cappuccino bars, Nega defended his decision to turn to the dictatorship for support.

""Do we really have to discuss the kind of dictatorships that the U.S. sleeps with?"" he asked me. ""Here is a country that was willing to give us sanctuary, a country that had once been part of Ethiopia. I look at any of these people, I talk to them, and they are just like me, they are as Ethiopian as I am. Why should I not get help from them?""

Nega insisted that he saw some positives in the dictatorship. ""This is the only country that says, despite its poverty, 'We are going to chart our own course -- whether you like it or not,' "" he told me. ""They are not corrupt. You see these government officials driving 1980s cars, torn down the middle. I have seen their lives, their houses. There is some element of a David-and-Goliath struggle in this thing."" He called the United Nations report describing crimes against humanity an ""exaggeration."" (A Western diplomat in Asmara I talked to, who asked not to be identified because of the political sensitivities of his position, agreed with Nega's assessment of the report, saying it was based on testimony of refugees in Europe who had ""an interest in depicting their country as badly as possible to justify their status."")

It goes without saying that Nega was reluctant to speak harshly about the nation that was providing his movement with a refuge -- and that could snatch it away at any moment. ""I don't want to butt into their personal issues,"" he said carefully. ""They've always been nice to us."" Out of the public eye, however, the rebel leader can be more critical. ""He holds no illusions about Eritrea,"" says his friend and former Bucknell colleague Dean Baker.

I asked Nega if he was confident that pressure by the rebel groups could bring down the Ethiopian government. Nega believed that momentum was on his side. ""This resistance to the state is coming in every direction now, in all parts of the country,"" he said. He was giving himself ""four or five years"" before he and his rebel forces entered Ethiopia as part of a new democratic dispensation. ""It certainly won't be a decade,"" he told me.

Until that happens, Nega will continue planning and preparing from a precarious and lonely limbo. Back at the bungalow, he led me down the corridor and showed me where he slept: a monastic chamber furnished with a single bed, an armoire and a night table strewn with jars of vitamins and blood-pressure medication. (He lost his medical insurance when he left Bucknell, but still has American insurance coverage through his wife, and he picked up a three-month supply of the medicine on his May trip to the United States.) He retrieved from the freezer a chilled bottle of Absolut and poured two glasses. We sat in the concrete courtyard, beside a clothesline draped with Nega's laundry. The power failed again, casting us into total darkness, then returned a few seconds later. The contrast with his previous life in the States -- cheering for the Lewisburg Green Dragons, his son's high-school track team; vacationing on the beaches of Maryland and North Carolina with his extended family -- could hardly have been more extreme.

""If you like comfort, and that's what drives you, you'll never do this,"" he told me, taking a sip of the ice-cold vodka. ""But sometimes you get really surprised. Once you have a commitment to something, all these things that you thought were normal in your day-to-day life become unnecessary luxuries.""",https://www.nytimes.com/2016/09/04/magazine/once-a-bucknell-professor-now-the-commander-of-an-ethiopian-rebel-army.html

Good evening. Here's the latest.

1. Democrats took control of the House of Representatives and elected Nancy Pelosi as speaker, returning divided government to Washington.

The power shift came amid a partial government shutdown, with President Trump's insistence on a wall on the Mexican border running headlong into newly energized Democratic opposition. House Democrats are voting on two new bills to reopen the federal government this evening, but their prospects in the Senate seemed dim.

Hours before her election, Ms. Pelosi, center, suggested in an interview that a sitting president could be indicted and left open the option of impeachment, kicking off what could shape up to be a memorable term.

The incoming class of freshman lawmakers is best described in superlatives -- it is the most racially diverse group ever elected to the House, and it includes a historic number of women.

2. An American citizen has been charged with spying in Russia, his lawyer said.

Paul Whelan, 48, above, is the head of security for a Michigan auto parts maker and a Marine Corps veteran. A Russian news agency reported that he was accused of trying to recruit a Russian citizen to obtain classified information.

Mr. Whelan's family said he was in Russia to attend the wedding of a friend. His lawyer said his client was upbeat despite being held in solitary confinement.

There has been widespread speculation that Russia seized Mr. Whelan to exchange him for Maria Butina, a Russian citizen who pleaded guilty to conspiring to act as a foreign agent and influence N.R.A. officials and prominent Republicans.

3. A spending slowdown in China has investors concerned, leading U.S. markets to close down about 2.5 percent.

News that Apple was cutting its revenue forecast for the first time in 16 years because of poor iPhone sales in China sparked fears. And reams of other data suggest Chinese consumers are tightening their belts over worries about the trade war, personal debt and their country's own economy. Above, in Beijing.

Shrinking Chinese demand would have a big impact on a world looking for engines of growth, on companies that counted on China's continuing expansion and on global investors who have long viewed the country as a steady source of profits.

So what should you do about the falling stock market? Take a nap, writes our senior economics correspondent.

4. In Turkey, ""the brain drain is real.""

After a failed coup attempt in 2016, President Recep Tayyip Erdogan set out on a sweeping crackdown, consolidating his power and steering the country toward authoritarianism.

Since then, hundreds of thousands of Turks -- including entrepreneurs and wealthy individuals -- have left the country. They have emigrated because of fear of political persecution, distrust of the judiciary, mismanagement of the economy and a deteriorating business climate. Above, in Istanbul.

The exodus has resulted in an alarming loss of talent and capital in Turkey, at a time when its economy is teetering -- a development that some experts believe looks like a more permanent reordering of society, threatening to set the country back decades.

5. Saudi Arabia's public prosecutor requested the death penalty for five suspects in the killing of the Saudi dissident Jamal Khashoggi.

The announcement came after the first court session in the case. It provided no new information about the murder, the investigation or why the prosecutor sought the death penalty against only five of the 11 suspects charged in Mr. Khashoggi's death.

The killing inside the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul has badly tarnished the international reputation of the kingdom and of its crown prince and day-to-day ruler, Mohammed bin Salman. Above, at a vigil in Istanbul.

The Trump administration has stood by the prince, an important ally in the Middle East. But U.S. intelligence agencies and members of Congress believe he ordered the killing.

7. Two Australian artists have paid for and installed a bronze menagerie of kitschy statues -- anthropomorphic dogs and rabbits, topsy-turvy rhinos -- across New York City.

In August, their ""Statues for Equality,"" 10 likenesses of women including Angelina Jolie and Michelle Obama, will line the property facing Radio City Music Hall. Above, ""The Table of Love"" at 237 Park Ave.

They've quickly become the most prolific creators of public art in New York City history -- to the dismay of leading art historians. Awarding city space to wealthy artists who can afford to bankroll their own work saves taxpayer dollars at the expense of diversity, experts told us.

The couple ""would not be considered serious artists with a capital 'A' and yet they have eight commissions?"" one said. ""That's a severe imbalance.""

8. New York City's subway service got a reprieve.

In an unexpected announcement, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said technology imported from Europe would be used to fix a tunnel without having to close it entirely.

The new plan would avert an expected 15-month shutdown of a major subway tunnel between Manhattan and Brooklyn on the L line, above.

The closure would have affected 250,000 riders daily, making it one of the biggest transportation disruptions in New York City's recent history.

Separately, a plan intended to help low-income New Yorkers by offering them discount MetroCards for the subway and buses has stalled. Seattle started a program in 2015 that has served as a model for other cities. Toronto is implementing a similar plan.

33,the new york times,"I've only been around Phil Anschutz a few times. My impressions on those occasions was that he was a run-of-the-mill arrogant billionaire. He was used to people courting him and he addressed them condescendingly from the lofty height of his own wealth.

I've never met Ryan McKibben, who runs part of Anschutz's media group. But stories about him have circulated around Washington over the years. The stories suggest that he is an ordinary corporate bureaucrat -- with all the petty vanities and the lack of interest in ideas that go with the type.

Last week, Anschutz and McKibbin murdered The Weekly Standard, the conservative opinion magazine that Anschutz owned. They didn't merely close it because it was losing money. They seemed to have murdered it out of greed and vengeance.

John Podhoretz, one of the magazine's founders, reports that they actively prevented potential buyers from coming in to take it over and keep it alive. They apparently wanted to hurt the employees and harvest the subscription list so they could make money off it. And Anschutz, being a professing Christian, decided to close the magazine at the height of the Christmas season, and so cause maximum pain to his former employees and their families.

The closing of The Weekly Standard is being told as a Trump story, as all stories must be these days. The magazine has been critical of Trump, and so this is another example of the gradual hegemony of Trumpism over the conservative world. That is indeed the backdrop to what happened here.

But that's not the whole story. In reality, this is what happens when corporate drones take over an opinion magazine, try to drag it down to their level and then grow angry and resentful when the people at the magazine try to maintain some sense of intellectual standards. This is what happens when people with a populist mind-set decide that an uneducated opinion is of the same value as an educated opinion, that ignorance sells better than learning.

In that sense, the closing of The Standard resembles Chris Hughes's destruction of the old New Republic. This is what happens when the commercial forces trying to dumb down the American media run into a pocket of people trying to resist those forces.

I was on staff when The Standard was founded, by Bill Kristol, Podhoretz and Fred Barnes. They gathered the most concentrated collection of talent I have ever been around. The first masthead featured Charles Krauthammer, P.J. O'Rourke, Robert Kagan, David Frum, Chris Caldwell, Matt Labash, Tucker Carlson and the greatest political writer of my generation, Andrew Ferguson.

Early issues featured the writings of Tom Wolfe, Gertrude Himmelfarb, James Q. Wilson and Harvey Mansfield. The person at the bottom of the editorial masthead, a young Neomi Rao, has just been nominated to replace Brett Kavanaugh on the U.S. Court of Appeals.

It was and remains a warm, fun and convivial group. The magazine's tone was part high intellectualism, part street-level political reporting and part Hunter Thompson-style gonzo journalism.

The Standard was conservative, but It frequently dissented from the Republican establishment and delighted in modern pop culture. The staff was never unanimous about anything. The many flavors of conservatism were hashed out in its pages. If it stood for anything, I would say it stood for this: that the good life consists of being an active citizen and caring passionately about politics; that it also consists of knowing something about Latin American fiction, ancient Greek culture and social impact of modern genetics; that it also consists of delighting in the latest good movies and TV shows, the best new cocktails and the casual pleasures of life.

Over the past year, under the editorship of Steve Hayes, the magazine was as good as it ever was. Adam Keiper did brilliant work with the back of the book. Amazingly talented young writers were recruited, like Adam Rubenstein, Alice Lloyd and Haley Byrd. If you look at the issue now online -- the last that apparently will ever go online -- there's an article calling on Republicans to respect due process, a look at what can be done to bring down the suicide rate, an essay by literary critic Paul Cantor on ""Frankenstein"" at 200 and a piece on the sixth-century Roman poet Maximianus.

Over the past few years, if all the stories are correct, McKibbin tried to change the tone of the magazine. He tried to get The Standard to hire highly partisan shock-jock screamers. He tried to tilt in more in the direction of a Republican direct mail fund-raising letter. When these efforts were blocked, resentment flared and the ax fell.

The Standard is now gone, but the people and ideas The Standard nurtured will continue to flourish. The talented young people who were fired last week will go on to have brilliant careers; the courage and integrity Hayes has shown during the Trump era will continue to inspire, while the drab corporate bureaucrats fade into the sand.

Good morning.

The curious case of an American charged with espionage, a new session of the U.S. Congress and a plan to return art to Africa. Here's the latest:

American accused of spying in Russia

An American citizen has been charged with spying in Russia, his lawyer said.

The Russian authorities have brought espionage charges against Paul Whelan, a former Marine who is the head of global security for an auto parts maker. If convicted, Mr. Whelan faces up to 20 years in prison.

Why Russia: Mr. Whelan's family said he was in Russia to attend the wedding of a friend. A Russian news agency reported that he was accused of trying to recruit a Russian citizen to obtain classified information.

Possible exchange: There has been widespread speculation that Russia seized Mr. Whelan to exchange him for Maria Butina, a Russian who pleaded guilty in a U.S. federal court to conspiring to act as a foreign agent and influence N.R.A. officials and prominent Republicans.

The 116th Congress comes to order

Democrats took control of the House of Representatives and returned Nancy Pelosi to the speaker's post, bringing divided government back to Washington.

Hours before her election, Ms. Pelosi, the only woman who has been speaker of the House, suggested in an interview that a sitting president could be indicted and left open the option of impeaching President Trump. She is now second in line to the presidency.

Meet the new freshmen: The class is best described in superlatives -- it is the most racially diverse group ever elected to the House, and it includes a historic number of women.

Government shutdown: In its first session, the House passed a plan to reopen the government, but the shutdown isn't over. The Senate may not even vote on it. Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader, is facing pressure from members of his own party to step in and resolve the stalemate.

Was Wall Street right?

Last month, investors seemed too pessimistic. Now, they seem prescient.

As companies like Apple and Delta issued warnings this week about the health of their businesses, their concern suggests that investors were right to be worried. Scores of companies will soon report fourth-quarter results. A White House official said there could be a torrent of bad news from corporate America.

Markets: News that Apple was cutting its revenue forecast for the first time in 16 years because of poor iPhone sales in China rippled through stocks around the world.

Another angle: What should you do about the falling stock market? Take a nap, our senior economics correspondent writes.

Out of Europe

In November, a pivotal report commissioned by the French president called for thousands of artworks to leave French museums and return to West Africa. But how do Africans see the challenges of restituting works of art?

The Times sat down with an African artist, a historian and a philosopher to discuss what should happen.

What's at stake: It could be the largest shake-up ever for European museums that have objects acquired during the colonial era.

One take: ""It demands that the logic of France's relationship to Africa be renegotiated,"" a French art historian said. ""It's not simply about the objects, and where they are. By insisting on full restitution, the idea of 'long-term loans' to African countries becomes as absurd as it sounds.""

Here's what else is happening

Brexit: A new poll of Conservative Party members shows that 57 percent prefer leaving the European Union without a deal, despite warnings of price increases and food shortages.

France: The French police arrested a prominent leader of the Yellow Vest movement for a second time, a clear signal that the government is following through on a pledge to get tough after violent protests.

North Korea: The country's ambassador to Italy disappeared from its embassy in Rome in November in what appeared to be a defection attempt, according to a South Korean lawmaker.

Rome: Pope Francis told U.S. bishops to set aside their differences and confront a ""crisis of credibility"" stemming from the sexual abuse scandal.

Jamal Khashoggi: Saudi Arabia's public prosecutor formally requested the death penalty for five suspects in the killing of the dissident, but didn't provide their names, the roles they played in the crime or any other details.

Intermission: London's theaters are finally tackling one of their biggest issues: a need for more women's bathrooms.

Moon landing: China's Chang'e-4 became the first spacecraft to make a soft landing on the far side of the moon. Take a look at some early images.

Germany: An independent movie theater offered free tickets to the rereleased ""Schindler's List"" to members of the far-right Alternative for Germany party. Party members called it a ""senseless provocation.""

Around the world: Our inaugural 52 Places Traveler journeyed nearly 75,000 miles around the globe. Here's what she learned in a year of almost nonstop motion.

Back Story

Some of us are still sorting through the year-end ""best of"" lists. Notably, many video game lists included a new release with roots in 1984: Tetris Effect.

It features a modern visual and sonic experience, including an acclaimed virtual-reality mode. But its core is the same gameplay that a Russian programmer, Alexey Pajitnov, created in his original title, Tetris.

In that version -- and in more than 200 subsequent official releases -- seven shapes (configurations of four squares, called tetriminos) stream one by one from the top of the screen. The player seeks to organize them to fill horizontal rows, which then clear from the field of play. The game ends when uncleared areas fill the playing grid. (Because of Soviet-era contracts, Mr. Pajitnov only began to get Tetris royalties in 1996.)

A report in The Times in 1988 said players found it ""surprisingly addictive.""

That has been borne out. Players report seeing the tetriminos away from the screen, including while dreaming.

The phenomenon's name? The Tetris Effect.

35,the new york times,"NEW YORK -- A 16-year-old American boy fighting on behalf of the Islamic State was captured on the battlefield in Syria, an American-backed force fighting the militants said Wednesday.

If the teenager is proved to be a United States citizen, he would be the first American minor to be caught fighting on behalf of the terrorist group overseas.

His arrest follows the capture of Warren Christopher Clark, 34, a former substitute teacher from Texas whose seizure in the same area was announced on Sunday. They are among the handful of American citizens -- just five so far -- who have been taken alive on the front line in the battle against the Islamic State, according to a database maintained by the Program on Extremism at George Washington University.

The militia that announced the boy's capture, the Syrian Democratic Forces, said he was among eight foreign fighters who were apprehended this week in the last sliver of Islamic State-held territory in northeastern Syria. The others included citizens of Germany, Russia, Ukraine, Tajikistan, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan.

United States officials did not immediately respond to a request for comment, and over the weekend the same militia announced the capture of what they said was another American citizen. There were indications, however, that that person might be from Trinidad, according to Simon Cottee, a senior lecturer in criminology at the University of Kent.

Mr. Cottee also said that he had a name very similar to that of the teenager said to be American in a database kept to track Islamic State fighters from Trinidad.

The captures were announced three weeks after President Trump declared ""We have won against ISIS,"" another name for the Islamic State, and ordered the withdrawal of 2,000 American troops from Syria.

While United States officials have estimated that 295 Americans either have joined or tried to join militant groups in Iraq and Syria, they have not said how many of those recruits successfully made it to the battle zone, nor which group they joined.

The database maintained by the Program on Extremism has identified just 55 American nationals who joined the Islamic State. That is a small fraction of the number from countries like France, from where at least 1,400 people are believed to have joined, according to the Paris-based Center for the Analysis of Terrorism.

While the 16-year-old would be the only American minor caught on the battlefield, other American teenagers have been found in Islamic State-controlled territory.

A 15-year-old girl from Kansas was repatriated from Syria, after being forced to travel to the war zone by her father. She was forcibly married to an ISIS fighter and was pregnant at the time of her capture.

And several other American teenagers have been arrested for trying to carry out attacks on behalf of the militants in the United States. Prosecuting them has proved difficult because of their age, said Seamus Hughes, the deputy director of the George Washington University Program on Extremism.

In South Carolina, for instance, Zakaryia Abdin was accused of plotting an attack against soldiers on behalf of the Islamic State at age 16. He initially pleaded guilty to a firearms offense and was sentenced to one year in a juvenile facility. Only when he tried to travel to Syria following his parole, then age 18, did the Justice Department charge him with providing material support to a foreign terrorist organization.

In New Jersey, Santos Colon, 17, pleaded guilty in 2017 to participating in a plot to kill Pope Francis during a Mass in Philadelphia two years earlier. He was released to a halfway house pending sentencing; he faces up to 15 years in prison.

""Here's the concern with this case,"" Mr. Hughes said, referring to the teenager apprehended in Syria. ""How long has this young man been in Syria? Did he go early on with family? Or is it a more recent case of traveling? And he is purported to have been fighting for ISIS. It's one thing to say it and another to prove it in a court of law, and authorities may well decide not to prosecute him given his age.""",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/09/world/middleeast/isis-american-teen-captured.html
36,the new york times,"This column has argued for a while now that there is only one thing worse than one-party autocracy, and that is one-party democracy. At least a one-party autocracy can order things to get done.

A one-party democracy -- that is, a two-party system where only one party is interested in governing and the other is in constant blocking mode, which has characterized America in recent years -- is much worse. It can't do anything big, hard or important.

We can survive a few years of such deadlock in Washington, but we sure can't take another four or eight years without real decay setting in, and that explains what I'm rooting for in this fall's elections: I hope Hillary Clinton wins all 50 states and the Democrats take the presidency, the House, the Senate and, effectively, the Supreme Court.

That is the best thing that could happen to America, at least for the next two years -- that Donald Trump is not just defeated, but is crushed at the polls. That would have multiple advantages for our country.

First, if Clinton wins a sweeping victory, we will have a chance (depending on the size of a Democratic majority in the Senate) to pass common-sense gun laws. That would mean restoring the Assault Weapons Ban, which was enacted as part of the 1994 federal crime bill but expired after 10 years, and making it illegal for anyone on the terrorist watch list to buy a gun.

I don't want to touch any citizen's Second Amendment rights, but the notion that we can't restrict military weapons that are increasingly being used in mass murders defies common sense -- yet it can't be fixed as long as today's G.O.P. controls any branch of government.

If Clinton wins a sweeping victory, we can borrow $100 billion at close to zero interest for a national infrastructure rebuild to deal with some of the nation's shameful deferred maintenance of roads, bridges, airports and rails and its inadequate bandwidth, and create more blue-collar jobs that would stimulate growth.

If Clinton wins a sweeping victory, we will have a chance to put in place a revenue-neutral carbon tax that would stimulate more clean energy production and allow us to reduce both corporate taxes and personal income taxes, which would also help spur growth.

If Clinton wins a sweeping victory, we can fix whatever needs fixing with Obamacare, without having to junk the whole thing. Right now we have the worst of all worlds: The G.O.P. will not participate in any improvements to Obamacare nor has it offered a credible alternative.

At the same time, if Clinton crushes Trump in November, the message will be sent by the American people that the game he played to become the Republican nominee -- through mainstreaming bigotry; name-calling; insulting women, the handicapped, Latinos and Muslims; retweeting posts by hate groups; ignorance of the Constitution; and a willingness to lie and make stuff up with an ease and regularity never seen before at the presidential campaign level -- should never be tried by anyone again. The voters' message, ""Go away,"" would be deafening.

Finally, if Trump presides over a devastating Republican defeat across all branches of government, the G.O.P. will be forced to do what it has needed to do for a long time: take a time out in the corner. In that corner Republicans could pull out a blank sheet of paper and on one side define the biggest forces shaping the world today -- and the challenges and opportunities they pose to America -- and on the other side define conservative, market-based policies to address them.

Our country needs a healthy center-right party that can compete with a healthy center-left party. Right now, the G.O.P. is not a healthy center-right party. It is a mishmash of religious conservatives; angry white males who fear they are becoming a minority in their own country and hate trade; gun-control opponents; pro-lifers; anti-regulation and free-market small-business owners; and pro- and anti-free trade entrepreneurs.

The party was once held together by the Cold War. But as that faded away it has been held together only by renting itself out to whoever could energize its base and keep it in power -- Sarah Palin, Rush Limbaugh, the Tea Party, the National Rifle Association. But at its core there was no real common denominator, no take on the world, no real conservative framework.

The party grew into a messy, untended garden, and Donald Trump was like an invasive species that finally just took over the whole thing.

Party leaders can all still call themselves Republicans. They can even hold a convention with a lot of G.O.P. elephant balloons. But the truth is, the party's over. Thoughtful Republicans have started to admit that. John Boehner gave up being speaker of the House because he knew that his caucus had become a madhouse, incapable of governing.

A Clinton sweep in November would force more Republicans to start rebuilding a center-right party ready to govern and compromise. And a Clinton sweep would also mean Hillary could govern from the place where her true political soul resides -- the center-left, not the far left.

37,the new york times,"The presidential oath of office contains 35 words and one core promise: to ""preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States."" Since virtually the moment Donald J. Trump took that oath two years ago, he has been violating it.

He has repeatedly put his own interests above those of the country. He has used the presidency to promote his businesses. He has accepted financial gifts from foreign countries. He has lied to the American people about his relationship with a hostile foreign government. He has tolerated cabinet officials who use their position to enrich themselves.

To shield himself from accountability for all of this -- and for his unscrupulous presidential campaign -- he has set out to undermine the American system of checks and balances. He has called for the prosecution of his political enemies and the protection of his allies. He has attempted to obstruct justice. He has tried to shake the public's confidence in one democratic institution after another, including the press, federal law enforcement and the federal judiciary.

The unrelenting chaos that Trump creates can sometimes obscure the big picture. But the big picture is simple: The United States has never had a president as demonstrably unfit for the office as Trump. And it's becoming clear that 2019 is likely to be dominated by a single question: What are we going to do about it?

The easy answer is to wait -- to allow the various investigations of Trump to run their course and ask voters to deliver a verdict in 2020. That answer has one great advantage. It would avoid the national trauma of overturning an election result. Ultimately, however, waiting is too dangerous. The cost of removing a president from office is smaller than the cost of allowing this president to remain.

He has already shown, repeatedly, that he will hurt the country in order to help himself. He will damage American interests around the world and damage vital parts of our constitutional system at home. The risks that he will cause much more harm are growing.

Some of the biggest moderating influences have recently left the administration. The defense secretary who defended our alliances with NATO and South Korea is gone. So is the attorney general who refused to let Trump subvert a federal investigation into himself. The administration is increasingly filled with lackeys and enablers. Trump has become freer to turn his whims into policy -- like, say, shutting down the government on the advice of Fox News hosts or pulling troops from Syria on the advice of a Turkish autocrat.

The biggest risk may be that an external emergency -- a war, a terrorist attack, a financial crisis, an immense natural disaster -- will arise. By then, it will be too late to pretend that he is anything other than manifestly unfit to lead.

For the country's sake, there is only one acceptable outcome, just as there was after Americans realized in 1974 that a criminal was occupying the Oval Office. The president must go.

Achieving this outcome won't be easy. It will require honorable people who have served in the Trump administration to share, publicly, what they have seen and what they believe. (At this point, anonymous leaks are not sufficient.) It will require congressional Republicans to acknowledge that they let a con man take over their party and then defended that con man. It will require Democrats and progressive activists to understand that a rushed impeachment may actually help Trump remain in office.

But if removing him will not be easy, it's not as unlikely as it may sometimes seem. From the beginning, Trump has been an unusually weak president, as political scientists have pointed out. Although members of Congress have not done nearly enough to constrain him, no other recent president has faced nearly so much public criticism or private disdain from his own party.

Since the midterm election showed the political costs that Trump inflicts on Republicans, this criticism seems to be growing. They have broken with him on foreign policy (in Saudi Arabia, Yemen and Syria) and are anxious about the government shutdown. Trump is vulnerable to any erosion in his already weak approval rating, be it from an economic downturn, more Russia revelations or simply the defection of a few key allies. When support for an unpopular leader starts to crack, it can crumble.

Before we get to the how of Trump's removal, though, I want to spend a little more time on the why -- because even talking about the ouster of an elected president should happen only under extreme circumstances. Unfortunately, the country is now so polarized that such talk instead occurs with every president. Both George W. Bush and Barack Obama were subjected to reckless calls for their impeachment, from members of Congress no less.

So let's be clear. Trump's ideology is not an impeachable offense. However much you may disagree with Trump's tax policy -- and I disagree vehemently -- it is not a reason to remove him from office. Nor are his efforts to cut government health insurance or to deport undocumented immigrants. Such issues, among others, are legitimate matters of democratic struggle, to be decided by elections, legislative debates, protests and the other normal tools of democracy. These issues are not the ""treason, bribery or other high crimes and misdemeanors"" that the founders intended impeachment to address.

Yet the founders also did not intend for the removal of a president to be impossible. They insisted on including an impeachment clause in the Constitution because they understood that an incompetent or corrupt person was nonetheless likely to attain high office every so often. And they understood how much harm such a person could do. The country needed a way to address what Alexander Hamilton called ""the abuse or violation of some public trust"" and James Madison called the ""incapacity, negligence or perfidy"" of a president.

The negligence and perfidy of President Trump -- his high crimes and misdemeanors -- can be separated into four categories. This list is conservative. It does not include the possibility that his campaign coordinated strategy with Russia, which remains uncertain. It also does not include his lazy approach to the job, like his refusal to read briefing books or the many empty hours on his schedule. It instead focuses on demonstrable ways that he has broken the law or violated his constitutional oath.

Trump has used the presidency for personal enrichment.

Regardless of party, Trump's predecessors took elaborate steps to separate their personal financial interests from their governing responsibilities. They released their tax returns, so that any potential conflicts would be public. They placed their assets in a blind trust, to avoid knowing how their policies might affect their own investments.

Trump has instead treated the presidency as a branding opportunity. He has continued to own and promote the Trump Organization. He has spent more than 200 days at one of his properties and billed taxpayers for hundreds of thousands of dollars.

If this pattern were merely petty corruption, without damage to the national interest, it might not warrant removal from office. But Trump's focus on personal profit certainly appears to be affecting policy. Most worrisome, foreign officials and others have realized they can curry favor with the president by spending money at one of his properties.

Saudi Arabia has showered the Trump Organization with business, and Trump has stood by the Saudis despite their brutal war in Yemen and their assassination of a prominent critic. A Chinese government-owned company reportedly gave a $500 million loan to a Trump-backed project in Indonesia; two days later, Trump announced that he was lifting sanctions on another well-connected Chinese company.

These examples, and many more, flout Article 1 of the Constitution, which bans federal officeholders from accepting ""emoluments"" from any foreign country unless Congress approves the arrangement. Madison, when making the case for an impeachment clause, spoke of a president who ""might betray his trust to foreign powers.""

Then, of course, there is Russia. Even before Robert Mueller, the special counsel, completes his investigation, the known facts are damning enough in at least one way. Trump lied to the American people during the 2016 campaign about business negotiations between his company and Vladimir Putin's government. As president, Trump has taken steps -- in Europe and Syria -- that benefit Putin. To put it succinctly: The president of the United States lied to the country about his commercial relationship with a hostile foreign government toward which he has a strangely accommodating policy.

Combine Trump's actions with his tolerance for unethical cabinet officials -- including ones who have made shady stock trades, accepted lavish perks or used government to promote their own companies or those of their friends -- and the Trump administration is almost certainly the most corrupt in American history. It makes Warren G. Harding's Teapot Dome scandal look like, well, a tempest in a teapot.

Trump has violated campaign finance law.

A Watergate grand jury famously described Richard Nixon as ""an unindicted co-conspirator."" Trump now has his own indictment tag: ""Individual-1.""

Federal prosecutors in New York filed papers last month alleging that Trump -- identified as Individual-1 -- directed a criminal plan to evade campaign finance laws. It happened during the final weeks of the 2016 campaign, when he instructed his lawyer, Michael Cohen, to pay a combined $280,000 in hush money to two women with whom Trump evidently had affairs. Trump and his campaign did not disclose these payments, as required by law. In the two years since, Trump has lied publicly about them -- initially saying he did not know about the payments, only to change his story later.

It's worth acknowledging that most campaign finance violations do not warrant removal from office. But these payments were not most campaign finance violations. They involved large, secret payoffs in the final weeks of a presidential campaign that, prosecutors said, ""deceived the voting public."" The seriousness of the deception is presumably the reason that the prosecutors filed criminal charges against Cohen, rather than the more common penalty of civil fines for campaign finance violations.

What should happen to a president who won office with help from criminal behavior? The founders specifically considered this possibility during their debates at the Constitutional Convention. The most direct answer came from George Mason: A president who ""practiced corruption and by that means procured his appointment in the first instance"" should be subject to impeachment.

Trump has obstructed justice.

Whatever Mueller ultimately reveals about the relationship between the Trump campaign and Russia, Trump has obstructed justice to keep Mueller -- and others -- from getting to the truth.

Again and again, Trump has interfered with the investigation in ways that may violate the law and clearly do violate decades-old standards of presidential conduct. He pressured James Comey, then the F.B.I. director, to let up on the Russia investigation, as a political favor. When Comey refused, Trump fired him. Trump also repeatedly pressured Jeff Sessions, the attorney general, to halt the investigation and ultimately forced Sessions to resign for not doing so. Trump has also publicly hounded several of the government's top experts on Russian organized crime, including Andrew McCabe and Bruce Ohr.

And Trump has repeatedly lied to the American people. He has claimed, outrageously, that the Justice Department tells witnesses to lie in exchange for leniency. He has rejected, with no factual basis, the findings of multiple intelligence agencies about Russia's role in the 2016 campaign. He reportedly helped his son Donald Trump Jr. draft a false statement about a 2016 meeting with a Russian lawyer.

Obstruction of justice is certainly grounds for the removal of a president. It was the subject of the first Nixon article of impeachment passed by the House Judiciary Committee. Among other things, that article accused him of making ""false or misleading public statements for the purpose of deceiving the people of the United States.""

Trump has subverted democracy.

The Constitution that Trump swore to uphold revolves around checks and balances. It depends on the idea that the president is not a monarch. He is a citizen to whom, like all other citizens, the country's laws apply. Trump rejects this principle. He has instead tried to undermine the credibility of any independent source of power or information that does not serve his interests.

It's much more than just the Russia investigation. He has tried to delegitimize federal judges based on their ethnicity or on the president who appointed them, drawing a rare rebuke from Chief Justice John Roberts. Trump has criticized the Justice Department for indicting Republican politicians during an election year. He has called for Comey, Hillary Clinton and other political opponents of his to be jailed.

Trump has described journalists as ""the enemy of the people"" -- an insult usually leveled by autocrats. He has rejected basic factual findings from the C.I.A., the Congressional Budget Office, research scientists and others. He has told bald lies about election fraud.

Individually, these sins may not seem to deserve removal from office. Collectively, though, they exact a terrible toll on American society. They cause people to lose the faith on which a democracy depends -- faith in elections, in the justice system, in the basic notion of truth.

No other president since Nixon has engaged in behavior remotely like Trump's. To accept it without sanction is ultimately to endorse it. Unpleasant though it is to remove a president, the costs and the risks of a continued Trump presidency are worse.

What now?

The most relevant precedent for the removal of Trump is Nixon, the only American president to be forced from office because of his conduct. And two aspects of Nixon's departure tend to get overlooked today. One, he was never impeached. Two, most Republicans -- both voters and elites -- stuck by him until almost the very end. His approval rating among Republicans was still about 50 percent when, realizing in the summer of 1974 that he was doomed, he resigned.

The current political dynamics have some similarities. Whether the House of Representatives, under Democratic control, impeaches Trump is not the big question. The question is whether he loses the support of a meaningful slice of Republicans.

I know that many of Trump's critics have given up hoping that he ever will. They assume that Republican senators will go on occasionally criticizing him without confronting him. But it is a mistake to give up. The stakes are too large -- and the chances of success are too real.

Consider the following descriptions of Trump: ""terribly unfit;"" ""erratic;"" ""reckless;"" ""impetuous;"" ""unstable;"" ""a pathological liar;"" ""dangerous to a democracy;"" a concern to ""anyone who cares about our nation."" Every one of these descriptions comes from a Republican member of Congress or of Trump's own administration.

They know. They know he is unfit for office. They do not need to be persuaded of the truth. They need to be persuaded to act on it.

Democrats won't persuade them by impeaching Trump. Doing so would probably rally the president's supporters. It would shift the focus from Trump's behavior toward a group of Democratic leaders whom Republicans are never going to like. A smarter approach is a series of sober-minded hearings to highlight Trump's misconduct. Democrats should focus on easily understandable issues most likely to bother Trump's supporters, like corruption.

If this approach works at all -- or if Mueller's findings shift opinion, or if a separate problem arises, like the economy -- Trump's Republican allies will find themselves in a very difficult spot. At his current approval rating of about 40 percent, Republicans were thumped in the midterms. Were his rating to fall further, a significant number of congressional Republicans would be facing long re-election odds in 2020.

Two examples are Cory Gardner of Colorado and Susan Collins of Maine, senators who, not coincidentally, have shown tentative signs of breaking with Trump on the government shutdown. The recent criticism from Mitt Romney -- who alternates between critical and sycophantic, depending on his own political interests -- is another sign of Trump's weakness.

For now, most Republicans worry that a full break with Trump will cause them to lose a primary, and it might. But sticking by him is no free lunch. Just ask the 27 Republican incumbents who were defeated last year and are now former members of Congress. By wide margins, suburban voters and younger voters find Trump abhorrent. The Republican Party needs to hold its own among these voters, starting in 2020.

It's not only that Trump is unfit to be president and that Republicans know it. It also may be the case that they will soon have a political self-interest in abandoning him. If they did, the end could come swiftly. The House could then impeach Trump, knowing the Senate might act to convict. Or negotiations could begin over whether Trump deserves to trade resignation for some version of immunity.

Finally, there is the hope -- naïve though it may seem -- that some Republicans will choose to act on principle. There now exists a small club of former Trump administration officials who were widely respected before joining the administration and whom Trump has sullied, to greater or lesser degrees. It includes Rex Tillerson, Gary Cohn, H.R. McMaster and Jim Mattis. Imagine if one of them gave a television interview and told the truth about Trump. Doing so would be a service to their country at a time of national need. It would be an illustration of duty.

Throughout his career, Trump has worked hard to invent his own reality, and largely succeeded. It has made him very rich and, against all odds, elected him president. But whatever happens in 2019, his false version of reality will not survive history, just as Nixon's did not. Which side of that history do today's Republicans want to be on?

38,the new york times,"I will be going on book leave soon -- today is my last column for a while because of the holiday schedule -- to write what I believe to be the most important thing that I've ever written.

No, it's not about Donald Trump, just in case you were wondering.

But since I have written almost exclusively about Trump for more than two years, please allow me this parting assessment: It is so much worse than I thought.

My original objections to Trump, the things that pushed me into the Resistance, were his immorality, dishonesty, fraudulence and grift.

I freely admit now that I was seeing only the pointy edge of an enormous machine. I had no idea how immoral Trump actually is.

The same month that Trump pulled the outrageous stunt of inviting women who had accused Bill Clinton of inappropriate sexual behavior to his debate with Hillary Clinton, his personal lawyer, Michael Cohen, apparently under his instructions, facilitated a $130,000 payment to the porn star Stormy Daniels to prevent her from telling America that she had a sexual encounter with Trump, who was married with a small child. This payment was a few months after Cohen had helped arrange a $150,000 deal between American Media Inc., the parent company of The National Enquirer, to buy the story of the Playboy model Karen McDougal, who also claimed a sexual relationship with Trump.

According to prosecutors, both were campaign finance violations -- federal crimes -- and now a judge has sentenced Cohen to three years in prison for that and other crimes.

The fact that Trump would be directly implicated in a federal crime that took place on the verge of the election and may have helped hand that election to him is mind-blowing to me.

Trump, for his part, lied about these payments and denied them -- while also having those around him lie about them on his behalf -- until he could simply no longer lie about them anymore. Then came the roulette wheel of revolving explanations that makes one dizzy because of their silliness.

Just this week, the Trump Foundation agreed to dissolve under pressure from the New York attorney general, who found that the foundation functioned ""as little more than a checkbook to serve Mr. Trump's business and political interests"" and engaged in ""a shocking pattern of illegality,"" including coordinating with Trump's presidential campaign.

How can a family that can't run a charity run a country?

But of course, that is not all. Nearly every aspect of Trump's life is now under investigation for wrongdoing, something I could not have foreseen.

I could not have predicted the extraordinary lengths to which the president would go to obstruct justice and undermine the rule of law, nor that he would do these things in full view, for everyone to see.

I could not have predicted, when I first wrote that Trump was a pathological liar, that his rate of lying would increase with his time in office, rather than decrease. As The Washington Post Fact Checker put it in September:

""Trump's tsunami of untruths helped push the count in The Fact Checker's database past 5,000 on the 601st day of his presidency. That's an average of 8.3 Trumpian claims a day, but in the past nine days -- since our last update -- the president has averaged 32 claims a day. When we first started this project for the president's first 100 days, he averaged 4.9 claims a day. He passed the 2,000 mark on Jan. 10 -- eight months ago.""

Just this month, the newspaper's Fact Checker was forced to create a new category of lying just for the Trump era: the ""Bottomless Pinocchio"" for ""when a politician refuses to drop a claim that has been fact checked as three or four Pinocchios, keeps saying it over and over and over again, so that it basically becomes disinformation, propaganda.""

I could not have predicted the overwhelming number of contacts that would have existed between people in Trump's orbit and the Russians during the campaign, or the number of people who would take plea deals and ultimately be charged, indicted or convicted of lying about those contacts.

I couldn't have predicted any of it, but here we are, and the president, his congressional backers and his citizen supporters are continuing to tell us that this doesn't matter as much as we think, that this is a politically driven prosecution, that everyone does what Trump has done.

They are all wrong. This is huge, and the longer we pretend that it isn't, the more damage we do to the health and stability of our own country.

While I am away, I will enjoy not having to follow the hourly insanities too closely, but every day I will worry about the republic in which we live. Trump has the capacity to damage or even destroy it. That's not hyperbole. That's an observation informed by a close reading of history.

39,the new york times,"WASHINGTON -- The Chinese government has detained a third Canadian citizen, escalating a diplomatic crisis in which it is pushing the United States to relent on legal pressure against one of China's leading technology companies.

Canadian consular officials are providing assistance to the family of the latest detainee, a spokesman for Global Affairs Canada, the country's Foreign Ministry, said on Wednesday. The spokesman declined to identify the detainee or provide more details.

A Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman said at a regularly scheduled news conference in Beijing on Wednesday that the ministry had no information on the case.

Chinese security agencies detained two other Canadians, Michael Kovrig and Michael Spavor, on Dec. 10. Chinese officials have suggested in public comments that the agencies are looking into potential national security charges.

But by all appearances, the detentions appear to be retaliation for Canada's arrest of Meng Wanzhou, chief financial officer of Huawei, the giant Chinese technology company, on Dec. 1, as Ms. Meng was in transit in Vancouver between Hong Kong and Mexico.

Ms. Meng, who is also the daughter of Huawei's founder, was arrested at the behest of the United States. At her bail hearing, a Canadian official said Ms. Meng had been accused by the Americans of tricking banks into transactions involving Huawei-controlled entities that violated United States sanctions against Iran.

Ms. Meng is out on bail now. A court is expected to rule whether Canada will extradite her to the United States.

The Chinese government has said Ms. Meng is being wrongfully held and should be released immediately, and has accused the United States of pursuing Ms. Meng for political purposes.

The Canadian government has not publicly drawn any links between the detentions of the Canadians and the arrest of Ms. Meng.

But on Dec. 13, the Chinese ambassador to Canada, Lu Shaye, explicitly tied the actions when he wrote in an op-ed in the Globe and Mail: ""Those who accuse China of detaining some person in retaliation for the arrest of Ms. Meng should first reflect on the actions of the Canadian side. It is both ignominious and hypocritical to revile China with double standards.""

Mr. Kovrig is a China researcher for the International Crisis Group, a conflict and foreign policy research organization. He was living in Hong Kong and had a visa to enter mainland China.

He was on leave from Global Affairs Canada, where he had done postings abroad as a diplomat, including in China.

Mr. Kovrig was visiting Beijing when he was detained by the Ministry of State Security, the main Chinese spy agency, which also does counterintelligence, said the crisis group.

Rob Malley, president and chief executive of the group, said Mr. Kovrig had been open with Chinese officials about his work, all of which can be read online.

""Michael led two successive professional lives in China -- first as a diplomat for Canada and next as a researcher for Crisis Group,"" he said in an interview on Monday.

""His detention means one of two things,"" Mr. Malley said. ""Either he is being charged retroactively for engaging in activities that all diplomats engage in, or for engaging in the open, transparent work that many others routinely engage in. In either case, the message being sent -- to businesspeople, diplomats, academics and others who wish to deal with China -- is chilling.""

The second detainee, Mr. Spavor, is an entrepreneur and writer living near North Korea in northeast China's Liaoning Province.

Mr. Spavor was running a travel business that took people to North Korea, and had helped arrange a trip by Dennis Rodman, the former basketball player, to Pyongyang, where Mr. Rodman met with Kim Jong-un, the young North Korean leader.

Mr. Spavor has also met with Mr. Kim and had posted a photograph of the two online.

American officials have been looking into Huawei for years, and more recently national security officials from the United States have been pressing other countries not to use Huawei technology for next-generation wireless networks, saying it poses a potential security threat.

Administration officials say the sanctions case against Huawei being brought by the Justice Department is separate from other security concerns.

President Trump complicated the Justice Department case against Ms. Meng and Huawei on Dec. 11 when he overtly politicized it by saying he might intervene in the case if he thought China would settle a monthslong trade war with the United States.

""If I think it's good for the country, if I think it's good for what will be certainly the largest trade deal ever made -- which is a very important thing -- what's good for national security -- I would certainly intervene if I thought it was necessary,"" Mr. Trump told Reuters in an interview in the Oval Office.

That statement handed Ms. Meng's lawyer an argument against her extradition.

The Canadian foreign minister, Chrystia Freeland, has said repeatedly that Canada arrested Mr. Meng because of its extradition agreement with the United States, and that a Canadian court will decide whether to extradite her based solely on legal rationale.

""It is also very important for Canada that extradition agreements are not used for political purposes,"" Ms. Freeland said at a news conference last Friday in Washington. ""In Canada, there has been, to this point, no political interference in this issue at all.""

Mike Pompeo, the secretary of state, said at the same news conference that the United States had raised the cases of the Canadian detainees with China and asked for their release.

Chinese security agencies have long engaged in the arbitrary detentions of foreign citizens, and in January, the United States issued a travel warning.

Donald Clarke, a professor at George Washington University who studies Chinese law, wrote this week that China had taken the Canadians as hostages, in hopes Canada would exchange Ms. Meng for them.

""You cannot just go around arresting innocent people and holding them hostage,"" Mr. Clarke wrote in a Washington Post op-ed. ""That is the mark of a thuggish state, not a permanent member of the Security Council. If detaining two Canadians is an acceptable response, how about 20 or 200?""",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/19/us/politics/china-canada-huawei.html
40,the new york times,"BEIJING -- China acknowledged on Thursday that the authorities there had detained a third Canadian citizen, a teacher from Alberta, making her the most recent casualty in a diplomatic standoff between the two countries.

The Foreign Ministry said that ""a female Canadian citizen"" identified as Sarah D. McIver had been working illegally and was being held in administrative detention. The Canadian government announced the detention on Wednesday but did not release Ms. McIver's name.

Ms. McIver's detention came days after the arrests of Michael Kovrig, a former Canadian diplomat who was working for a nongovernmental organization in China, and Michael Spavor, an entrepreneur specializing in business with North Korea.

The three detentions appear to be in retaliation for Canada's arrest of Meng Wanzhou, the chief financial officer of Huawei, the giant Chinese technology company. Ms. Meng was detained on Dec. 1 while in transit in Vancouver, on her way from Hong Kong to Mexico.

Ms. Meng was arrested at the request of the United States. The Trump administration is seeking her extradition.

At her bail hearing, a Canadian official said Ms. Meng had been accused by the Americans of tricking banks into transactions involving Huawei-controlled entities that violated United States sanctions against Iran.

Ms. Meng is out on bail. A court is expected to rule on whether she will be extradited to the United States.

Ms. Meng's case has provoked a diplomatic crisis between China and Canada. The Chinese government insists Ms. Meng is being wrongfully held and should be released immediately.

The three detentions by the Chinese government are being seen as ratcheting up the pressure on Canada to release Ms. Meng. China also appears to be trying to tell Washington that it should not demand the extradition of Ms. Meng from Canada to the United States.

A Canadian newspaper, The National Post, reported that Ms. McIver had been teaching at a school in China.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/20/world/asia/china-canadian-detained.html
41,the new york times,"Readers responding to an Op-Ed article by John Kerry offer additional suggestions.

To the Editor:

Re ""Forget Trump. Act on the Climate,"" by John Kerry (Op-Ed, Dec. 14):

As Mr. Kerry correctly states, ""Scientists tell us we must act now to avoid the ravages of climate change,"" and he recommends investments in ""clean technologies"" and in ""low-carbon infrastructure.""

In fact, the only reliable and globally effective solution that can win the broad political support required is revenue-neutral carbon fee and dividend legislation. A bipartisan group of representatives has just introduced such a bill: the Energy Innovation and Carbon Dividend Act, which aims to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 by an amount greater than President Barack Obama's Clean Power Plan or the United States' commitment under the Paris climate agreement calls for.

It would do so by collecting a carbon fee from producers, importers and sellers of fuels that emit greenhouse gases and rebating much of the proceeds to all United States citizens and other lawful residents. This would help to lighten the burden of higher fuel prices and should diminish both politically conservative opposition and the kind of grass-roots resistance recently seen in France. It can and must be passed, for the sake of our grandchildren.

The writer is a former Environmental Protection Agency lawyer.

To the Editor:

In his analysis, John Kerry leaves out the private citizen. There are plenty of things we individuals can do, even if the muckety-mucks that Mr. Kerry enjoins fail to act. Here are just a few of them:

Get rid of all the plastic things you own and do not buy new things made of plastic.

Get rid of your car; consider getting an electric bike instead. Refuse to work at a job you have to drive to. Walk. Stop flying.

If you own your home, retrofit it for energy efficiency; install some solar panels or join a solar collective. Instead of turning up the heat, put on a sweater if you're cold. Throw out your air-conditioner, or at the very least use it only when your health or life depends on it.

Be a locavore.

To the Editor:

John Kerry's urgings to take action to mitigate the ravages of climate change are on the right track, but Mr. Kerry does not raise an even more fundamental issue that humanity must grapple with: Even with a total elimination of coal power and the maximum use of wind, solar and other renewables, planet Earth simply cannot, over the long term, sustain its current population level, let alone an increase of several billion more souls, with minimal ingredients for a decent life for everyone.

Climate change and mass migrations are but two symptoms of the imbalance between earth's resources and its population that will only worsen if we do not recognize this. If humanity can come to grips with this simple reality and humanely start reducing its rate of fertility, we just may survive.

42,the new york times,"As far as incursions into combat go, President Trump's brief trip to Iraq last week is not likely to make any future leadership manuals. ""What we had to go through, with the darkened plane, with all windows closed,"" he said of his descent in a dimmed Air Force One to an airstrip at Al Asad Air Base. ""I've never seen anything like it.""

That's actually pretty vanilla as these things go, a far cry from corkscrewing into Baghdad International to evade surface-to-air missiles, let alone crossing the Alps on a war elephant. But, after two years as commander in chief and a steady stream of complaints for not having done so, Mr. Trump did visit American troops stationed in a war zone.

It didn't take long for many of the same people who criticized him for never making that presidential pilgrimage to express disdain for how he did it. His Iraq trip came in the wake of his announcement of a troop withdrawal from Syria, and coincided with a report in The New York Times on how his deferment for bone spurs during the Vietnam War might have come about. Cable news packed itself full with retired generals, foreign policy experts and seasoned journalists who've been to the proving grounds of war and found the president in contempt.

The visit was likened to a campaign rally. ""Cadet Bone Spurs"" trended on Twitter. Thinkers ranging from Noam Chomsky to Bill Kristol made cases for remaining in Syria in some capacity. Even on Fox News, the morning host Brian Kilmeade said, ""Nobody thinks ISIS is defeated,"" pushing back against Mr. Trump's initial argument for withdrawal from Syria.

It's true that the president brought a lot of this criticism upon himself. But there's also something perverse about the fierce blowback he received. I've found myself wondering if he's facing this tempest for another reason -- because he dared suggest scaling back the reach of the American military-industrial complex.

Mr. Trump has a strange relationship with the military. He loves the parades, the star-spangled pomp and surrounding himself with generals' stars. Until the generals speak, at least. For a prime example of this, see the letter of resignation from Secretary of Defense Jim Mattis -- and the way it sped up his departure.

The Iraq trip was a prime example of the superficiality of how this president sees the military. The seemingly staged images of Mr. Trump with kitted-up special operators in the Asad chow hall are both exploitative and goofy. And it seemed a bit convenient that so many ""Make America Great Again"" red hats happened to be at an air base in the middle of desolate Anbar Province.

Mr. Trump tends to recoil from the messy particulars, like understanding Purple Hearts aren't something to congratulate soldiers for, or reading through complex foreign policy briefings. He channels a vague sense of gratitude for service members -- one that neatly mirrors the vague gratitude of many Americans.

This president embodies our republic's earnest yet shallow understanding of military service, all the while acting as a reminder of the limited mass appeal of service itself. Less than one percent of Americans wear the uniform these days. Bone spurs? In 2018, who actually cares, beyond those who had to go to Vietnam in the stead of kids like Donald Trump?

Our country has had ample opportunity to elect a Vietnam veteran as president. It has chosen not to, time and time again. It's not a coincidence our three boomer presidents (Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, Mr. Trump) all managed to avoid service in Vietnam. Nor is it coincidence that veterans like John McCain and John Kerry had their service records used against them on the presidential campaign trail. Even Al Gore, who spent a few months in Vietnam as an Army newspaper reporter, got closer to battle than the man who defeated him, Mr. Bush, who spent his service time stateside on Air National Guard bases.

In so many ways, Mr. Trump is not a cause of diminishing respect for the military, but a symptom of it. So it is with 21st-century America and war. ""Thank you for your service,"" but spare the details, please.

Last month, I attended a retirement ceremony at Fort Knox, Ky., for the platoon sergeant I served with in Iraq. A photograph of Mr. Trump glowering greets people at the visitors' center there, next to the stern, cool-eyed image of (the soon departing) Secretary Mattis.

We celebrated that evening with my friend's family over dinner and drinks, and talk gradually turned to the world. I asked my friend what changes he'd noticed over his 20-plus years of military service -- how different presidents have shaped his career, his multiple combat deployments.

""It's been the same for us for a long time,"" he said. ""Republicans in charge, Democrats in charge -- hasn't really mattered much, to be honest.""

A few years ago, the author and Vietnam veteran Karl Marlantes told me in an interview, ""We're not behaving like a republic,"" and his words return to me a lot when I read war news. Something is broken in our system if the machineries of war endure all strategies and policy changes, if only for the sake of enduring. There are legitimate reasons, both related to national security and humanitarian interests, to remain in Syria, as one example -- our Kurdish allies pre-eminent among them.

But when questions like ""How long?"" and ""How many?"" and ""What's the objective?"" get swallowed up by a defense industry that essentially answers with, ""We'll handle it,"" it's no wonder that the American citizenry doesn't engage with its military much beyond surprise homecomings at football games.

It's also no wonder that nearly half of Americans believe the war in Afghanistan has ""mostly failed,"" according to a recent Pew poll, despite Secretary Mattis and others continually making the case that staying there will help prevent another Sept. 11. It's no wonder the American citizenry elected a president with an isolationist bent who reflexively distrusts elites and experts. And in Mr. Trump's defense -- not a line I thought I'd ever write -- it's many of those same elites and experts who got us mired in a war that now costs us $45 billion a year to begin with.

Should we remain in Afghanistan? Should we stay in Syria and Iraq? Both as a combat veteran and a citizen who tries to stay informed of his nation's foreign policy, I can honestly answer only: I don't know. I'm not privy to top-secret briefings, nor do I earn a living by making grand predictions on matters of war and peace.

I do know this, though: The way forward should involve more transparency, not less. Then citizens will be better able to hold our elected officials accountable for the decisions they have our military leaders execute. As it stands now, Americans seem to care so little or are so convinced of the necessity of permanent war that our military is still fighting overseas based on congressional authorization from 2001. That's not good enough, not even close.

The American public has been conditioned to believe that foreign war is necessary, even vital, to maintaining our way of life. Forcing those in power to explain why -- beyond easy, histrionic references to Sept. 11 -- would go a long way toward moving beyond this forever war. In the meantime, our commander in chief continues to be both baffled by and obsessed with our men and women in uniform. It's crass. It's clownish. It's unbecoming. In 2018, it's also unquestionably American.

43,the new york times,"Good Friday morning. Here are some of the stories making news in Washington and politics today.

_____________________

* Ebullient Democrats assumed control of the House and elected Nancy Pelosi as speaker. The only woman to hold the post, she reclaimed the gavel she lost in 2011. To win it back, the California representative had to put down a rebellion in her caucus -- but there were still dissenters in her ranks.

* The new Democratic majority passed two bills to reopen the government, without funding for President Trumps's border wall. They are likely to go nowhere for now but will raise pressure on Republicans to negotiate.

* President Trump has talked about the need for ""protection"" along the southern border. But what he hasn't talked about publicly during the partial government shutdown are the 800,000 federal workers who are not being paid. Those workers are coming up on a full pay cycle off the job, and many are trying to decide which bills to pay.

* Senator Mitch McConnell, the Republican leader, had removed himself from talks to reopen the government, part of a strategy to protect vulnerable Republicans running for re-election in 2020. But his senators have started to break rank.

* As the House of Representatives convenes, the seat in North Carolina's Ninth District is still empty. Mark Harris, a Republican who had looked like the winner in November, finds himself in limbo, with his election under investigation.

* The American citizen detained in Russia on espionage charges, Paul Whelan, is being held in solitary confinement in the notorious Lefortovo Prison in Moscow. He could face a sentence of as much as 20 years.

* A former employee of the Trump resort in Bedminster, N.J., said her name was removed from a list being vetted by the Secret Service after she reminded management that she was undocumented.

* Mexico's Foreign Ministry has asked for an investigation into two episodes at the border near San Diego in which American officers used tear gas to repel migrants.

* Secretary of State Mike Pompeo warned Iran against launching three spacecraft in the coming months, arguing that they were a cover for testing missile technology.

* The Trump administration is considering Jim Webb, a former Democratic senator and Reagan-era secretary of the Navy, to be the next defense secretary. Mr. Webb's views align with the president's drive to pull troops from the Middle East and confront China more aggressively.

* Gov. Jerry Brown of California is entering his final days in public life -- and is out to make the most of them.

44,the new york times,"Good morning,

We start with the U.S. withdrawal from Syria, what rising interest rates mean for you, and the Senate vote to avert a government shutdown.

President Trump orders a full withdrawal from Syria

In announcing the return of 2,000 American troops, the president brought a sudden end to the U.S. military campaign in Syria, declaring that it had ""defeated ISIS"" there.

The decision, announced on Wednesday over the objections of Mr. Trump's military and civilian advisers, fulfills the president's frequently expressed desire to bring troops home. But it also cedes control of Syria to Russia and Iran, and it abandons America's Kurdish allies.

News analysis: Mr. Trump doesn't believe that U.S. forces can alter the strategic balance in the Middle East, a view shared by his immediate predecessor, Barack Obama, our national security correspondent writes.

From Opinion: ""The Islamic State has not been 'defeated' -- and our mission in Syria has not been fully accomplished,"" two counterterrorism officials in the Trump and Obama administrations write.

Congress moves to avert a shutdown

Senators approved a spending bill Wednesday night that would keep the government funded through Feb. 8 and leave the question of funding President Trump's southern border wall for the new year.

The bill is expected to pass the House today and to be sent to Mr. Trump before the deadline of midnight Friday. It was unclear, however, if the president would sign the measure, which doesn't include the $5 billion he has demanded for a wall.

If you missed it: In a farewell speech to Congress on Wednesday, Speaker Paul Ryan said that politics in America is ""broken."" A former rising star in the Republican Party, Mr. Ryan oversaw the enactment of a tax overhaul that many welcomed but that has also contributed to a growing federal deficit.

Fed raises interest rates, saying the economy is healthy

The Federal Reserve raised its benchmark interest rate for the fifth consecutive quarter on Wednesday, as expected, emphasizing continued economic growth.

The benchmark rate will now sit in a range of 2.25 percent to 2.5 percent, near the lower end of what the central bank considers the neutral zone, in which rates neither stimulate nor restrain the economy.

President Trump has repeatedly urged the central bank to keep rates low.

Watch: The Fed's chairman, Jerome Powell, said political considerations played ""no role"" in the decision.

For you: Rising interest rates affect both savers and spenders.

A list of accused priests omitted names, Illinois says

The Roman Catholic Church in the state withheld the names of at least 500 priests who were accused of the sexual abuse of minors, Illinois' attorney general said on Wednesday in a report that also accused the church of neglecting to investigate victims' allegations.

The report by Attorney General Lisa Madigan said 690 priests had been accused of abuse, but only 185 names were made public.

Why it matters: The report is the latest effort by state prosecutors to hold the Catholic Church accountable. At least 16 states have opened investigations since August, after a grand jury report in Pennsylvania accused more than 300 priests of sexual abuse over 50 years.

Yesterday: Pope Francis accepted the resignation of an auxiliary bishop of Los Angeles accused of sexual misconduct with a minor.

If you have 9 minutes, this is worth itAll white

Dr. W. Melvin Brown III is a native of Charleston, S.C., a military veteran who served two tours in Afghanistan, an emergency-room doctor and a family man.

But the African-American couldn't break the barrier of a social club founded a few years before the Civil War. His white friends are furious.

Here's what else is happening

Facebook criticism: Lawmakers in the U.S. and Britain called for greater oversight of the company after a Times report about undisclosed data-sharing. Here are five ways Facebook shared users' data.

Imitating Russian election tricks: A group of Democratic tech experts tested tactics in Alabama's fiercely contested Senate race last December similar to those used nationally by Russia, according to people familiar with the effort and a report on its results.

China detains another Canadian: The Chinese government is holding a third Canadian citizen, apparently in retaliation for the arrest of a technology executive.

Relief for Russian oligarch: The Trump administration plans to lift sanctions against the business empire of Oleg Deripaska, one of Russia's most influential businessmen, after lobbying by his companies.

American demographics: U.S. population growth is at its lowest level since 1937, up 0.62 percent from July 2017 to July 2018, the Census Bureau said.

London airport suspends flights: Gatwick Airport, Britain's second busiest, is at a standstill today after drone sightings at its airfield.

Marijuana in New York: Mayor Bill de Blasio endorsed legalization of the drug for the first time -- with a few caveats -- three days after Gov. Andrew Cuomo added the issue to his agenda for next year.

And now for the Back Story on ...When Christmas went electric

Clare Macdonald, a reader from Keene, N.H., asked us when electric lights were first used on a Christmas tree.

It was in 1882, just three years after Thomas Edison filed a patent for his light bulb. The tree became a fixture in the experiment-filled home of an executive at his company.

Eighty walnut-size red, white and blue bulbs covered the tree, which sat on a revolving box. A newspaper article described it: ""As the tree turned, the colors alternated, all the lamps going out and being relit at every revolution. The result was a continuous twinkling of dancing colors, red, white, blue, white, red, blue, all evening.""

President Grover Cleveland popularized electric Christmas lights in the 1890s by installing them on the White House tree.

But it wasn't until (relatively) inexpensive strings of Christmas lights became available a few years later that the tradition really caught on.

That's it for Thursday's briefing. If, like Clare, you have an idea for a Back Story, email us. We prefer light(ish) subjects that can be described succinctly.

See you next time.

45,the new york times,"Re: Trump's Inquisitors

Jason Zengerle wrote about three Democratic representatives who will soon have the power to investigate the Trump White House.

Out here in Ohio, there is relief and even some hope that now Donald Trump, his family, his campaign and his administration can begin to be held accountable for their words and actions in the last two years. Congressional Republicans have given Trump and company free rein in running the government. Sadly, we are seeing the results of handing that freedom to the incompetent and corrupt. We also want to see some focus on issues that are essential to our lives -- health care, taxes, wages, the environment. I actually feel 2019 may be a turning point for 60 percent of us to finally see some accountability for Trump and the Republicans. Meg, Troy, Ohio

Do not rest until we have all the facts and everyone responsible for the corruption is in jail. We need Trump's tax returns, correspondence between the campaign and Russian operatives and details about decision-making in the White House, especially as it relates to lobbying by the fossil-fuel industry for reduced environmental protections. We gave Democrats power so they could hold the worst president in history accountable, and we demand that they do so. Casey Penk, New York

Never has an administration been so unprepared to lead and so willing to make money from power. Never has a party been so willing to ignore corruption as the Republicans of 2016 to 2018.

I trust Jerrold Nadler, Adam Schiff and Elijah Cummings to choose wisely. Godspeed, gentlemen. Deirdre, New Jersey

The new House Democrats should go as far as they have to go in order to investigate the activities of this administration and a president who by and large continues to hold himself both unaccountable and above the law. And the main reason he has been able to get away with everything he has done so far is that the checks-and-balances system that normally regulates the overreach of any individual's power has been drastically compromised by the one party now in control of all three branches of government. This is not about a ""witch hunt,"" nor should it be. This is about justice. And it's about time. N. Smith, New York

Re: Denaturalized

Seth Freed Wessler wrote about the push to strip naturalized immigrants of their citizenship.

I am a current law student, and I had the privilege of working with Irina Hughes as an intern on Odette Dureland's case. I remember sitting in federal court and watching Dureland's husband, children and grandchild weep as the judge announced she would be deported. This case is heartbreaking, unacceptable and one of the myriad reasons we need comprehensive immigration reform. Porfírio Gueiros, Gainesville, Fla.

This is an important story. As far as I knew, the only codified restriction on naturalized citizens was that they could not become president. Stripping naturalized citizens of their citizenship furthers the goal of creating two classes of citizens and tells immigrants that they can never truly be Americans. This is exactly what the Republican Party wants at this time. People need certainty in their lives to thrive. The idea that the government could take everything away from a person and family in an instant because of a mistake made decades before, spun as ""fraud,"" is abhorrent to the idea of freedom. Every naturalized citizen -- and those who love them -- have to realize that they could be targeted by a cruel white-nationalist government. And even if the government's case fails, everything is thrown into question while it is pending. That's frightening. The bar for these denaturalization suits should be very high, and the government should have to pay lawyers' fees if it brings a losing case. Max Farthington, Washington

Re: Stuffed Animals

Max Genecov wrote a Letter of Recommendation about stuffed animals.

I have a stuffed bear that replaced the stuffed tiger I slept with growing up. I don't play with him, but I sleep with him and make no apologies for it. Life is hard; bears are soft. Gabrielle Rose, Philadelphia",https://www.nytimes.com/2019/01/04/magazine/readers-respond-to-the-12-23-2018-issue.html
46,the new york times,"On the morning of June 2, 2017, Odette Dureland woke to a loud knock on the door of the one-story bungalow that she shares with her husband and her children. She was recovering from minor surgery, so her 26-year-old daughter, Rebecca, rose to open the door. Outside, there was a group of federal agents from Immigration and Customs Enforcement.

Rebecca was confused: Everyone in her family was a citizen. She told the officers there must be a mistake. They told Rebecca there wasn't; they had a warrant for the arrest of her mother. One officer ordered Odette to dress and then led her out of the house and into a government vehicle.

At that time, Odette, Gilbert and Rebecca had been American citizens for five years. They had lived in the United States for more than two decades, since political violence in their native Haiti forced them to flee in the mid-1990s. Gilbert had joined protests following the first overthrow of the Haitian president Jean-Bertrand Aristide, which made him a target of the new ruling party -- he was beaten and jailed, his right eyeball destroyed. Odette remembers her husband coming home, his face battered. Gilbert fled to the United States. Odette and Rebecca eventually followed, boarding a rickety boat and landing on a Florida beach.

After several years in the United States, Gilbert was granted political asylum, and he filed petitions for Odette and Rebecca. In 2002, the couple applied for green cards. They began working as janitors and had three more children, eventually moving into the bungalow in East Lake, Fla., where they still live. Their youngest child is now in high school, while another is studying elementary education at a nearby college and another is in Air Force training; Rebecca, who has a young baby of her own, works at a nearby call center. ""We can say we are proud of this,"" Gilbert told me.

In 2012, Odette, Gilbert and Rebecca finally applied to become United States citizens, and later that year they took their oaths of allegiance. ""It felt big, like we were really American, even though I've been here for all my life,"" Rebecca says. Odette, too, felt a sense of deep relief after becoming a citizen. ""We came from a country where there was chaos,"" she says. ""When we had the opportunity to become citizens, we thought this was the best thing to do, that it would provide safety."" She had not anticipated how freeing it would feel to engage fully as a citizen, in the country that had become her home. She voted in her first United States election and traveled back to Haiti for the first time in nearly two decades, without worrying that her life in America was at risk.

But then, the knock on the door. The officers were agents from Homeland Security Investigations, a sprawling investigative unit within Immigration and Customs Enforcement. A week earlier, they told Odette, she had been indicted in federal court in Tampa. The Justice Department claimed that in 1997, before her husband filed his asylum claim, Odette applied under a different identity; her fingerprints and photograph were part of the application for Enite Alindor, a last name close to her mother's maiden name. After that application was filed, no one ever again appeared to pursue it. An immigration judge ordered ""Alindor"" deported in absentia.

""They presented me with a name, and they said that this name is my name, and that it matched my fingerprints and that it had been in existence for 21 years,"" Odette says. ""They showed me a paper. They said that I was supposed to be deported, but that they had never found me.""

Dureland was charged criminally by the United States attorney for the Middle District of Florida. Dureland's attorney, a federal public defender named Irina Hughes, eventually presented evidence to the judge that a document preparer Dureland had hired to help before she was granted asylum was convicted criminally several years later for defrauding clients, using their names and identities to file fake tax returns. Hughes suggested that the ""Alindor"" asylum application might have been connected to one of the man's schemes, but the judge would not allow this evidence to be heard by the jury. Hughes also pointed to testimony by government officials who told Congress in the 1990s that immigration records from the time were often handled by private entities, including untrained storefront processors -- so it would have been unsurprising to find a fraudulent application with someone else's prints. There was no way, Hughes argued, that the government could credibly come back decades later and use those haphazard records to prove anything.

The prosecution of naturalized United States citizens like Odette Dureland is a sign, immigrant advocates fear, of a new and gathering storm for immigration policy in the Trump era. For decades, the debate over immigration in the United States has centered on who should be allowed to enter the country and who should be allowed to stay; citizens like Dureland have largely been exempted from that debate. But amid the Trump administration's growing stridency on immigration, that may be changing. ""We have always focused on those who have done something terrible,"" a former Justice Department attorney told me. ""If that's now changing, if we're going after people who did nothing of note, or whose wrong caused no harm, it means they're going after citizenship.""

Dureland's case was filed as part of an Immigration and Customs Enforcement program called Operation Second Look, which grew out of a U.S.C.I.S. program started under the Obama administration called Operation Janus. Both operations seek to identify cases in which people might have been naturalized despite apparent deportation orders or concerns about past fraud or criminal charges. The investigation into Dureland was coordinated with a unit in the Justice Department's civil division called the Office of Immigration Litigation. That office, which devotes most of its resources to defending the federal government on immigration matters in court, is the nerve center for denaturalization actions in the department. From 2004 to 2016, denaturalization cases filed by that office and by United States attorneys have averaged 46 each year. In each of the last two years, prosecutors filed nearly twice that many cases.

That number was already rising toward the end of the Obama administration, but the rhetoric from the Trump administration suggests that the rise under his watch is more than random noise. In July 2017, around the time that Dureland was arrested, the Justice Department began signaling -- quietly at first, through a bulletin from the Office of Immigration Litigation -- that ""civil denaturalization will play a prominent role in securing the integrity of our immigration system."" As the department ""renews its commitment to immigration enforcement,"" the bulletin went on, ""the president has directed all executive departments and agencies 'to employ all lawful means to enforce the immigration laws of the United States.' ""

Last January, the Justice Department announced what it said was the first conviction for denaturalization fraud to come out of Operation Janus, which along with Second Look is looking into 315,000 immigration cases in which concerns had been raised but fingerprints were not uploaded to the government's digital system. Some of those people, the government worried, may have gone on to become citizens using fake identities. By the end of the Obama administration, the Department of Homeland Security planned to refer 120 cases to the Justice Department to face potential federal charges. Now, in announcing the first denaturalization, the Trump administration said in a news release that the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services planned an expansion: The agency sought to refer 1,600 people to the Justice Department to face charges. A month later, U.S.C.I.S., which processes green-card and citizenship applications, changed its statement of purpose, removing a commitment to fulfill ""America's promise as a nation of immigrants"" and promising instead to focus on ""securing the homeland."" Attorney General Jeff Sessions then issued a strategic plan for the Justice Department as a whole, listing denaturalizations among a short tally of ""strategic objectives"" for the next five years.

This summer, it became clear that the Trump administration was ramping up denaturalization efforts. U.S.C.I.S. said it was forming a new office in California, to become fully functional sometime next year, that would replace and consolidate existing Operation Janus work. The agency is actively hiring lawyers to staff the unit. The number of cases that U.S.C.I.S. has flagged as likely targets for denaturalization has risen to 2,500. The agency has referred 167 cases to the Justice Department for civil charges, nine of which have already led to denaturalizations. (ICE would not say how many criminal cases it had referred to United States attorney's offices.) The Department of Homeland Security also asked Congress earlier this year to approve funding to hire 300 new agents for other immigration-fraud investigations, including Operation Second Look. And now ICE says it is sharply expanding the number of files under review. Its deportation division, Enforcement and Removal Operations, is looking into 700,000 additional files to find evidence of fraudulent naturalization, despite U.S.C.I.S.'s saying it considers them very low priority. That brings the total number of files under scrutiny to more than one million.

Trump's U.S.C.I.S. director, L. Francis Cissna, appeared in August on a panel at the Center for Immigration Studies, a right-wing policy group that advocates the restriction of legal immigration. There, he described the agency's denaturalization investigations as ""totally rational and appropriate,"" and warned against concerns that U.S.C.I.S. was attacking citizenship. ""This is about people who lied about having been deported, and then faked that identity, and then came in under Identity No. 2 and became a citizen somehow.""

Since January 2017, United States attorney's offices have filed 107 criminal naturalization fraud cases. Among these cases are a number against people like Odette Dureland, naturalized citizens who purportedly committed fraud but who deny those claims. Many involve people whose histories raise no national-security concerns -- an apparent departure from the Obama administration's priorities. But the number is on par with prosecutions during the Obama era. Where there has been a marked rise in denaturalizations under Trump is in the civil process. Lawyers in the Office of Immigration Litigation filed more than 65 civil denaturalization cases between January 2017 and November 2018, according to data from the Justice Department, twice the total number of civil cases that the office filed in the last two years of the Obama administration. Some of these people would most likely have been denaturalized under any administration, including people who were convicted of serious crimes or were discovered to have participated in war crimes. But the Trump administration's prosecutions have served another purpose: In news releases and declarations by senior officials, the denaturalization cases have been used as cudgels -- tools for attacking the legal immigration process as riddled with fraud, as pathways for criminals and terrorists to enter the United States.

""For decades, the American people have begged and pleaded with their government for a lawful system of immigration that serves the national interest -- a system that has as its foremost priorities their safety, their jobs and their well-being,"" Sessions said in one news release about denaturalization cases against a Somali family in Minnesota whom the State Department had investigated for making false claims in paperwork about their family ties. ""The current immigration system is easily abused by fraudsters and nefarious actors."" He continued, ""If the fraud is not detected and swift enforcement actions are not taken, chain migration only multiplies the consequences of this abuse.""

In another release, the acting head of the Justice Department's civil division said that ""the filing of these cases sends a clear message to immigration fraudsters -- if you break our immigration laws, we will prosecute you and denaturalize you."" This summer, Trump lied on Twitter that the ""Obama Administration granted citizenship, during the terrible Iran Deal negotiation, to 2,500 Iranians -- including to government officials. How big (and bad) is that?""

The administration has cast naturalized citizens as suspects for fraud, and the legal immigration process itself in need of urgent course-correction to prevent that abuse. ""They are trying to manufacture crises to institute draconian policies,"" says Ur Jaddou, who was the chief lawyer at U.S.C.I.S. for almost three years under Obama. ""They did it with families at the border. The worry is they'll do that with this story of naturalization fraud."" Denaturalization court cases require significant dedication of time and labor from federal prosecutors. It's not clear whether the Justice Department has shifted resources to facilitate significantly larger numbers of prosecutions. But Mae Ngai, a Columbia University historian who writes on citizenship and immigration, says that the announcement of a denaturalization surge has already sent a message. She compares the rhetoric about denaturalization to the conservative campaign against voter fraud. Intent on imposing voter restrictions on communities of color, Republican officials, including Trump, have often held up scarce examples of fraudulent voting as evidence that such measures as voter identification laws are necessary -- even as they've been unable to marshal evidence that voter fraud is widespread. ""It's trying to make a crisis out of an issue that is not by any measure a crisis,"" Ngai says, ""an attempt to call the larger systems into question.""

Revoking citizenship has been part of the American citizenship system since the earliest efforts to centralize it. Beginning in 1906, officials in the federal government began to denaturalize immigrants who had obtained citizenship through fraud, often then allowing them to reapply. But as Patrick Weil, a historian and legal scholar at Yale, details in his 2013 book, ""The Sovereign Citizen: Denaturalization and the Origins of the American Republic,"" what began as an administrative cleanup soon became overtly political. Within a few years, denaturalization was being deployed against political subversives, most famously Emma Goldman, the anarchist and Lithuanian immigrant who for years had confounded efforts by federal officials to deport her. Prosecutors discovered that her husband, through whom she had obtained citizenship, was himself naturalized through fraud. In 1909, the government stripped Goldman of her citizenship, and she was eventually expelled. For the next 50 years, the federal government revoked the citizenship of thousands of naturalized and United States-born citizens. Many were targeted for their associations with communists. Others lost their citizenship because they had moved abroad after naturalization or had voted in foreign elections or served in foreign armies. Women were summarily stripped of citizenship for marrying foreign men.

Weil found that between 1906, when naturalization law was standardized and centralized, and the 1970s, 145,000 United States citizens, native born and naturalized, were stripped of their citizenship by the courts. Many others lost their citizenship without any judicial process at all. But a series of court decisions in the 1950s and 1960s curtailed that process. In the most significant of these, in 1967, the Supreme Court in Afroyim v. Rusk ruled in favor of a Polish Jewish immigrant named Beys Afroyim who had become a United States citizen. Afroyim had voted in an Israeli election, which at the time was an offense that could lead to denaturalization. The court ruled against the government: ""Citizenship is no light trifle to be jeopardized any moment Congress decides to do so,"" Justice Hugo Black wrote. Citizenship, acquired either by birth or by naturalization, was now held as a nearly unassailable right, no longer hinging upon adherence to norms imposed by the state.

In the 50 years since then, courts have further tightened the requirements for denaturalization. Mass stripping of citizenship is no longer possible. The government can now denaturalize citizens only if the state can prove they should never have obtained citizenship in the first place, i.e., if it was acquired through some material fraud or misrepresentation. And yet politics has continued to drive rounds of denaturalization prosecutions. After the Republican Party won control of the House in 1994, the new congressional majority began to denounce the Clinton administration, claiming that the Democrats had opened the gates to citizenship for criminals as a way to expand the ranks of Democratic voters. The Justice Department responded by devising a streamlined denaturalization process that would allow Immigration and Naturalization Services, or I.N.S., to administratively strip citizenship from recently naturalized people who had been convicted of crimes -- sidestepping the courts. The agency compiled a list of 369 cases of people with serious past convictions, planning to strip them of their citizenship. Those plans were upended by a lawsuit decided in 2000, when the court ruled that federal officials were required to take denaturalization cases to court. As a smaller number of those cases rolled through the federal courts, the early years of the George W. Bush administration were marked by a spike in civil denaturalization actions, which reached a peak of 50 in 2001.

During the Bush and Obama administrations, a number of citizens were stripped of their citizenship after being implicated in a sprawling immigration-fraud scheme -- they paid bribes to a D.H.S. official to process their immigration applications. A handful of others were denaturalized for being war criminals.

The seeds of the current denaturalization campaign were sown as early as 2008, when a Customs and Border Protection officer discovered 206 cases of people from ""special-interest countries"" like Afghanistan and Iraq, and countries that border them, who appeared to have once been ordered deported, but had gone on to obtain green cards or become citizens. The Department of Homeland Security began looking into those cases, only to discover thousands of other old immigration files that had never been uploaded to digital immigration databases. In September 2016, near the end of the Obama administration, the inspector general for the Department of Homeland Security reported a total of 315,000 previously undigitized sets of fingerprints associated with immigrants whose files raised possible concerns. Just over half of those prints had been uploaded since the problem was discovered in 2008. More than 850 people from special-interest countries, or countries that bordered them, who were apparently ordered out of the country and whose fingerprints were not in the digital system had still gone on to become citizens. Just a few appear to have raised serious concerns, and they were referred to the Justice Department or to Joint Terrorism task forces for further review. Another 953 cases had also been flagged for possible review. The inspector general recommended the government to finish uploading the remaining files, a process that the report said had stalled for lack of funding. It also recommended that ICE determine how to proceed with the remaining files.

Former Obama officials told me that they believed that few of the flagged cases would rise to the level of major priorities for federal agencies. ""We wanted to know who had become a citizen and to see if there was anyone who raised real concerns"" about security, says Ur Jaddou, the former U.S.C.I.S. official. For example, she noted that the inspector general had flagged a handful of cases that involved people who had obtained security clearances or government jobs after naturalizing. By March 2015, with the case-file reviews well underway, Obama's D.H.S. had referred several dozen cases to the offices of the United States attorneys, which in turn decided to prosecute only two. By the time the inspector general's office released its report in September 2016, the Department of Homeland Security had referred a total of 120 cases to the Justice Department to consider for prosecution.

Several former Obama officials told me that the spike in court cases by the Trump administration may be explained by Operation Janus, adding that the numbers for 2017 and 2018 might look similar under a Democratic administration. U.S.C.I.S. also characterizes the growing number of cases under review as the natural expansion of the Janus process. It is an open question how much the number of people charged will grow under the Trump Administration, as the Justice Department prioritizes denaturalization efforts and the scope of the files under review expand.

In my conversations with immigration advocates in recent months, nobody has been more awake to the threat of denaturalization cases than Abdulhakem Alsadah, who spends his days dashing between meetings with members of the Yemeni community near Detroit and working with people already in the court system who need counseling. Alsadah, a social worker, is president of the National Association of Yemeni-Americans, a community organization that operates out of a second-floor office next to a small Yemeni restaurant in Dearborn. Starting in 2013, he began to hear from Yemeni-Americans who had traveled to Yemen that the United States government had confiscated their passports at the embassy in Sana, the country's capital. Alsadah called these passport confiscations ""unofficial denaturalizations."" United States citizens were stuck in Yemen for months; in some cases their passports were never returned, and they were only able to return to their families in Michigan on provisional passports. Other Yemeni-Americans found themselves grounded in the United States, unable to travel. ""They are just stranded,"" Alsadah says. ""They are United States citizens. But they were not treated that way.""

State Department officials in Sana, and then later in the United States, he explains, were telling these suddenly paperless Yemeni-Americans that their passports would not be returned or renewed until they could prove that they were indeed who they said they were. The problem for Yemenis is that documentation to prove identity often doesn't exist in the country, which didn't have a civil department that recorded births and deaths until the mid-1980s. The United States has for years treated this lack of strong documentation as a harbinger of fraud. The U.S.C.I.S. manual issued during the Obama administration notes that because ""civil documents concerning marriage, birth, death, etc., are often issued in Yemen based solely on information furnished by an interested party, often the petitioner or beneficiary of the petition, they are usually not considered conclusive to establish claimed relationships."" (The Trump administration used a lack of strong documentation to justify its travel ban on individuals from five Muslim-majority countries, arguing that the Yemeni government and other banned countries couldn't provide the United States with the information it needs to verify the identity of a potential immigrant.)

In October of this year, the State Department's inspector general released a report that found these Obama-era passport seizures had not followed any discernible process and were not backed by clear rationale. Nonetheless, those passport seizures appear now to have created yet another pool of people -- like those from Janus and Second Look -- who can be targeted with denaturalization. For years, Alsadah was worried about exactly this possibility, and under the Trump administration it has begun.

Alsadah has met several families in Detroit whose passports were revoked under the Obama administration and who have now been threatened with denaturalization, including Abdo Wasel, whom I met this summer through his lawyer. In June 2017, Wasel, who is 53 and lives with his family on a quiet street in Hamtramck, Mich., received a letter from the Justice Department that read, ""The government has evidence that you illegally procured your naturalization."" Based on this evidence, which the letter did not specify, he had not been eligible to become a United States citizen.

Wasel was confused. He left Yemen in 1990, when he was 25, following his father. Wasel settled in Hamtramck, a town near Detroit with a growing Yemeni community, and found work in warehouses and factories. For several years, he traveled back to Yemen whenever he could; he married there, and some of his children were born there. But after he became a United States citizen in 1995, he started bringing his children to Hamtramck, one after another. He and his wife now live in a five-bedroom home, on a street lined with vinyl-sided two-story homes. Wasel's oldest son lives with his own wife and their children in a house on Wasel's block.

Wasel says his troubles began in 2015, after he applied to renew his United States passport to travel to Yemen. The county was becoming increasingly unstable, and he wanted to visit relatives and possibly help them come to the United States. Months passed, and he hadn't received it. He returned to the passport office several times, where he was told the government was looking into his case. During one stop at the office, Wasel says, State Department officers told him they needed him provide a saliva sample so that they could perform a DNA test to verify his identity.

He did not know at the time that the refusal to renew his passport -- and later the United States passports of two of his children -- was part of a broader practice by the Obama administration. For him, the loss meant he could not make any plans to visit the place he was born. Wasel was also unaware that in February 2016, State Department agents showed up at the California home of his father and asked the older man to submit to a DNA test. The results showed that the men were not biologically related.

His father finally told Wasel the truth: He was orphaned as a baby, and he and his wife raised him as their own. Wasel was stunned. He says the story was entirely new to him, and he could only speculate about how the government came to suspect a back story that he had never even imagined. No official has ever explained to him how the investigation came about.

Wasel's is one of at least two denaturalization cases brought by the Trump Department of Justice against Yemeni-Americans whose passports were seized or revoked during the Obama years. Naz Ahmad, a staff lawyer with the Clear project at the City University of New York, which has advocated for Yemeni-Americans with passport issues, was concerned when I told her about Wasel's case. ""We suspect there may have been hundreds of seized passports. How many of those families will now be threatened with denaturalization?""

Of the civil denaturalization cases that have so far been filed by the Office of Immigration Litigation under the Trump Administration, roughly 10 percent have been against people from three countries -- Yemen, Somalia and Iran -- that are included in Trump's ban of Muslim nations. But people from these countries make up just over 1 percent of foreign-born people in the United States. ""They are cherry-picking, picking and choosing, focusing on these communities,"" Alsadah said. If Wasel's citizenship is stripped, the government can cancel the citizenship of his children born in Yemen.

Because Wasel's case is a civil action, there's no threat of prison time. But there's also no access to a public defender and no statute of limitations -- prosecutors can file charges against people like Wasel whose citizenship was obtained decades ago. And the standards for denaturalization are more lax; prosecutors have no burden to prove intent. In a pretrial brief filed in July, prosecutors clarified that the government acknowledges Wasel may well not have known that his father is not biological kin. They say that doesn't matter. ""It is entirely irrelevant when Defendant learned that"" the man ""is not his father and whether he subjectively intended to provide incorrect information,"" the government wrote.

In another recent case, this one drawn from Janus files, the United States attorney for the Middle District of Florida -- the same office that brought the charges against Dureland -- failed to persuade a jury to convict a Bangladeshi-born United States citizen for criminal citizenship fraud. The claims against the man, Shorab Hossain, hinged significantly on a single letter of his first name. In an asylum application filed in 1995, soon after he arrived in the United States, Hossain signed his name as Sohrab. The government denied that petition and he was ordered deported, but Hossain claimed in court that he never received the order. Believing his application had gone nowhere, he later applied again to remain in the United States and signed this time as Shorab, switching the O and H -- two plausible spellings of a name that Hossain, until his arrival in the United States, had written only in Bengali. The jury, apparently unconvinced that he had intentionally sought to alter his identity, acquitted him in April (the jury hung on a separate related charge), and he returned home to his wife and stepdaughter, and to work at the gas station and convenience store he owns. But one month later, the prosecutor told the judge that the Department of Homeland Security was considering a civil case against Hossain -- this time, with no burden to prove intent.

One of the few Trump-era denaturalization cases that has received substantial press attention, that of Norma Borgoño, a 64-year-old secretary and grandmother who was naturalized in 2007, is also facing civil counts, with the same lower burden of proof. The case stems from an ICE investigation that is unrelated to Janus. Four years after becoming a citizen, she pleaded guilty to assisting her boss defraud a bank and cooperated in the investigation. In May 2018 she found herself facing denaturalization, following a probe by Homeland Security Investigations. The Office of Immigration Litigation claimed that Borgoño should have alerted U.S.C.I.S. to her role in the ongoing crime when she applied for citizenship -- even though it's plausible she may not have been aware, at that point, that she was participating in a crime.

""At this point you'd be disrupting an American family,"" Leon Rodriguez, who served as the head of U.S.C.I.S. during the later part of the Obama administration, told me of cases like Borgoño's and Dureland's. ""What do we gain as a society from that? Sessions will talk about sound principles of asylum, but, truly, what do we gain from doing this?""

Throughout Odette Dureland's trial, her lawyer maintained her innocence. But she also argued that even if the jury believed Dureland had applied for asylum under a different name, it shouldn't matter. Odette had become a citizen through her husband's application, moving from asylee to green-card holder to citizen based on fully adjudicated claims. If Dureland became a citizen through a process that would be unproblematic were it not for this supposed ""Alindor"" application, why should that now affect her right to remain in the United States?

The jury was unconvinced. The government had shown evidence that Dureland has relatives named Alindor, and that various details on the Alindor application looked similar to those on the one she later filed. The jury found Dureland guilty of criminal naturalization fraud. ""The integrity of our nation's legal immigration system is paramount,"" the acting director of U.S.C.I.S. in Tampa said in a press statement after the conviction. ""This conviction sends a clear message that attempting to fraudulently obtain United States citizenship will not be tolerated. Our nation's citizens deserve nothing less."" The judge sentenced Dureland to five months in prison. The conviction automatically led to Dureland's losing her citizenship.

After serving her sentence, Immigration and Customs Enforcement moved her to a detention center in August, with plans to deport her. She spent a month there before Gilbert managed to scrape together $10,000 for bond. The couple has hired an immigration attorney, who says he will try to convince an immigration judge that she should be allowed, effectively, to start the immigration process again, to obtain a new green card as the wife of a citizen or the mother of a citizen in the military. But lawyers familiar with denaturalization cases say that because she has been convicted of a crime, it's unlikely she'll prevail. Without a judge's approval, ICE will almost certainly deport her.

In September, I sat with Dureland and her family at their home. A bowl of star fruit, picked from the tree outside, sat on the table. Dureland held her head up with her hands, her elbows resting on the table. Her eyes were heavy. Less than two days before, she was released from federal immigration detention.""I didn't know if I would come home again,"" Dureland told me, standing beside her 15-year-old son, Gethro. She placed her hand on the top of her son's head, which he rested on her shoulder. She liked to pretend, before she was locked up, that she and her youngest child were the same height, but he had grown in the six months that she was away; there was no more pretending. She laughed. But despite her easygoing demeanor with her son, Dureland was weary from her time in detention, and she told me she needed to nap. When I returned a few hours later, the house was filled with the smell of spices and cooked onions. It had been six months since Dureland had made a meal. ""I missed my kitchen,"" she said.

She sat back down at the table. ""Detention was a scary place,"" Dureland told me. ""When I got there, everybody was being deported. And I was thinking, I have nobody in Haiti. If I were deported to Haiti, I would be by myself.""

Before she became a citizen, Dureland always knew that if something happened, if she were convicted of some crime, say, she could be deported. She lived a careful life. When she took the oath in 2012, that feeling -- that it could be taken away -- finally disappeared. ""I became an American,"" Dureland said. ""I am an American."" But even as she said it, she knew it was no longer true.",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/19/magazine/naturalized-citizenship-immigration-trump.html

The Fed raised rates, but it's bracing for economic strain

The Federal Reserve raised its benchmark interest rate yesterday to between 2.25 percent to 2.5 percent, and signaled that it expects ""some"" additional rate increases next year.

The Fed believes the U.S. economy is strong. ""Jerome H. Powell, the Fed's chairman, emphasized the continued strength of economic growth at a news conference after the announcement,"" Binyamin Appelbaum of the NYT writes. He adds that it was ""a display of measured confidence in the economy.""

But the move is a slap in the face to vocal critics. ""Mr. Powell insisted on the wisdom of the Fed's plans to raise borrowing costs while investors dumped their holdings,"" Mr. Appelbaum writes. ""The Fed's decision also rebuffed President Trump, who has broken with the practice of his predecessors by loudly and publicly campaigning for the Fed to keep rates low.""

Mr. Powell acknowledged new strains in recent months that included weaker growth in Europe and China and a downturn in stock prices, and he said that the Fed expects slightly slower domestic growth and fewer rate increases next year, Mr. Applebaum writes. Officials now expect to raise rates just twice in 2019, not three times as previously suggested.

Decoding the Fed's message is complex. Policymakers are saying that while the economy is basically sound, they are open to the possibility that choppy economic conditions could worsen and prove them wrong, even as they continue to unwind their so-called quantitative easing, notes Neil Irwin of the NYT. One thing is clear: The Fed is listening to economic data more than to the markets.

Did it choose correctly? Honestly, only time will tell.

The markets hated the rate increase

Investors had hoped the Fed would take the markets into account during its policy statement yesterday and signal growing concern about the outlook for economic growth. That hope was not fulfilled.

The S&P 500 stock index slumped, finishing down 1.5 percent. That brings its losses for the month of December to 9.2 percent. The benchmark was up before the Fed released its statement.

The exact offense is unclear. That current strains on the markets were overlooked? That the Fed is too bullish on growth? That the continuing unwinding of quantitative easing will leave the markets illiquid? Bloomberg suggests all three things may be at work.

The positive spin: ""The Fed message to the markets is, take a breath,"" Brian Belski, chief investment strategist at BMO Capital Markets in New York, told the NYT. ""The Fed did its job today.""

But the malaise will linger. International markets followed Wall Street's leads, and futures that track U.S. stock markets suggest shares will fall in early trading today.

Why a dull W.T.O. meeting descended into trash talking

The U.S. accused China of stealing intellectual property. Europe accused the U.S. of a trade war that threatened the global economy. And China said the U.S. wasn't using its powers responsibly.

That is not what you expect from a typical W.T.O. meeting, but it's what happened at a review of American trade policies in Geneva yesterday. ""In an age of severe trade tensions,"" writes Jack Ewing of the NYT, the meeting ""became a venue for allies and adversaries alike to vent their anger at American policies they said were illegal and destructive.""

""The Trump administration's confrontational approach to international diplomacy has altered the rules of engagement at international institutions like the W.T.O.,"" adds Mr. Ewing. ""The niceties of protocol are eroding and the language has become more blunt.""

Moves elsewhere speak just as loudly. The Justice Department is expected to announce another enforcement action against China today as part of a push against the threat the country may pose to America's national security. And China has detained a third Canadian citizen, escalating a diplomatic crisis in which it is pushing the U.S. to ease legal pressure against Huawei.

The tensions show no signs of stopping. ""Top advisers to Robert Lighthizer, the United States trade representative, briefed Congress on Tuesday afternoon about the state of the trade talks with China and left staff with the sense that the negotiations were in disarray,"" Mr. Ewing writes. Tariffs placed on Chinese goods by the U.S. may not be rolled back even if an agreement is struck before the end of a current trade truce with China, the advisers said.

Facebook's no good, very bad day

Facebook had a tough day yesterday after the publication of an NYT investigation into how the social network failed to disclose the extent of its vast data-sharing deals with other Big Tech firms.

Lawmakers in the U.S. and Britain called for greater oversight. ""Congress is going to have to regulate them and stop this,"" Senator Roy Blunt, Republican of Missouri, said. ""I hate to do it, but by God I will if they can't clean up their act.""

A new lawsuit added to the company's woes. The District of Columbia's attorney general, Karl Racine, sued Facebook for allowing the political consulting firm Cambridge Analytica to harvest the private data of tens of millions of Facebook users.

And Facebook's stock plunged. Shares fell as much as 7.3 percent yesterday, their biggest one-day percentage drop since a huge collapse in late July.

China's economy continues its slide

New data from Beijing shows that the nation hasn't yet managed to check the slowdown in its economy, reports the WSJ:

* ""Industrial production, weighed down by woes among automobile makers and in the property markets, slowed in November to its slackest point since early 2016, official data released Friday showed. Growth in retail sales dropped to its lowest level in more than 15 years.""

* ""Investors sent the yuan, bond yields and benchmark indexes in Hong Kong, Shanghai and Shenzhen lower in morning trading, in a realization that the weakening that began earlier this year has yet to run its course.""

The continuing problem for China is how to overcome its weakening economy while fighting a trade war with the U.S. that threatens to sap demand for Chinese exports.

New weed and vaping deals? How very 2018

The tobacco and alcohol industries can smell that change is in the air, which is why they're striking new deals with cannabis and vaping companies.

The e-cigarette maker Juul is reportedly on the cusp of signing a deal to become partners with Altria, one of the world's largest tobacco companies. Altria would invest $12.8 billion for a 35 percent stake in Juul, at a $38 billion valuation, giving the vaping company access to Altria's prized shelf-space and supply channels.

The world's biggest brewer, ABInBev, struck a deal with the Canadian marijuana company Tilray to research nonalcoholic beverages that are infused with cannabis. Each company will invest $50 million in the tie-up.

Both incumbents are trying to insulate themselves from market shifts. The Juul deal comes just two weeks after Altria bought a 45 percent stake in the Canadian marijuana company Cronos for $1.9 billion.

But Juul, which vowed to make cigarettes obsolete, is facing criticism as cozying up to Big Tobacco. ""This shows that Juul is all about maximizing sales and profit,"" said Eric N. Lindblom of the O'Neill Institute for National and Global Health Law at Georgetown University.

Uber lost another push to keep drivers as contractors

A British court yesterday affirmed a lower court's decisions that would grant the ride-hailing company's drivers a form of employment status.

What's happened: In October 2016, a U.K. employment tribunal ruled Uber drivers were workers, not contractors, and as such were entitled to national minimum wage and holiday pay. Uber has been appealing that decision. Britain's Court of Appeal yesterday upheld the ruling.

What it means: Uber may have to provide those benefits to its drivers. That would drastically increase the company's operating costs in the U.K. Uber prefers to cast things differently, and said in a statement yesterday that the provision of worker status would lead to the loss of ""the freedom and flexibility that comes with being their own boss.""

Next up: Uber says it will take its case to the British Supreme Court. In a similar case relating to gig economy plumbers, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of granting the laborer worker status.

48,the new york times,"WASHINGTON -- As a 12-year-old refugee from Somalia adjusting to life in the Virginia suburbs, Ilhan Omar fended off bullies who stuck gum on her scarf, knocked her down stairs and jumped her when she changed clothes for gym class.

Her father ""sat me down, and he said, 'Listen, these people who are doing all of these things to you, they're not doing something to you because they dislike you,'"" Ms. Omar recalled in a recent interview. ""They are doing something to you because they feel threatened in some way by your existence.""

Now Ms. Omar is Representative-elect Ilhan Omar, Democrat of Minnesota, and her father's words still hold. Nearly a quarter-century later, as Democrats prepare to assume control of the House with an extraordinarily diverse freshman class, she is perhaps Washington's most glorified and vilified newcomer -- a vehicle for the hopes of millions of Muslims and others touched by her life story, and for the fears of those who feel threatened by her.

When she is sworn in on Thursday, Ms. Omar will take her place in the history books as one of the first two Muslim women in Congress -- and the first to wear a hijab, or head covering, on the House floor. Her push to change a 181-year-old rule barring headwear in the chamber -- which Democrats are expected to immediately adopt -- has drawn fire from a Christian pastor, who warned that the floor of the House ""is now going to look like an Islamic republic.""

Her support for the boycott, divest and sanctions movement to pressure Israel to improve treatment of Palestinians is making Jewish leaders nervous. In Saudi Arabia, a state-owned newspaper recently suggested she was part of an Islamist plot to control Congress.

And at home in Minnesota, Ms. Omar has been dogged by specious rumors that she briefly married her brother for immigration purposes -- which she called ""absurd and offensive"" -- and by charges filed by a conservative Republican colleague in the Minnesota Legislature that she violated campaign finance laws; the state is investigating.

Yet in her short political career, which began two years ago when she unseated a 44-year incumbent to win a seat in the Minnesota Legislature, Ms. Omar has also been featured on the cover of a Time magazine edition spotlighting ""women who are changing the world""; appeared on ""The Daily Show,"" where she publicly invited President Trump to tea; danced in a Maroon 5 music video; and become the subject of her own documentary, ""Time for Ilhan.""

""She's the epitome of the so-called American dream, but for much of white Christian America, she's an American nightmare,"" said Larycia Hawkins, who teaches politics and religion at the University of Virginia, and lost her job at an evangelical college after wearing a hijab in solidarity with Muslim women.

Ms. Omar, a slight 36-year-old with a soft voice and delicate features, envisions herself as a voice in Washington for the disenfranchised, for marginalized people and for immigrants like herself. She came up in politics as a community organizer, working on issues like hunger and inequities in the juvenile justice system. When she arrived in the capital for freshman orientation, she ran into Representative John Lewis, Democrat of Georgia and a civil-rights icon -- and burst into tears.

""I said to him, 'Sir, I read about you in middle school, and you're here in the flesh, and I get to be your colleague,'"" she recalled, tearing up again. She added, ""There are moments -- every single minute -- that I've been here where I almost want to pinch myself.""

Ms. Omar's life story is, in many respects, uniquely American, an immigrant who worked hard and made good. She also embodies the complicated crosscurrents around immigration, race and religion that dominate Mr. Trump's Washington.

When she was 8, Somalia erupted into civil war, and her extended family fled to a refugee camp in Kenya, where they spent four years before seeking asylum in the United States in 1995. They settled first in Arlington, Va., and later in Minneapolis, whose large Somali population Mr. Trump has called ""a disaster"" for Minnesota. Her father, a teacher in Somalia, picked up work driving taxis and later got a job at the post office; her mother died when Ms. Omar was 2.

Her arrival in this country was the first time, Ms. Omar has said, that she had confronted ""my otherness"" as both a black person and a Muslim. She became a citizen in 2000, when she was 17. After the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, she decided to wear the hijab, as an open declaration of her identity. But from ""the first day we arrived in America,"" she said, she concluded that it was not the golden land that she had heard about.

""I think back to the orientations I went through a little over 20 years ago in the process of coming to this country, and in those orientations they did not have people who were homeless. There was an America that extended liberty and justice to everyone. There was an America where prosperity was guaranteed regardless of where you were born and what you looked like and who you prayed to,"" she said, adding, ""I wasn't comfortable with that hypocrisy.""

That feeling led to organizing, and Democratic politics. ""She was almost like a cliché of a civic-minded new American,"" said Larry Jacobs, a professor at the University of Minnesota who taught Ms. Omar during a public policy fellowship. She would quote the Declaration of Independence, he said, asking, ""Why have we come up short?""

As a candidate, rallying voters for a $15 minimum wage, more relaxed immigration policies, Medicare for all and other progressive agenda items, Ms. Omar proved herself sure-footed and tough, with a flair for inspirational rhetoric -- traits that her predecessor, Representative Keith Ellison, Minnesota's incoming attorney general, attributes to her early childhood in Somalia, as the daughter of a well-to-do family of educators.

""She grows up with this sense of herself as important, and yet war destroyed everything and essentially put her in a position where she had to go get rice from relief workers for her family at a young age,"" he said, adding, ""She had a certain sense of herself, a certain confidence of her own view.""

Running for office meant upending gender norms in the Somali community, where politics is typically the province of men. It also forced Ms. Omar to make public details about her complicated private life, which became fodder for conservative bloggers, who seized on her brief marriage to a British citizen. They have since divorced; earlier this year, she married her current husband, Ahmed Hirsi, the father of her three children.

""Like all families, we have had our ups and downs,"" she said in a 2016 statement, ""but we are proud to have come through it together.""

Her election that year made her the first Somali-American state legislator in the nation, but some conservative colleagues were put off by her frank talk about race, religion and discrimination.

""The liberal media in Minnesota likes to paint her as their hero and that's what they have done here -- Time magazine beauty queen, trailblazer, all of those wrapped together,"" said State Representative Steve Drazkowski, who has investigated Ms. Omar's campaign spending. He said Ms. Omar was ""really accusatory and really rode the edge of racial discussion.""

And Ms. Omar's careful answer on the 2018 campaign trail to questions about Israel -- and her postelection clarification that she does indeed back the boycott, divest and sanctions movement -- has left some Jewish leaders feeling betrayed.

""I think people looked at her as this transformative, inspirational-type figure,"" said Lonny Goldsmith, editor of TCJewfolk, a media nonprofit in the Twin Cities, ""and maybe she is to some people. But at the end of the day she's a politician.""

Ms. Omar's admirers see her as a powerful symbol, whose ""mere presence will hopefully help to educate the American people about who Muslim women are,"" said Farhana Khera, the executive director of Muslim Advocates, a civil-rights group.

Already, she has worked with Representative Jim McGovern of Massachusetts, the incoming chairman of the Rules Committee, to carve out a religious exception to the no-hats rule. She gave a hint of her style in her sassy response to the pastor, Bishop E. W. Jackson, who complained that the House floor would look like an Islamic republic.

""Well sir,"" she wrote on Twitter, ""the floor of Congress is going to look like America ... And you're gonna have to just deal.""",https://www.nytimes.com/2018/12/30/us/politics/ilhan-omar-minnesota-congress.html

It's Friday! And the earth is at its closest annual approach to the sun. 🌞 New York Times: ""Chilly as winter may feel in the Northern Hemisphere, we're more than three million miles closer to our fiery star than we were in the dead of summer.""

Weather: Clear as glass, with a high of 49. Rainy as heck tomorrow. Sunny and mild again Sunday.

Alternate-side parking: in effect until Jan. 21.

So much for that shutdown.

As the one in Washington continues, New Yorkers had been bracing for a different shutdown: a 15-month disruption to the L train, beginning in April, to make repairs.

But on Thursday, Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo announced that by adopting a new technology, engineers would be able to keep service going during rush hour, while crews worked nights and weekends to make fixes.

[Read our full story on the L train.]

Mr. Cuomo was smiling as he delivered the news from his Midtown office. Some Brooklynites were ecstatic.

But not everyone was.

For nearly three years, the Metropolitan Transportation Authority and city officials had planned for the disruption. More ferries, buses and bike lanes were in the works. Many people and businesses moved to other neighborhoods to avoid the shutdown.

Now, City Hall and others are asking, what happened to all those plans? What about the millions already spent? Was the technology too untested?

Answers will come, eventually. But not on Thursday.

Mr. Cuomo prioritized speed and construction, not parliamentary rules of procedure. He has long argued that government was more about building than talking and debating.

Besides, Mr. Cuomo has said, he does not control the M.T.A., which operates the subways. But there he was, controlling it, while denying that was what he was doing.

Obvious contradictions, zigging while your administration is zagging, all with a showman's timing. Did that sound familiar?

Mr. Cuomo, who says he has no interest in running for president, delivered the train news on Thursday afternoon, around the time members of Congress were being sworn in.

Local news carried Mr. Cuomo's news conference live.

Coincidence? On New Year's Day, he was inaugurated on Ellis Island, in the shadow of the Statue of Liberty. On Wednesday, he was greeted with a Daily News front page describing him as ""presidential-sounding.""

One critic of the new L train plan said Mr. Cuomo did, in a way, seem presidential. The governor, @2AvSagas wrote on Twitter, ""sounds like Trump now.""

And finally: An L-train game-maker wonders, 'Now what?'

""Everything gets messed up, even our attempt to make fun of the chaos.""

That's how Hunter Fine, co-creator of a board game based on the L train shutdown, reacted to news (see above) about the shutdown being averted.

Just yesterday I told you about the game, ""Escape from HelL."" Players roll dice to get from Bushwick to Manhattan without the L train. Along the way, they draw ""chance"" cards that, nearly always, send them backward.

On Kickstarter, Mr. Fine and his partner raised nearly $6,000 to make the game, more than twice their goal.

Mr. Fine will press forward, but the game will be tweaked. ""I think we might update some of those cards,"" Mr. Fine said yesterday, ""based on some of those latest developments.""

Will the new cards say things like, ""Governor Cuomo changed his mind, move back 3 spaces?""

""That's a really good idea,"" Mr. Fine said. ""I might steal that.""

It's Friday: Roll the dice and take a chance.

Metropolitan Diary: Swiped through

Dear Diary:

I was outside one of the entrances to the Brooklyn Bridge-City Hall subway station in Lower Manhattan. An older man approached me and asked where he could find a token booth.

I told him he would have to cross the street and walk two blocks south.

He looked dejected.

""If you'd like,"" I said, ""I'd be happy to swipe you in here.""

Relieved, he promised to reimburse me. After we had both gone through the turnstile, he reached into his pocket and then stopped to show me the identification card hanging on a lanyard around his neck.

""I'm a senior citizen,"" he said, ""I get half off.""
