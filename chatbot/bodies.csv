0,"As a partial US government shutdown hit the two-week mark on Friday, Donald Trump once again invited congressional leaders to meet him at the White House, amid an impasse over his demands for taxpayers' money for a border wall, and Democrats taking control of the House of Representative.

The president has invited leaders from both parties back to the White House just two days after a meeting on border security in the situation room there did not resolve matters, and a day after Nancy Pelosi became speaker of the House and Democrats passed legislation to reopen the government.

The meeting is scheduled for 11.30am in Washington.

About 800,000 federal workers have been affected by the 22 December closure of about one-quarter of the federal government as Trump withheld his support for new funding until he secures $5bn to build his long-promised but unachieved wall along the US-Mexico border.

Such a wall, he has argued, is needed to stem the flow of illegal immigrants and drugs over the southwestern border. When he ran for president in 2016, he vowed Mexico would pay for the wall, which it has refused to do.

On Thursday, Trump tried to keep the pressure on Democrats, even as they gained significant new power with their takeover of the House of Representatives at the start of a new Congress.

""Build the Wall,"" the president demanded on Twitter. But in remarks at a surprise White House press briefing, Trump appeared to give himself negotiating space when he said: ""You can call it a barrier. You can call it whatever you want. But essentially, we need protection in our country.""

In a meeting at the White House in December, Trump said he would be ""proud"" to take responsibility for causing the government shutdown, though has since tried to blame it on Democrats.

Pelosi was adamant, however.

""We're not doing a wall,"" she said late on Thursday. ""It has nothing to do with politics. It has to do with a wall is an immorality between countries. It's an old way of thinking. It isn't cost effective.""

Asked if she would give Trump $1 for a wall to reopen the government, Pelosi said: ""One dollar? Yeah, one dollar. The fact is a wall is an immorality. It's not who we are as a nation.""

Late on Thursday, the House passed two Democratic bills to immediately reopen government agencies for varying lengths of time, despite a White House veto threat. The Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, a Republican, will not support the legislation and has pledged not to pass anything the president will not sign.

But McConnell now faces increasing pressure from fellow Republicans.

""We should pass a continuing resolution to get the government back open. The Senate has done it last Congress, we should do it again today,"" the Republican senator Cory Gardner told the Hill on Thursday. His colleague Susan Collins also called for the Senate to pass the funding bills.

Vice-President Mike Pence later suggested on Fox News that the White House could work with Democrats on so-called Dreamer immigrants who were brought to the United States unlawfully as children - an idea Trump had rejected on Wednesday. ""It's being talked about,"" Pence said.",0
0,"There are two chants that everyone remembers from Donald Trump's campaign rallies. One is ""Lock her up!"", aimed at Hillary Clinton, a demand not likely to be met unless America becomes a banana republic. The other is ""build that wall!""

It is now crunch time for this central, defining promise of the Trump candidacy and ""make America great again"" movement. The US president says he will not support a bill to fully fund the government until he secures $5.6bn for a wall on the US-Mexico border.

So quarter of the US government has been shut down for two weeks, leaving hundreds of thousands of workers without pay. After Friday's talks with congressional Democrats at the White House, there is still no end in sight.

Indeed, no one should assume Trump was bluffing when he said he was willing to keep the government closed for months or even years, or that he would consider using emergency powers - an ominous phrase in any democracy under strain - to bypass Congress and get the wall built.

It has come to this because there is no political incentive for Trump or his nemesis, the newly re-elected House speaker Nancy Pelosi, to blink first. Both are under intense pressure from their respective bases to hold firm and resist concessions. The system has delivered divided government with no common ground.

On Thursday, Vice-President Mike Pence told Fox News: ""Bottom line, if there's no wall, there's no deal."" Pelosi, meanwhile, told reporters on Capitol Hill: ""We're not doing a wall. Does anybody have any doubt that we are not doing a wall?""

A foreign visitor to the US might not immediately spot the signs of malaise. In grey and chilly Washington, traffic still rolls, trains still run, the shows goes on. The current shutdown has not affected three quarters of the government, including the Pentagon and the postal service, which have secure funding.

But there is a gradual sense of things grinding to a standstill, small but telling harbingers of imperial decline. The Smithsonian Institution's 17 museums and zoo are closed (although the animals are still getting fed). Couples in Washington cannot get marriage licences.

Nationally, 800,000 employees from the departments of homeland security and transportation and other agencies have been furloughed or are working without pay. Even as China lands a spacecraft on the far side of the moon, most employees at Nasa are on furlough, with the small percentage who remain working without pay.

With bitter irony given the issue at hand, the shutdown has reached America's 62 immigration courts. Hundreds of judges are on furlough, and only cases of immigrants in detention are being heard.

The National Park Service is operating with a skeleton staff. Some parks may be accessible, others closed completely. The National Park Service is providing no visitor services such as toilets, facility and road maintenance and trash collection. Campgrounds have begun closing due to sanitation concerns.

As the shutdown drags on, there will be a creeping paralysis, affecting everything from the Internal Revenue Service's ability to pay out tax refunds to rental assistance payments in public housing to whether the interior department can pay out treaty rights obligations to Indian tribes.

The fact it is a partial, not total, government shutdown has perhaps tempted Trump to make a political calculation that the pain is preferable to giving in - or being seen to give in - on his promise to build the wall. It is worth remembering how fundamental this was to his campaign, his political identity, perhaps even his psyche.

On the day he launched his unlikely run for president, descending an escalator at Trump Tower in New York, Trump declared: ""I would build a great wall, and nobody builds walls better than me, believe me, and I'll build them very inexpensively, I will build a great, great wall on our southern border. And I will have Mexico pay for that wall.""

Mexico rejected the idea but Trump repeated the promise in almost every speech and interview, insisting the estimated $23bn barrier is necessary to stem the flow of illegal immigrants and drugs into the US. For supporters and detractors alike, it became the ultimate symbol of his xenophobic vision of America.

Democrats' victory in the House in the midterms election means the dream has probably slipped away, but Trump cannot afford to admit it. When, last month, the Republican-controlled Senate approved a stopgap measure to keep the government open, he was poised to sign it until rightwing talking heads complained that he was capitulating.

In that sense, it is not a Trump shutdown or Pelosi shutdown. It is a Rush Limbaugh shutdown, an Ann Coulter shutdown. Rightwing minority rule is now holding the country to ransom.

For their part, Pelosi and the Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, see no reason to impose a medieval solution on a 21st century problem. They are also aware that Democrats were elected in 2018 by voters eager to resist Trump in general and the wall in particular. To give an inch would be seen as a betrayal. Pelosi declared this week: ""How many more times can we say no? Nothing for the wall.""

On Friday, Trump and the Democratic leaders could not even agree whether their talks had gone well. Trump insisted the meeting had been ""very productive"", whereas Pelosi described the conversation as ""sometimes contentious"".

And where, in all this, is Mitch McConnell? The Senate majority leader has been lurking on the sidelines, saying little other than that measures approved by the House are non-starters in the Senate without the president's support. The New York Times noted: ""By absenting himself, Mr McConnell had hoped to push the blame for a prolonged shutdown on to Democrats while protecting Republicans running for re-election in 2020 - including himself."" But with some Republicans becoming restless, it is not clear whether the strategy is sustainable.

For now, Trump has designated a working group led by Pence, and including his son-in-law Jared Kushner, to conduct more negotiations. But the stalemate looks set to overtake the longest shutdown on record: 21 days under Bill Clinton in 1996.

The president's best hope now is to turn the dispute to his advantage by using Democrats as a foil in the 2020 presidential election. The line of argument will be along the lines of: I wanted to give you a wall, but the Democrats denied me - and you. That is why, in the White House Rose Garden on Friday, he reiterated: ""I'm very proud of doing what I'm doing.""",1

President Donald Trump had to cancel his planned Friday departure for his luxury property in Florida after he walked away from a plan to fund the government and resumed demands to fund a border wall.

But the first lady isn't waiting around for lawmakers to agree on either a permanent or even a temporary funding solution.

The federal government will go into partial shutdown at midnight, unless a dramatic and unexpected action forces the Senate back into session.

'It has long been the family's tradition to spend their Christmas holiday at Mar-a-Lago. Her plans to travel with her son to their Florida home for his winter break have not changed this year,' spokeswoman Stephanie Grisham said, CNN reported.

0,"Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham is counseling President Trump to stand firm in his fight for a border barrier and warned Wednesday evening that capitulation would be the end of the first-term executive's presidency.

Appearing on Fox News on Wednesday evening, Graham declared: 'If he gives in now, that's the end of 2019 in terms of him being an effective president.

'That's the probably the end of his presidency. Donald Trump has made a promise to the American people. He's going to secure our border,' the senior senator said.

Retreating on Trump's signature campaign promise would damage the Republican Party as a while, Graham advised colleagues on Capitol Hill who believe their leader should concede the issue to Democrats.

'That's the end of us if we give in on this issue as Republicans,' he asserted.

Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham is counseling President Trump to stand firm in his fight for a border barrier and warned Wednesday evening that capitulation would be the end of the first-term executive's presidency

Graham has the president's ear and visited the White House over the weekend, when the president remained in Washington to share in the pain of the government shutdown rather than party at his Palm Beach mansion with family and friends.

He told Fox that he doesn't believe the president is going to budge on his border security demands.

'He's not going to sign a bill that doesn't have money for the wall. I can tell you exactly how this is going to end. The president is going to challenge Democrats to compromise and if they continue to say no, they're going to pay the price with the American people,' he asserted.

Counselor to the president Kellyanne Conway similarly said on Thursday morning that Trump will only sign 'something that truly secures the border' and a bill that Democrats plan to pass today as their first act in Congress does not do that.

'It doesn't reopen the government for homeland security,' she claimed.

One bill funds closed areas of the government through the end of the current fiscal year. Its companion appropriates money to the Department of Homeland Security only until Feb. 8.

Democrats and their Republican counterparts came to the White House at the president's invitation on Wednesday afternoon for a border security briefing and negotiation in the Situation Room. The two sides left conversation angrily pointing the finger at one another for the partial government closure.

Conway claimed that soon-to-be House speaker Nancy Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer were 'very rude and dismissive' during the briefing conducted by the Homeland Security Secretary via satellite.

'That was really poor form, but the president has graciously invited them back here tomorrow,' she said of the president's request that lawmakers return on Friday.

Counselor to the president Kellyanne Conway similarly said on Thursday morning that Trump will only sign 'something that truly secures the border' and a bill that Democrats plan to pass today as their first act in Congress does not do that

Democratic leaders left the White House on Wednesday unconvinced by the president's arguments that a border wall is necessary for national security.

They left a briefing on the border early, Republican leaders revealed, and interrupted and argued with Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen.

The meeting ended at an impasse, with the president inviting attendees back Friday for more talks after leadership elections have taken place. His White House believes that Pelosi will be more amenable to giving him the funds once she's formally elected speaker.

Speaking to NBC News, Pelosi said that will not be the case. 'We can go through the back and forth,' she said in an interview that aired on Thursday morning. 'No. How many more times can we say no? Nothing for the wall.'

'There is no amount of persuasion he can do to say to us, ""We want you to do something that is not effective, that costs billions of dollars."" That sends the wrong message about who we are as a country,' she contended.

Schumer urged the president during a White House press conference to reconsider his own position on bills to reopen the government.

'At our last meeting the president said, I am going to shut the government down. They are now feeling the heat. It is not helping the president, it is not helping the Republicans to be the owners of this shutdown,' he said.

'Today we gave them an opportunity to get out of that and open up the government as we debate border security, and to say to them, because he says he won't sign it, and use the government as hostage, and just give in, the American people don't want that, that's bad for our country.'

The White House says a pair of bills that Democrats are backing that would end the shutdown are a 'non-starter' because they do not fund the border wall.

Incoming House Majority Whip Steny Hoyer said they would move forward with passing them, anyway. 'Because that is our responsibility, as a co-equal branch of government,' he said.

'We want the president to open up government. We are giving him a Republican path to do that. Why would he not do it,' he asked.

Democrats have proposed legislation that would fund every closed area through the end of the current fiscal year, except the Homeland Security department.

A bill that Pelosi, the expected speaker of the House, will put on the floor Thursday extends funding for DHS until Feb. 8, providing Trump and the new Congress with an opportunity to continue talks while the government hums along.

Before she could gavel in the new legislative session, the White House deemed the strategy dead-on-arrival, indicating in a late-night statement that Trump is resolved to keep the government closed until Congress appropriates money for his border wall.

'The Pelosi plan is a non-starter because it does not fund our homeland security or keep American families safe from human trafficking, drugs, and crime,' White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said.

Conway said that Trump shouldn't be faulted for the breakdown in talks, because he is at least open to a conversation.

'But this president, give him his due, he's willing to have him here,' she said.

Trump told Democrats in a meeting last month that he would be 'proud to oversee' a shutdown but has since blamed the two-week closure on the opposing party.

'He doesn't own this shutdown any longer,' Conway insisted.

House Republicans passed a bill before the end of the last Congress, she argued, that provided roughly $5.7 bill all at once for the president's border wall. She said that it was the Senate, which has also passed a bill that Trump won't sign, that needs to do its job.

The Senate is still run by Republicans but their majority is too slim to pass legislation without the help of seven Democrats after today.

Conway said the shutdown cannot end with Democrats are 'harrumphing their way in the Situation Room' as she contended they were on Wednesday.

'I hope that they'll get serious about negotiating,' she concluded.",4

As a partial U.S. government shutdown hit the two-week mark, President Donald Trump and congressional leaders prepared to meet on Friday over ways to break an impasse pitting his demand for building a border wall against Democrats' call for alternative security measures.

About 800,000 federal workers have been affected by the Dec. 22 closure of about one-quarter of the federal government as Trump withheld his support for new funding until he secures $5 billion to start building the wall along the U.S.-Mexico border that he promised during his campaign.

Such a wall, he has argued, is needed to stem the flow of illegal immigrants and drugs over the southwestern border. When he ran for president in 2016, he vowed Mexico would pay for the wall, which it has refused to do.

On Thursday, Trump tried to keep the pressure on Democrats, even as they gained significant new power with their takeover of the House of Representatives at the start of a new Congress.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi (left) will be among congressional leaders making a trip to the White House to negotiate with President Donald Trump (right) over funding for his long-promised border wall on Friday

'Build the Wall,' the Republican president demanded on Twitter. In remarks to reporters that same day, Trump said: 'You can call it a barrier. You can call it whatever you want. But essentially, we need protection in our country.'

As Trump dug in, so did opposition Democrats, leaving many to wonder just how much progress might be made during Friday's White House meeting scheduled for 11:30 a.m.

'We're not doing a wall,' Democrat Nancy Pelosi said late on Thursday, several hours after she was sworn in as the new speaker of the House of Representatives.

'It has nothing to do with politics. It has to do with a wall is an immorality between countries. It's an old way of thinking. It isn't cost effective,' Pelosi added.

Asked how much money she would authorize for the project in a Democrat-led spending package to reopen parts of the government that have been closed for nearly two weeks, she replied: 'One dollar.'

Late on Thursday, the House passed two Democratic bills to immediately reopen government agencies for varying lengths of time, despite a White House veto threat.

Earlier in the day, Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell labeled the House effort 'political theater, not productive lawmaking,' that the president would not sign into law, although the Senate last month approved identical legislation.

Trump has dug in his heels on funding for a wall, boasting to his supporters that he's not bending to Democrats' demands

But McConnell faces increasing pressure from within his caucus, especially from vulnerable Republicans up for re-election in 2020, as several conservative senators urged action to reopen the government, according to media reports.

'We should pass a continuing resolution to get the government back open. The Senate has done it last Congress, we should do it again today,' U.S. Senator Cory Gardner told The Hill on Thursday. His colleague Susan Collins also called for the Senate to pass the funding bills, while several other Republicans also urged an end to the shutdown, The Hill and The New York Times reported.

Vice President Mike Pence, in a television interview Thursday night, also suggested that in exchange for the wall, the White House could work with Democrats on so-called Dreamer immigrants who were brought to the United States illegally as children -- an idea Trump had rejected on Wednesday.

'It's being talked about,' Pence told Fox News.

Democrats back other border security measures aside from the wall, and their two-bill package passed Thursday includes $1.3 billion for border fencing and $300 million for other border security items such as technology and cameras.

Without a deal to end the partial government shutdown, the Department of Homeland Security will not be able to bring some furloughed workers back to their jobs while others continue to be forced to work without paychecks for the time being.

Other federal agencies were also hobbled, including the Justice Department, Commerce Department and departments of Agriculture, Labor, Interior and Treasury.

Additionally, the partial shutdown was straining the country's immigration system, worsening backlogs in courts and complicating hiring for employers.

'Important meeting today on Border Security with Republican and Democrat Leaders in Congress. Both parties must work together to pass a Funding Bill that protects this Nation and its people - this is the first and most important duty of government...,' Trump tweeted Wednesday evening.

Trump and Congressional leaders met at the White House on Wednesday

Congressional leaders from both sides of the aisle emerged from a meeting at the White House earlier in the day with no details on how or when the shutdown may end.

The president invited everyone back on Friday to reconvene.

Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell admitted no progress was made as the shut down hit day 12.

And, he conceded, it could continue for 'weeks.'

'We had a good discussion. Obviously the border security issue - I don't think any particular progress was made today. But we talked about all aspects of it and it was a civil discussion. And we're hopeful that somehow in the coming days and weeks we'll be able to reach an agreement,' he told reporters upon returning to the Capitol on Wednesday afternoon.

The impasse remains at funding for Trump's wall on the almost 2,000 mile U.S.-Mexico border.

Democrats are holding firm in their position that they will not give Trump the $5 billion he needs to build it.

'We can go through the back and forth,' incoming Speaker Nancy Pelosi told NBC News. 'No. How many more times can we say no? Nothing for the wall.'

The blame game has begun.

House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy put the ball in Democrats' court.

'We never did get through the complete briefing,' McCarthy said at the White House after the event, which was led by Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen. 'I was a little disappointed with some on the other side. Once the secretary started, Senator Schumer interrupted her and they really didn't want to hear it.'

And he told reporters at the Capitol no negotiations were held during their sit down at the White House.

'They were pretty much on script,' he said of Democrats.

Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer shot the blame right back.

'At our last meeting the president said, I am going to shut the government down. They are now feeling the heat. It is not helping the president, it is not helping the Republicans to be the owners of this shutdown,' he said.

The president is holding firm too.

In his remarks during a Cabinet meeting before he sat down with Congressional leaders, Trump refused to say whether he would sign a government funding bill if he received less than his $5 billion request to fund his border wall.

'Could we do it for a little bit less? It's so insignificant compared to what we're talking about. You know, I've heard numbers as high as $275 billion we lose on illegal immigration,' Trump said. 'The $5 billion approved by the House is such a small amount compared to the level of the problem.'

There had been reports the White House had come down $2.5 billion and would accept legislation with that number.

But Trump shot that down.

'No, not $2.5 (billion), no. We're asking for $5.6 (billion) and somebody said $2.5 (billion),' he said.

Democrats are holding fast to their own position - the $1.3 billion they've allocated.

That is the position all have been in since the shut down started on Dec. 21.

Negotiations went no where during the holidays and Wednesday's meeting with the first time the main players were all in one room since the shut down began.

The lawmakers who attended the meeting included Pelosi, incoming House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, McCarthy, and incoming House Minority Whip Steve Scalise. Those attending from the Senate include Schumer, McConnell, incoming Senate Majority Whip John Thune, and Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin.

The White House says a pair of bills that Democrats are backing that would end the shutdown are a 'non-starter' because they do not fund the border wall.

The two-part plan from House Democrats would fund the Department of Homeland Security until Feb. 8 and fund all other closed departments - such as Justice, Interior, Transportation, Commerce and Agriculture - for the rest of the fiscal year through Sept. 30.

Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell said no progress was made and the shut down could last weeks

Nancy Pelosi will become Speaker of the House on Thursday when she pushes a plan to reopen the government

They will bring those bills up for a vote on Thursday when they take control of the House and hope passage in the lower chamber will pressure the Senate to follow suit.

An estimated 380,000 federal employees in those departments have been furloughed and another 420,000 will have to work without pay. The clock is ticking to Jan. 11 - the first pay period for those workers that will encompass the entire time period of the shutdown.

The Democrats' proposal would allow the debate over wall funding to continue without tying the rest of the government to it. Wall money is appropriated through the Department of Homeland Security.

The six bills to fund the other departments have bipartisan support in both chambers but have been held up over the dispute over funding Trump's wall.

A spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Monday that the chamber wouldn't take up legislation without public support from the president.

'It's simple: The Senate is not going to send something to the President that he won't sign,' said Don Stewart, a spokesman for McConnell.

The partial government shutdown began December 22 after Trump bowed to conservative demands that he fight to make good on his pledge to build the wall.

0,"The Internal Revenue Service still expects taxpayers to pay what they owe on time - but the partial government shutdown may significantly delay refunds.

Since the shutdown began on December 22, IRS has been operating on a shutdown plan that it uses outside of the tax-filing season, which doesn't fund the processing of tax refunds.

The shutdown plan cuts staffing at the IRS by 88 per cent, and the agency will not conduct audits or answer taxpayer questions under the current shutdown plan.

With the advent of tax season, the Treasury Department is expected to issue a revised shutdown plan soon, but it is unclear whether it will allow for the processing of refunds, an IRS source told DailyMail.com.

The partial government shutdown may significantly delay tax refunds from the IRS. Pictured: a man reviews his tax filings in a stock image

Tax filing season begins in mid-January, and returns are due to the IRS by April 15 -raising the possibility that the shutdown could hit taxpayers who are depending on a speedy refund.

The shutdown, now nearing two weeks, could go on for 'months or even years', Democratic Senate Leader Chuck Schumer said on Friday, after meeting with President Donald Trump.

'We're in uncharted territory as each day gets longer,' Mark Steber, chief tax officer at Jackson Hewitt Tax Service, told the Wall Street Journal, which first reported on the refund issue.

Typically, lower-income taxpayers who have no federal tax liability file their tax returns as soon as possible in January, and expect to receive refunds by February.

The shutdown could hit those taxpayers the hardest unless it is resolved quickly.

Those who owe taxes usually delay filing until the April 15 deadline, and wealthier taxpayers with more complicated returns often take an extension.

WASHINGTON, Jan 4 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump said on Friday he could use emergency powers to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border without Congress' approval, threatening to bypass Democratic lawmakers emboldened by their recent takeover of the House of Representatives.

A showdown between Trump and Congressional Democrats over funding for his wall project has led to a two-week government shutdown. Trump says he will not support a bill to fully fund the government until he secures the money for the wall.

Asked whether he had considered declaring a national emergency to build the wall, Trump said: ""Yes, I have. ... We can do it. I haven't done it. I may do it ... But we can call a national emergency and build it very quickly.""

The comments come just a day after Democrats, led by Nancy Pelosi, took charge of the House, ushering in an era of divided government two years into Trump's term.

In sometimes combative talks on Friday, Trump, Pelosi and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer failed to strike a deal to end the partial shutdown as they fought over Trump's request for $5 billion to fund the wall.

The U.S. Constitution assigns Congress the power over funding the federal government, so Trump would likely face legal challenges if he tried to bypass Congress on financing the wall.

He dismissed those concerns in a news briefing at the White House.

In sometimes combative talks on Friday, Trump, Pelosi and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer failed to strike a deal to end the partial shutdown as they fought over Trump's request for $5 billion to fund the wall.

The U.S. Constitution assigns Congress the power over funding the federal government, so Trump would likely face legal challenges if he tried to bypass Congress on financing the wall.

He dismissed those concerns in a news briefing at the White House.

""We can call a national emergency because of the security of our country, absolutely,"" he said. Asked if declaring a national emergency was a threat hanging over Democrats, Trump said, ""I'd never threaten anybody, but I am allowed to do that, yes.""",9
0,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump's budget director and chief of staff on Sunday said the partial U.S. government shutdown could continue to Jan. 3, when the new Congress convenes and Democrats take over the House of Representatives.

""It's very possible this shutdown will go beyond (December) the 28th and into the new Congress,"" Mick Mulvaney said on Fox News Sunday.

""I don't think things are going to move very quickly here for the next few days"" because of the Christmas holiday, added Mulvaney, who serves as director of the Office of Management and Budget and was named acting White House chief of staff 10 days ago.

The U.S. Senate adjourned on Saturday, unable to break an impasse over Trump's demand for more funds for a wall on the border with Mexico that Democrats are unwilling to accept.

Mulvaney said the White House made a ""counter-offer"" to Democrats on funding for border security that fell between the Democratic offer of $1.3 billion and Trump's demand for $5 billion.

As part of those talks on Saturday, Vice President Mike Pence offered to drop the demand for $5 billion for a border wall, substituting instead $2.1 billion, ABC News reported, citing unnamed sources.

A Democratic source familiar with the negotiations said real discussions have been happening between Democratic lawmakers and Republican Senator Richard Shelby, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, who has been talking to the White House. It was unclear what Democrats had offered.

Mulvaney sought to shift blame for the partial shutdown to Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic nominee for speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, saying she might hold up negotiations to ensure she secures the position.

""I think she's in that unfortunate position of being beholden to her left wing to where she cannot be seen as agreeing with the president on anything until after she is speaker,"" Mulvaney said. ""If that's the case, again, there's a chance we go into the next Congress.""

Pelosi spokesman Drew Hammill disputed that account, saying in a statement: ""As Mr. Mulvaney well knows, House Democrats are united in their opposition to the President's immoral, expensive and ineffective wall.""

The White House should ""stop the posturing and start serious bipartisan talks,"" Hammill said.

Financing for about a quarter of federal government programs - including the departments of Homeland Security, Justice and Agriculture - expired at midnight on Friday. More than 400,000 ""essential"" employees in those agencies will work without pay until the dispute is resolved. Another 380,000 will be ""furloughed,"" meaning they are put on temporary leave.

Law enforcement efforts, border patrols, mail delivery and airport operations will keep running.

Building a wall to try to prevent migrants from entering the United States illegally was a central plank of Trump's presidential campaign, but Democrats are vehemently opposed and have rejected his funding request.

Trump reiterated his push for border security on Sunday, saying on Twitter that ""the only way"" to stop drugs, gangs, and human trafficking at the border was with a wall or barrier.

""Drones and all of the rest are wonderful and lots of fun, but it is only a good old fashioned Wall that works!,"" the president said in the tweet.

Earlier in the week, leaders in both the Senate and House thought they had reached a deal that Trump would sign that contained less money for border security, only to watch the president, under pressure from conservatives, re-assert his demand for $5 billion at the last minute.

Senator David Perdue, a Republican from Georgia on the Senate Banking Committee, said on Fox News' ""Sunday Morning Futures"" that he thought a deal this week was possible.

""I spoke to the president last night, he wants that,"" Purdue said, adding: ""I'm hopeful that cooler heads will prevail and we'll get to some number between $1.6 (billion) and $5 billion on that.""",10
0,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - No agreement came out of a meeting between U.S. congressional leaders and President Donald Trump on Wednesday to end a partial government shutdown now in its 12th day as the president stuck to his demand for $5 billion in border wall funding fiercely opposed by Democrats.

Congressional leaders are expected to return to the White House on Friday to resume talks, signaling the shutdown will likely stretch into the weekend.

The White House convened the meeting to try to convince Democrats that funding a wall on the southern border with Mexico was a pressing security need. Instead, Democratic leaders cut off Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Neilsen's presentation and tried to no avail to press Trump to accept their offer.

""It just was not a credible presentation,"" Senator Dick Durbin said of the briefing. He added that Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi, who is expected to be elected House speaker on Thursday, insisted the conversation focus instead on the shutdown.

Pelosi said the House would proceed with plans to hold votes on Thursday, when they formally take control of the chamber from Trump's fellow Republicans, on legislation that would end the shutdown without providing the wall money sought by Trump.

""We're asking the president to open up government,"" Pelosi told reporters outside the White House after the meeting.

But Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said afterward on the Senate floor that the chamber would not vote on the legislation, calling it a ""political sideshow"" and ""total nonstarter.""

Democrats say they want to fund most of the government through September, but allow for another month to negotiate wall funding by only partially funding the Department of Homeland Security, which is responsible for the wall.

Schumer said Trump conceded that Republicans would lose leverage if they allowed the rest of the government to be funded.

""We asked him to give us one good reason ... why you should continue your shutdown of the eight Cabinet departments while we are debating our differences on homeland security. He could not give a good answer,"" Schumer told reporters after the meeting.

In a tweet on Wednesday evening, Trump called the meeting ""important"" and said he would continue talks with Democrats ""to pass a bill that secures our borders, supports the agents and officers on the ground, and keeps America Safe.""

Trump's demand for $5 billion in funding for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border triggered the shutdown affecting about a quarter of the federal government and 800,000 federal workers.

Before meeting with lawmakers, Trump said the shutdown would last for ""as long as it takes"" as he pushes for wall money as part of any legislation to reopen agencies shuttered when their funding lapsed on Dec. 22.

""It could be a long time,"" Trump told reporters on Wednesday during a Cabinet meeting, ""or it could be quickly.""

""We know that we have a challenge along the border,"" said Kevin McCarthy, the top House Republican. ""We want to solve that issue. We want to make sure we open this government up. And I think at the end of the day, the president, listening to him, he wants to solve this as well.""

Pelosi noted that the legislation being presented in the House had previously won backing in the Senate, which will remain in Republican hands in the new 2019-2020 Congress that convenes on Thursday.

But McConnell said previously that Senate Republicans would not approve a spending measure Trump does not support.

Trump made the border wall a key part of his presidential campaign. Before meeting with the Democrats, Trump called the border a ""sieve,"" rebutted Pelosi's complaint that a wall was immoral, provided an estimate of the U.S. illegal immigrant population far higher than the figures most experts cite and made disputed comments about progress toward building a wall.

The visit by Pelosi and Schumer was their first to the White House since their sharp exchange with Trump in the Oval Office on Dec. 11 during which the president told them he would be ""proud to shut down the government for border security.""

He has since blamed Democrats for the shutdown.

The $5 billion Trump is seeking would cover only a portion of the money needed for a border wall, a project estimated to cost about $23 billion. Trump had said Mexico would pay for the wall, but Mexico has refused.",11
0,"Amid a government shutdown and major winter storms hitting large swaths of the U.S., the number of TSA officers who didn't come to work on Sunday more than doubled compared to that number a year ago.

On Sunday, TSA spokesperson Michael Bilello said 7.7 percent of the agency's employees had an unscheduled absence today, compared with 5.6 percent on Saturday and 3.2 percent a year ago.

A stalemate between President Donald Trump and congressional Democrats over funding for Trump's campaign promise of a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border has created the longest federal government shutdown in history, and forced over 800,000 government employees to go without paychecks.

According to Bilello, 99.9 percent of airline passengers across the U.S. waited less than 30 minutes at their checkpoints.

Official wait time data for Sunday wasn't immediately available.

More than 51,000 airport security screeners are required to work through the government shutdown --despite the agency's inability to provide them their regular pay -- until it secures congressional funding from lawmakers in Washington.

In addition to missing a regular payday, thousands of TSA employees are dealing with winter weather stretching from the Midwest to the East Coast.

Parts of Missouri, Iowa and Illinois received more than a foot of snow by Sunday morning. With at least 10 inches of snow in St. Louis so far, this is the biggest snow storm the city has seen in 5 years.

Five inches of snow in New Jersey and ice-covered roads as far south as North Carolina made for dangerous driving conditions in other parts of the country.

In an apparent effort to raise the spirits of those tasked with keep the country's airports safe, TSA Administrator David Pekoske announced on Friday that his uniformed screening officers would soon receive a one-time bonus of $500 ""in recognition of their hard work during yet another busy holiday travel season, maintaining the highest of security standards during an extraordinary period.""

That extraordinary period has seen an increasing number of airport screeners calling out of work, even before the government shutdown postponed paychecks for the first time on Friday, sparking fears of long lines and staffing shortages as the shutdown continues.

The National Air Traffic Controllers Association is currently suing the Trump administration on behalf of the thousands of controllers that have not been paid during the record-breaking shutdown.

The suit, filed in federal court in Washington, D.C., claims the administration has violated the Fifth Amendment by depriving workers of wages without due process and violated fair labor regulations by not at least paying minimum wage to air traffic controllers and others who are required to work during the government shutdown. The suit also claims the FAA didn't promptly pay overtime to union members, an oversight the union said is also in violation of regulations.

While the shutdown drags on, maintenance, inspection, training and modernization programs have also been deferred.

""While we are doing the day-to-day tasks there's a lot of things that are falling through the cracks,"" Portland International Airport tower controller Richard Kennington told ABC News. ""There's a lot of insidious stuff that the flying public doesn't see that's not happening.""",12

The increasing number of screeners calling out sick at the Transportation Security Administration is impacting its operations at smaller U.S. airports, but the agency's effectiveness to protect the country's flights has not been diminished, a TSA spokesperson told ABC News.

A Southern California TSA official recognized ""adversely impacted security operations"" at Palm Springs International Airport, according to an email obtained by CNN and confirmed to ABC News by TSA.

With a smaller workforce, the increased number of employees calling out sick has put the brunt of the shutdown on smaller airports, TSA spokesperson Jim Gregory acknowledged to ABC News. When employees are calling out across the board, the small teams at airports like Palm Springs feel it first.

But Gregory stressed the country's airports and airlines would not be imperiled by any hit to security operations, citing strict standards and a program that sends screeners and managers from airports under less stressful circumstances to any airport needing backup. Dubbed the ""National Deployment Force,"" TSA has the ability to quickly dispatch more frontline screeners, canine teams and specially trained Homeland Security personnel. They are often used during major events like the Super Bowl or in the wake of natural disasters when hometown TSA employees are unable make it to work.

The email was written Monday by Martin Elam, a deputy federal security director, to all TSA staff at the Palm Springs airport and mentioned ""excessive unscheduled absences recently experienced at PSP,"" and threatened disciplinary action.

""Your unauthorized unscheduled absence will be coded by payroll as absent without leave (AWOL),"" Elam wrote. ""At the conclusion of the government shutdown, an employee's AWOL status may result in progressive disciplinary action.""

TSA spokesperson Michael Bilello on Monday said that 4.6 percent of TSA employees did not show up for work on Monday nationwide, compared to 3.8 percent on the same day in 2018.

Many Democrats spent the day decrying the shutdown and its effect on thousands of federal employees tasked with protecting America's skies and airports.

""There will come a breaking point for many of these individuals and families. Why are we doing this? Why are we pushing them to the point where they've got their minds on their children, and who's going to take care of them, and who's going to pay for day care?"" Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Illinois told reporters at Chicago O'Hare International Airport.

He added that officers continue to serve the country despite not being paid. They are scheduled to miss their first paycheck this Friday unless TSA secures congressional funding.

""I'm not getting paid. I just found out,"" Christine Vitel, a TSA officer at O'Hare said. ""I'm not going to be able to pay my mortgage.""

Donald Evans, a union representative for TSA employees, said, ""They're looking to survive.""

He added, ""They just want a roof over their head, and heat in the winter, and food on their table ... they want to provide for their families.""",13

Just days after claiming that ""many"" furloughed government workers told him they're fine with not getting paid as long as he secures additional funding for a border wall, President Donald Trump tweeted Thursday morning that ""most of the people not getting paid are Democrats.""

Trump, who offered no support for his claim, fired off the tweet early Thursday morning as the government shutdown entered its sixth day. Trump said on Christmas Day that he will not reopen the government until he gets $5 billion in funding for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.

Democrats have said they won't provide Trump with that funding, and indicated they won't go beyond the $1.6 billion that has already been allocated for border wall purposes. Republicans and Democrats reached an agreement last week on a stopgap spending measure to prevent a shutdown -- a deal that the White House signaled Trump would sign. But at the eleventh hour, Trump scuttled the agreement because it did not provide additional funding for a border wall.

Democratic senators responded on Twitter to Trump's early morning comment.

Speaking in the Oval Office on Tuesday, Trump said the U.S. must have ""a wall, a fence, whatever they'd like to call it,"" before claiming that ""many"" furloughed workers want him to keep the government closed until he locks in wall funding.

""Many of those workers have said to me, communicated, 'stay out until you get the funding for the wall,'"" he said.",14
0,"President Donald Trump is hopeful that incoming House Speaker Nancy Pelosi will be more willing to make concessions in shutdown negotiations after she officially becomes House speaker at noon Thursday.

Pelosi will take the helm of a significant Democratic majority in the House of Representatives, ushering in a new era of the Trump presidency. Trump and Democratic lawmakers remain engaged in a high-stakes fight over border wall funding, which has resulted in a partial government shutdown.

The president is demanding $5 billion in border wall funding, but Democratic lawmakers are saying that they will provide no more than $1.6 billion, with the stipulation that none of it can be used to construct a concrete wall.

Pelosi, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Republican leaders met Wednesday with Trump at the White House for another round of negotiations, but to no avail. The ostensible reason for the gathering was a briefing by Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, though a White House official familiar with the meeting told The Daily Caller that the Democratic lawmakers refused to even listen to the briefing.

Both sides emerged from the meeting without any consensus, with Democrats declaring that they will refuse to appropriate a single extra dollar to border wall funding. The end result of the meeting was simply an agreement to reconvene on Friday when Pelosi is officially House speaker. (Related: Trump Refuses To Budge in Shutdown Demand: 'As Long As It Takes')

White House officials believe that Pelosi is in a precarious situation because dozens of her new majority are vehemently opposed to Trump's proposed wall and she needs their votes to secure speakership. These officials say that after Pelosi formally secures her speakership, she can compromise on more divisive issues.

Pelosi, however, is attempting to dispel this notion by publicly stating multiple times that Democrats will not compromise on wall funding. When asked by NBC on Thursday morning if Democrats would compromise on giving more money for the wall, Pelosi flatly replied, ""No."" Schumer has similarly said that no compromise will occur.

Trump, ahead of the meeting, drew his own line in the sand, telling reporters at his cabinet meeting that he would not accept anything lower than $5.6 billion in funding and that he was willing to let the shutdown continue for ""as long as it takes.""

The president blamed much of the Democratic intransigence on the 2020 presidential campaign, saying later on Twitter:

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell struck the least optimistic note of all parties involved, telling reporters after the Thursday meeting that the shutdown could last for ""weeks.""",15
0,"On their first day as majority leaders the Democrats have passed a plan to end the partial US government shutdown without funding Donald Trump's border wall.

The President is demanding billions of dollars to build a wall along the US border with Mexico, which the Democrats have so far refused.

The disagreement has led to a partial shutdown of the federal government which started on 22 December and has so far affected 800,000 federal workers.

Mr Trump has withheld his support for any new funding package until he secures $5 billion to start building the wall along the US-Mexico border that he promised during his campaign.

Such a wall, he has argued, is needed to stem the flow of illegal immigrants and drugs over the southwestern border.

When he ran for president in 2016, he vowed Mexico would pay for the wall, which it has refused to do.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Mr Trump and Senate Republicans should ""take yes for an answer"" and approve the border bill to completely end the shutdown.

When asked if she would give Mr Trump one dollar for a wall to reopen the government, Ms Pelosi said: ""One dollar? Yes, one dollar. The fact is a wall is an immorality. It's not who we are as a nation.""

Ms Pelosi, who was elected speaker earlier on 3 January, also took a shot at Mr Trump, calling his proposal ""a wall between reality and his constituents"".

The largely party-line votes came after Mr Trump made a surprise appearance at the White House briefing room pledging to keep up the fight for his signature campaign promise.

Reporters were told that White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders would be holding a late afternoon briefing on 3 January.

Instead, out walked Mr Trump, flanked by members of the unions that represent border patrol and immigration enforcement agents.

It was his first time delivering remarks at the briefing room podium.

""You can call it a barrier, you can call it whatever you want,"" Mr Trump said.

""But essentially we need protection in our country. We're going to make it good. The people of our country want it.""

Mr Trump said his meeting with the union officials had long been planned and just happened to come at ""a very opportune time"".

He also claimed his refusal to budge was winning praise, telling reporters, ""I have never had so much support as I have in the last week over my stance for border security.""

He then left without taking questions from reporters.

The Democratic legislation to re-open the government without funding the wall is going nowhere in the Senate, where Republicans want Mr Trump's endorsement before voting on a funding package.

Congressional leaders from both parties met with Mr Trump at the White House on 2 January, but failed to make progress during their first sit-down in weeks.

The White House has invited the leaders back on Friday for another round of talks that officials have suggested might be more successful now that Ms Pelosi has been sworn in.

US President Donald Trump and congressional leaders including new Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi have gathered at the White House for the second time this week as the US shutdown hits the two-week mark.

Emerging after more than two hours of talks, Mr Trump said he had designated a team that would meet over the weekend with politicians to resolve the standoff over his demand for a border wall.

About 800,000 federal workers have been affected by the December 22 closure of about one-quarter of the Federal Government, as Mr Trump withheld his support for new funding until he secures $US5 billion ($7.14 billion) to start building the wall along the US-Mexico border that he promised during his campaign.

Such a wall, he has argued, is needed to stem the flow of illegal immigrants and drugs over the southwestern border.

Before the meeting, Mr Trump sent a letter to Congress to try to gain their support for his wall, suggesting he was unlikely to budge on his funding demands.

""Walls work. That's why rich, powerful and successful people build them around their homes,"" Mr Trump wrote in his letter.

Mr Trump reportedly told congressional leaders he would keep the Government closed ""for a very long period of time, months or even years"" at the White House gathering.

That is according to Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer, who was among those meeting with the President.

Mr Schumer said his party's leaders ""told the President we needed the Government open -- he resisted"".

Ms Pelosi called it a ""lengthy and sometimes contentious"" meeting.

""We cannot resolve this until we open up Government,"" she said.

Mr Trump addressed the public from the White House rose garden following the gathering.

Before the meeting, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders told reporters that while Mr Trump was ready to negotiate, his primary goal was keeping Americans safe with a border wall.

""We have a national crisis at our border. We also have a humanitarian crisis at our border. And the President's not going to back off,"" Ms Sanders said at the White House press briefing.

""The people that elected Nancy Pelosi didn't elect her to come up here and do nothing and didn't elect her to play political games. They elected her to find real solutions ... so, we're hopeful that she as Speaker will do that.""

Ahead of the meeting, Ms Pelosi sought to separate the issue of the wall and Government funding, and called on Mr Trump and his fellow Republicans in the Senate to reopen agencies as border talks continue.

""The wall and the Government shutdown really have nothing to do with each other,"" said Ms Pelosi, who has rejected any funding for what she has called an ""immoral"" border wall.

Senate Democratic Party Leader Chuck Schumer said that if Senate Republicans continued to stay on the sidelines, that ""Trump can keep the Government shutdown for a long time.""

""The President needs an intervention,"" Mr Schumer said.

""And Senate Republicans are just the right ones to intervene.""

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said that even though the new Congress had convened with the Democrats holding a majority in the House of Representative, ""the basic steps that are needed to end this unfortunate standoff really haven't changed at all"".

Earlier, Mr Trump responded to rumblings of a move by Democrats to impeach him, tweeting that he was too successful and popular to be impeached.

""How do you impeach a president who ... had the most successful first two years of any president, and is the most popular Republican in party history,"" Mr Trump tweeted.

""They only want to impeach me because they know they can't win in 2020, too much success!""

House Speaker Ms Pelosi has been cautious about whether her new Democratic majority would ever impeach Mr Trump, but at least two of her members are ready to move forward.

California Representative Brad Sherman and Texas Representative Al Green introduced articles of impeachment against Mr Trump on Thursday, the first day of the new Congress.

Mr Sherman and Mr Green pushed to impeach Mr Trump in 2017 and 2018 but the House blocked those resolutions twice, with the help of Democrats who said the effort was premature.

Ms Pelosi has not ruled out impeachment but has called it a ""divisive activity"" that needs support from both parties.

Trump turned to the bully pulpit on the first work day of the new year with a stream of tweets and an extended televised cabinet meeting to press his case for funding the construction of a wall along the US-Mexico border. Later, he and top congressional leaders met for what was billed as a briefing on border security issues in the Situation Room at the White House.

Democrats, who take over the majority in the House this week were unmoved.

The White House meeting quickly devolved into political posturing. Democrat Nancy Pelosi, who's poised to be elected House speaker, said the chamber will vote on two measures to reopen government that mirror legislation that the Senate had already passed with Republican support only to be rejected by Trump. Republicam Senate majority meader Mitch McConnell said the shutdown could last weeks.

* Wall negotiations devolve into on-camera shouting match between Trump, Pelosi and Schumer

Trump invited the lawmakers to return on Friday to the White House following Thursday's congressional leadership elections. It's unclear whether the Democrats will accept his offer, although he sounded somewhat conciliatory in tweets: ""I remain ready and willing to work with Democrats to pass a bill that secures our borders, supports the agents and officers on the ground, and keeps America Safe. Let's get it done!""

Republicans sought to insinuate that Pelosi was struggling to shore up support within her ranks for her leadership bid.

But Pelosi and Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer instead signalled they saw a political opportunity to gain further leverage against the White House. The legislation they plan to pass would reopen the affected government departments, provide US$1.3 billion for border security on a pro-rated basis and give time for further negotiations on the issue. The measure would fund the Department of Homeland Security only until February 8, and wouldn't include money for the construction of the border wall.

That's not enough for Trump, and Democrats will cast the president as holding federal workers as hostage for the wall.

That approach - and the underlying intransigence - has been made easier by a president who has misplayed his hand repeatedly during negotiations.

Trump's most severe misstep was self-inflicted. In a meeting with Pelosi and Schumer last month, he defiantly boasted that he would be ""proud"" to ""take the mantle"" of shutting the government down if he didn't get the more than US$5 billion he was seeking for building the wall.

That would cause political trouble for even the most popular of politicians -- and poses a particular hazard for one whose approval rating regularly hit historic lows even before the latest personnel turnovers at the White House and market swings fuelled by ongoing trade disputes.

""The president said, 'I am going to shut the government down,'"" Schumer remarked. ""They are now feeling the heat. It is not helping the president, it is not helping the Republicans, to be the owners of this shutdown.""

Trump also hasn't cultivated an image as a person ready to seek common ground. On Wednesday, he said he wasn't willing to budge on his wall funding demand. He also appeared to rule out a broader compromise that could offer protected status for undocumented immigrants brought to the country as children.

""As long as it takes,"" Trump said when asked how long he would hold out. ""Look, I'm prepared -- I think the people of the country think I'm right.""

Fifty-seven per cent of Americans wanted Trump to compromise on the wall before the shutdown, and nearly seven in 10 said the wall wasn't an immediate priority, according to an NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll published December 11.

Democrats haven't offered even cursory concessions as the consequences of the funding lapse are rapidly intensifying, underscoring how little ground Trump has earned as the shutdown has progressed.

But Pelosi is facing pressures of her own as newly elected progressives aim to take the Democratic Party further to the left. Incoming House Democrat Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York said she would vote against a package of legislative rules that had been negotiated by Pelosi. California Democrat Ro Khanna said he'll also oppose the measure, which contains an austerity provision demanded by centrists.

Trump's unequivocal embrace of responsibility for the shutdown has helped deflect other news - such as the fatal shooting of a California police officer, allegedly by an undocumented immigrant, or Pelosi's vacation at a Hawaiian resort as hundreds of thousands of federal workers worried about their pay - that may have eroded the Democrats' political standing.

Some of the president's allies have not helped his cause. His outgoing chief of staff, John Kelly, said the president had already retreated from his initial plans for a ""solid concrete wall"" early in the administration.

Others in the Senate, including Lindsey Graham and Lamar Alexander, have said Trump must seek compromise to end the shutdown. McConnell has laid the issue at Trump's feet by saying the upper chamber will adopt legislation - including bills that passed late last year - only if they have White House support.

McConnell's position has kept Trump from having to issue the first presidential veto of his term, but otherwise has offered him little political cover.

""I don't think any particular progress was made today,"" McConnell said after the Wednesday meeting at the White House. ""We're hopeful that somehow in the coming days or weeks we will be able to reach an agreement.""

But for Trump, the set of options seems to have diminished.

If he accepts a funding deal from Democrats that offers little or no money for new wall construction, he risks alienating a base that has provided a steady line of support and undermining his self-proclaimed status as a master negotiator.

Allowing the shutdown to drag along carries risks as well. While Trump can continue to elevate immigration as a potent political wedge, a prolonged shutdown could add uncertainty to already volatile markets as federal workers and contractors begin missing paychecks and invoices.

Yet with Democrats showing little inclination to budge as the shutdown stretches into its third week, Trump posed the key question to himself rhetorically as he met with his Cabinet. ""Well, I'd rather not say it - could we do it for a little bit less?"" Trump said.",20

President Donald Trump will take the national stage tonight to make his case for the construction of a wall at the US-Mexico border. But experts say such an enormous construction project would have significant impacts on the environment around the nation's southern border.

His live address from the Oval Office comes 18 days into a partial government shutdown, which is the result of a disagreement over funding for Trump's desired border wall. The shutdown has impacted nearly 800,000 federal employees (and caused garbage to pile up in national parks), but Trump has indicated that he won't end the shutdown until he secures $5 billion in funding for the wall.

Trump most likely hopes that his national address and visit to the southwest will boost public support for a wall -- despite the environmental impact.

What's more, the Department of Homeland Security has already indicated that it will leverage a law that enables the government to expedite border infrastructure by waiving certain legal requirements, which would allow the project to sidestep dozens of environmental rules in California.",21

US President Donald Trump said he intends to keep the federal government closed until he secures the desired funding from Congress for his promised border wall, and he cast doubt about the performance of Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome H Powell after a sharp downturn in US stock markets.

In an Oval Office appearance on Christmas morning, Trump praised Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin despite the stock markets suffering their steepest Christmas Eve decline in decades but was more circumspect about his handpicked Fed chair.

""Well, we'll see,"" Trump said when a journalist asked whether he had confidence in Powell. ""They're raising interest rates too fast, that's my opinion. But I certainly have confidence. But I think it'll straighten. They're raising interest rates too fast because they think the economy is so good. But I think that they will get it pretty soon, I really do.""

As for whether he has confidence in Mnuchin, whose Sunday calls to reassure major bank executives rattled investors and may have exacerbated Monday's sell-off, Trump told reporters, ""Yes, I do. Very talented guy, very smart person.""

Trump made his comments during a Christmas photo op in the Oval Office, where he spoke by video teleconference with service members from all five branches of the armed forces who are stationed in Alaska, Bahrain, Guam and Qatar.

About 25 per cent of the government is shut down for the fourth straight day with Congress at a stalemate over Trump's demand for US$5 billion ($7.4b) in wall construction money.

""I can't tell you when the government is going to reopen,"" he said. ""I can tell you it's not going to be open until we have a wall, a fence, whatever they'd like to call it. I'll call it whatever they want. But it's all the same thing. It's a barrier from people pouring into our country.""

The president defended his plan to construct a wall along the border with Mexico that he insisted only an Olympic athlete would be able to scale. ""If you don't have that, then we're just not opening,"" Trump said.

All told, about 800,000 of 2.1 million federal workers nationwide - or more than a third - are estimated to be affected in some way by the shutdown. Trump claimed that many of them support the shutdown.

""Many of those workers have said to me, communicated - stay out until you get the funding for the wall,"" Trump said. ""These federal workers want the wall.""

But his claim conflicts with the accounts of federal workers' union leaders.

""Federal employees should not have to pay the personal price for all of this dysfunction,"" said Tony Reardon, president of the National Treasury Employees Union, which represents 150,000 members at 33 federal agencies and departments. ""This shutdown is a travesty. Congress and the White House have not done their fundamental jobs of keeping the government open.""

In a survey of 1500 union members, about 85 per cent said they have limited holiday season spending or are planning to do so because of uncertainty about income, Reardon said on Christmas Eve. He said they include one who said ""I have recently lost my wife and now . . .. I have to put off buying her headstone. Breaks my heart.""

Another responded, ""I can't buy any Christmas presents and am considering returning those I already have. Mortgage companies and utility companies won't wait to get paid,"" according to Reardon.

The government shutdown comes near the end of what will probably be the worst year for the US stock market since the financial crisis a decade ago. Many sectors are now technically in a ""bear market,"" down more than 20 per cent.

Before the recent reversal in the stock market, which began during the fall, Trump had frequently boasted that stocks were soaring during his tenure, claiming credit for the upswing.

The downturn has caused great uncertainty in the White House as Trump has sought someone to blame, and he has lashed out publicly at Powell. On Saturday, several news outlets reported that Trump was looking for ways to potentially fire Powell. That spurred Mnuchin to release a statement on Trump's behalf that the president did not believe he had the ""right"" to fire Powell.

Many economists and analysts on Wall Street say that an attempt to fire the Fed chief would send markets in a tailspin amid uncertainty over the stability of the US central bank, the most important institution in shaping US and global markets.

Trump is angry that Powell is continuing the Fed's long-telegraphed plan to raise its benchmark interest rate and scale back other extraordinary measures intended to support the economy. The Fed's benchmark rate is now 2.25 to 2.5 per cent, higher than the near-zero interest rate the Fed had pursued for years but still historically low.

Trump complains that his predecessor Barack Obama benefited from lower interest rates, spurring economic growth. Others point out that the Fed, which operates independently of the White House, had pursued a low-interest-rate policy because the economy was much weaker than it is today.

""They are raising interest rates too fast, that's my opinion,"" Trump said Tuesday. ""President Obama didn't do much of that . . . He had a very low interest rate.""

Powell was Mnuchin's recommendation when Trump was seeking a new Fed chair a year ago, and some close to Trump have questioned whether the president will begin to blame the treasury secretary, too, for the sell-off. But on Tuesday he praised Mnuchin, a longtime friend and finance chairman of his 2016 campaign.

Again on Tuesday, Trump tried to place blame for Washington's budget stalemate solely on Democrats, portraying their leaders as disingenuous and claiming that they support the notion of a physical barrier along the border and object to building the wall only because it is Trump's idea.

Trump likened the situation to his May 2017 firing of James Comey as FBI director, saying ""Democrats hated him"" until he was fired and then Comey was treated as a hero.

Even as he vowed to keep the government closed to secure wall funding, Trump claimed that much of his envisioned wall was already being built. He said he had awarded a contract ""at a great price"" for a 185-kilometre section of wall in Texas and plans to visit the site in January for ""a ground-breaking"" ceremony.

Administration officials have provided no details about this construction project or the terms of the contract.

Trump said he hopes to have all portions of the wall completed - either old fencing renovated or new construction - by Election Day 2020, an indication that he sees building the wall chiefly as a political issue tied to his reelection chances.

Trump said Tuesday that the wall as he envisions it would be a fortress that no normal human could breach.

""Now there may be the case of an Olympic champion who can get over the wall, but for the most part you are not able to do it,"" he said. ""Very high. It's gonna be 30 feet. Much of it is 30 feet high. Some if it's low. But in some areas we have it as high as 30 feet. That's like a three-story building.""

Trump turned to the bully pulpit on the first work day of the new year with a stream of tweets and an extended televised cabinet meeting to press his case for funding the construction of a wall along the US-Mexico border. Later, he and top congressional leaders met for what was billed as a briefing on border security issues in the Situation Room at the White House.

Democrats, who take over the majority in the House this week were unmoved.

The White House meeting quickly devolved into political posturing. Democrat Nancy Pelosi, who's poised to be elected House speaker, said the chamber will vote on two measures to reopen government that mirror legislation that the Senate had already passed with Republican support only to be rejected by Trump. Republicam Senate majority meader Mitch McConnell said the shutdown could last weeks.

Trump invited the lawmakers to return on Friday to the White House following Thursday's congressional leadership elections. It's unclear whether the Democrats will accept his offer, although he sounded somewhat conciliatory in tweets: ""I remain ready and willing to work with Democrats to pass a bill that secures our borders, supports the agents and officers on the ground, and keeps America Safe.

Washington is experiencing a massive shake-up on Thursday as Democrats take over the House and Republicans beef up their Senate majority. But one thing is showing no signs of change: A government shutdown dragging into its 13th day.

Speaker-to-be Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) is set to pass a package of government funding bills on Thursday afternoon aimed at reopening the quarter of the government that's closed and shirking President Donald Trump's border wall. But Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) says he won't take up the proposals -- or anything at all without Trump's approval.

A government shutdown has never in recent history dragged on from one Congress to another, but like so many things under Trump's presidency this conflict is one without precedent.

The sharp impasse comes after a bipartisan meeting with the president on Wednesday aimed to restarting moribund negotiations. But Trump dismissed Pelosi's plan and said he would look ""foolish"" for reopening government departments unrelated to the immigration dispute, leaving the new divided Congress opening in a state of remarkable gridlock.

""We want the president to open up the government. We are giving him a Republican path to do that, why would he not do it?"" Pelosi implored the president after the meeting.

But McConnell raised the prospect that the shutdown could drag on for ""weeks"" and dismissed Pelosi's bill as political theater, even though Senate Republicans supported a stopgap bill with no increase in wall funding as recently as December.

""Will these new Democrats come to Washington ready to roll up their sleeves, work together and make laws? Or are they going to waste time on partisan show votes that will do nothing to move the country forward?"" McConnell said on Wednesday night. ""Let me make this perfectly clear: The Senate will not waste its time considering a Democrat bill which cannot pass this chamber and which the president will not sign.""

With the two top congressional leaders already feuding, the sides have at least tentatively agreed to continue talking. Members of Congress have been invited to another meeting at the White House on Friday, and the president said after Wednesday's unsuccessful meeting that he is ""ready and willing to work with Democrats to pass a bill that secures our borders.""

Republicans have surmised that Pelosi may be more willing to deal with Trump after winning her speakership election on Thursday, yet Democrats seem to have little interest in ceding ground to the president. Some liberals are urging the Democratic leaders to give Trump no money for a border barrier, and Schumer and Pelosi have settled at $1.3 billion for fencing, which means no increase from current funding levels.

""If the Republicans and Trump want to reject that, then the ball is in their court to come up with something they think would fly. There is no appetite on the Democratic side of the aisle to fund a wall that is symbolic at best and largely political for his base,"" said Rep. Gerry Connolly (D-Va.).

The president is moving in another direction, panning a compromise that Vice President Mike Pence floated to Schumer of about half the $5 billion that the president has been seeking. Trump is still advocating for the $5.6 billion in funding passed by the Republican House in the lame duck, a piece of legislation which officially dies at noon Thursday when the House GOP majority fades away.",25

U.S. President Donald Trump's budget director and chief of staff on Sunday said the partial U.S. government shutdown could continue to January 3, when the new Congress convenes and Democrats take over the House of Representatives.

""It's very possible this shutdown will go beyond the 28th and into the new Congress,"" Mick Mulvaney said on Fox News Sunday.

""I don't think things are going to move very quickly here for the next few days"" because of the Christmas holiday, added Mulvaney, who serves as director of the Office of Management and Budget and was named acting White House chief of staff 10 days ago.

The U.S. Senate adjourned on Saturday unable to break an impasse over Trump's demand for more funds for a wall on the border with Mexico that Democrats are unwilling to accept.

Mulvaney said the White House made a ""counteroffer"" to Democrats on funding for border security that falls between the Democratic offer of $1.3 billion and Trump's demand for $5 billion.

As part of those talks on Saturday, Vice President Mike Pence offered to drop the demand for $5 billion for a border wall, substituting instead $2.1 billion, ABC News reported citing unnamed sources.

Mulvaney sought to shift blame for the partial shutdown to Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic nominee for speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, saying she might hold up negotiations to ensure she secures the position.

""I think she's in that unfortunate position of being beholden to her left wing to where she cannot be seen as agreeing with the president on anything until after she is speaker,"" Mulvaney said. ""If that's the case, again, there's a chance we go into the next Congress.""

Financing for about a quarter of federal government programs - including the departments of Homeland Security, Justice and Agriculture - expired at midnight on Friday and will not be renewed until a deal is done.

Federal parks were to close and more than 400,000 federal ""essential"" employees in those agencies will work without pay until the dispute is resolved. Another 380,000 will be ""furloughed"", meaning they are put on temporary leave.

Law enforcement efforts, border patrols, mail delivery and airport operations will keep running.

Building a wall to keep migrants from entering the United States illegally was a central plank of Trump's presidential campaign, but Democrats are vehemently opposed and have rejected his funding request.

Trump reiterated his push for border security on Sunday, saying on Twitter that ""the only way"" to stop drugs, gangs, and human trafficking at the border was with a wall or barrier.

""Drones and all of the rest are wonderful and lots of fun, but it is only a good old fashioned Wall that works!,"" the president said in the tweet.

Earlier in the week, leaders in both the Senate and House of Representatives thought they had reached a deal that Trump would sign that contained less money for border security, only to watch the president, under pressure from conservatives, re-assert his demand for $5 billion at the last minute.

Senator David Perdue, a Republican from Georgia on the Senate Banking Committee, said on Fox News' ""Sunday Morning Futures"" that he thought a deal this week was possible.

""I spoke to the President last night, he wants that,"" Purdue said, adding ""I'm hopeful that cooler heads will prevail and we'll get to some number between $1.6 (billion) and $5 billion on that.""

Pelosi, a Democratic representative from California, was asked on NBC's Today show if she would give Trump some of the $5 billion he is demanding to build the wall. ""No, nothing for the wall,"" Pelosi said. ""We're talking about border security. We can go through this back-and-forth. No. How many more times can we say no? No -- nothing for the wall.""

Before the shutdown began on December 22, Trump said during a testy meeting with Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, the Democratic senator for New York, that he would take responsibility for any federal government stoppage. Trump said at the meeting he would be ""proud to shut down the government for border security.""

Since then, the president has sought to blame the Democrats for the shutdown because they will not agree to a budget that includes any of the $5 billion of funding Trump is demanding for his border wall, which he claims will stop undocumented migrants crossing into the U.S.

Democrats will once again be the majority in the House of Representatives on Thursday when the new batch of Congresspeople are sworn in following the midterm elections in November. They plan to pass legislation to fund the federal departments currently shut down.

While they refuse to explicitly fund the wall, they have shown willingness to give an extra $1.6 billion to border security. However, Trump and the Republicans want more -- and specifically for the wall's construction, not just border security.

""We asked the president to support the bills that we support that will open up government,"" Schumer told reporters after a meeting at the White House on Wednesday, CBS News reported.

""We asked him to give us one good reason -- I asked him directly, I said 'Mr. President give me one good reason why you should continue your shutdown of the eight cabinet departments while we are debating our differences on homeland security.' He could not give a good answer,"" said Schumer.

Republicans control the Senate, which must also approve the budget. Though the House has flipped back to the Democrats, the Republicans increased their majority in the Senate after the midterms.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell called the House Democrats' budget plan a ""nonstarter"" and urged them to get ""serious"" if they want to end the current deadlock.

""It's exactly the kind of proposal you'd expect if the incoming House Democrats are choosing to stage a political sideshow rather than doing the hard work of helping govern the country. In other words a total nonstarter,"" McConnell told the Senate, The Hill reported.

President Trump tweeted that Congressional leaders had an ""important"" meeting on border security, though there was little sign of an end to the shutdown.

""Both parties must work together to pass a Funding Bill that protects this Nation and its people-this is the first and most important duty of government,"" Trump wrote on Twitter. ""I remain ready and willing to work with Democrats to pass a bill that secures our borders, supports the agents and officers on the ground, and keeps America Safe. Let's get it done!""

The president later added: ""Sadly, there can be no REAL Border Security without the Wall!""

He also said at a meeting with his cabinet that he is content for the shutdown to continue for ""as long as it takes"" because he believes ""the people of this country think I'm right.""",28
0,"WASHINGTON, Jan 4 (Reuters) - As a partial U.S. government

shutdown hit the two-week mark, President Donald Trump and

congressional leaders were scheduled on Friday to discuss ways to break an impasse pitting his demand for building a border wall against Democrats' call for alternative security measures.

About 800,000 federal workers have been affected by the Dec. 22 closure of about one-quarter of the federal government as Trump withheld his support for new funding until he secures $5 billion to start building the wall along the U.S.-Mexico border that he promised during his campaign.

Such a wall, he has argued, is needed to stem the flow of illegal immigrants and drugs over the southwestern border. When he ran for president in 2016, he vowed Mexico would pay for the wall, which it has refused to do.

On Thursday, Trump tried to keep the pressure on Democrats, even as they gained significant new power with their takeover of the House of Representatives at the start of a new Congress.

""Build the Wall,"" the Republican president demanded on Twitter. In remarks to reporters that same day, Trump said: ""You can call it a barrier. You can call it whatever you want. But essentially, we need protection in our country.""

As Trump dug in, so did opposition Democrats, leaving many to wonder just how much progress might be made during Friday's White House meeting scheduled for 11:30 a.m. (1630 GMT).

""We're not doing a wall,"" Democrat Nancy Pelosi said late on Thursday, several hours after she was sworn in as the new speaker of the House of Representatives.

""It has nothing to do with politics. It has to do with a wall is an immorality between countries. It's an old way of thinking. It isn't cost effective,"" Pelosi added.

Late on Thursday, the House passed two Democratic bills to immediately reopen government agencies for varying lengths of time, despite a White House veto threat. Earlier in the day, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican, labeled the House effort ""political theater, not productive lawmaking,"" even though the Senate last month approved identical legislation.

AGENCIES HOBBLED

Democratic Representative Lucille Roybal-Allard, speaking to reporters late on Thursday, argued that funding a border wall, which ultimately could cost more than $24 billion, would hamper other, more important national security protections.

She noted that more federal law enforcement agents were needed to intercept illegal opioids and other ""contraband"" moving through U.S. ports of entry. She added more money was needed for the Coast Guard to beef up the U.S. presence in the Arctic at a time when Russia and China increasingly were on the prowl for that region's natural resources.

Without a deal to end the partial government shutdown, the Department of Homeland Security will not be able to bring some furloughed workers back to their jobs while others continue to be forced to work without paychecks for the time being.

An array of other federal agencies are similarly hobbled, including the Justice Department, Commerce Department and departments of Agriculture, Labor, Interior and Treasury.

Visitors to Smithsonian museums, among Washington's most popular tourist attractions, were being turned away during the shutdown, as were visitors to many of the nation's federal parks.

WASHINGTON, Jan 4 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump and senior Democrats failed to strike a deal in talks on Friday to end a partial shutdown of the U.S. government as they again fought over Trump's request for over $5 billion to fund his signature wall on the Mexican border.

After Democratic congressional leaders turned Trump down at a meeting in the White House Situation Room, the Republican president threatened to take the controversial step of using emergency powers to build the wall without approval from Congress.

Trump is withholding his support for a bill that would fully fund the government until he secures the money for the wall. As a result around 800,000 public workers have been unpaid, with about a quarter of the federal government closed for two weeks.

Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said Democrats had told Trump during the meeting to end the shutdown. ""He resisted,"" Schumer said. ""In fact, he said he'd keep the government closed for a very long period of time, months or even years.""

Trump confirmed that comment but painted a more positive picture of the meeting, the first since a new era of divided government began when Democrats took control of the House of Representatives on Thursday.

""We had a very, very productive meeting, and we've come a long way,"" Trump said.

According to a source familiar with the White House discussion, Trump opened the meeting with a speech that lasted at least 15 minutes in which he insisted on the need for $5.6 billion for a border wall.

The source also said Trump brought up recent impeachment threats during those remarks, arguing that he had notched a strong performance as president and should not be a target for impeachment.

NATIONAL EMERGENCY?

Raising the stakes in his tussle with the newly emboldened Democrats, Trump threatened extraordinary measures to build the wall, which he says is needed to stem the flow of illegal immigrants and drugs into the United States.

Asked by a reporter whether he had considered declaring a national emergency to build the wall, Trump said: ""Yes, I have ... I may do it ... we can call a national emergency and build it very quickly.""

He said he could declare a national emergency ""because of the security of our country, absolutely.""

Senator Jack Reed, the senior Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, criticized the comments, saying in a statement, ""Declaring a trumped up national emergency in order to skirt congressional approval is wrong.""

The U.S. Constitution assigns Congress the power over funding the federal government so Trump likely would face legal challenges if he tried to bypass Congress on financing the wall. Building a wall - and having Mexico pay for it - was one of Trump's main promises when he ran for president in 2016.

Trump's wall project is estimated to cost about $23 billion.

Democrats have called the wall immoral, ineffective and medieval.

Nancy Pelosi, the newly elected Democratic speaker of the House, said Friday's meeting with Trump was ""sometimes contentious"" but that they agreed to continue talking.

""But we recognize on the Democratic side that we really cannot resolve this until we open up government and we made that very clear to the president,"" she said.

Credit rating agency Moody's says the shutdown will cause minimal U.S. economic and credit market disruption but there could be a more severe impact on financial markets and the broad economy if the closure is protracted.

A Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll last week showed that 50 percent of the public blame Trump for the shutdown and 7 percent blame Republican lawmakers, while 32 percent blame Democrats.

In a Dec. 11 meeting with Pelosi and Schumer, Trump said he would be ""proud"" to shut the government over the security issue and would not blame Democrats. He has since said they are responsible.

Administration officials and congressional staffers are set to meet on Saturday to try to end the impasse, the White House said.

House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy told reporters that Trump had named Vice President Mike Pence, senior aide Jared Kushner and Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen to work over the weekend.

The partial shutdown is straining the country's immigration system, worsening backlogs in courts and complicating hiring for employers.

Federal agencies such as the Justice Department, Commerce Department and departments of Agriculture, Labor, Interior and Treasury have been hit by the shutdown.

House Ways and Means Committee chairman Richard Neal, a Democrat, asked the Internal Revenue Service in a letter on Friday to explain the possible effects of the shutdown on the upcoming tax filing season for millions of Americans.

* Pelosi: wall and shutdown aren't related (Adds shutdown details)

WASHINGTON, Jan 4 (Reuters) - President Donald Trump and congressional leaders were entrenched ahead of a meeting on Friday to try to end a partial U.S. government shutdown over his demand for $5 billion to build a wall on the border with Mexico.

About 800,000 federal workers have been unpaid due to the 2-week-old closure of about a quarter of the federal government as Trump withholds his support for new funding until he secures the money for the wall that he promised to construct during his election campaign.

The wall, Trump has argued, is needed to stem the flow of illegal immigrants and drugs over the border. When he ran for president in 2016, Trump vowed Mexico would pay for the wall, which it has refused to do.

It remained unclear how much progress might be made during Friday's meeting, which was scheduled for 11:30 a.m. EST (1630 GMT) in the White House Situation Room.

It will be the first showdown between Trump and Democrats since they took over the U.S. House of Representatives on Thursday after victories in last November's elections.

""The president isn't going to back off,"" White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders told reporters on Friday morning.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi sought to separate the issue of the wall and government funding, and called on Trump and his fellow Republicans in the Senate to reopen agencies as border talks continue.

""The wall and the government shutdown really have nothing to do with each other,"" Pelosi, who has rejected any funding for what she has called an ""immoral"" border wall, said at an event hosted by MSNBC.

Steny Hoyer, the No. 2 House Democrat, said Democratic congressional leaders hoped to resolve the shutdown at the meeting. ""I hope we will open up government,"" he told MSNBC in a separate interview.

About 800,000 federal employees have either been furloughed or are working without pay because of the shutdown.

It is showing signs of straining the country's immigration system and has been blamed for worsening backlogs in courts and complicating hiring for employers.

Trump continued to promote the wall in tweets to keep the pressure on Democrats on Thursday even as they gained significant power with their takeover of the House at the start of a new Congress.

PRESSURE ON MCCONNELL

Late on Thursday, the House passed two Democratic bills to immediately reopen government agencies for varying lengths of time, despite a White House veto threat.

Earlier in the day, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican, rejected the House effort saying the president would not sign into law, although the Senate last month approved identical legislation.

But McConnell faces increasing pressure from within his caucus, especially from vulnerable Republicans up for re-election in 2020.

""We should pass a continuing resolution to get the government back open. The Senate has done it last Congress, we should do it again today,"" U.S. Senator Cory Gardner told The Hill on Thursday.

His colleague Susan Collins also called for the Senate to pass the funding bills, while several other Republicans urged an end to the shutdown, the Hill and New York Times reported.

Pelosi on Friday urged McConnell to bring the measures up for a vote. ""The president can sign or not but he should never say, 'I'm not even going to put it on the president's desk,""' she told MSNBC, noting Congress can pass bills without Trump's support.

Legislation can become law with a veto-proof majority of lawmakers' support or if the president does not sign it or veto it within 10 days.

Vice President Mike Pence, in a television interview Thursday night, suggested that in exchange for the wall, the White House could work with Democrats on so-called Dreamer immigrants who were brought to the United States illegally as children - an idea Trump had rejected on Wednesday.

""It's being talked about,"" Pence told Fox News.

Democrats back other border security measures aside from the wall, and their two-bill package passed Thursday includes $1.3 billion for border fencing and $300 million for other border security items such as technology and cameras.

In a Dec. 11 meeting with Pelosi and Democratic Senate Leader Chuck Schumer, Trump said he would be ""proud"" to shut the government over the security issue and would not blame Democrats. He has since said they are responsible.

WASHINGTON, Jan 4 (Reuters) - The two top congressional Democrats emerged from a White House meeting on Friday offering no sign of progress toward a deal with President Donald Trump to fully re-open the government, with one claiming Trump threatened to keep it shut for ""months or even years"" as he held out for funding for a border wall.

With the partial shutdown now two weeks old, the two sides held a sometimes contentious meeting in the White House about the shutdown, said House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat.

About 800,000 federal workers have been unpaid due to the closure of about a quarter of the federal government as Trump withholds his support for a bill which would fund the government until he secures the money for the wall that he promised during his election campaign.

""We just completed a lengthy and sometimes contentious conversation with the president,"" Pelosi told reporters. ""We agreed that we would continue our conversations. But we recognize on the Democratic side that we really cannot resolve this until we open up government and we made that very clear to the president.""

""We told the president we needed the government open,"" said Democratic Senate Leader Chuck Schumer. ""He resisted. In fact, he said he'd keep the government closed for a very long period of time, months or even years.""

Trump, who wants $5 billion in funding for the wall, has said it is needed to stem the flow of illegal immigrants and drugs over the border. When he ran for president in 2016, Trump vowed Mexico would pay for the wall, which it has refused to do.

0,"WASHINGTON: U.S. President Donald Trump's budget director and chief of staff on Sunday said the partial U.S. government shutdown could continue to Jan. 3, when the new Congress convenes and Democrats take over the House of Representatives.

""It's very possible this shutdown will go beyond (December) the 28th and into the new Congress,"" Mick Mulvaney said on Fox News Sunday.

""I don't think things are going to move very quickly here for the next few days"" because of the Christmas holiday, added Mulvaney, who serves as director of the Office of Management and Budget and was named acting White House chief of staff 10 days ago.

The U.S. Senate adjourned on Saturday, unable to break an impasse over Trump's demand for more funds for a wall on the border with Mexico that Democrats are unwilling to accept.

Mulvaney said the White House made a ""counter-offer"" to Democrats on funding for border security that fell between the Democratic offer of US$1.3 billion and Trump's demand for US$5 billion.

As part of those talks on Saturday, Vice President Mike Pence offered to drop the demand for US$5 billion for a border wall, substituting instead US$2.1 billion, ABC News reported, citing unnamed sources.

A Democratic source familiar with the negotiations said real discussions have been happening between Democratic lawmakers and Republican Senator Richard Shelby, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, who has been talking to the White House. It was unclear what Democrats had offered.

Mulvaney sought to shift blame for the partial shutdown to Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic nominee for speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, saying she might hold up negotiations to ensure she secures the position.

""I think she's in that unfortunate position of being beholden to her left wing to where she cannot be seen as agreeing with the president on anything until after she is speaker,"" Mulvaney said. ""If that's the case, again, there's a chance we go into the next Congress.""

Pelosi spokesman Drew Hammill disputed that account, saying in a statement: ""As Mr. Mulvaney well knows, House Democrats are united in their opposition to the President's immoral, expensive and ineffective wall.""

The White House should ""stop the posturing and start serious bipartisan talks,"" Hammill said.

Financing for about a quarter of federal government programs - including the departments of Homeland Security, Justice and Agriculture - expired at midnight on Friday. More than 400,000 ""essential"" employees in those agencies will work without pay until the dispute is resolved. Another 380,000 will be ""furloughed,"" meaning they are put on temporary leave.

Law enforcement efforts, border patrols, mail delivery and airport operations will keep running.

Building a wall to try to prevent migrants from entering the United States illegally was a central plank of Trump's presidential campaign, but Democrats are vehemently opposed and have rejected his funding request.

Trump reiterated his push for border security on Sunday, saying on Twitter that ""the only way"" to stop drugs, gangs, and human trafficking at the border was with a wall or barrier.

""Drones and all of the rest are wonderful and lots of fun, but it is only a good old fashioned Wall that works!,"" the president said in the tweet.

Earlier in the week, leaders in both the Senate and House thought they had reached a deal that Trump would sign that contained less money for border security, only to watch the president, under pressure from conservatives, re-assert his demand for US$5 billion at the last minute.

Senator David Perdue, a Republican from Georgia on the Senate Banking Committee, said on Fox News' ""Sunday Morning Futures"" that he thought a deal this week was possible.

""I spoke to the president last night, he wants that,"" Purdue said, adding: ""I'm hopeful that cooler heads will prevail and we'll get to some number between US$1.6 (billion) and US$5 billion (£3.95 billion) on that.""

0,"Business-first Republican advocates want the president to trade away his ""Hire American"" policy to get border wall funding, while pro-American advocates say he can win by trading concessions in healthcare, trade, and infrastructure.

President Donald Trump ""needs a strategy ... and the strategy has to be to trade something that is not immigration,"" said Jessica Vaughan, policy director at the Center for Immigration Studies.

The chances of a broader swap were raised on January 3 when White House officials recommended a Presidential veto of Pelosi's first budget proposal.

Democrats are blocking wall spending, but they have other policy goals in trade, infrastructure, healthcare, and the environment, Vaughan said. For example, Democrats want to add more worker protection to the NAFTA 2 treaty, and they want more construction projects in big cities, she said. Trump should offer concessions in those areas, and so force Democrats to deal or reveal the political cost of their obstructionism, she said.

If House Majority Leader Nancy Pelosi rejects those concessions, she and other Democrats will quickly see how she is martyring her political agenda by opposing a few billion dollars worth of fencing in 2019, Vaughan said.

If the wall talks are expanded, Pelosi will be under pressure to accept a compromise, Vaughan said, because ""she has to show she can govern."" Moreover, Pelosi's majority is made possible by semi-centrist Democrats who ran to her right in the November elections. They need compromises to keep their seats in 2020, she said.

Also, outside the Beltway, voters know Trump was elected to build the wall. ""I think people's perception is that the Democrats are really the problems here and that [perception problem] is going to get worse,"" Vaughan said.

But the GOP's business-first wing instead wants Trump to trade away his lower immigration, higher wages policy to get a few billion dollars for the wall, she said.

That wage-boosting ""Hire American"" policy is now raising wages for GOP voters before the 2020 elections -- but it is also crimping the profits and stock values demanded by the GOP's donors and business-first legislators.

For example, GOP Sen. Lamar Alexander, who voted for the Gang of Eight Amnesty in 2013, used a January 3 article in the Washington Post to urge Trump to endorse a huge amnesty that would drive down wages before the election:

Go bigger: Pass the bill that 54 senators voted for last February, which combined a solution for children brought to the United States illegally (Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA) and $25 billion in appropriated funding for border security over 10 years. The bill failed only because of last-minute White House opposition.

Go really big: Begin the new Congress by creating a legal immigration system that secures our borders and defines legal status for those already here. In 2013, 68 senators -- including all 54 Democrats -- voted for such a bill, but the House refused to take it up. That bill included more than $40 billion and many other provisions to secure our borders.

In 2013, Alexander voted for the 2013 ""Gang of Eight"" amnesty bill, which would have amnestied an unknown number of migrants, and also allowed prestige companies to import a limitless number of cheap foreign college graduates for middle-class jobs sought by the American graduates.

Utah's Mitt Romney also is arguing that the government should let states import cheap labor.

""We need to make it easier in some respects for people to come here legally and work temporarily and then go home, particularly in the agriculture industry,"" Romney told CNN's Jake Tapper on January 2. ""In Utah, we rely on a lot of people coming in to harvest crops and so forth,"" he said, adding, ""We ought to be guided by what the states need, as opposed to what the federal government imposes on them.""

Romney's policies would allow the states to import huge levels of cheap labor. His plan would cut investors' labor costs, impose new costs on state residents and federal taxpayers, and also deter employers from buying the U.S.-built labor-saving machinery that raises Americans' productivity and wealth.

Other legislators are pushing for an amnesty of at least one million younger 'DACA' illegals. Breitbart News reported January 3:

A handful of Republican and Democrat lawmakers are continuing to tout a plan that gives amnesty to nearly a million illegal aliens in exchange for some amount of funding for President Trump's proposed border wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.

Rep. Mark Meadows (R-NC), as well as Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-SC), and Democrats such as Rep. Jackie Speier (D-CA) and Debbie Dingell (D-MI) have signaled that they are at least open to granting amnesty to at least 800,000 illegal aliens who are enrolled in the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program if it meant receiving a fifth of wall funding.

Vaughan's proposal may never make it onto Trump's desk because Trump's advisers include many deputies and aides who are part of the GOP's business-first wing.

For example, interim chief of staff Mick Mulvaney told Fox News on December 28 that ""legal immigration is so important and wonderful for this country.""

Nationwide, the U.S. establishment's economic policy of using legal migration to boost economic growth shifts wealth from young people towards older people by flooding the market with cheap white-collar and blue-collar foreign labor. That flood of outside labor spikes profits and Wall Street values by cutting salaries for manual and skilled labor of blue-collar and white-collar employees.",36

Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said Democrats had told Trump during the meeting to end the shutdown. ""He resisted,"" Schumer said. ""In fact, he said he'd keep the government closed for a very long period of time, months or even years.""

Trump confirmed that comment but painted a more positive picture of the meeting, the first since a new era of divided government began when Democrats took control of the House of Representatives on Thursday.

""We had a very, very productive meeting, and we've come a long way,"" Trump said.

But raising the stakes in his tussle with the newly emboldened Democrats, Trump threatened extraordinary measures to build the wall, which he says is needed to stem the flow of illegal immigrants and drugs into the United States.

NATIONAL EMERGENCY?

Asked by a reporter whether he had considered declaring a national emergency to build the wall, Trump said: ""Yes, I have ... I may do it ... we can call a national emergency and build it very quickly.""

He said he could declare a national emergency ""because of the security of our country, absolutely.""

The U.S. Constitution assigns Congress the power over funding the federal government so Trump likely would face legal challenges if he tried to bypass Congress on financing the wall. Building a wall - and having Mexico pay for it - was one of Trump's main promises when he ran for president in 2016.

Trump's wall project is estimated to cost about US$23 billion.

Democrats have called the wall immoral, ineffective and medieval.

Nancy Pelosi, the newly elected Democratic speaker of the House, said Friday's meeting with Trump was ""sometimes contentious"" but that they agreed to continue talking.

""But we recognise on the Democratic side that we really cannot resolve this until we open up government and we made that very clear to the president,"" she said.

Credit rating agency Moody's says the shutdown will cause minimal U.S. economic and credit market disruption but there could be a more severe impact on financial markets and the broad economy if the closure is protracted.

A Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll last week showed that 50 percent of the public blame Trump for the shutdown and 7 percent blame Republican lawmakers, while 32 percent blame Democrats.

In a Dec. 11 meeting with Pelosi and Schumer, Trump said he would be ""proud"" to shut the government over the security issue and would not blame Democrats. He has since said they are responsible.

Administration officials and congressional staffers are set to continue meeting over the weekend to try to end the impasse.

House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy told reporters that the leaders and Trump had decided to designate staff to work over the weekend. He said Trump had named Vice President Mike Pence, senior aide Jared Kushner and Secretary of Homeland Security, Kirstjen Nielsen.

The partial shutdown is straining the country's immigration system, worsening backlogs in courts and complicating hiring for employers.

Federal agencies such as the Justice Department, Commerce Department and departments of Agriculture, Labour, Interior and Treasury have been hit by the shutdown.

House Ways and Means Committee chair Richard Neal, a Democrat, asked the Internal Revenue Service in a letter on Friday to explain the possible effects of the shutdown on the upcoming tax filing season for millions of Americans.

0,"WASHINGTON: As a partial U.S. government shutdown hit the two-week mark, President Donald Trump and congressional leaders prepared to meet on Friday over ways to break an impasse pitting his demand for building a border wall against Democrats' call for alternative security measures.

About 800,000 federal workers have been affected by the Dec. 22 closure of about one-quarter of the federal government as Trump withheld his support for new funding until he secures US$5 billion to start building the wall along the U.S.-Mexico border that he promised during his campaign.

Such a wall, he has argued, is needed to stem the flow of illegal immigrants and drugs over the southwestern border. When he ran for president in 2016, he vowed Mexico would pay for the wall, which it has refused to do.

On Thursday, Trump tried to keep the pressure on Democrats, even as they gained significant new power with their takeover of the House of Representatives at the start of a new Congress.

""Build the Wall,"" the Republican president demanded on Twitter. In remarks to reporters that same day, Trump said: ""You can call it a barrier. You can call it whatever you want. But essentially, we need protection in our country.""

As Trump dug in, so did opposition Democrats, leaving many to wonder just how much progress might be made during Friday's White House meeting scheduled for 11:30 a.m. (1630 GMT).

""We're not doing a wall,"" Democrat Nancy Pelosi said late on Thursday, several hours after she was sworn in as the new speaker of the House of Representatives.

""It has nothing to do with politics. It has to do with a wall is an immorality between countries. It's an old way of thinking. It isn't cost effective,"" Pelosi added.

Late on Thursday, the House passed two Democratic bills to immediately reopen government agencies for varying lengths of time, despite a White House veto threat.

Earlier in the day, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican, labelled the House effort ""political theatre, not productive lawmaking,"" that the president would not sign into law, although the Senate last month approved identical legislation.

But McConnell faces increasing pressure from within his caucus, especially from vulnerable Republicans up for re-election in 2020, as several conservative senators urged action to reopen the government, according to media reports.

""We should pass a continuing resolution to get the government back open. The Senate has done it last Congress, we should do it again today,"" U.S. Senator Cory Gardner told The Hill on Thursday. His colleague Susan Collins also called for the Senate to pass the funding bills, while several other Republicans also urged an end to the shutdown, the Hill and the New York Times reported.

Vice President Mike Pence, in a television interview Thursday night, also suggested that in exchange for the wall, the White House could work with Democrats on so-called Dreamer immigrants who were brought to the United States illegally as children - an idea Trump had rejected on Wednesday.

""It's being talked about,"" Pence told Fox News.

Democrats back other border security measures aside from the wall, and their two-bill package passed Thursday includes US$1.3 billion for border fencing and US$300 million for other border security items such as technology and cameras.

Without a deal to end the partial government shutdown, the Department of Homeland Security will not be able to bring some furloughed workers back to their jobs while others continue to be forced to work without paychecks for the time being.

Other federal agencies were also hobbled, including the Justice Department, Commerce Department and departments of Agriculture, Labor, Interior and Treasury.

Additionally, the partial shutdown was straining the country's immigration system, worsening backlogs in courts and complicating hiring for employers.

Visitors to Smithsonian museums, among Washington's most popular tourist attractions, were being turned away during the shutdown, as were visitors to many of the nation's federal parks.

""It's very possible this shutdown will go beyond the 28th and into the new Congress,"" Mick Mulvaney said on Fox News Sunday.

""I don't think things are going to move very quickly here for the next few days"" because of the Christmas holiday, added Mulvaney, who serves as director of the Office of Management and Budget and was named acting White House chief of staff 10 days ago.

The US senate adjourned on Saturday unable to break an impasse over Trump's demand for more funds for a wall on the border with Mexico that Democrats are unwilling to accept.

Mulvaney said the White House made a ""counteroffer"" to Democrats on funding for border security that falls between the Democratic offer of $1.3 billion and Trump's demand for $5 billion.

As part of those talks on Saturday, Vice President Mike Pence offered to drop the demand for $5 billion for a border wall, substituting instead $2.1 billion, ABC News reported citing unnamed sources.

Mulvaney sought to shift blame for the partial shutdown to Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic nominee for speaker of the US House of Representatives, saying she might hold up negotiations to ensure she secures the position.

""I think she's in that unfortunate position of being beholden to her left wing to where she cannot be seen as agreeing with the president on anything until after she is speaker,"" Mulvaney said. ""If that's the case, again, there's a chance we go into the next Congress.""

Financing for about a quarter of federal government programs - including the departments of Homeland Security, Justice and Agriculture - expired at midnight on Friday and will not be renewed until a deal is done.

Federal parks were to close and more than 400,000 federal ""essential"" employees in those agencies will work without pay until the dispute is resolved. Another 380,000 will be ""furloughed"", meaning they are put on temporary leave.

Law enforcement efforts, border patrols, mail delivery and airport operations will keep running.

Building a wall to keep migrants from entering the United States illegally was a central plank of Trump's presidential campaign, but Democrats are vehemently opposed and have rejected his funding request.

Trump reiterated his push for border security on Sunday, saying on Twitter that ""the only way"" to stop drugs, gangs, and human trafficking at the border was with a wall or barrier.

""Drones and all of the rest are wonderful and lots of fun, but it is only a good old fashioned Wall that works!,"" the president said in the tweet.

Earlier in the week, leaders in both the Senate and House of Representatives thought they had reached a deal that Trump would sign that contained less money for border security, only to watch the president, under pressure from conservatives, re-assert his demand for $5 billion at the last minute.

Senator David Perdue, a Republican from Georgia on the Senate Banking Committee, said on Fox News' ""Sunday Morning Futures"" that he thought a deal this week was possible.

""I spoke to the President last night, he wants that,"" Purdue said, adding ""I'm hopeful that cooler heads will prevail and we'll get to some number between $1.6 (billion) and $5 billion on that.""",39

US President Donald Trump said on Friday he could use emergency powers to build a wall on the US-Mexico border without approval from Congress.

A showdown between Trump and Congressional Democrats over funding for the project has led to a two-week government shutdown. Trump says he will not support a bill to fully fund the government until he secures the money for the wall.

Asked at a White House press briefing whether he had considered declaring a national emergency to build the wall, Trump said: ""Yes, I have. ... We can do it. I haven't done it. I may do it.""

0,"Washington: The White House meeting between President Donald Trump and top Congressional leaders on resolving the ongoing partial government shutdown ended in a stalemate Wednesday, with Republicans and Democrats sticking to their respective positions over the presidential demand for a US-Mexico border wall.

The President is seeking USD 5.2 billion in funding for the wall which according to him is a must to prevent flow of illegal immigrants into the US. The Democrats assert that such a move is a ""waste"" of taxpayers' money. Following their inconclusive Situation Room meeting, Congressional leaders and Trump agreed to meet again on Friday.

Newly elected members of the Congress are scheduled to be sworn in Thursday; the first day of the 116th Congress. Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi is all set to be elected as the Speaker of the US House of Representatives. ""Important meeting today on Border Security with Republican and Democrat Leaders in Congress. Both parties must work together to pass a Funding Bill that protects this Nation and its people ? this is the first and most important duty of government,"" Trump said in a tweet after the meeting.

""I remain ready and willing to work with Democrats to pass a bill that secures our borders, supports the agents and officers on the ground, and keeps America Safe. Let's get it done!"" said the US President. Pelosi told reporters at the White House after the meeting that she plans to go ahead with the Democratic legislation on a spending bill without funding for a border wall. Beginning Thursday, Democrats would enjoy majority in the House of Representatives.

""We are asking the president to open up the government. We are giving him a Republican path to do that. Why would he not do it?"" Pelosi told reporters at the White House. ""Democrats have been committed to protecting our borders. It's the oath of office we take to protect and defend. It has been very important to us, and we have committed resources to it when we were in the majority, and will continue to do so,"" she said.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said the Democrats asked the President to support the bills that they support that will open up government. ""We asked him to give us one good reason -- I asked him directly. I said, Mr President, give me one good reason why you should continue your shutdown of these -- of the eight cabinet departments while we are debating our differences on Homeland Security? He could not give a good answer,"" he said.

""So, we would hope that they would reconsider and would support the very bills that passed the Senate, four of them 92 to 6, two of them unanimously, in the Appropriations Committee with Mitch McConnell's support,"" he said. ""The only reason that they are shutting down the government is very simple. They want to try and leverage that shutdown into their proposals on border security. We want strong border security. We believe ours our better. But to use the shutdown as hostage, which they had no argument against, is wrong,"" Schumer said.

Senator Majority Leader Mitch McConnell later said that no progress was made Wednesday in the meeting with Trump. Not very optimistic, he said that the partial government shutdown ? now into its 12th day ? could continue for even weeks. ""It was a civil discussion. We're hopeful that somehow in the coming days and weeks we'll be able to reach an agreement,"" he said.

Without a deal to end the partial government shutdown, the Department of Homeland Security will not be able to bring some furloughed workers back to their jobs while others continue to be forced to work without paychecks for the time being.

An array of other federal agencies are similarly hobbled, including the Justice Department, Commerce Department and departments of Agriculture, Labor, Interior and Treasury.

WASHINGTON * US President Donald Trump has gained little leverage with Democrats two weeks into the partial government shutdown of his own making, with fewer possible escape routes and a more treacherous path ahead as the GOP relinquishes control of the House.

Mr Trump turned to the bully pulpit on the first working day of the new year with a stream of tweets and an extended televised Cabinet meeting to press his case for funding the construction of a wall along the US-Mexico border.

Later, he and top congressional leaders met for what was billed as a briefing on border security issues in the Situation Room at the White House. Democrats, who were set to take over the majority in the House yesterday, were unmoved.

The White House meeting quickly devolved into political posturing. Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, who was poised to be elected House Speaker yesterday, said the chamber would vote on two measures to reopen the government that mirror legislation that the Senate had already passed with Republican support only to be rejected by Mr Trump.

Mr Trump invited the lawmakers to return to the White House today, following yesterday's congressional leadership elections.

It is unclear whether the Democrats will accept his offer, although he sounded somewhat conciliatory on Wednesday evening, tweeting: ""I remain ready and willing to work with Democrats to pass a Bill that secures our borders, supports the agents and officers on the ground, and keeps America Safe. Let's get it done!""

But Ms Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer instead signalled that they saw a political opportunity to gain further leverage against the White House.

If he accepts a funding deal from Democrats that offers little or no money for wall construction,

Mr Trump risks alienating a base that has provided steady support, and undermining his self-proclaimed status as a master negotiator.

Allowing the shutdown to drag on carries risks as well.

The legislation they plan to pass would reopen the affected government departments, provide US$1.3 billion (S$1.8 billion) for border security on a pro-rated basis and give time for further negotiations on the issue. The measure would fund the Department of Homeland Security only until Feb 8, and would not include money for the construction of the border wall.

That is not enough for Mr Trump, and Democrats will cast the President as holding federal workers hostage for the wall. That approach - and the underlying intransigence - has been made easier by a president who has misplayed his hand repeatedly during negotiations.

Mr Trump's most severe misstep was self-inflicted. In a meeting with Ms Pelosi and Mr Schumer last month, the President defiantly boasted that he would be ""proud"" to ""take the mantle"" of shutting the government down if he did not get the more than US$5 billion he was seeking to build the wall.

Mr Trump's unequivocal embracing of responsibility for the shutdown has helped deflect other news - such as the fatal shooting of a California police officer, allegedly by an undocumented immigrant, and Ms Pelosi's vacation at a Hawaiian resort as hundreds of thousands of federal workers worried about their pay - that may have eroded the Democrats' political standing.

If he accepts a funding deal from Democrats that offers little or no money for wall construction, Mr Trump risks alienating a base that has provided steady support, and undermining his self-proclaimed status as a master negotiator.

Allowing the shutdown to drag on carries risks as well. While Mr Trump can continue to elevate immigration as a potent political wedge, a prolonged shutdown could add uncertainty to already volatile markets as federal workers and contractors begin missing pay cheques and invoices.

Yet with Democrats showing little inclination to budge as the shutdown stretches into its third week, Mr Trump posed the key question to himself rhetorically as he met his Cabinet on Wednesday.

""Well, I'd rather not say it - could we do it for a little bit less?"" Mr Trump said.

0,"WASHINGTON - US President Donald Trump's budget director and chief of staff on Sunday said the partial US government shutdown could continue to 3 January, when the new Congress convenes, and Democrats take over the House of Representatives.

""It's very possible this shutdown will go beyond (December) the 28th and into the new Congress,"" Mick Mulvaney said on Fox News Sunday.

""I don't think things are going to move very quickly here for the next few days"" because of the Christmas holiday, added Mulvaney, who serves as director of the Office of Management and Budget and was named acting White House chief of staff 10 days ago.

The US Senate adjourned on Saturday, unable to break an impasse over Trump's demand for more funds for a wall on the border with Mexico that Democrats are unwilling to accept.

Mulvaney said the White House made a ""counter-offer"" to Democrats on funding for border security that fell between the Democratic offer of $1.3 billion and Trump's demand for $5 billion.

As part of those talks on Saturday, Vice President Mike Pence offered to drop the demand for $5 billion for a border wall, substituting instead $2.1 billion, ABC News reported, citing unnamed sources.

A Democratic source familiar with the negotiations said real discussions have been happening between Democratic lawmakers and Republican Senator Richard Shelby, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, who has been talking to the White House. It was unclear what Democrats had offered.

Mulvaney sought to shift blame for the partial shutdown to Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic nominee for speaker of the US House of Representatives, saying she might hold up negotiations to ensure she secures the position.

""I think she's in that unfortunate position of being beholden to her left wing to where she cannot be seen as agreeing with the president on anything until after she is the speaker,"" Mulvaney said. ""If that's the case, again, there's a chance we go into the next Congress.""

Pelosi spokesman Drew Hammill disputed that account, saying in a statement: ""As Mr Mulvaney well knows, House Democrats are united in their opposition to the President's immoral, expensive and ineffective wall.""

The White House should ""stop the posturing and start serious bipartisan talks,"" Hammill said.

Financing for about a quarter of federal government programs - including the departments of Homeland Security, Justice and Agriculture - expired at midnight on Friday. More than 400,000 ""essential"" employees in those agencies will work without pay until the dispute is resolved. Another 380,000 will be ""furloughed,"" meaning they are put on temporary leave.

Law enforcement efforts, border patrols, mail delivery and airport operations will keep running.

Building a wall to try to prevent migrants from entering the United States illegally was a central plank of Trump's presidential campaign, but Democrats are vehemently opposed and have rejected his funding request.

Trump reiterated his push for border security on Sunday, saying on Twitter that ""the only way"" to stop drugs, gangs, and human trafficking at the border was with a wall or barrier.

""Drones and all of the rest are wonderful and lots of fun, but it is only a good old fashioned Wall that works!,"" the president said in the tweet.

Earlier in the week, leaders in both the Senate and House thought they had reached a deal that Trump would sign that contained less money for border security, only to watch the president, under pressure from conservatives, re-assert his demand for $5 billion at the last minute.

Senator David Perdue, a Republican from Georgia on the Senate Banking Committee, said on Fox News' Sunday Morning Futures that he thought a deal this week was possible.

""I spoke to the president last night, he wants that,"" Purdue said, adding: ""I'm hopeful that cooler heads will prevail and we'll get to some number between $1.6 (billion) and $5 billion (£3.95 billion) on that.""",50
0,"Washington: The White House meeting between President Donald Trump and top Congressional leaders on resolving the ongoing partial government shutdown ended in a stalemate on Wednesday, with Republicans and Democrats sticking to their respective positions over the presidential demand for a US-Mexico border wall.

The President is seeking $5.2 billion in funding for the wall which according to him is a must to prevent the flow of illegal immigrants into the US. The Democrats assert that such a move is a ""waste"" of taxpayers' money.

Following their inconclusive Situation Room meeting, Congressional leaders and Trump agreed to meet again on Friday.

Newly elected members of the Congress are scheduled to be sworn in Thursday; the first day of the 116th Congress. Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi is all set to be elected as the Speaker of the US House of Representatives.

""Important meeting today on Border Security with Republican and Democrat Leaders in Congress. Both parties must work together to pass a Funding Bill that protects this Nation and its people - this is the first and most important duty of government,"" Trump said in a tweet after the meeting.

""I remain ready and willing to work with Democrats to pass a bill that secures our borders, supports the agents and officers on the ground, and keeps America Safe. Let's get it done!"" said the US President.

Pelosi told reporters at the White House after the meeting that she plans to go ahead with the Democratic legislation on a spending bill without funding for a border wall. Beginning Thursday, Democrats would enjoy a majority in the House of Representatives.

""We are asking the president to open up the government. We are giving him a Republican path to do that. Why would he not do it?"" Pelosi told reporters at the White House. ""Democrats have been committed to protecting our borders. It's the oath of office we take to protect and defend. It has been very important to us, and we have committed resources to it when we were in the majority, and will continue to do so,"" she said.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said the Democrats asked the President to support the bills that they support that will open up government. ""We asked him to give us one good reason -- I asked him directly. I said, Mr President, give me one good reason why you should continue your shutdown of these -- of the eight cabinet departments while we are debating our differences on Homeland Security? He could not give a good answer,"" he said.

""So, we would hope that they would reconsider and would support the very bills that passed the Senate, four of them 92 to 6, two of them unanimously, in the Appropriations Committee with Mitch McConnell's support,"" he said.

""The only reason that they are shutting down the government is very simple. They want to try and leverage that shutdown into their proposals on border security. We want strong border security. We believe ours our better. But to use the shutdown as a hostage, which they had no argument against, is wrong,"" Schumer said.

Senator Majority Leader Mitch McConnell later said that no progress was made Wednesday in the meeting with Trump. Not very optimistic, he said that the partial government shutdown -- now into its 12th day -- could continue for even weeks. ""It was a civil discussion. We're hopeful that somehow in the coming days and weeks we'll be able to reach an agreement,"" he said.

The partial government shutdown that started on 22 December has affected 800,000 federal employees, who have either been furloughed or are working without pay.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump and senior Democrats failed to strike a deal in talks on Friday to end a partial shutdown of the U.S. government as they again fought over Trump's request for $5 billion to fund his signature wall on the Mexican border.

After Democratic congressional leaders turned Trump down

at a meeting in the White House Situation Room, the Republican president threatened to take the controversial step of using emergency powers to build the wall without approval from Congress.

Trump is withholding his support for a bill that would fully fund the government until he secures the money for the wall and as a result about 800,000 federal workers have been unpaid due to the closure of about a quarter of the federal government.

Administration officials, led by Vice President Mike Pence, and congressional staffers are to meet during the weekend to try to end the impasse over the 2-week-old shutdown.

Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said Democrats had told Trump during the meeting to end the shutdown. ""He resisted,"" Schumer said. ""In fact, he said he'd keep the government closed for a very long period of time, months or even years.""

Trump confirmed that comment but painted a more positive picture of the meeting, the first since a new era of divided government began when Democrats took control of the House of Representatives on Thursday.

""We had a very, very productive meeting, and we've come a long way,"" Trump said.

But raising the stakes in his tussle with the newly emboldened Democrats, Trump threatened extraordinary measures to build the wall, which he says is needed to stem the flow of illegal immigrants and drugs into the United States.

NATIONAL EMERGENCY?

Asked by a reporter whether he had considered declaring a national emergency to build the wall, Trump said: ""Yes, I have ... I may do it ... But we can call a national emergency and build it very quickly.""

He said he could declare a national emergency ""because of the security of our country, absolutely.""

The U.S. Constitution assigns Congress the power over funding the federal government so Trump likely would face legal challenges if he tried to bypass Congress on financing the wall. Building a wall - and having Mexico pay for it - was one of Trump's main promises when he ran for president in 2016.

Trump's wall project is estimated to cost about $23 billion.

Democrats have called the wall immoral, ineffective and medieval.

Nancy Pelosi, the newly elected Democratic speaker of the House, said Friday's meeting with Trump was ""sometimes contentious"" but that they agreed to continue talking.

""But we recognise on the Democratic side that we really cannot resolve this until we open up government and we made that very clear to the president,"" she said.

Credit rating agency Moody's says the shutdown will cause minimal U.S. economic and credit market disruption but there could be a more severe impact on financial markets and the broad economy if the closure is protracted.

A Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll last week showed that 50 percent of the public blame Trump for the shutdown and 7 percent blame Republican lawmakers, against 32 percent who blame Democrats.

In a Dec. 11 meeting with Pelosi and Schumer, Trump said he would be ""proud"" to shut the government over the security issue and would not blame Democrats. He has since said they are responsible.

The partial shutdown is straining the country's immigration system, worsening backlogs in courts and complicating hiring for employers.

Federal agencies such as the Justice Department, Commerce Department and departments of Agriculture, Labor, Interior and Treasury have been hit by the shutdown.

0,"No agreement came out of a meeting between US congressional leaders and President Donald Trump yesterday to end a partial government shutdown, now in its 13th day, as the president stuck to his demand for US$5 billion in border wall funding fiercely opposed by Democrats.

Congressional leaders are expected to return to the White House tomorrow to resume talks, signalling the shutdown will likely stretch into the weekend.

The White House convened the meeting to try to convince Democrats that funding a wall on the southern border with Mexico was a pressing security need. Instead, Democratic leaders cut off Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Neilsen's presentation and tried to no avail to press Trump to accept their offer.

""It just was not a credible presentation,"" Senator Dick Durbin said of the briefing. He added that Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi, who is expected to be elected House speaker today, insisted that the conversation should instead focus on the shutdown.

Pelosi said the House would proceed with plans to hold votes today, when they formally take control of the chamber from Trump's fellow Republicans, on legislation that would end the shutdown without providing the wall money sought by Trump.

""We're asking the president to open up government,"" Pelosi told reporters outside the White House after the meeting.

But Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said afterwards on the Senate floor that the chamber would not vote on the legislation, calling it a ""political sideshow"" and ""total non-starter"".

Democrats say they want to fund most of the government through September, but allow for another month to negotiate wall funding by only partially funding the Department of Homeland Security, which is responsible for the wall.

Schumer said Trump conceded that Republicans would lose leverage if they allowed the rest of the government to be funded.

""We asked him to give us one good reason... why you should continue your shutdown of the eight cabinet departments while we are debating our differences on homeland security. He could not give a good answer,"" Schumer told reporters after the meeting.

In a tweet yesterday evening, Trump called the meeting ""important"" and said he would continue talks with Democrats ""to pass a bill that secures our borders, supports the agents and officers on the ground, and keeps America Safe.""

'As long as it takes'

Trump's demand for US$5 billion in funding for a wall along the US-Mexico border triggered the shutdown affecting about a quarter of the federal government and 800,000 federal workers.

Before meeting with lawmakers, Trump said the shutdown would last for ""as long as it takes"" as he pushes for wall money as part of any legislation to reopen agencies shuttered when their funding lapsed on Dec 22.

""It could be a long time,"" Trump told reporters during a cabinet meeting yesterday, ""or it could be quickly"".

""We know that we have a challenge along the border,"" said Kevin McCarthy, the top House Republican. ""We want to solve that issue. We want to make sure we open this government up. And I think at the end of the day, the president, listening to him, he wants to solve this as well.""

Pelosi noted that the legislation being presented in the House had previously won backing in the Senate, which will remain in Republican hands in the new 2019-2020 Congress that convenes today.

But McConnell said previously that Senate Republicans would not approve a spending measure Trump does not support.

Trump made the border wall a key part of his presidential campaign. Before meeting with the Democrats, Trump called the border a ""sieve,"" rebutted Pelosi's complaint that a wall was immoral, provided an estimate of the US illegal immigrant population far higher than the figures most experts cite and made disputed comments about progress toward building a wall.

The visit by Pelosi and Schumer was their first to the White House since their sharp exchange with Trump in the Oval Office on Dec 11, during which the president told them he would be ""proud to shut down the government for border security.""

He has since blamed Democrats for the shutdown.

WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The two top congressional Democrats emerged from a White House meeting on Friday offering no sign of progress towards a deal with President Donald Trump to fully re-open the government, with one claiming Trump threatened to keep it shut for ""months or even years"" as he held out for funding for a border wall.

With the partial shutdown now two weeks old, the two sides held a sometimes contentious meeting in the White House about the shutdown, said House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat.

About 800,000 federal workers have been unpaid due to the closure of about a quarter of the federal government as Trump withholds his support for a bill which would fund the government until he secures the money for the wall that he promised during his election campaign.

A showdown between Trump and Congressional Democrats over funding for his wall project has led to a two-week government shutdown. Trump says he will not support a bill to fully fund the government until he secures the money for the wall.

""We can call a national emergency because of the security of our country, absolutely,"" he said. Asked if declaring a national emergency was a threat hanging over Democrats, Trump said, ""I'd never threaten anybody, but I am allowed to do that, yes.""

0,"As a partial U.S. government shutdown hit the two-week mark, President Donald Trump and congressional leaders were scheduled on Friday to discuss ways to break an impasse pitting his demand for building a border wall against Democrats' call for alternative security measures.

About 800,000 federal workers have been affected by the Dec. 22 closure of about one-quarter of the federal government as Trump withheld his support for new funding until he secures $5 billion to start building the wall along the U.S.-Mexico border that he promised during his campaign.

Such a wall, he has argued, is needed to stem the flow of illegal immigrants and drugs over the southwestern border. When he ran for president in 2016, he vowed Mexico would pay for the wall, which it has refused to do.

On Thursday, Trump tried to keep the pressure on Democrats, even as they gained significant new power with their takeover of the House of Representatives at the start of a new Congress.

""Build the Wall,"" the Republican president demanded on Twitter. In remarks to reporters that same day, Trump said: ""You can call it a barrier. You can call it whatever you want. But essentially, we need protection in our country.""

As Trump dug in, so did opposition Democrats, leaving many to wonder just how much progress might be made during Friday's White House meeting scheduled for 11:30 a.m. (1630 GMT).

""We're not doing a wall,"" Democrat Nancy Pelosi said late on Thursday, several hours after she was sworn in as the new speaker of the House of Representatives.

""It has nothing to do with politics. It has to do with a wall is an immorality between countries. It's an old way of thinking. It isn't cost effective,"" Pelosi added.

Late on Thursday, the House passed two Democratic bills to immediately reopen government agencies for varying lengths of time, despite a White House veto threat. Earlier in the day, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican, labeled the House effort ""political theater, not productive lawmaking,"" even though the Senate last month approved identical legislation.

Democratic Representative Lucille Roybal-Allard, speaking to reporters late on Thursday, argued that funding a border wall, which ultimately could cost more than $24 billion, would hamper other, more important national security protections.

She noted that more federal law enforcement agents were needed to intercept illegal opioids and other ""contraband"" moving through U.S. ports of entry. She added more money was needed for the Coast Guard to beef up the U.S. presence in the Arctic at a time when Russia and China increasingly were on the prowl for that region's natural resources.

Without a deal to end the partial government shutdown, the Department of Homeland Security will not be able to bring some furloughed workers back to their jobs while others continue to be forced to work without paychecks for the time being.

An array of other federal agencies are similarly hobbled, including the Justice Department, Commerce Department and departments of Agriculture, Labor, Interior and Treasury.

0,"WASHINGTON - U.S. President Donald Trump and senior Democrats failed to strike a deal in talks on Friday to end a partial shutdown of the U.S. government as they again fought over Trump's request for over $5 billion to fund his signature wall on the Mexican border.

After Democratic congressional leaders turned Trump down at a meeting in the White House Situation Room, the Republican president threatened to take the controversial step of using emergency powers to build the wall without approval from Congress.

Trump is withholding his support for a bill that would fully fund the government until he secures the money for the wall. As a result around 800,000 public workers have been unpaid, with about a quarter of the federal government closed for two weeks.

Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said Democrats had told Trump during the meeting to end the shutdown. ""He resisted,"" Schumer said. ""In fact, he said he'd keep the government closed for a very long period of time, months or even years.""

Trump confirmed that comment but painted a more positive picture of the meeting, the first since a new era of divided government began when Democrats took control of the House of Representatives on Thursday.

""We had a very, very productive meeting, and we've come a long way,"" Trump said.

According to a source familiar with the White House discussion, Trump opened the meeting with a speech that lasted at least 15 minutes in which he insisted on the need for $5.6 billion for a border wall.

The source also said Trump brought up recent impeachment threats during those remarks, arguing that he had notched a strong performance as president and should not be a target for impeachment.

Raising the stakes in his tussle with the newly emboldened Democrats, Trump threatened extraordinary measures to build the wall, which he says is needed to stem the flow of illegal immigrants and drugs into the United States.

Asked by a reporter whether he had considered declaring a national emergency to build the wall, Trump said: ""Yes, I have . . . I may do it . . . we can call a national emergency and build it very quickly.""

He said he could declare a national emergency ""because of the security of our country, absolutely.""

Senator Jack Reed, the senior Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, criticized the comments, saying in a statement, ""Declaring a trumped up national emergency in order to skirt congressional approval is wrong.""

The Constitution assigns Congress the power over funding the federal government so Trump likely would face legal challenges if he tried to bypass Congress on financing the wall. Building a wall -- and having Mexico pay for it -- was one of Trump's main promises when he ran for president in 2016.

Trump's wall project is estimated to cost about $23 billion.

Democrats have called the wall immoral, ineffective and medieval.

Nancy Pelosi, the newly elected Democratic speaker of the House, said Friday's meeting with Trump was ""sometimes contentious"" but that they agreed to continue talking.

""But we recognize on the Democratic side that we really cannot resolve this until we open up government and we made that very clear to the president,"" she said.

Credit rating agency Moody's says the shutdown will cause minimal U.S. economic and credit market disruption but there could be a more severe impact on financial markets and the broad economy if the closure is protracted.

A Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll last week showed that 50 percent of the public blame Trump for the shutdown and 7 percent blame Republican lawmakers, while 32 percent blame Democrats.

In a Dec. 11 meeting with Pelosi and Schumer, Trump said he would be ""proud"" to shut the government over the security issue and would not blame Democrats. He has since said they are responsible.

White House officials and congressional staffers will meet at 11 a.m. Saturday to try to end the impasse, White House spokesman Hogan Gidley said.

House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy told reporters that Trump had named Vice President Mike Pence, senior aide Jared Kushner and Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen to work over the weekend.

The partial shutdown is straining the country's immigration system, worsening backlogs in courts and complicating hiring for employers.

Federal agencies such as the Justice Department, Commerce Department and departments of Agriculture, Labor, Interior and Treasury have been hit by the shutdown.

House Ways and Means Committee chairman Richard Neal, a Democrat, asked the Internal Revenue Service in a letter on Friday to explain the possible effects of the shutdown on the upcoming tax filing season for millions of Americans.",60
0,"TRUMP QUESTIONS HIS OWN STRATEGY: The Afghanistan strategy President Trump announced in summer 2017 aimed to convince the Taliban the U.S. would not cut and run. That approach remains intact a year-and-a-half later, according to the Pentagon's latest progress report to Congress -- released the same day Defense Secretary Jim Mattis resigned. ""The key to success remains sustained military pressure against the Taliban,"" the December document said. ""By convincing the Taliban that they cannot win on the battlefield, and credibly committing to a conditions based strategy, we have greatly increased the odds of concluding a settlement on terms favorable to the United States and Afghanistan.""

Yesterday Trump couldn't have made his impatience with that strategy and its lack of progress clearer, and he blamed Mattis, a key architect of the plan. ""What's he done for me? How has he done in Afghanistan? Not too good, not too good. I'm not happy with what he's done in Afghanistan and I shouldn't be happy,"" Trump said during a 98-minute engagement with the media during a Cabinet meeting. ""I wish him well, I hope he does well, but as you know, President Obama fired him and, essentially, so did I. I want results.""

YOU CAN'T QUIT, YOU'RE FIRED: Mattis resigned on principle Dec. 20 and planned to stay until the end of February to allow for a smooth transition. But Trump, stung by the bipartisan reaction praising Mattis' resignation letter and rebuking of the president, essentially ""fired"" him four days later, replacing him with Deputy Defense Secretary Patrick Shanahan, effective Jan. 1. That way Mattis would not represent the department at NATO or defend the budget before Congress in February, both venues where Mattis would no doubt be questioned about his deep policy differences with the president.

LET OTHERS DO IT: As with Syria, Trump doesn't think the U.S. should carry the overwhelming burden of distant wars that benefit other countries as much, if not more than, the United States. ""Why isn't Russia there, why isn't India there, why isn't Pakistan there? Why are we there, we're 6,000 miles away?""

And Trump mocked the contributions of some NATO and partner nations in fighting both the Taliban and ISIS. ""When a country sends us 200 soldiers to Iraq or sends us 100 soldiers from a big country to Syria or to Afghanistan and then they tell me 100 times, 'Oh, we sent you soldiers, we sent you soldiers' -- and that's 1/100th of the money that they're taking advantage of, they're just doing that to make me happy or to make past presidents happy,"" Trump said. ""They're involved in the Afghanistan War because they sent us 100 soldiers, and, yet, it's costing us billions and billions of dollars.""

""I could give you an example where I get along very well with India and Prime Minister [Narenda] Modi, but he's constantly telling me he built a library in Afghanistan, OK? A library -- that's like -- you know what that is? That's like five hours of what we spend.""

THE ENEMY OF MY ENEMY IS STILL MY FREAKIN' ENEMY: Trump believes he has the common sense that some of his vaunted generals lack. ""I think I would've been a good general, but who knows?"" he said. ""I'll give you an example. So, the Taliban is our enemy, ISIS is our enemy. We have an area that I brought up with our generals four or five weeks ago where Taliban is here, ISIS is here and they're fighting each other. I said, 'Why don't you let them fight? Why are we getting in the middle of it?' I said let them fight, they're both our enemies, let them fight.""

Instead, Trump says, the U.S. goes in and ends up fighting both of them. ""It's the craziest thing I've ever seen.""

BAD TIMING: Another tenet of the Afghanistan strategy is making sure U.S. diplomats negotiate from a position of strength. But by order, the Pentagon is set to start cutting the U.S. presence in Afghanistan in half from roughly 15,000 troops to about 8,000. A key demand of the Taliban in early talks is the withdrawal of all U.S. troops. The pullout plan hands the Taliban a major concession with no quid pro quo.

AFGHANISTAN AT 'IMPASSE': Talks between special U.S. envoy Zalmay Khalilzad and Taliban representatives have raised hopes for a deal. But the latest Pentagon assessment posits the military stalemate remains and the U.S.-led NATO mission has slowed -- but not stopped -- the Taliban's momentum. ""The current military situation inside of Afghanistan remains at an impasse,"" says a Pentagon report to Congress issued last month.

""The Afghan National Defense and Security Forces (ANDSF) remain in control of most of Afghanistan's population centers and all of the provincial capitals, while the Taliban control large portions of Afghanistan's rural areas, and continue to attack poorly defended government checkpoints and rural district centers.""

HAPPENING TODAY: Congress will be gaveled back into session for the 116th time today, and with the Democrats now in control of the House, divided government returns to Washington. Not that it wasn't divided before, since Republicans have an expanded majority in the Senate, up to seats to a 53-47 edge, but are still far short of the 60 votes needed to ram through legislation.

House Democrats' first order of business is sending is the Senate to reopen parts of the government closed for nearly two weeks and put off any decision on funding Trump's border wall until next month. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Ky., has already said the effort won't fly because he'll block a vote on any plan that doesn't have President Trump's approval.

At yesterday's meeting in the White House Situation room, Trump wanted his Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen to lay out the case of why a better barrier at the border is needed. But Democrats, led by Minority Leader Sen. Chuck Schumer, N.Y., and presumptive House Speaker Rep. Nancy Pelosi, Calif., wanted only to argue for an end to the shutdown. ""I was a little disappointed with, I would say, some on the other side,"" said Rep. Kevin McCarthy R-Calif., afterward. ""Once the secretary started, Sen. Schumer interrupted her, and they didn't want to hear it. And they challenged some of the points the secretary made.""

""Secretary Nielsen wanted to go over some very alarming numbers, things that are actually happening at the border, and what's happened last year,"" said Rep. Steve Scalise, R-La., who becomes House minority whip Thursday. ""Last year alone, there were 3,700 known or suspected terrorists that were stopped from entering this country.""

McCarthy said another session with Democrats is set for tomorrow. ""Hopefully Friday we'll be able to get there.""

THIS IS WHAT INTRANSIGENCE LOOKS LIKE: Like a page out of Dr. Seuss classic parable ""The Zax,"" neither side is budging over the $5 billion Trump wants for border wall construction. And both convinced of the rightness of their cause. Asked how long he's willing to keep 25 percent of the government shutdown and 800,000 federal workers in limbo, Trump said, ""As long as it takes. I mean look, I'm prepared. I think the people of the country think I'm right. I think the people of this country think I'm right.""

In the White House driveway, Schumer was just as adamant Democrats would not acquiesce. ""Today we gave them an opportunity to get out of that and open up the government as we debate border security. And to say to them, 'Because he says he won't sign it and use the government as a hostage, we should just give in?' The American people don't want that. That's bad for our country, and that's not the way to govern.""

THIS IS WHAT COMPROMISE LOOKS LIKE: Meanwhile in a Fox radio interview, Sen. Lindsey Graham, an informal Trump adviser, urged the president to channel his 1987 bestseller ""The Art of the Deal.""

""The question is do the Democrats want a deal? If they want a deal, there will be one. If they want to continue to play politics there will not be one,"" the South Carolina told host Brian Kilmeade. ""I've been talking to a couple Democrats about trying to construct a deal, $5 billion for wall/border security, the Bridge Act giving work permits to the DACA population. The TPS Reform Program, people that came from Vietnam, Cambodia, other places that had war and natural disasters for the wall. That's the deal that makes sense and I'm hoping that after this meeting they'll start talking to us.""

Trump tweeted last night, ""I remain ready and willing to work with Democrats to pass a bill that secures our borders, supports the agents and officers on the ground, and keeps America Safe. Let's get it done!""

SHANAHAN SALUTES: Yesterday's cabinet meeting marked the debut of Pat Shanahan as acting defense secretary, and during the White House session Trump called on Shanahan -- who he said ""such a pleasure to work with"" -- to bolster his case for the wall. Shanahan was happy to salute. ""The threat is real,"" Shanahan said. ""The risks are real. We need to control our border.""

Shanahan said the military plans to do more to help the DHS with the restoration of border fences and building out of additional mileage of the wall. ""The Army Corps of Engineers is dialed in on doing this cost-effectively, quickly and the right amount of urgency, of where we can build stand up walls quickly.""

Trump was clearly pleased with Shanahan, a sign perhaps his acting status could continue for an indefinite time.

NO BOEING, PLEASE: One thing Trump loves about Shanahan is his business background and his record of 30 years as an ace plane-maker at Boeing. But now that he's the top guy at the Pentagon, Shanahan is pledging to recuse himself from any DoD business involving his old employer.

""Under his Ethics Agreement, Mr. Shanahan has recused himself for the duration of his service in the Department of Defense from participating in matters in which the Boeing Company is a party,"" said Lt. Col. Joe Buccino, a spokesman for Shanahan.

MORE TRUMP UNPLUGGED: In his one hour, 38-minute freewheeling session before the cameras yesterday, President Trump opined on a wide range of national security issues. Here's a sample:

Foreign aid, who needs it? ""We're giving away $54 billion in foreign aid. So, we give money to countries, but we don't give money to our own country, which is another thing that I've been complaining about, and we're cutting that back. It's very unfair when we give money to Guatemala and to Honduras and to El Salvador, and they do nothing for us, when we give money to Pakistan, $1.3 billion. I ended that -- a lot of people don't know it -- because they haven't been fair to us. We want to have a great relationship with Pakistan, but they house the enemy, they take care of the enemy. We just can't do that.""

Syria four months? Okay whatever: ""I know somebody said four months. But I didn't say that either. I'm getting out. We're getting out of Syria. Look, we don't want Syria. Obama gave up Syria years ago when he didn't violate the red line ... So, Syria was lost long ago. It was lost long ago. And besides that, I don't want -- we're talking about sand and death. That's what we're talking about. We're not talking about, you know, vast wealth. We're talking about sand and death.""

(CNN is quoting an unnamed Pentagon official as saying four months is the minimum timeframe to realistically and safely extract the 2,000 U.S. troops and their equipment from Syria. The official reportedly said the new withdrawal plan is an attempt ""to please the president and not get everyone killed."")

Another love letter from Kim: ""I just got a great letter from Kim Jong Un. Those few people that I've shown this letter to have never written letters like this. This letter is a great letter. We made a lot of progress with North Korea and Kim Jong Un.""

WHAT WAS KIM REALLY SAYING? The folks at 38 North, the North Korea monitoring site now affiliated with Stimson Center had been carefully reviewing Kim Jong Un's New Year's Day speech and think his between-the-lines message is that he's hoping to play China off against the U.S. The key line -- a warning that ""we even might find ourselves in a situation where we have no other choice but to find a new way,"" writes analyst Ruediger Frank.

""Kim's confidence stems from the expectation of growing and reliable support by China,"" writes Frank. ""I thus interpret Kim's threat of 'finding a new way' not as a hint at more nuclear tests, but rather as a message to Donald Trump: You are not our only option for security and economic development. If you refuse to be cooperative, we will ignore you and turn to China. Oh, and we will take South Korea along.""

WHO'S THE NEW SHANAHAN? With Patrick Shanahan elevated to acting secretary, the nameplate on his old office now has the name of the Pentagon Comptroller. ""As Department of Defense Chief Financial Officer and Comptroller for the past 19 months, David Norquist has had insight into virtually every tenet of this department,"" said Shanahan in a statement issued yesterday. ""I have the greatest confidence in his abilities to lead a phenomenally talented team while performing the duties as Deputy Secretary of Defense.""

JUMP, FELL OR WAS PUSHED: The active-duty two-star Marine general former Defense Secretary Mattis tapped to serve as the on-camera spokesman for the Pentagon asked not to take the job, after all, now that Mattis is gone, Pentagon officials say. One official said that in a meeting with Shanahan, Marine Maj. Gen. Burke Whitman gave five reasons why he preferred not to take the job, and that after considering the reasons, Shanahan agreed.

Pentagon officials insisted that Whitman was not fired, but that his disposition toward accepting the post had changed. Whitman's appointment as the face of the Pentagon was controversial because of the strong tradition for members of the U.S. military to remain apolitical, while the Pentagon's spokesman job often requires defending or explaining administration policy.

MEXICO'S NEW GUARD: Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador announced yesterday the government will recruit 50,000 civilians to serve in his country's new National Guard. In his first press conference of 2019, Lopez Obrador said the move would ""address the problem of insecurity and violence."" He also said the plan would be carried out over a period of three or four years.

CRITICS REMAIN CRITICAL: The top counterterrorism official who served in former President Barack Obama's White House warned yesterday that the current administration is failing to take national security seriously in terms of staffing in the West Wing. Lisa Monaco, who served as the White House homeland security and counterterrorism adviser from 2013-17, said the Trump administration's changes to the White House's approach to both counterterrorism and cybersecurity represent ""very dangerous departures"" from national security procedures.

MARINE ID'D: The Marine who died from an apparent accidental discharge of a gun at the Marine Barracks early New Year's Day has been identified as Lance Cpl. Riley S. Kuznia.

Kuznia, 20, was stationed at the Barracks where he served as a team leader for Guard Company. Kuznia is from Karlstad, Minn. His personal decorations include the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal and the National Defense Service Medal. The shooting incident remains under investigation.

0,"President Trump warned Friday that the southern U.S. border is now in a ""crisis situation"" that demands tougher border measures, in a letter sent to every member of Congress that he hopes will win support for his proposed border wall.

""As the enclosed presentation makes clear, current funding levels, resources, and authorities are woefully inadequate to meet the scope of the problem,"" Trump wrote to lawmakers. ""We are no longer in a status quo situation at the Southern Border but in a crisis situation. Status quo funding is not enough.""

He said construction of a border wall is ""absolutely critical"" to border security, and reminded lawmakers that many Democrats have supported a physical barrier before.

""Members of both parties -- including then Senators Obama and Clinton, current Senator Schumer, and many other members of the House and Senate -- all voted for a hard, physical barrier,"" he wrote. ""Walls work. That's why rich, powerful, and successful people build them around their homes. All Americans deserve the same protection. In Israel, it is 99 percent effective.""

""Senator Chuck Schumer once said 'Illegal immigration is wrong, plain and simple. Until the American people are convinced that we will stop future flows of illegal immigration, we will make no progress on dealing with the millions of illegal immigrants who are here now, and on rationalizing our system of legal immigration. That's plain and simple and unavoidable,'"" Trump added.

Trump also suggested other legal changes that would allow U.S. officials to detain families as a unit, and allow for the U.S. to return minors to their home countries when they are smuggled into the U.S.

Trump told lawmakers he was sending the letter in response to the refusal by House and Senate Democratic leaders to listen to a presentation on border security when they met with the president earlier this week. He provided a link to that presentation in his letter, which outlined the growing number of illegal crossings and detentions at the border.

""Some of those present did not want to hear the presentation at the time, and so I have instead decided to make the presentation available to all Members of Congress,"" Trump wrote to lawmakers, referring to the leadership meeting at the White House. ""I encourage you to review it carefully, to share it with your staff, and to discuss it with other lawmakers.""

The two parties are now locked in a battle over border wall funding, which has held up funding for nine agencies and departments that are now partially closed.

Democratic and Republican leaders from both parties were scheduled to meet with Trump this morning about the government funding impasse.

Below is Trump's full letter to Congress:

January 4, 2019

Dear Members of Congress:

Congratulations to Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and her entire team, on her election to be Speaker of the House. I look forward to working together on our shared priorities for the American People, including rebuilding our infrastructure, reforming unfair trade deals, and reducing the price of prescription drugs. Our recent bipartisan success on numerous legislative accomplishments such as Criminal Justice Reform, opioid legislation, and the Farm Bill, underscores the extraordinary achievements that are possible when we rise above party politics to advance the good of the Nation as a whole.

As we begin this new Congress, our first task should be to reopen the Government and to deliver on our highest duty as elected officials: the security of the Nation and its borders.

It is the sovereign right of every nation to establish an immigration program in its national interest -- lawfully admitting those who have followed the rules, while denying entry to those who break the rules or fail to meet the requirements established in law.

A nation that fails to control its borders cannot fulfill its most basic obligations to its citizens -- physical safety, economic security, essential public services, and the uniform protection of our laws.

I was grateful for the opportunity to meet with Congressional leadership at the White House this Wednesday to discuss the border security crisis, and the need for a government funding bill that secures the border and keeps Americans safe.

During the meeting, there was debate over the nature and extent of this crisis and its impact on Americans. It had been my hope that Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen would have the opportunity to deliver a presentation discussing the facts about the depth and severity of the humanitarian crisis and the security crisis that is now unfolding at the Southern Border.

However, some of those present did not want to hear the presentation at the time, and so I have instead decided to make the presentation available to all Members of Congress. I encourage you to review it carefully, to share it with your staff, and to discuss it with other lawmakers. In crafting a Homeland Security bill, it is essential that we make decisions based upon the facts on the ground -- not ideology and rhetoric -- and that we listen to the law enforcement personnel on the front lines. The Southern Border is a very dangerous place -- in fact, Border Patrol agents routinely encounter some of the most dangerous criminals, cartels, and traffickers anywhere in the world.

Effective border security must dramatically reduce the entry of illegal immigrants, criminals, and drugs; it must keep out terrorists, public safety threats, and those otherwise inadmissible under U.S. law; and it must ensure that those who do enter without legal permission can be promptly and safely returned home.

As the enclosed presentation makes clear, current funding levels, resources, and authorities are woefully inadequate to meet the scope of the problem. We are no longer in a status quo situation at the Southern Border but in a crisis situation. Status quo funding is not enough.

In fiscal year (FY) 2018, 17,000 adults at the border with existing criminal records were arrested by Customs and Border Protection (CBP) and border agents. In FY2017 and FY2018, ICE officers arrested approximately 235,000 aliens on various criminal charges or convictions within the interior of the United States -- including roughly 100,000 for assault, 30,000 for sex crimes, and 4,000 for homicides. We are now averaging 60,000 illegal and inadmissible aliens a month on our Southern Border. Last month alone, more than 20,000 minors were smuggled into the United States. The immigration court backlog is nearly 800,000 cases. There has been a 2,000 percent increase in asylum claims over the last five years, with the largest growth coming from Central America -- while around 9 in 10 claims from Central American migrants are ultimately rejected by the immigration courts, the applicant has long since been released into the interior of the United States. In FY2017, roughly 135,000 illegal and inadmissible family units arrived from Central America. Of those, less than 2 percent have been successfully removed from the country due to a shortage of resources and glaring loopholes in our federal laws. So far in FY2019, we have seen a 280 percent increase in family units from FY2018. 300 Americans are killed every week from heroin -- 90 percent of which floods across our Southern Border. Illegal immigration is a humanitarian crisis: 1 in 3 migrant women is sexually assaulted on the journey northward to the U.S. border; 50 illegal migrants a day are referred for emergency medical care; and CBP rescues 4,300 people a year who are in danger and distress.

Illegal immigration is NOT progressive -- by every measure, it is unfair, unjust, uncompassionate, and cruel. Many people are killed. It hurts both those who make the journey and so many communities bearing the cost in lives, safety, and dollars.

Senator Chuck Schumer once said: ""Illegal immigration is wrong, plain and simple. Until the American people are convinced that we will stop future flows of illegal immigration, we will make no progress on dealing with the millions of illegal immigrants who are here now, and on rationalizing our system of legal immigration. That's plain and simple and unavoidable.""

Absolutely critical to border security and national security is a wall or a physical barrier that prevents entry in the first place. Members of both parties -- including then Senators Obama and Clinton, current Senator Schumer, and many other members of the House and Senate -- all voted for a hard, physical barrier. Walls work. That's why rich, powerful, and successful people build them around their homes. All Americans deserve the same protection. In Israel, it is 99 percent effective.

We must also close the legal gaps in America's defenses. Loopholes in federal law that prevent removals provide a magnet for illegal entry, and a lucrative business model for vicious coyotes, while overwhelming the U.S. immigration system. The worst loopholes incentivize the smuggling of minors. Under these legal loopholes, if an illegal minor, or those traveling with a minor, merely set foot on United States soil, they cannot be successfully returned home. This explains the profound increases in the arrival of minors travelling both alone and with adults on the dangerous journey to our border.

To protect these children from abuse, and stop this illegal flow, we must close these loopholes. This is an urgent humanitarian necessity. Children are terribly used by criminals and coyotes to gain access to our country -- they are the biggest victims of all.

The most pressing legal changes are as follows:

Terminate the Flores Settlement Agreement -- which is preventing families from being held together through removal; and Amend the Trafficking Victims Protection Reauthorization Act (TVPRA), to allow for the safe and humane return of illegally-smuggled minors back to their families in their home countries.

Americans have endured decades of broken promises on illegal immigration. Now, is the time for both parties to rise above the partisan discord, to set aside political convenience, and to put the national interest first. Now is the time -- this is the moment -- to finally secure the border and create the lawful and safe immigration system Americans, and those wanting to become Americans, deserve.

Sincerely,

DONALD J. TRUMP",62
0,"WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump and Democratic congressional leaders dug in Wednesday for a lengthy partial shutdown in a newly divided government after a White House meeting -- the first in 22 days -- yielded no agreement on a way to break an impasse over Trump's demands for billions of dollars for a border wall.

During the contentious meeting in the Situation Room, Trump made his case for a wall on the southwestern border and rejected Democrats' proposals for reopening the government while the two sides ironed out their differences.

""I would look foolish if I did that,"" Trump responded after Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, posed the question to Trump directly, according to three officials familiar with the meeting, who described it on the condition of anonymity. He said that the wall was why he was elected, one of the officials said.

Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, said after the meeting that he had no intention of putting Democratic bills to reopen the government to a vote if Trump would not sign them.

""We're hopeful that, somehow, in the coming days and weeks, we'll be able to reach an agreement,"" McConnell told reporters at the Capitol, offering an ominous timeline.

The events underscored the personal and political crosscurrents standing in the way of any compromise between a president unwilling to lose face with his core supporters on his signature c a m pa i g n p ro m i s e and newly empowered Democrats -- poised to assume control of the House on Thursday -- who refuse to give ground on an issue that has come to symbolize Trump's immigration policies.

With the partial government funding lapse dragging into its 12th day and affecting 800,000 federal employees, the confrontation in the Situation Room only served to highlight the depth of the divide.

""Could be a long time, or it could be quickly,"" Trump said of resolving the shutdown. ""It's too important a subject to walk away from.""

Rep. Nancy Pelosi of California, who is in line to be elected speaker Thursday, said: ""We are asking the president to open up government. Why would he not do it?""

""He could not give a good answer,"" Schumer said of the president.

Trump tried creative ways to persuade the Democrats that they should support his wall. At one point, he said Pelosi should back it because she was ""a good Catholic"" and Vatican City is surrounded by a wall, according to one of the officials familiar with the discussion.

In her first legislative act as speaker, Pelosi plans Thursday to bring up two bills to reopen the government. One would fund the Department of Homeland Security through Feb. 8, providing a month to break the impasse over border security funding, and a second would provide money for the remaining shuttered agencies and departments through September. The homeland security measure would devote $1.3 billion to border security measures, such as enhanced surveillance and fortified fencing, but not the wall.

Trump's rejection of those measures left the prospects of a resolution at their dimmest since the shutdown began Dec. 22. It also highlighted the difficulty of the situation, in which Democrats, Republicans and even some White House staff members have found themselves trying to anticipate what Trump will accept.

Rep. Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., the incoming minority leader, said the group would meet again Friday, although Democratic officials said they had received no formal invitation to do so.

In a pair of evening tweets, Trump seemed to hold out hope of an agreement, writing: ""I remain ready and willing to work with Democrats to pass a bill that secures our borders, supports the agents and officers on the ground, and keeps America Safe. Let's get it done!""

But the path to such a deal seemed murky at best.

Before he met congressional leaders Wednesday, Trump vetoed a compromise that his own vice president floated with Democrats last month to stave off the government funding lapse, saying $2.5 billion in border security spending was insufficient. In the hours before a midnight deadline to avert a shutdown before Christmas, Vice President Mike Pence had broached that number, which his team has quietly continued to push in the days after parts of the government ran out of money.",63
0,"US President Donald Trump's budget director and chief of staff on Sunday said the partial US government shutdown could continue to Jan. 3, when the new Congress convenes and Democrats take over the House of Representatives.

""It's very possible this shutdown will go beyond (December) the 28th and into the new Congress,"" Mick Mulvaney said on Fox News Sunday.

""I don't think things are going to move very quickly here for the next few days"" because of the Christmas holiday, added Mulvaney, who serves as director of the Office of Management and Budget and was named acting White House chief of staff 10 days ago.

The US Senate adjourned on Saturday, unable to break an impasse over Trump's demand for more funds for a wall on the border with Mexico that Democrats are unwilling to accept.

Mulvaney said the White House made a ""counter-offer"" to Democrats on funding for border security that fell between the Democratic offer of $1.3 billion and Trump's demand for $5 billion.

As part of those talks on Saturday, Vice President Mike Pence offered to drop the demand for $5 billion for a border wall, substituting instead $2.1 billion, ABC News reported, citing unnamed sources.

A Democratic source familiar with the negotiations said real discussions have been happening between Democratic lawmakers and Republican Senator Richard Shelby, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, who has been talking to the White House. It was unclear what Democrats had offered.

Mulvaney sought to shift blame for the partial shutdown to Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic nominee for speaker of the US House of Representatives, saying she might hold up negotiations to ensure she secures the position.

""I think she's in that unfortunate position of being beholden to her left wing to where she cannot be seen as agreeing with the president on anything until after she is speaker,"" Mulvaney said. ""If that's the case, again, there's a chance we go into the next Congress.""

Pelosi spokesman Drew Hammill disputed that account, saying in a statement: ""As Mr. Mulvaney well knows, House Democrats are united in their opposition to the President's immoral, expensive and ineffective wall.""

The White House should ""stop the posturing and start serious bipartisan talks,"" Hammill said.

Financing for about a quarter of federal government programs - including the departments of Homeland Security, Justice and Agriculture - expired at midnight on Friday. More than 400,000 ""essential"" employees in those agencies will work without pay until the dispute is resolved. Another 380,000 will be ""furloughed,"" meaning they are put on temporary leave.

Law enforcement efforts, border patrols, mail delivery and airport operations will keep running.

Building a wall to try to prevent migrants from entering the United States illegally was a central plank of Trump's presidential campaign, but Democrats are vehemently opposed and have rejected his funding request.

Trump reiterated his push for border security on Sunday, saying on Twitter that ""the only way"" to stop drugs, gangs, and human trafficking at the border was with a wall or barrier.""Drones and all of the rest are wonderful and lots of fun, but it is only a good old fashioned Wall that works!,"" the president said in the tweet.

Earlier in the week, leaders in both the Senate and House thought they had reached a deal that Trump would sign that contained less money for border security, only to watch the president, under pressure from conservatives, re-assert his demand for $5 billion at the last minute.

Senator David Perdue, a Republican from Georgia on the Senate Banking Committee, said on Fox News' ""Sunday Morning Futures"" that he thought a deal this week was possible.

""I spoke to the president last night, he wants that,"" Purdue said, adding: ""I'm hopeful that cooler heads will prevail and we'll get to some number between $1.6 (billion) and $5 billion on that.""",64

After Democratic congressional leaders turned Trump down at a meeting in the White House Situation Room, the Republican president threatened to take the controversial step of using emergency powers to build the wall without approval from Congress.

Trump is withholding his support for a bill that would fully fund the government until he secures the money for the wall. As a result around 800,000 public workers have been unpaid, with about a quarter of the federal government closed for two weeks.

Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said Democrats had told Trump during the meeting to end the shutdown. ""He resisted,"" Schumer said. ""In fact, he said he'd keep the government closed for a very long period of time, months or even years.""

Trump confirmed that comment but painted a more positive picture of the meeting, the first since a new era of divided government began when Democrats took control of the House of Representatives on Thursday.

""We had a very, very productive meeting, and we've come a long way,"" Trump said.

But raising the stakes in his tussle with the newly emboldened Democrats, Trump threatened extraordinary measures to build the wall, which he says is needed to stem the flow of illegal immigrants and drugs into the United States.

Asked by a reporter whether he had considered declaring a national emergency to build the wall, Trump said: ""Yes, I have ... I may do it ... we can call a national emergency and build it very quickly.""

He said he could declare a national emergency ""because of the security of our country, absolutely.""

The US Constitution assigns Congress the power over funding the federal government so Trump likely would face legal challenges if he tried to bypass Congress on financing the wall. Building a wall - and having Mexico pay for it - was one of Trump's main promises when he ran for president in 2016.

Trump's wall project is estimated to cost about $23 billion.

Democrats have called the wall immoral, ineffective and medieval.

Nancy Pelosi, the newly elected Democratic speaker of the House, said Friday's meeting with Trump was ""sometimes contentious"" but that they agreed to continue talking.

""But we recognise on the Democratic side that we really cannot resolve this until we open up government and we made that very clear to the president,"" she said.

Credit rating agency Moody's says the shutdown will cause minimal US economic and credit market disruption but there could be a more severe impact on financial markets and the broad economy if the closure is protracted.

House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy told reporters that Trump had named Vice President Mike Pence, senior aide Jared Kushner and Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen to work over the weekend. The partial shutdown is straining the country's immigration system, worsening backlogs in courts and complicating hiring for employers. Federal agencies such as the Justice Department, Commerce Department and departments of Agriculture, Labor, Interior and Treasury have been hit by the shutdown.

0,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - No agreement came out of a meeting between U.S. congressional leaders and President Donald Trump on Wednesday to end a partial government shutdown now in its 12th day as the president stuck to his demand for $5 billion in border wall funding fiercely opposed by Democrats.

Congressional leaders are expected to return to the White House on Friday to resume talks, signalling the shutdown will likely stretch into the weekend.

The White House convened the meeting to try to convince Democrats that funding a wall on the southern border with Mexico was a pressing security need. Instead, Democratic leaders cut off Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Neilsen's presentation and tried to no avail to press Trump to accept their offer.

""It just was not a credible presentation,"" Senator Dick Durbin said of the briefing. He added that Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi, who is expected to be elected House speaker on Thursday, insisted the conversation focus instead on the shutdown.

Pelosi said the House would proceed with plans to hold votes on Thursday, when they formally take control of the chamber from Trump's fellow Republicans, on legislation that would end the shutdown without providing the wall money sought by Trump.

""We're asking the president to open up government,"" Pelosi told reporters outside the White House after the meeting.

But Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said afterward on the Senate floor that the chamber would not vote on the legislation, calling it a ""political sideshow"" and ""total nonstarter.""

Democrats say they want to fund most of the government through September, but allow for another month to negotiate wall funding by only partially funding the Department of Homeland Security, which is responsible for the wall.

Schumer said Trump conceded that Republicans would lose leverage if they allowed the rest of the government to be funded.

""We asked him to give us one good reason ... why you should continue your shutdown of the eight Cabinet departments while we are debating our differences on homeland security. He could not give a good answer,"" Schumer told reporters after the meeting.

In a tweet on Wednesday evening, Trump called the meeting ""important"" and said he would continue talks with Democrats ""to pass a bill that secures our borders, supports the agents and officers on the ground, and keeps America Safe.""

Trump's demand for $5 billion in funding for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border triggered the shutdown affecting about a quarter of the federal government and 800,000 federal workers.

Before meeting with lawmakers, Trump said the shutdown would last for ""as long as it takes"" as he pushes for wall money as part of any legislation to reopen agencies shuttered when their funding lapsed on Dec. 22.

""It could be a long time,"" Trump told reporters on Wednesday during a Cabinet meeting, ""or it could be quickly.""

""We know that we have a challenge along the border,"" said Kevin McCarthy, the top House Republican. ""We want to solve that issue. We want to make sure we open this government up. And I think at the end of the day, the president, listening to him, he wants to solve this as well.""

Pelosi noted that the legislation being presented in the House had previously won backing in the Senate, which will remain in Republican hands in the new 2019-2020 Congress that convenes on Thursday.

But McConnell said previously that Senate Republicans would not approve a spending measure Trump does not support.

Trump made the border wall a key part of his presidential campaign. Before meeting with the Democrats, Trump called the border a ""sieve,"" rebutted Pelosi's complaint that a wall was immoral, provided an estimate of the U.S. illegal immigrant population far higher than the figures most experts cite and made disputed comments about progress towards building a wall.

The visit by Pelosi and Schumer was their first to the White House since their sharp exchange with Trump in the Oval Office on Dec. 11 during which the president told them he would be ""proud to shut down the government for border security.""

He has since blamed Democrats for the shutdown.

Earlier in the week, leaders in both the Senate and House thought they had reached a deal that Trump would sign that contained less money for border security, only to watch the president, under pressure from conservatives, re-assert his demand for $5 billion at the last minute.

Senator David Perdue, a Republican from Georgia on the Senate Banking Committee, said on Fox News' ""Sunday Morning Futures"" that he thought a deal this week was possible.

""I spoke to the president last night, he wants that,"" Purdue said, adding: ""I'm hopeful that cooler heads will prevail and we'll get to some number between $1.6 (billion) and $5 billion on that.""",72

The White House meeting between President Donald Trump and top Congressional leaders on resolving the ongoing partial government shutdown ended in a stalemate Wednesday, with Republicans and Democrats sticking to their respective positions over the presidential demand for a US-Mexico border wall.

The President is seeking USD 5.2 billion in funding for the wall which according to him is a must to prevent flow of illegal immigrants into the US.

The Democrats assert that such a move is a ""waste"" of taxpayers' money.

Following their inconclusive Situation Room meeting, Congressional leaders and Trump agreed to meet again on Friday.

Newly elected members of the Congress are scheduled to be sworn in Thursday; the first day of the 116th Congress. Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi is all set to be elected as the Speaker of the US House of Representatives.

""Important meeting today on Border Security with Republican and Democrat Leaders in Congress. Both parties must work together to pass a Funding Bill that protects this Nation and its people this is the first and most important duty of government,"" Trump said in a tweet after the meeting.

""I remain ready and willing to work with Democrats to pass a bill that secures our borders, supports the agents and officers on the ground, and keeps America Safe. Let's get it done!"" said the US President.

Pelosi told reporters at the White House after the meeting that she plans to go ahead with the Democratic legislation on a spending bill without funding for a border wall. Beginning Thursday, Democrats would enjoy majority in the House of Representatives.

""We are asking the president to open up the government. We are giving him a Republican path to do that. Why would he not do it?"" Pelosi told reporters at the White House.

""Democrats have been committed to protecting our borders. It's the oath of office we take to protect and defend. It has been very important to us, and we have committed resources to it when we were in the majority, and will continue to do so,"" she said.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said the Democrats asked the President to support the bills that they support that will open up government.

""We asked him to give us one good reason -- I asked him directly. I said, Mr President, give me one good reason why you should continue your shutdown of these -- of the eight cabinet departments while we are debating our differences on Homeland Security? He could not give a good answer,"" he said.

""So, we would hope that they would reconsider and would support the very bills that passed the Senate, four of them 92 to 6, two of them unanimously, in the Appropriations Committee with Mitch McConnell's support,"" he said.

""The only reason that they are shutting down the government is very simple. They want to try and leverage that shutdown into their proposals on border security. We want strong border security. We believe ours our better. But to use the shutdown as hostage, which they had no argument against, is wrong,"" Schumer said.

Senator Majority Leader Mitch McConnell later said that no progress was made Wednesday in the meeting with Trump. Not very optimistic, he said that the partial government shutdown now into its 12th day could continue for even weeks. ""It was a civil discussion. We're hopeful that somehow in the coming days and weeks we'll be able to reach an agreement,"" he said.

The partial government shutdown that started on December 22 has affected 800,000 federal employees, who have either been furloughed or are working without pay.

0,"President Donald Trump and senior Democrats failed to strike a deal in talks on Friday to end a partial shutdown of the U.S. government as they again fought over Trump's request for $5 billion to fund his signature wall on the Mexican border.

After Democratic congressional leaders turned Trump down at a meeting in the White House Situation Room, the Republican president threatened to take the controversial step of using emergency powers to build the wall without approval from Congress.

Trump is withholding his support for a bill that would fully fund the government until he secures the money for the wall and as a result about 800,000 federal workers have been unpaid due to the closure of about a quarter of the federal government.

Administration officials, led by Vice President Mike Pence, and congressional staffers are to meet during the weekend to try to end the impasse over the 2-week-old shutdown.

Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said Democrats had told Trump during the meeting to end the shutdown. ""He resisted,"" Schumer said. ""In fact, he said he'd keep the government closed for a very long period of time, months or even years.""

Trump confirmed that comment but painted a more positive picture of the meeting, the first since a new era of divided government began when Democrats took control of the House of Representatives on Thursday.

""We had a very, very productive meeting, and we've come a long way,"" Trump said.

But raising the stakes in his tussle with the newly emboldened Democrats, Trump threatened extraordinary measures to build the wall, which he says is needed to stem the flow of illegal immigrants and drugs into the United States.

Asked by a reporter whether he had considered declaring a national emergency to build the wall, Trump said: ""Yes, I have... I may do it ... But we can call a national emergency and build it very quickly.""

He said he could declare a national emergency ""because of the security of our country, absolutely.""

The U.S. Constitution assigns Congress the power over funding the federal government so Trump likely would face legal challenges if he tried to bypass Congress on financing the wall. Building a wall - and having Mexico pay for it - was one of Trump's main promises when he ran for president in 2016.

Trump's wall project is estimated to cost about $23 billion.

Democrats have called the wall immoral, ineffective and medieval.

Nancy Pelosi, the newly elected Democratic speaker of the House, said Friday's meeting with Trump was ""sometimes contentious"" but that they agreed to continue talking.

""But we recognize on the Democratic side that we really cannot resolve this until we open up government and we made that very clear to the president,"" she said.

Credit rating agency Moody's says the shutdown will cause minimal U.S. economic and credit market disruption but there could be a more severe impact on financial markets and the broad economy if the closure is protracted.

A Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll last week showed that 50 percent of the public blame Trump for the shutdown and 7 percent blame Republican lawmakers, against 32 percent who blame Democrats.

In a Dec 11 meeting with Pelosi and Schumer, Trump said he would be ""proud"" to shut the government over the security issue and would not blame Democrats. He has since said they are responsible.

The partial shutdown is straining the country's immigration system, worsening backlogs in courts and complicating hiring for employers.

Federal agencies such as the Justice Department, Commerce Department and departments of Agriculture, Labor, Interior and Treasury have been hit by the shutdown.

0,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump said on Friday he could use emergency powers to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border without Congress' approval, threatening to bypass Democratic lawmakers emboldened by their recent takeover of the House of Representatives.

A showdown between Trump and Congressional Democrats over funding for his wall project has led to a two-week government shutdown. Trump says he will not support a bill to fully fund the government until he secures the money for the wall.

Asked whether he had considered declaring a national emergency to build the wall, Trump said: ""Yes, I have. ... We can do it. I haven't done it. I may do it ... But we can call a national emergency and build it very quickly.""

He dismissed those concerns in a news briefing at the White House.

0,"WASHINGTON -- The U.S. Coast Guard saw a nearly fivefold increase in the number of migrants it intercepted off the coast of southern California in 2018, underscoring the challenge that will remain in stopping illegal migration even if President Donald Trump secures funding for his southern border wall.

The numbers, released to The Washington Post in recent days, show the service intercepted 1,022 migrants at sea there in the fiscal year ending Sept. 30. That was up from 213 in 2017 and 142 in 2016.

Nationwide, the number of migrant intercepts at sea dropped from 2,512 in 2017 to 1,668 in 2018, indicating a shift in which more migrants are now intercepted off the West Coast. The majority of migrants taken into custody there come from Central and South America, while migrants caught along the East Coast are more likely to come from Haiti or other islands in the Caribbean Sea.

A Coast Guard spokesman, Chief Warrant Officer 4 Barry Lane, said that the migrants intercepted at sea in 2018 come from numerous countries in the Western Hemisphere, including Mexico, Ecuador, Bolivia, Colombia and Guatemala. Others came from farther away nations that include China, Sri Lanka, India and Jordan, he said.

For years, the Coast Guard intercepted more migrants off the coast of Florida than anywhere else. Those numbers plummeted in 2017, after the Obama administration normalized diplomatic relations with Cuba and ended the so-called wet-foot, dry-foot policy that allowed most Cubans who made the 90-mile trip by sea to pursue legal residency.

The service also intercepted 209,000 kilograms of cocaine at sea in 2018, falling just behind its record grab of 223,843 kilograms in 2017. The majority of those drugs are interdicted by a handful of Coast Guard cutters in the eastern Pacific Ocean, as they meet ships heading from Central and South America.

Intercepts at sea represent a fraction of a much larger trend. Customs and Border Protection reported 415,517 total apprehensions at the southern border in fiscal 2017, and 521,090 more in fiscal in 2018. More than 60,000 migrants were arrested in each of the last three months attempting to enter the country illegally.

But the statistics will still serve as new fodder for advocates of the Coast Guard, whose service members are among the federal employees working without pay amid a partial government shutdown caused by a political dispute over President Trump's proposed southern border wall. Service members are due a pay check on Tuesday, and unlikely to get their money. The shutdown was 24 days old - and the longest in U.S. history - as of Monday.

Although the service is considered a part of the U.S. military, it has no funding because it is part of the Department of Homeland Security. Most other branches of service are part of the Defense Department, which has funding approved.

The shutdown also has threatened the pensions of Coast Guard veterans. Adm. Charles Ray, the service's No. 2 officer, said in an email to retirees on Saturday that there is the ""distinct possibility"" that retiree pay and money for the Survivor's Benefit Plan, an insurance policy for the surviving spouses of Coast Guard veterans, may be delayed if the shutdown continues into late January.

""Please be assured that we are continuing to work closely with the Department of Homeland Security, the Administration, and Congress to reduce the impacts of this funding lapse on our Coast Guard workforce - past and present - and I will keep you informed as additional information becomes available,"" Ray wrote.

The shutdown has put other strains on the service, as Trump seeks funding for the wall. The president has promised to fund new polar icebreaker ships for the Coast Guard, but funding for them is no longer a certainty. A Senate appropriations bill passed last year included $750 million for the first ship, but the House version did not include the money. It is not clear whether the money will be included if a spending bill makes it to the White House.

The Coast Guard commandant, Adm. Karl Schultz, has posted a series of social-media messages in recent days as he seeks to reassure the force.

""While our Coast Guard workforce is deployed, there are loved ones at home reviewing family finances, researching how to get support, and weighing childcare options - they are holding down the fort,"" he wrote Sunday on Facebook.

0,"Assailing President Donald Trump for ""a crisis of leadership,"" former Obama cabinet member Julian Castro joined the 2020 presidential race Saturday as the rush of Democrats making early moves to challenge the incumbent accelerates, while anticipation grows around bigger names still considering a White House run.

Castro, who could end up being the only Latino in what is shaping up to be a crowded Democratic field, made immigration a centerpiece of his announcement in his hometown of San Antonio, less than 200 miles from the US-Mexico border.

Two days after the president visited the border to promote his promised wall, Castro mocked Trump for claiming that the US faces an ""invasion"" from its ally to the south. ""He called it a national security crisis,"" Castro said. ""Well, there is a crisis today. It's a crisis of leadership. Donald Trump has failed to uphold the values of our great nation.""

Castro, the 44-year-old grandson of a Mexican immigrant, said he was running for president ""because it's time for new leadership, because it's time for new energy and it's time for a new commitment to make sure that the opportunities that I've had are available to every American.""

He made the announcement as a government shutdown drags into the longest in US history, and as the field of 2020 contenders widens.

Castro was San Antonio's mayor for five years and US housing secretary in President Barack Obama's second term. He became the second Democrat to formally enter race, after former Maryland Rep. John Delaney.

Castro doesn't have much policy experience relating to Israel, but he's visited and has spoken in general terms of admiration for the Jewish state. When he visited Israel as mayor of San Antonio, Texas, in July 2011, then-president Shimon Peres held an official ceremony welcoming him.

""Israel's is an inspiring story, because if Israel, given the challenging circumstances it operates under can excel in a 21st century economy, certainly communities in the United States like San Antonio can do so as well,"" Castro told reporters at the time. ""It was eye-opening for me in terms of how a nation can overcome diversity, how they can come together and create something truly amazing in terms of entrepreneurship, and it spoke to me about what San Antonio can accomplish.""

Castro was reportedly so impressed by Saul Singer and Dan Senor's book ""Start-Up Nation: The Story of Israel's Economic Miracle"" that he decided to take a San Antonio delegation to learn from the country more directly.

But other than that, he has never been in a position to execute foreign policy, and has not been vocal or specific about any particular policy positions on the Israeli-Palestinian conflict or other regional issues.

Interviewed by Hadassah Magazine in January 2013, he defended President Obama's approach toward Israel, along with his handling of the Iranian nuclear threat, without going into details about policy.

""The president is a strong supporter of Israel, and through his leadership the United States has maintained a very close connection [and] has made a very big investment in ensuring that Israel continues to be stable and secure."" he said.

""The United States and Israel share a common goal with most of the rest of the world that Iran never secures nuclear weapons,"" he added. ""I don't believe it will happen as long as we are vigilant and remain committed to the goal. The US will always stand for a strong Israel and ensure that Iran doesn't have nuclear weapons.""

Castro is getting an early start in trying to stand out. His first trip as a candidate comes Monday, to hurricane-ravaged Puerto Rico, where an outcry has begun as the White House considers diverting disaster funding to pay for the wall.

The impasse over paying for a border wall that Trump made a central part of his 2016 campaign has led to the partial federal closure. That stalemate, along with Trump's hard-line immigration stands, drew sharp rebukes from Castro.

""There are serious issues that need to be addressed in our broken immigration system, but seeking asylum is a legal right. And the cruel policies of this administration are doing real and lasting harm,"" he said.

He argued for securing the border in a ""smart and humane way.""

""There is no way in hell that caging babies is a smart or a right or good way to do it. We say no to building a wall and say yes to building community. We say no to scapegoating immigrants, and yes to 'Dreamers,' yes to keeping families together."" There are about 700,000 young ""Dreamers"" who were brought into the US illegally as children; advocates want to provide them with protection deportation and a chance to apply for citizenship.

Joining Castro at the campaign kickoff was his twin brother, Democratic Rep. Joaquin Castro, chairman of the Hispanic congressional caucus and a frequent Trump critic. The Spanish-style plaza in the Castro twins' boyhood neighborhood was packed with supporters who streamed through the gates between a mariachi band. Castro had said leading up to his announcement that a Latino candidate was a must in the 2020 field.

That group of hopefuls is starting to take shape even though the first primary elections are more than a year away.

Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts has also started an exploratory committee for president, and four other Democratic senators are taking steady steps toward running. Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard, the first Hindu elected to Congress, said this week she is planning a bid, too.

Sen. Kamala Harris of California this past week published a memoir, a staple of presidential candidates. Former Texas Rep. Beto O'Rourke is doing little to dim speculation that he might jump into a field that has no clear front-runner.

Castro is aware he lacks the name recognition of potential 2020 rivals or the buzz surrounding O'Rourke, whose flirtations with 2020 have tantalized donors and activists after a close race last year against Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas.

Even some supporters at Castro's announcement could be torn if O'Rourke gets in the race. Diana Delrosario, a social worker in San Antonio, warned she might cry while she recounted how Castro once went out of his way as mayor to help wheel her mother out of a restaurant.

""I have this heart for Julian. But it's going to be a big discussion if Beto decides to run,"" said Delrosario, 45.

Castro, who has repeatedly dismissed talk that an O'Rourke candidacy would complicate his own chances, has framed the neighborhood and his upbringing as the story of an underdog.

He was raised by a local Latina activist, and after a brief career in law, was elected mayor of the nation's seventh-largest city at 34. It wasn't long before Democrats nationally embraced him as a star in the making, particularly one from Texas, where a booming Hispanic population is rapidly changing the state's demographics and improving the party's fortunes.

Castro delivered the keynote speech at the 2012 Democratic National Convention. Two years later, President Barack Obama picked him to lead the Department of Housing and Urban Development.

He was on the short list of Hillary Clinton's potential running mates in 2016. During Castro's trip this past week to Nevada, one state Latino business leader told Castro that he should again be a top contender for vice president if his campaign falls short.

Like other Democrats running, Castro has said he will not accept money from political action committees tied to corporations and unions, and he has sought to introduce himself to voters as a champion for universal health care and affordable housing.",82

""I can't tell you when the government is going to reopen,"" he said. ""I can tell you it's not going to be open until we have a wall, a fence, whatever they'd like to call it. I'll call it whatever they want. But it's all the same thing. It's a barrier from people pouring into our country.""

He added, ""If you don't have that, then we're just not opening.""

Trump made his comments to reporters during a Christmas photo sessions in the Oval Office, where he spoke by video teleconference with service members from all five branches of the armed forces who are stationed in Alaska, Bahrain, Guam and Qatar.

All told, about 800,000 of 2.1 million federal workers nationwide -- or more than a third -- are estimated to be affected in some way by the shutdown. Trump claimed that many of them support the shutdown.

""Many of those workers have said to me, communicated -- stay out until you get the funding for the wall,"" Trump said. ""These federal workers want the wall.""

But his claim conflicts with the accounts of federal workers' union leaders.

""Federal employees should not have to pay the personal price for all of this dysfunction,"" said Tony Reardon, president of the National Treasury Employees Union, which represents 150,000 members at 33 federal agencies and departments. ""This shutdown is a travesty. Congress and the White House have not done their fundamental jobs of keeping the government open.""

In a survey of 1,500 union members, about 85 percent said they have limited holiday season spending or are planning to do so because of uncertainty about income, Reardon said on Christmas Eve. He said they include one who said ""I have recently lost my wife and now . . .. I have to put off buying her headstone. Breaks my heart.""

Another responded, ""I can't buy any Christmas presents and am considering returning those I already have. Mortgage companies and utility companies won't wait to get paid,"" according to Reardon.

Again on Tuesday, Trump tried to place blame for Washington's budget stalemate solely on Democrats, portraying their leaders as disingenuous and claiming that they support the notion of a physical barrier along the border and object to building the wall only because it is Trump's idea.

Trump likened the situation to his May 2017 firing of James Comey as FBI director, saying ""Democrats hated him"" until he was fired and then Comey was treated as a hero.

Even as he vowed to keep the government closed to secure wall funding, Trump claimed that much of his envisioned wall was already being built. He said he had awarded a contract ""at a great price"" for a 115-mile section of wall in Texas and plans to visit the site in January for ""a ground-breaking"" ceremony.

Administration officials have provided no details about this construction project or the terms of the contract.

Trump said he hopes to have all portions of the wall completed -- either old fencing renovated or new construction -- by Election Day 2020, an indication that he sees building the wall chiefly as a political issue tied to his reelection chances.

Trump said Tuesday that the wall as he envisions it would be a fortress that no normal human could breach.

""Now there may be the case of an Olympic champion who can get over the wall, but for the most part you are not able to do it,"" he said. ""Very high. It's gonna be 30 feet. Much of it is 30 feet high. Some if it's low. But in some areas we have it as high as 30 feet. That's like a three-story building.""",83
0,"WASHINGTON -- The U.S. Coast Guard saw a nearly fivefold increase in the number of migrants it intercepted off the coast of southern California in 2018, underscoring the challenge that will remain in stopping illegal migration even if President Donald Trump secures funding for his southern border wall.

The numbers, released to The Washington Post in recent days, show the service intercepted 1,022 migrants at sea there in the fiscal year ending Sept. 30. That was up from 213 in 2017 and 142 in 2016.

Nationwide, the number of migrant intercepts at sea dropped from 2,512 in 2017 to 1,668 in 2018, indicating a shift in which more migrants are now intercepted off the West Coast. The majority of migrants taken into custody there come from Central and South America, while migrants caught along the East Coast are more likely to come from Haiti or other islands in the Caribbean Sea.

['My husband is in the middle of the ocean. If you're not going to pay him, send him home.']

A Coast Guard spokesman, Chief Warrant Officer 4 Barry Lane, said that the migrants intercepted at sea in 2018 come from numerous countries in the Western Hemisphere, including Mexico, Ecuador, Bolivia, Colombia and Guatemala. Others came from farther away nations that include China, Sri Lanka, India and Jordan, he said.

For years, the Coast Guard intercepted more migrants off the coast of Florida than anywhere else. Those numbers plummeted in 2017, after the Obama administration normalized diplomatic relations with Cuba and ended the so-called wet-foot, dry-foot policy that allowed most Cubans who made the 90-mile trip by sea to pursue legal residency.

The service also intercepted 209,000 kilograms of cocaine at sea in 2018, falling just behind its record grab of 223,843 kilograms in 2017. The majority of those drugs are interdicted by a handful of Coast Guard cutters in the eastern Pacific Ocean, as they meet ships heading from Central and South America.

Intercepts at sea represent a fraction of a much larger trend. Customs and Border Protection reported 415,517 total apprehensions at the southern border in fiscal 2017, and 521,090 more in fiscal in 2018. More than 60,000 migrants were arrested in each of the last three months attempting to enter the country illegally.

But the statistics will still serve as new fodder for advocates of the Coast Guard, whose service members are among the federal employees working without pay amid a partial government shutdown caused by a political dispute over Trump's proposed southern border wall. Service members are due a pay check on Tuesday, and unlikely to get their money. The shutdown was 24 days old -- and the longest in U.S. history -- as of Monday.

['I don't know who I can put off': Stress mounts for Coast Guard families working without pay]

Although the service is considered a part of the U.S. military, it has no funding because it is part of the Department of Homeland Security. Most other branches of service are part of the Defense Department, which has funding approved.

The shutdown also has threatened the pensions of Coast Guard veterans. Adm. Charles Ray, the service's No. 2 officer, said in an email to retirees on Saturday that there is the ""distinct possibility"" that retiree pay and money for the Survivor's Benefit Plan, an insurance policy for the surviving spouses of Coast Guard veterans, may be delayed if the shutdown continues into late January.

""Please be assured that we are continuing to work closely with the Department of Homeland Security, the Administration, and Congress to reduce the impacts of this funding lapse on our Coast Guard workforce -- past and present -- and I will keep you informed as additional information becomes available,"" Ray wrote.

The shutdown has put other strains on the service, as Trump seeks funding for the wall. The president has promised to fund new polar icebreaker ships for the Coast Guard, but funding for them is no longer a certainty. A Senate appropriations bill passed last year included $750 million for the first ship, but the House version did not include the money. It is not clear whether the money will be included if a spending bill makes it to the White House.

[Coast Guard families told they can have garage sales to cope with government shutdown]

The Coast Guard commandant, Adm. Karl Schultz, has posted a series of social-media messages in recent days as he seeks to reassure the force.

""I recognize that there is anxiety & uncertainty about the status of your pay this evening,"" Shultz tweeted Monday night. ""Your senior leadership team continues to work on your behalf. We will provide an additional update by 1200 EST. Continue standing the watch -- I am proud of your unwavering devotion to duty.""",84
0,"Budget director and chief of staff Mick Mulvaney said stand-off could continue to January 3

President Donald Trump's budget director and chief of staff on Sunday said the partial US government shutdown could continue to January 3, when the new Congress convenes and Democrats take over the House of Representatives.

""It's very possible this shutdown will go beyond the 28th and into the new Congress,"" Mick Mulvaney said on Fox News Sunday.

""I don't think things are going to move very quickly here for the next few days"" because of the Christmas holiday, added Mr Mulvaney, who serves as director of the Office of Management and Budget and was named acting White House chief of staff 10 days ago.

The US Senate adjourned on Saturday unable to break an impasse over Mr Trump's demand for more funds for a wall on the border with Mexico that Democrats are unwilling to accept.

Mr Mulvaney said the White House made a ""counteroffer"" to Democrats on funding for border security that fell between the Democratic offer of $1.3 billion and Mr Trump's demand for $5 billion.

As part of those talks on Saturday, vice president Mike Pence offered to drop the demand for $5 billion for a border wall, substituting instead $2.1 billion, ABC News reported citing unnamed sources.

Mr Mulvaney sought to shift blame for the partial shutdown to Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic nominee for speaker of the US House of Representatives, saying she might hold up negotiations to ensure she secures the position.

""I think she's in that unfortunate position of being beholden to her left wing to where she cannot be seen as agreeing with the president on anything until after she is speaker,"" Mr Mulvaney said. ""If that's the case, again, there's a chance we go into the next Congress.""

Ms Pelosi's spokesman Drew Hammill disputed that account, saying in a statement: ""As Mr Mulvaney well knows, House Democrats are united in their opposition to the President's immoral, expensive and ineffective wall.""

The White House should ""stop the posturing and start serious bipartisan talks,"" Mr Hammill said.

Financing for about a quarter of federal government programs - including the departments of Homeland Security, Justice and Agriculture - expired at midnight on Friday. More than 400,000 'essential' employees in those agencies will work without pay until the dispute is resolved. Another 380,000 will be ""furloughed"", meaning they are put on temporary leave.

Law enforcement efforts, border patrols, mail delivery and airport operations will keep running.

Building a wall to keep migrants from entering the United States illegally was a central plank of Mr Trump's presidential campaign, but Democrats are vehemently opposed and have rejected his funding request.

Mr Trump reiterated his push for border security on Sunday, saying on Twitter that ""the only way"" to stop drugs, gangs, and human trafficking at the border was with a wall or barrier.

""Drones and all of the rest are wonderful and lots of fun, but it is only a good old fashioned Wall that works!,"" the president said in the tweet.

Earlier in the week, leaders in both the Senate and House of Representatives thought they had reached a deal that Trump would sign that contained less money for border security, only to watch the president, under pressure from conservatives, re-assert his demand for $5 billion at the last minute.

Senator David Perdue, a Republican from Georgia on the Senate Banking Committee, said on Fox News' Sunday Morning Futures that he thought a deal this week was possible.

""I spoke to the President last night, he wants that,"" Mr Purdue said, adding ""I'm hopeful that cooler heads will prevail and we'll get to some number between $1.6 (billion) and $5 billion on that.""",85
0,"Portions of the federal bureaucracy have been shut down since December 22, after Donald Trump demanded Congress budget $5 billion for a wall on the southern border and lawmakers -- Democrats in particular -- refused to include that in spending bill required to fund the government. As a result, around 800,000 government employees are temporarily out of work or working without pay and may struggle to pay rent; meanwhile, many of the jobs they would be doing, like keeping national parks clean, are not being done at all.

The reason Trump and his allies are demanding a wall, they say, is a ""crisis"" at the southern border. Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen criticized Congress for not addressing the ""growing security and humanitarian crisis"" on Saturday; Trump echoed that rhetoric and demanded ""a government funding bill that secures the border and keeps Americans safe"" in a letter to Congress on Friday.

This is dishonest in a couple different ways. Firstly, the ""crisis"" narrative is largely manufactured -- illegal border crossing apprehensions have been falling for years, according to available data, and even Trump claimed that the border was ""secure"" last month. If there is a crisis in regards to immigration it's that there's a massive backlog of asylum cases in the court system, and authorities are failing to quickly process claims from migrants waiting at the southern border in deplorable conditions. But of course, a wall won't do anything to solve those problems, and in fact Trump's supposedly tough immigration policy has fed them.

The second bit of dishonesty is that if Republicans were really concerned with border security, they've had chance after chance to address it through legislation over the past decade. Instead, both before Trump and during his administration the GOP has scuttled many compromises on immigration that would have given them the border security they say they want. Let's run the tape:

The politics of immigration were very different 12 years ago. As Trump and others have noted, many Democrats voted in 2006 for the ""Secure Fence Act"" that called for new security measures along 700 miles of the border. (There's a longstanding debate about how effective that kind of approach, a mix of fencing and other barriers, is compared to other border enforcement methods.) But that was only signed into law after a larger compromise package failed to pass.

That compromise, passed by the Senate in May and largely supported by President George W. Bush, would have built border fencing and more jail cells for deportees, and declared English the national language. But it also would have created a guest worker program and allowed undocumented people to remain in the country and in some cases become citizens -- a policy many Democrats and even some Republicans supported but which was derided as ""amnesty"" by portions of the right. The bill never went anywhere in the House, as Speaker Dennis Hastert (who was years later sent to prison after sexually abusing wrestlers he coached) slow-walked it and failed to bring it up for a vote.

That failure didn't dampen demands for a bipartisan compromise that secured the border while offering a way for millions of undocumented immigrants to come out of the shadows. The Bush White House put out a framework that offered a way to achieve those objectives. Features of this plan included a guest worker program, a worker database that would help prevent employers from hiring undocumented immigrants, and a pathway undocumented people could use to get a green card, though that process would take years. The resulting bill had support from Democrats and Republicans, but it ultimately couldn't even get a simple majority in the Senate.

Many at the time and later blamed its failure on a ""poison pill"" amendment that would have put an expiration date on the guest worker program. Introduced by a Democrat at the behest of unions, it was backed by then Senator Barack Obama and several Republicans who voted for it because they knew it would make the compromise unworkable. Though there is some doubt that the legislation would have become law even without that poison pill, the 2007 failure showed that while there was bipartisan support for an immigration compromise, there was also opposition to it from Democrats.

The politics of this issue began to shift during the Obama administration, as the Republican Party, never fully on board with the idea of immigration reform that included any relief for undocumented people, became more stridently nativist. But some GOP senators were still working on a compromise. Notably, Lindsey Graham wrote a March Washington Post op-ed with Democrat Chuck Schumer calling for increased border security along with a pathway to legal status for undocumented immigrants. But appetite for a compromise vanished as Republicans supported a harsh anti-immigrant law in Arizona and Graham rescinded his support for a compromise. Democrats still backed a security-and-legal-status reform package, but without much hope of it becoming law, since Republicans wouldn't take that deal. Any sort of support for what the right called ""amnesty"" was regarded as toxic, which is one likely reason John McCain, a previous reform sponsor, abandoned the issue around this time.

But by 2013, the dynamic had shifted again, or so many people thought. As ProPublica's Alec MacGillis would later write, after Mitt Romney lost the 2012 presidential election in part because he only got 27 percent of the Hispanic vote, many Republicans were looking at immigration reform as a way to get that demographic back and avoid becoming a party exclusively made up of whites. In the Senate, a bipartisan ""Gang of Eight"" that included four members of each party came up with a by-now-familiar framework: On one hand, there would be increased border security and measures intended to make it harder to hire undocumented workers; on the other, millions of undocumented people would be provided a pathway to citizenship.

The resulting bill passed the Senate, but the real obstacle, as it was in the Hastert era, was the House, which Republicans controlled after the Tea Party wave of 2010 put many extreme anti-immigration conservatives in office. In early 2014, GOP leaders including Speaker John Boehner introduced some principles that indicated there might be room for a compromise: They didn't support citizenship for all undocumented people, but would allow them to live and work in the US.

But then Boehner essentially bailed, saying, ""There's widespread doubt about whether this administration can be trusted to enforce our laws. And it's going to be difficult to move any immigration legislation until that changes."" This was perhaps a curious line of criticism, given that Obama's border policies around this time earned him the title ""deporter in chief"" from America's largest Latino advocacy group, but the bottom line was that conservative Republicans weren't interested in reform.

In the following years, there was little hope of compromise as the parties drifted further apart on the issue. Obama used his powers as president to shield some undocumented people brought to the US as children -- a.k.a. ""dreamers"" -- from deportation, while the GOP became increasingly anti-immigration, to the point that Marco Rubio, a member of the Gang of Eight, rejected his previous position on the issue to appeal to voters in the 2016 primary.

The 2016 election created a new obstacle to compromise legislation, as Trump was far more flagrantly racist and cruel than previous Republican presidents. Still, he had made extensive promises about building a wall, and to do so he needed at least some Democratic support, setting the stage for an obvious deal where a wall gets built in exchange for some Democratic policies.

But after a heated debate in the Senate that included a short, Democrat-led government shutdown, a series of votes for bills along those lines in early 2018 failed thanks to widespread Republican opposition. Trump maintains that the problem is federal courts have blocked his efforts to remove those protections for dreamers, making the Democrats reticent to agree to any deal involving them. But Senate Minority Leader Schumer reportedly offered to give Trump as much as $25 billion for border security, including money for the wall, in exchange for protections for dreamers -- an offer Trump rejected last January. And Trump later indicated he was not willing to negotiate along those lines.

The current state of the shutdown-and-wall negotiation is muddled, in part because Trump is such an unreliable bargaining partner. But the basic dynamic is the same as it has been for years: Democrats are largely willing, even eager, to agree to a deal that includes more border security in exchange for some protections for undocumented people. Last year, Illinois Democratic Congressman Luis Gutiérrez even said of Trump's wall, ""I'll take a bucket, take bricks, and start building it myself,"" if it meant dreamers would be shielded from deportation.

The problem is that since 2007 -- when, you could argue, Democrats were at least partly responsible for the failure of a reform bill -- Republicans have consistently refused to compromise without offering a credible alternative. If Trump really wanted a wall, he could trade it for something with Democrats. Instead, he's holding the government hostage in an attempt to get $5 billion in exchange for nothing. A rambling Friday press conference where he threatened to keep the shutdown going for years didn't help. Some conservatives have hinted they'd be willing to trade dreamer protections for the wall, but there are other indications that the nativist crew at the White House will want much more in the way of concessions from Democrats, making a deal seem impossible.

The only thing that's clear that Republicans don't want to secure the supposedly porous border. They want to gin up fear and have a big shouting match. That's pretty much the only thing you can count on at this point.",86

""No, nothing for the wall,"" Pelosi said. ""We're talking about border security. We can go through this back-and-forth. No. How many more times can we say no? No -- nothing for the wall.""

Before the shutdown began on December 22, Trump said during a testy meeting with Pelosi and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, the Democratic senator for New York, that he would take responsibility for any federal government stoppage. Trump said at the meeting he would be ""proud to shut down the government for border security.""

Since then, the president has sought to blame the Democrats for the shutdown because they will not agree to a budget that includes any of the $5 billion of funding Trump is demanding for his border wall, which he claims will stop undocumented migrants crossing into the U.S.

Democrats will once again be the majority in the House of Representatives on Thursday when the new batch of Congresspeople are sworn in following the midterm elections in November. They plan to pass legislation to fund the federal departments currently shut down.

While they refuse to explicitly fund the wall, they have shown willingness to give an extra $1.6 billion to border security. However, Trump and the Republicans want more -- and specifically for the wall's construction, not just border security.

""We asked the president to support the bills that we support that will open up government,"" Schumer told reporters after a meeting at the White House on Wednesday, CBS News reported.

""We asked him to give us one good reason -- I asked him directly, I said 'Mr. President give me one good reason why you should continue your shutdown of the eight cabinet departments while we are debating our differences on homeland security.' He could not give a good answer,"" said Schumer.

Republicans control the Senate, which must also approve the budget. Though the House has flipped back to the Democrats, the Republicans increased their majority in the Senate after the midterms.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell called the House Democrats' budget plan a ""nonstarter"" and urged them to get ""serious"" if they want to end the current deadlock.

""It's exactly the kind of proposal you'd expect if the incoming House Democrats are choosing to stage a political sideshow rather than doing the hard work of helping govern the country. In other words a total nonstarter,"" McConnell told the Senate, The Hill reported.

President Trump tweeted that Congressional leaders had an ""important"" meeting on border security, though there was little sign of an end to the shutdown.

""Both parties must work together to pass a Funding Bill that protects this Nation and its people-this is the first and most important duty of government,"" Trump wrote on Twitter. ""I remain ready and willing to work with Democrats to pass a bill that secures our borders, supports the agents and officers on the ground, and keeps America Safe. Let's get it done!""

The president later added: ""Sadly, there can be no REAL Border Security without the Wall!""

He also said at a meeting with his cabinet that he is content for the shutdown to continue for ""as long as it takes"" because he believes ""the people of this country think I'm right.""

0,"Just days after claiming that ""many"" furloughed government workers told him they're fine with not getting paid so long as he secures additional funding for a border wall, President Donald Trump tweeted Thursday morning that ""most of the people not getting paid are Democrats.""

Trump fired off the tweet early Thursday morning as the government shutdown entered its sixth day. Trump said on Christmas Day he will not reopen the government until he gets $5 billion in funding for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.

Democrats have said they won't provide Trump with that funding, and indicated they won't go beyond the $1.6 billion that has already been allocated for border wall purposes. Republicans and Democrats reached an agreement last week on a stopgap spending measure to prevent a shutdown -- a deal that the White House signaled Trump would sign. But at the 11th hour, Trump scuttled the agreement because it did not provide additional funding for a border wall.

Speaking in the Oval Office on Tuesday, Trump said the U.S. must have ""a wall, a fence, whatever they'd like to call it,"" before claiming that ""many"" furloughed workers want him to keep the government closed until he locks in wall funding.

""Many of those workers have said to me, communicated, 'stay out until you get the funding for the wall,'"" he said.",90
0,"Washington: President Donald Trump and congressional leaders gathered at the White House on Friday to try to end a 2-week-old partial U.S. government shutdown but all parties were entrenched over his demand for $5 billion to build a wall on the border with Mexico.

About 800,000 federal workers have been unpaid due to the closure of about a quarter of the federal government as Trump withholds his support for new funding until he secures the money for the wall that he promised to construct during his election campaign.

The wall, Trump has argued, is needed to stem the flow of illegal immigrants and drugs over the border. When he ran for president in 2016, Trump vowed Mexico would pay for the wall, which it has refused to do.

Democratic congressional leaders arrived at the White House for the meeting with Trump but it was unclear how much progress might be made.

It is the first showdown between Trump and Democrats since they took over the US House of Representatives on Thursday after victories in last November's elections.

""The president isn't going to back off,"" White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders told reporters before the talks began.

The Senate on Friday adjourned until Tuesday afternoon in a sign that the shutdown would likely not end before then.

Ahead of the meeting, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi sought to separate the issue of the wall and government funding, and called on Trump and his fellow Republicans in the Senate to reopen agencies as border talks continue.

""The wall and the government shutdown really have nothing to do with each other,"" Pelosi, who has rejected any funding for what she has called an ""immoral"" border wall, said at an event hosted by MSNBC.

About 800,000 federal employees have either been furloughed or are working without pay because of the shutdown.

It is showing signs of straining the country's immigration system and has been blamed for worsening backlogs in courts and complicating hiring for employers.

Trump continued to promote the wall in tweets to keep the pressure on Democrats on Thursday even as they gained significant power with their takeover of the House at the start of a new Congress.

Trump letter

Trump sent a letter to all members of Congress on Friday ""on the need to secure our borders,"" the White House said.

""Absolutely critical to border security and national security is a wall or a physical barrier that prevents entry in the first place,"" Trump wrote.

Late on Thursday, the House passed two Democratic bills to immediately reopen government agencies for varying lengths of time, despite a White House veto threat.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican, has rejected the House effort saying the president would not sign into law, although the Senate last month approved identical legislation.

""We're in the same place ... Any viable compromise will need to carry the endorsement of the president before it receives a vote in either house of Congress,"" McConnell said, speaking on the Senate floor Friday morning.

But he may face pressure from within his caucus from vulnerable Republicans up for re-election in 2020.

""We should pass a continuing resolution to get the government back open. The Senate has done it last Congress, we should do it again today,"" US Senator Cory Gardner told The Hill on Thursday.

His colleague Susan Collins also called for the Senate to pass the funding bills, while several other Republicans urged an end to the shutdown, the Hill and New York Times reported.

Pelosi on Friday urged McConnell to bring the measures up for a vote. ""The president can sign or not but he should never say, 'I'm not even going to put it on the president's desk,'"" she told MSNBC, noting Congress can pass bills without Trump's support.

Legislation can become law with a veto-proof majority of lawmakers' support or if the president does not sign it or veto it within 10 days.

Vice President Mike Pence on Thursday suggested that in exchange for the wall, the White House could work with Democrats on so-called Dreamer immigrants who were brought to the United States illegally as children - an idea Trump had rejected.

""It's being talked about,"" Pence told Fox News.

Democrats back other border security measures aside from the wall, and their two-bill package passed Thursday includes $1.3 billion for border fencing and $300 million for other border security items such as technology and cameras.

In a Dec. 11 meeting with Pelosi and Democratic Senate Leader Chuck Schumer, Trump said he would be ""proud"" to shut the government over the security issue and would not blame Democrats. He has since said they are responsible.

A Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll last week showed that 50 percent of the public blame Trump for the shutdown and 7 percent blame Republican lawmakers, against 32 percent who blame Democrats.",91
0,"President Donald Trump said on Friday he could use emergency powers to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border without Congress' approval, threatening to bypass Democratic lawmakers emboldened by their recent takeover of the House of Representatives, Reuters reports.

A showdown between Trump and Congressional Democrats over funding for his wall project has led to a two-week government shutdown. Trump says he will not support a bill to fully fund the government until he secures the money for the wall.

Asked whether he had considered declaring a national emergency to build the wall, Trump said: ""Yes, I have. ... We can do it. I haven't done it. I may do it ... But we can call a national emergency and build it very quickly.""

The comments come just a day after Democrats, led by Nancy Pelosi, took charge of the House, ushering in an era of divided government two years into Trump's term.

In sometimes combative talks on Friday, Trump, Pelosi and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer failed to strike a deal to end the partial shutdown as they fought over Trump's request for $5 billion to fund the wall.

The U.S. Constitution assigns Congress the power over funding the federal government, so Trump would likely face legal challenges if he tried to bypass Congress on financing the wall.

He dismissed those concerns in a news briefing at the White House.

""We can call a national emergency because of the security of our country, absolutely,"" he said. Asked if declaring a national emergency was a threat hanging over Democrats, Trump said, ""I'd never threaten anybody, but I am allowed to do that, yes.""

0,"As a partial U.S. government shutdown hit the two-week mark, President Donald Trump and congressional leaders were scheduled on Friday to discuss ways to break an impasse pitting his demand for building a border wall against Democrats' call for alternative security measures, Trend reports referring to Reuters.

About 800,000 federal workers have been affected by the Dec. 22 closure of about one-quarter of the federal government as Trump withheld his support for new funding until he secures $5 billion to start building the wall along the U.S.-Mexico border that he promised during his campaign.

Such a wall, he has argued, is needed to stem the flow of illegal immigrants and drugs over the southwestern border. When he ran for president in 2016, he vowed Mexico would pay for the wall, which it has refused to do.

On Thursday, Trump tried to keep the pressure on Democrats, even as they gained significant new power with their takeover of the House of Representatives at the start of a new Congress.

""Build the Wall,"" the Republican president demanded on Twitter. In remarks to reporters that same day, Trump said: ""You can call it a barrier. You can call it whatever you want. But essentially, we need protection in our country.""

As Trump dug in, so did opposition Democrats, leaving many to wonder just how much progress might be made during Friday's White House meeting scheduled for 11:30 a.m. (1630 GMT).

""We're not doing a wall,"" Democrat Nancy Pelosi said late on Thursday, several hours after she was sworn in as the new speaker of the House of Representatives.

""It has nothing to do with politics. It has to do with a wall is an immorality between countries. It's an old way of thinking. It isn't cost effective,"" Pelosi added.

Late on Thursday, the House passed two Democratic bills to immediately reopen government agencies for varying lengths of time, despite a White House veto threat. Earlier in the day, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican, labeled the House effort ""political theater, not productive lawmaking,"" even though the Senate last month approved identical legislation.

Democratic Representative Lucille Roybal-Allard, speaking to reporters late on Thursday, argued that funding a border wall, which ultimately could cost more than $24 billion, would hamper other, more important national security protections.

She noted that more federal law enforcement agents were needed to intercept illegal opioids and other ""contraband"" moving through U.S. ports of entry. She added more money was needed for the Coast Guard to beef up the U.S. presence in the Arctic at a time when Russia and China increasingly were on the prowl for that region's natural resources.

Without a deal to end the partial government shutdown, the Department of Homeland Security will not be able to bring some furloughed workers back to their jobs while others continue to be forced to work without paychecks for the time being.

An array of other federal agencies are similarly hobbled, including the Justice Department, Commerce Department and departments of Agriculture, Labor, Interior and Treasury.

Visitors to Smithsonian museums, among Washington's most popular tourist attractions, were being turned away during the shutdown, as were visitors to many of the nation's federal parks.

WASHINGTON, Dec 23 -- U.S. President Donald Trump's budget director and chief of staff on Sunday said the partial U.S. government shutdown could continue to Jan. 3, when the new Congress convenes and Democrats take over the House of Representatives.

""It's very possible this shutdown will go beyond (December) the 28th and into the new Congress,"" Mick Mulvaney said on Fox News Sunday.

""I don't think things are going to move very quickly here for the next few days"" because of the Christmas holiday, added Mulvaney, who serves as director of the Office of Management and Budget and was named acting White House chief of staff 10 days ago.

The U.S. Senate adjourned on Saturday, unable to break an impasse over Trump's demand for more funds for a wall on the border with Mexico that Democrats are unwilling to accept.

Mulvaney said the White House made a ""counter-offer"" to Democrats on funding for border security that fell between the Democratic offer of $1.3 billion and Trump's demand for $5 billion.

As part of those talks on Saturday, Vice President Mike Pence offered to drop the demand for $5 billion for a border wall, substituting instead $2.1 billion, ABC News reported, citing unnamed sources.

A Democratic source familiar with the negotiations said real discussions have been happening between Democratic lawmakers and Republican Senator Richard Shelby, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, who has been talking to the White House. It was unclear what Democrats had offered.

Mulvaney sought to shift blame for the partial shutdown to Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic nominee for speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, saying she might hold up negotiations to ensure she secures the position.

""I think she's in that unfortunate position of being beholden to her left wing to where she cannot be seen as agreeing with the president on anything until after she is speaker,"" Mulvaney said. ""If that's the case, again, there's a chance we go into the next Congress.""

Pelosi spokesman Drew Hammill disputed that account, saying in a statement: ""As Mr. Mulvaney well knows, House Democrats are united in their opposition to the President's immoral, expensive and ineffective wall.""

The White House should ""stop the posturing and start serious bipartisan talks,"" Hammill said.

Financing for about a quarter of federal government programs -- including the departments of Homeland Security, Justice and Agriculture -- expired at midnight on Friday. More than 400,000 ""essential"" employees in those agencies will work without pay until the dispute is resolved. Another 380,000 will be ""furloughed,"" meaning they are put on temporary leave.

Law enforcement efforts, border patrols, mail delivery and airport operations will keep running.

Building a wall to try to prevent migrants from entering the United States illegally was a central plank of Trump's presidential campaign, but Democrats are vehemently opposed and have rejected his funding request.

Trump reiterated his push for border security on Sunday, saying on Twitter that ""the only way"" to stop drugs, gangs, and human trafficking at the border was with a wall or barrier.

""Drones and all of the rest are wonderful and lots of fun, but it is only a good old fashioned Wall that works!,"" the president said in the tweet.

Earlier in the week, leaders in both the Senate and House thought they had reached a deal that Trump would sign that contained less money for border security, only to watch the president, under pressure from conservatives, re-assert his demand for $5 billion at the last minute.

Senator David Perdue, a Republican from Georgia on the Senate Banking Committee, said on Fox News' ""Sunday Morning Futures"" that he thought a deal this week was possible.

0,"(CNSNews.com) - President Donald Trump has asked congressional leaders to return to the White House on Friday, after the House and Senate leadership races are over, to try once again to end the impasse over border wall funding.

At the White House on Wednesday, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen tried to brief congressional leaders on the national security problems at the border, but Democrats Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi refused to hear her out:

""I was a little disappointed with, I would say, some on the other side,"" House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy (R-Calif.) told reporters after the attempted White House briefing. ""Once the secretary started, Sen. Schumer interrupted her, they really didn't want to hear it. They challenged some of the points the secretary made.""

McCarthy said President Trump decided to delay the negotiations until Friday, when people might be ""more willing to come to an agreement.""

McCarthy said the impasse over border wall funding that has partially shut down the government doesn't have to last long at all:

""I think we can come to an agreement rather quickly,"" he said.

Do you know in this caravan, one third of all the women...some are being raped, some are being violently treated. We have children that have challenges coming through; we have another caravan starting to come. We have a real challenge.

And I think that's why both sides can sit own, find a compromise that actually secures the border.

We had -- everybody in the room said they wanted to have a secure border. So maybe we work a combination to make it solved. And I think that's why the president -- I watched him in there stay very calm throughout the entire discussion -- he wanted to get the latest statistics going forward.

And that is why we'll be back on Friday. We want to make sure the border's secure, but more importantly, we want to make sure this government is opened.

McCarthy said he hopes Democrats will present a counter-offer on Friday.

House Democrats on Thursday (today) plan pass legislation to fund six government agencies for the rest of the fiscal year; and the Homeland Security Department through Feb. 8, while border security negotiations continue.

""Democrats have been committed to protecting our borders with the oath of office we take to protect and defend"" Pelosi said. It has been very important to us, and we have commited resources to it when we were in the majority and will continue to do so.""

Schumer said Democrats have asked the president to support bills that will open up government.

""The only reason that they are shutting down the government is very simple. They want to try and leverage that shutdown into their proposals on border security. We want strong border security, we believe ours are better. But to use the shutdown as hostage...is wrong, and we would urge them respectfully to reconsider and support these bills, which are bipartisan...open up the government as we continue to debate what is the best way to secure our border.

Pelosi said Democrats are giving President Trump ""a Republican path"" to reopen government. ""Why would he not do it?"" she asked.

President Trump tweeted his response to Wednesday's unproductive meeting:",95
0,"WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump told Democratic congressional leaders that the partial government shutdown may last for years, insisting Friday he won't budge on funding for a longer wall between the United States and Mexico.

At a news conference after the White House meeting, Trump raised the possibility that he'll unilaterally move forward with the project, invoking his emergency powers to bypass the opposition.

""We can do it. I haven't done it. I may do it. I may do it,"" he told reporters during a question-and-answer session. ""We can call a national emergency and build it very quickly. That's another way of doing it. But if we can do it through a negotiated process, we're giving that a shot.""

The president said he felt Friday's meeting was productive, but Democratic congressional leaders described it as contentious and accomplishing little.

Trump, at the news conference, insisted the United States is vulnerable to terrorists, criminals and gang members who are crossing from Mexico into the United States.

""The southern border is a dangerous, horrible disaster,"" Trump said.

""We're talking about national security. We're not playing games,"" he said.

A better wall, built of steel perhaps, would make America safer, he said.

It also would prevent deaths by lowering the number of people who make the dangerous trek north, he said.

""We want to save lives. We want children to be safe. ... We can't let them die on the way up,"" Trump said.

Women are also at risk, he said. ""If they know it's not going to take place because they can't get through because we have a great border wall or fence or barrier, they're not going to come up and you're not going to have the problem.""

Mexico will pay for the wall, at least indirectly, because the North American Free Trade Agreement has been redone, he said.

The new trade deal, which his administration helped craft, will be a boon for the U.S. economy, he added.

Stressing the need for legal immigration, Trump called for overhauling the nation's existing system.

""We need great people, but we want them to come in on a merit basis,"" he said. ""They can't come in the way they've been coming in for years.""

Trump's call for immigration changes echoed what he had said in 2017 after Arkansas' U.S. Sen. Tom Cotton introduced legislation to replace the existing system with a merit-based approach similar to those used in Australia and Canada. Cotton is a Republican from Dardanelle.

At the time, Trump called Cotton's proposal ""the most significant reform to our immigration system in half a century.""

Cotton plans to introduce similar legislation in the 116th Congress.

Trump said there was discussion during the meeting of marrying wall funding and protecting from deportation young people brought to the U.S. illegally as children who were previously covered by President Barack Obama's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which Trump has moved to rescind.

The New York Times reported that House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy sounded open to the idea as he left for the White House. ""We can find common ground,"" McCarthy said. ""DACA is a problem, border security is a problem and anything that can make sure that we can get everything together and move forward, I'm willing to discuss.""

A compromise linking the younger immigrants to the wall has been floated by Sens. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., and Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn.

Trump also used the news conference to highlight the nation's strong economy.

Take-home pay is rising, he said. Job numbers are rising. Gas prices have fallen. Unemployment is low. So is inflation. The stock market, despite recent losses, is still up 30 percent since his election, Trump said.

The president also spoke optimistically about Friday's government shutdown meeting.

Flanked by Vice President Mike Pence, House Republican leaders and Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, he described Friday's shutdown-related meeting as ""very, very productive,"" adding, ""I think we've come a long way.""

""We're all on the same path in terms of wanting to get government open,"" he said.

Pence said the dialogue had been ""candid and constructive.""

WEEKEND MEETING

Congressional leadership staff members and White House representatives will meet this morning in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building ""to work towards ... an agreement that secures the border and opens the government,"" a presidential spokesman said Friday evening.

Speaking to reporters after exiting the West Wing, Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said Democrats want to resume funding while the negotiations continue.

""We made a plea to the president once again. Don't hold millions of Americans, hundreds of thousands of workers hostage,"" Schumer said.

""We told the president we needed the government open. He resisted. In fact, he said he'd keep the government closed for a very long period of time. Months, or even years,"" Schumer said.

The Democratic leader indicated very little had been accomplished, but expressed a willingness to meet again.

""We'll continue discussing [this], of course, but it's very hard to see how progress will be made unless they open up the government.""

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., portrayed the meeting as ""lengthy and sometimes contentious.""

""We agreed that we will continue our conversations,"" she said.

Allowing the shutdown to continue would be counterproductive, she said.

""We recognize on the Democratic side that we really cannot resolve this until we open up government and we made that very clear to the president. Services are being withheld from the American people, paychecks are being withheld from people who serve the needs of the American people, and our border security will suffer if we do not resolve this issue,"" she said.

""We are committed to keeping our border safe. That has always been our principal to honor the oath of office that we take to protect and defend our country and our Constitution,"" she said. ""We can do that best when government is open. We've made that clear to the president.""

Meanwhile, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has largely stayed on the sidelines, leaving it to Pelosi and Schumer to resolve the wall dispute with Trump.

McConnell and his top deputy, Senate Majority Whip John Thune, R-S.D., were not present when Trump and other Republican lawmakers appeared outside the White House after Friday's meeting. Aides to McConnell insisted they were not aware of the news conference, The Washington Post reported.

The shutdown, which enters its third week today, has left about 800,000 workers without pay, limited the functions of federal agencies and slowed the court system. There are also concerns that if the shutdown continues for several more weeks, it will harm the overall economy.

Most Republicans in Congress have backed the president, though there were signs of a fraying alliance as two vulnerable senators from Democratic-leaning states, Cory Gardner of Colorado and Susan Collins of Maine, expressed misgivings over their leaders' intransigence. Gardner called on his party to end the shutdown, even if it meant not funding the wall, and Collins said she would support measures to fund the government in already approved appropriations bills.

MORE TROOPS SOUGHT

Separately, the Department of Homeland Security has asked the military to provide more help securing the U.S.-Mexico border, two defense officials told The Associated Press on Friday.

The acting secretary of defense, Patrick Shanahan, has not decided how to respond to the Homeland Security request, but in the past the Pentagon has provided help when asked. At one point last fall there were nearly 5,900 active-duty troops along the border in Texas, Arizona and California to assist border patrol agents and to erect wire barriers. That number now is about 2,350.

The defense officials said the agency asked for certain military capabilities, not any number of troops. It will be up to Shanahan to decide whether more active-duty troops are dispatched. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because the request for assistance has not yet been fully processed.

One of the officials said the Homeland Security Department wants the military to put up concertina wire as barriers along 160 miles of border. That would be in addition to 70 miles of concertina wire that combat engineers put up in the fall. If the new work is taken on by the military, it might require an extension of the current deployment beyond its scheduled Jan. 31 end. The official said the department did not specifically ask for an extension, but it has not been ruled out.

The troops have been erecting and reinforcing border barriers but are not performing law enforcement tasks or engaging with migrants. Some also have been providing transportation and logistical help as well as medical assistance to troops and to Customs and Border Protection personnel along the border.

Many in Congress, including leading Democrats, have criticized the troop deployments as a waste of money and a misuse of military resources.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi talks to reporters Friday after congressional Democrats met with President Donald Trump at the White House about border security. Joining Pelosi are (from left) Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer, House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer and Sen. Dick Durbin.

A Section on 01/05/2019",96
0,"WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump said Tuesday that he intends to keep the federal government closed until he secures the desired funding from Congress for his promised border wall.

""I can't tell you when the government's going to be open. I can tell you it's not going to be open until we have a wall or fence, whatever they'd like to call it,"" Trump said, referring to Democrats who oppose walling off the border.

""I'll call it whatever they want, but it's all the same thing,"" he told reporters. ""It's a barrier from people pouring into our country.""

Trump made the comments after participating in a holiday video conference with representatives from all five branches of the military. The representatives were stationed in Alaska, Bahrain, Guam and Qatar.

Trump argued that drug flows and human trafficking can only be stopped with a wall.

""The only way you're going to do it is to have a physical barrier, meaning a wall,"" he said. ""And if you don't have that, then we're just not opening"" the government.

Democrats say they prefer to spend money on fencing, technology and other means of controlling access to the border. Trump argued that Democrats oppose a wall only because he wants one, likening the situation to his May 2017 firing of James Comey as FBI director, saying ""Democrats hated him"" until he was fired.

Even as Trump vowed to secure wall funding, he said much of his envisioned wall was already being built. He tweeted Monday that he ""just gave out a 115 mile long contract for another large section of the Wall in Texas.""

""We gave it out at a great price,"" Trump said Tuesday, adding that he plans to visit the site in January for a groundbreaking ceremony. ""So we're going to have a great wall there, and we have other sections to give out.""

When asked who had received the contract, Trump replied: ""Different people, different people. Highly bid.""

Administration officials provided no details about the construction project or the terms of the contract.

Trump said Tuesday that the wall as he envisions it would be a fortress that no normal human could breach.

""Now there may be the case of an Olympic champion who can get over the wall, but for the most part you are not able to do it,"" he said. ""Very high. It's gonna be 30 feet. Much of it is 30 feet high. Some if it's low. But in some areas we have it as high as 30 feet. That's like a three-story building.""

As for the shutdown itself, Trump said: ""It's a disgrace what's happening in our country. But other than that, I wish everybody a very Merry Christmas.""

TRUMP ON POWELL

Trump on Tuesday also cast doubt about the performance of Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell after a sharp downturn in U.S. stock markets.

""Well, we'll see,"" Trump said when a journalist asked whether he had confidence in Powell. ""They're raising interest rates too fast, that's my opinion. But I certainly have confidence. But I think it'll straighten. They're raising interest rates too fast because they think the economy is so good. But I think that they will get it pretty soon, I really do.""

Trump is angry that Powell is continuing to raise the Fed's benchmark interest rate and scale back other extraordinary measures intended to support the economy. The Fed's benchmark rate is now 2.25 percent to 2.5 percent, higher than the near-zero interest rate the Fed had pursued for years, but still historically low.

Trump argued that his predecessor, President Barack Obama, benefited from lower interest rates, spurring economic growth.

""President Obama didn't do much of that,"" Trump said of raising rates. ""Much easier to run when you have no interest rate. He had a really low interest rate.""

Others point out that the Fed, which operates independently of the White House, had pursued a policy of low interest rates dating to the final months of the George W. Bush administration because the economy was much weaker than it is today.

Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, a longtime friend of Trump's who suggested Powell for the Fed's top job, last week released a statement on Trump's behalf saying that the president did not believe he had the ""right"" to fire Powell over disagreements on the management of the Fed.

Many economists and analysts on Wall Street say that an attempt to fire the Fed chief would send markets in a tailspin amid uncertainty over the stability of the U.S. central bank, the most important institution in shaping U.S. and global markets.

When asked Tuesday whether he has confidence in Mnuchin, whose Sunday calls to reassure major bank executives rattled some investors, Trump told reporters: ""Yes, I do. Very talented guy, very smart person.""

'A TRAVESTY'

Today is the fifth day of the partial government shutdown, though it is the first to affect many federal employees after the four-day holiday weekend. About 25 percent of the government has shut down.

All told, about 800,000 of 2.1 million federal workers nationwide -- or nearly a third -- are estimated to be affected in some way. Trump said Tuesday that many of them support the shutdown.

""Many of those workers have said to me, communicated -- stay out until you get the funding for the wall,"" Trump said. ""These federal workers want the wall.""

Trump didn't say how federal workers, excluding those he appointed or who work with him in the White House, had communicated with him about the shutdown.

Tony Reardon, president of the 150,000-member National Treasury Employees Union, disputed Trump's account. In a survey of 1,500 union members before Christmas, about 85 percent said they limited holiday season spending or planned to do so because of uncertainty about income, Reardon said.

""Federal employees should not have to pay the personal price for all of this dysfunction,"" Reardon said. ""This shutdown is a travesty. Congress and the White House have not done their fundamental jobs of keeping the government open.""

Many workers remained at their jobs, including volunteers at Peterson Air Force Base in Colorado, which uses pre-approved funding. The volunteers were working Christmas Eve to support the North American Aerospace Defense Command, which runs the NORAD Tracks Santa program. The program became a Christmas Eve tradition after a child called the forerunner to the agency in 1955 and asked to speak to Santa.

Trump and his wife, first lady Melania Trump, spent part of Monday night joining the volunteers, answering calls from children who wanted to know where Santa was on his gift-giving journey.

The president at one point asked a 7-year-old girl, ""Are you still a believer in Santa?"" Trump listened for a moment before adding, ""Because at 7, it's marginal, right?""

The girl -- Collman Lloyd of Lexington, S.C. -- said later that she had never heard the word ""marginal"" before and simply answered, ""Yes, sir."" Her family had made a video recording of the call because when Collman telephoned NORAD, a volunteer asked her if she would like to speak to the president.

The Trumps later attended religious services at Washington National Cathedral. The president and the first lady usually attend Christmas Eve services at the Episcopal church in Palm Beach where they were married in 2005.

Trump usually spends Christmas at his Florida estate.

""I thought it would be wrong for me to be with my family,"" he told reporters. ""My family is in Florida, Palm Beach, and I just didn't want to go down and be there when other people are hurting.""

Trump didn't say which of his family members were at the Mar-a-Lago estate.

On Tuesday, Trump wished U.S. troops stationed around the country and the globe a merry Christmas.

""I know it's a great sacrifice for you to be away from your families, but I want you to know that every American family is eternally grateful to you, and we're holding you close in our hearts, thoughts and prayers,"" Trump said. ""We love what you do and love your work. Amazing people.""

Trump said in a post on Twitter after the meeting that Democrats and Republicans must work together to pass a funding bill that protects the nation and its people, which he called the ""first and most important duty of government.""

""I remain ready and willing to work with Democrats to pass a bill that secures our borders, supports the agents and officers on the ground, and keeps America Safe. Let's get it done!"" Trump tweeted.

Despite expressing willingness to work with Democrats, Trump continues to stand by his demand that a spending bill include $5 billion for the construction of controversial border wall.

In remarks to reporters ahead of the meeting, Trump indicated the partial government shutdown will continue for ""as long as it takes"" to get the money for the wall.

The meeting was not expected to result in a major breakthrough, with a Capitol Hill source telling CNN the meeting ""appears to be more of a White House stunt than a serious attempt to have a discussion.""

Presumptive House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., indicated after the meeting that House Democrats will move forward with plans to reopen the government without providing funding for the wall.

Democrats will officially take control of the House on Thursday and plan to pass legislation that includes six full-year appropriations bills as well as a continuing resolution to fund the Department of Homeland Security until February 8th.

The legislation would provide $1.3 billion for border security, well below the $5 billion that Trump has demanded for construction of the wall.

The White House has rejected the legislation, however, with White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders calling the plan a ""non-starter.""

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ken., has also dismissed the plan and reiterated that the Senate will not vote on legislation that does not have the support of the president.

""The Senate will be glad to vote on a measure that the House passes that the president will sign. But we're not going to vote on anything else,"" McConnell said after the meeting.

0,"WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump said Tuesday that he intends to keep the federal government closed until he secures the desired funding from Congress for his promised border wall, and he cast doubt about the performance of Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome H. Powell after a sharp downturn in U.S. stock markets.

In an Oval Office appearance on Christmas morning, Trump praised Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin despite the stock markets suffering their steepest Christmas Eve decline in decades but was more circumspect about his handpicked Fed chair.

""Well, we'll see,"" Trump said when a journalist asked whether he had confidence in Powell. ""They're raising interest rates too fast, that's my opinion. But I certainly have confidence. But I think it'll straighten. They're raising interest rates too fast because they think the economy is so good. But I think that they will get it pretty soon, I really do.""

As for whether he has confidence in Mnuchin, whose Sunday calls to reassure major bank executives rattled investors and may have exacerbated Monday's sell-off, Trump told reporters, ""Yes, I do. Very talented guy, very smart person.""

Trump made his comments during a Christmas photo op in the Oval Office, where he spoke by video teleconference with service members from all five branches of the armed forces who are stationed in Alaska, Bahrain, Guam and Qatar.

About 25 percent of the government is shut down for the fourth straight day with Congress at a stalemate over Trump's demand for $5 billion in wall construction money.

""I can't tell you when the government is going to reopen,"" he said. ""I can tell you it's not going to be open until we have a wall, a fence, whatever they'd like to call it. I'll call it whatever they want. But it's all the same thing. It's a barrier from people pouring into our country.""

The president defended his plan to construct a wall along the border with Mexico that he insisted only an Olympic athlete would be able to scale. ""If you don't have that, then we're just not opening,"" Trump said.

All told, about 800,000 of 2.1 million federal workers nationwide - or more than a third - are estimated to be affected in some way by the shutdown. Trump claimed that many of them support the shutdown.

""Many of those workers have said to me, communicated - stay out until you get the funding for the wall,"" Trump said. ""These federal workers want the wall.""

But his claim conflicts with the accounts of federal workers' union leaders.

""Federal employees should not have to pay the personal price for all of this dysfunction,"" said Tony Reardon, president of the National Treasury Employees Union, which represents 150,000 members at 33 federal agencies and departments. ""This shutdown is a travesty. Congress and the White House have not done their fundamental jobs of keeping the government open.""

In a survey of 1,500 union members, about 85 percent said they have limited holiday season spending or are planning to do so because of uncertainty about income, Reardon said on Christmas Eve. He said they include one who said ""I have recently lost my wife and now . . .. I have to put off buying her headstone. Breaks my heart.""

Another responded, ""I can't buy any Christmas presents and am considering returning those I already have. Mortgage companies and utility companies won't wait to get paid,"" according to Reardon.

The government shutdown comes near the end of what will probably be the worst year for the U.S. stock market since the financial crisis a decade ago. Many sectors are now technically in a ""bear market,"" down more than 20 percent.

Before the recent reversal in the stock market, which began during the fall, Trump had frequently boasted that stocks were soaring during his tenure, claiming credit for the upswing.

The downturn has caused great uncertainty in the White House as Trump has sought someone to blame, and he has lashed out publicly at Powell. On Saturday, several news outlets reported that Trump was looking for ways to potentially fire Powell. That spurred Mnuchin to release a statement on Trump's behalf that the president did not believe he had the ""right"" to fire Powell.

Many economists and analysts on Wall Street say that an attempt to fire the Fed chief would send markets in a tailspin amid uncertainty over the stability of the U.S. central bank, the most important institution in shaping U.S. and global markets.

Trump is angry that Powell is continuing the Fed's long-telegraphed plan to raise its benchmark interest rate and scale back other extraordinary measures intended to support the economy. The Fed's benchmark rate is now 2.25 to 2.5 percent, higher than the near-zero interest rate the Fed had pursued for years but still historically low.

Trump complains that his predecessor Barack Obama benefited from lower interest rates, spurring economic growth. Others point out that the Fed, which operates independently of the White House, had pursued a low-interest-rate policy because the economy was much weaker than it is today.

""They are raising interest rates too fast, that's my opinion,"" Trump said Tuesday. ""President Obama didn't do much of that . . . He had a very low interest rate.""

Powell was Mnuchin's recommendation when Trump was seeking a new Fed chair a year ago, and some close to Trump have questioned whether the president will begin to blame the treasury secretary, too, for the sell-off. But on Tuesday he praised Mnuchin, a longtime friend and finance chairman of his 2016 campaign.

Again on Tuesday, Trump tried to place blame for Washington's budget stalemate solely on Democrats, portraying their leaders as disingenuous and claiming that they support the notion of a physical barrier along the border and object to building the wall only because it is Trump's idea.

Trump likened the situation to his May 2017 firing of James Comey as FBI director, saying ""Democrats hated him"" until he was fired and then Comey was treated as a hero.

Even as he vowed to keep the government closed to secure wall funding, Trump claimed that much of his envisioned wall was already being built. He said he had awarded a contract ""at a great price"" for a 115-mile section of wall in Texas and plans to visit the site in January for ""a ground-breaking"" ceremony.

Administration officials have provided no details about this construction project or the terms of the contract.

Trump said he hopes to have all portions of the wall completed - either old fencing renovated or new construction - by Election Day 2020, an indication that he sees building the wall chiefly as a political issue tied to his reelection chances.

Trump said Tuesday that the wall as he envisions it would be a fortress that no normal human could breach.

""Now there may be the case of an Olympic champion who can get over the wall, but for the most part you are not able to do it,"" he said. ""Very high. It's gonna be 30 feet. Much of it is 30 feet high. Some if it's low. But in some areas we have it as high as 30 feet. That's like a three-story building.""

Trump said of the government shutdown, ""It's a disgrace what's happening in our country. But other than that, I wish everybody a very Merry Christmas.""

0,"As a partial U.S. government shutdown hit the two-week mark, President Donald Trump and congressional leaders prepared to meet today over ways to break an impasse pitting his demand for building a border wall against Democrats' call for alternative security measures.

About 800,000 federal workers have been affected by the Dec. 22 closure of about one-quarter of the federal government as Trump withheld his support for new funding until he secures $5 billion to start building the wall along the U.S.-Mexico border that he promised during his campaign.

Such a wall, he has argued, is needed to stem the flow of illegal immigrants and drugs over the southwestern border. When he ran for president in 2016, he vowed Mexico would pay for the wall, which it has refused to do.

On Thursday, Trump tried to keep the pressure on Democrats, even as they gained significant new power with their takeover of the House of Representatives at the start of a new Congress.

""Build the Wall,""

the Republican president demanded on Twitter. In remarks to reporters that same day, Trump said: ""You can call it a barrier. You can call it whatever you want. But essentially, we need protection in our country.""

As Trump dug in, so did opposition Democrats, leaving many to wonder just how much progress might be made during Friday's White House meeting scheduled for 11:30 a.m.

Vice President Mike Pence, in a television interview Thursday night, also suggested that in exchange for the wall, the White House could work with Democrats on so-called Dreamer immigrants who were brought to the United States illegally as children; an idea Trump had rejected on Wednesday.

""It's being talked about,"" Pence told Fox News.

Democrats back other border security measures aside from the wall, and their two-bill package passed Thursday includes $1.3 billion for border fencing and $300 million for other border security items such as technology and cameras.

0,"President Donald Trump said on Friday he could use emergency powers to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border without Congress' approval, threatening to bypass Democratic lawmakers emboldened by their recent takeover of the House of Representatives.

A showdown between Trump and Congressional Democrats over funding for his wall project has led to a two-week government shutdown. Trump says he will not support a bill to fully fund the government until he secures the money for the wall.

Asked whether he had considered declaring a national emergency to build the wall, Trump said: ""Yes, I have. ... We can do it. I haven't done it. I may do it ... But we can call a national emergency and build it very quickly.""

The comments come just a day after Democrats, led by Nancy Pelosi, took charge of the House, ushering in an era of divided government two years into Trump's term.

In sometimes combative talks on Friday, Trump, Pelosi and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer failed to strike a deal to end the partial shutdown as they fought over Trump's request for $5 billion to fund the wall.

The U.S. Constitution assigns Congress the power over funding the federal government, so Trump would likely face legal challenges if he tried to bypass Congress on financing the wall.

He dismissed those concerns in a news briefing at the White House.

""We can call a national emergency because of the security of our country, absolutely,"" he said. Asked if declaring a national emergency was a threat hanging over Democrats, Trump said, ""I'd never threaten anybody, but I am allowed to do that, yes.""",102
0,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Coast Guard saw a nearly fivefold increase in the number of migrants it intercepted off the coast of southern California in 2018, underscoring the challenge that will remain in stopping illegal migration even if President Donald Trump secures funding for his southern border wall.

The numbers, released to The Washington Post in recent days, show the service intercepted 1,022 migrants at sea there in the fiscal year ending Sept. 30. That was up from 213 in 2017 and 142 in 2016.

Nationwide, the number of migrant intercepts at sea dropped from 2,512 in 2017 to 1,668 in 2018, indicating a shift in which more migrants are now intercepted off the West Coast. The majority of migrants taken into custody there come from Central and South America, while migrants caught along the East Coast are more likely to come from Haiti or other islands in the Caribbean Sea.

A Coast Guard spokesman, Chief Warrant Officer 4 Barry Lane, said that the migrants intercepted at sea in 2018 come from numerous countries in the Western Hemisphere, including Mexico, Ecuador, Bolivia, Colombia and Guatemala. Others came from farther away nations that include China, Sri Lanka, India and Jordan, he said.

For years, the Coast Guard intercepted more migrants off the coast of Florida than anywhere else. Those numbers plummeted in 2017, after the Obama administration normalized diplomatic relations with Cuba and ended the so-called wet-foot, dry-foot policy that allowed most Cubans who made the 90-mile trip by sea to pursue legal residency.

The service also intercepted 209,000 kilograms of cocaine at sea in 2018, falling just behind its record grab of 223,843 kilograms in 2017. The majority of those drugs are interdicted by a handful of Coast Guard cutters in the eastern Pacific Ocean, as they meet ships heading from Central and South America.

Intercepts at sea represent a fraction of a much larger trend. Customs and Border Protection reported 415,517 total apprehensions at the southern border in fiscal 2017, and 521,090 more in fiscal in 2018. More than 60,000 migrants were arrested in each of the last three months attempting to enter the country illegally.

But the statistics will still serve as new fodder for advocates of the Coast Guard, whose service members are among the federal employees working without pay amid a partial government shutdown caused by a political dispute over President Trump's proposed southern border wall. Service members are due a pay check on Tuesday, and unlikely to get their money. The shutdown was 24 days old - and the longest in U.S. history - as of Monday.

Although the service is considered a part of the U.S. military, it has no funding because it is part of the Department of Homeland Security. Most other branches of service are part of the Defense Department, which has funding approved.

The shutdown also has threatened the pensions of Coast Guard veterans. Adm. Charles Ray, the service's No. 2 officer, said in an email to retirees on Saturday that there is the ""distinct possibility"" that retiree pay and money for the Survivor's Benefit Plan, an insurance policy for the surviving spouses of Coast Guard veterans, may be delayed if the shutdown continues into late January.

""Please be assured that we are continuing to work closely with the Department of Homeland Security, the Administration, and Congress to reduce the impacts of this funding lapse on our Coast Guard workforce - past and present - and I will keep you informed as additional information becomes available,"" Ray wrote.

The shutdown has put other strains on the service, as Trump seeks funding for the wall. The president has promised to fund new polar icebreaker ships for the Coast Guard, but funding for them is no longer a certainty. A Senate appropriations bill passed last year included $750 million for the first ship, but the House version did not include the money. It is not clear whether the money will be included if a spending bill makes it to the White House.

The Coast Guard commandant, Adm. Karl Schultz, has posted a series of social-media messages in recent days as he seeks to reassure the force.

""I recognize that there is anxiety & uncertainty about the status of your pay this evening,"" Shultz tweeted Monday night. ""Your senior leadership team continues to work on your behalf. We will provide an additional update by 1200 EST. Continue standing the watch - I am proud of your unwavering devotion to duty.""",103
0,"The government shutdown is about distracting the population from Trump's failures, it also about ultimately furthering Bannon's agenda to bring the US government crashing down.

In worrying about what it will take to end the latest showdown over funding the US Government, many Democrats and Republicans are missing the point. Since Donald Trump's core supporters hate non-white immigrants and they see the federal government as the enemy, they win whether he gets the money for his border wall or the government remains partially shut down.

Trump's candidacy and presidency have tapped into a spiralling insurgency within the right wing of American politics, in which shutting down the government is an end in itself. As this movement has begun trending globally, it's worth considering just how far it will reach.

At this moment, in addition to the shutdown of significant daily functions of government, the United States has no permanent White House chief of staff, defence secretary, or attorney general. And it has announced a significant withdrawal of forces from Syria and Afghanistan, absent any coordination with international partners, rivals, or local leadership on the ground. There is no single explanation for President Trump's pronouncements and policies as President, just as there is no single reason he got elected. Nor is there only one factor behind the United Kingdom's Brexit or Marine Le Pen's strong showing in last year's French elections -- and the latest eruption of ""yellow vest"" protests.

One growing aphorism of history is that we should believe politicians when they advertise their goals, especially when they are dystopian. As we prepare to conclude the first two years of Donald Trump's administration, it's worth revisiting what his former chief strategist Steve Bannon told a Daily Beast reporter back in 2013: ""Lenin wanted to destroy the state, and that's my goal too. I want to bring everything crashing down, and destroy all of today's establishment.""

Republicans have long appealed to business interests by calling for ""small government"". Although the business community may not welcome the more destructive impulses of Bannon's agenda, they saw Trump as a way to get the historically ""pro-business"" Republican Party back into the White House. Like many enablers of previous revolutions (e.g., Russia, Iran), they still hope they can distract or restrain the true believers.

The second holiday season in a row with a government shutdown over immigration issues. And each time, it has been President Trump who forced the shutdown. Business has not been pleased with this turmoil or with the President's attacks on the Federal Reserve, or his new trade war with China, and so on. But the 2018 tax cut netted them and their companies hundreds of billions in extra cash and stock buybacks.

Since leaving his White House perch, Bannon has been touring the European Union (EU) to rally support for the local nationalisms and phobias of every destination -- from London to Paris to Rome, to Budapest and Prague -- with an eye to the 2019 European Parliament elections. Russian President Vladimir Putin has also been helping out right-wing anti-EU politicians, mostly behind the scenes, in France, the Netherlands, and most successfully in the EU-busting United Kingdom.

Since a defiant Russia cannot leverage the current system to its abiding benefit, Putin has good reason to weaken or even derail the EU, NATO, and the good faith and credit of the post-World War II global order. Back in the United States, Bannon did not somehow force his ideology on Mr. Trump. He found a ready and receptive audience.

Trump was proud to impose a shutdown of ""non-essential"" government agencies -- with or without his border wall -- because he knows his base supports both. What could be more fundamental than a great wall to defending the nativist conception of national interests? And what could be more appealing to a base that sees federal employees as the enemy than defunding and dismantling the government?

Despite his intentionally reckless approach to government and global stability, Trump could not have been President, along with control over both chambers of Congress these past two years, without major support from the normally cautious business community.

In the 1987 film ""Wall Street"", fictional corporate raider Gordon Gekko publicly proclaims, ""Greed is good!"". In the 1980s, aggravating the Vietnam and Watergate upheavals, US President Ronald Reagan challenged Americans to vote on the basis of their own economic interests -- effectively reversing John F. Kennedy's ""ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your county.""

As faith in the social contract has continued to erode, the moneyed classes have enjoyed the fruits of widening income and wealth gaps. Even as national debt grows, the top 10 percent are realising ever higher profits and tax cuts. For those still extolling the ""Wall Street"" ethos, government shutdowns are a dress rehearsal for deregulation, reduced social services, and lax oversight. In recent years, the budget for the Internal Revenue Service -- which collects federal taxes -- has been cut significantly. This means less government spending, and less enforcement, which is welcome news for those looking to weaken the government for ideological or financial gain.

Where the government does spend, billions of dollars are being farmed out to private prisons for criminals and immigration detainees, private health care for military veterans, and private contractors for securing Afghanistan and other hotspots. This both enriches well-connected insiders like Elliott Broidy -- who has gained notoriety as a target in the ongoing Mueller investigation -- and it weakens the oversight and effectiveness of the federal system.

For Americans and others who think disrupting the system is good, it is worth considering just how much depends on that system. Beyond the money, it's what keeps countries from invading their neighbours. It keeps criminal enterprises from taking over the functions of government. It protects the free exercise of religion. It facilitates international tracking and interdiction of illegal drugs and terrorist financing. It secures international shipping lanes and multilateral trade. And it shores up national currencies when politicians and corporate leaders make the wrong bets. At any rate, it would be a grave error to see Trump as gambling with the government to achieve his policy goals. It's not a gamble if he's equally happy to lose.",104
0,"US President Donald Trump has said he is considering declaring a national emergency to get a wall built on the southern border of the US, after meeting with congressional leaders to discuss the Government shutdown.

Mr Trump and Democratic leaders failed to strike a deal in sometimes combative talks to end the partial shutdown of the US Government, as they fought over Mr Trump's request for $US5 billion to fund his signature wall on the Mexican border.

Emerging after more than two hours of talks as the shutdown hits the two-week mark, Mr Trump told reporters he could use executive authority to build the border wall, but wanted to try to negotiate it with Congress.

""I can do it if I want. We can call a national emergency. I may do it.""

Mr Trump said he had designated a team that would meet over the weekend with politicians to resolve the standoff over his demand for a border wall.

About 800,000 federal workers have been affected by the December 22 closure of about one-quarter of the Federal Government, as Mr Trump withheld his support for new funding until he secures $US5 billion ($7.14 billion) to start building the wall along the US-Mexico border that he promised during his campaign.

Such a wall, he has argued, is needed to stem the flow of illegal immigrants and drugs over the southwestern border.

Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer, who was among those meeting with the President, said Mr Trump had told congressional leaders he would keep the Government closed ""for a very long period of time"".

Senator Schumer said his party's leaders ""told the President we needed the Government open -- he resisted"".

""In fact, he said he'd keep the Government closed for a very long period of time, months or even years,"" Senator Schumer said.

The new Speaker of the House, Nancy Pelosi, called it a ""lengthy and sometimes contentious"" meeting.

""We cannot resolve this until we open up Government,"" she said.

Before the meeting, Mr Trump sent a letter to Congress to try to gain their support for his wall, suggesting he was unlikely to budge on his funding demands.

""Walls work. That's why rich, powerful and successful people build them around their homes,"" Mr Trump wrote in his letter.

""All Americans deserve the same protection.""

But Ms Pelosi had sought to separate the issue of the wall and Government funding, and called on Mr Trump and his fellow Republicans in the Senate to reopen agencies as border talks continue.

""The wall and the Government shutdown really have nothing to do with each other,"" said Ms Pelosi, who has rejected any funding for what she has called an ""immoral"" border wall.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said that even though the new Congress had convened with the Democrats holding a majority in the House of Representative, ""the basic steps that are needed to end this unfortunate standoff really haven't changed at all"".

Earlier, Mr Trump responded to rumblings of a move by Democrats to impeach him, tweeting that he was too successful and popular to be impeached.

""How do you impeach a president who ... had the most successful first two years of any president, and is the most popular Republican in party history,"" Mr Trump tweeted.

""They only want to impeach me because they know they can't win in 2020, too much success!""

The President responded to calls for his impeachment a second time after Democratic congresswoman Rashida Tlaib riled up a supportive crowd by using a swear word to describe Mr Trump and predicting he would be removed from office, just hours after she took her seat in Congress.

Mr Trump launched back, saying: ""You can't impeach somebody doing a great job.""

He added Ms Tlaib had ""dishonoured herself and dishonoured her family"" with the remarks.

""I thought is was highly disrespectful to the United States of America,"" the President said.

House Speaker Ms Pelosi has been cautious about whether her new Democratic majority would ever impeach Mr Trump, but at least two of her members are ready to move forward.

California Representative Brad Sherman and Texas Representative Al Green introduced articles of impeachment against Mr Trump on Thursday, the first day of the new Congress.

Mr Sherman and Mr Green pushed to impeach Mr Trump in 2017 and 2018 but the House blocked those resolutions twice, with the help of Democrats who said the effort was premature.

Ms Pelosi has not ruled out impeachment but has called it a ""divisive activity"" that needs support from both parties.

She and House Judiciary Committee Chairman Jerrold Nadler, have said they want to wait for the outcome of special counsel Robert Mueller's investigation into Russia's meddling in the 2016 election and contacts with the Mr Trump campaign before making a judgement.",105
0,"President Donald Trump will take the national stage tonight to make his case for the construction of a wall at the US-Mexico border.

His live address from the Oval Office comes 18 days into a partial government shutdown, which is the result of a disagreement over funding for Trump's desired border wall. The shutdown has impacted nearly 800,000 federal employees (and caused garbage to pile up in national parks), but Trump has indicated that he won't end the shutdown until he secures $US5 billion in funding for the wall.

Trump most likely hopes that his national address and visit to the southwest will boost public support for a wall. But such an enormous construction project would have significant impacts on the environment around the nation's southern border.

What's more, the Department of Homeland Security has already indicated that it will leverage a law that enables the government to expedite border infrastructure by waiving certain legal requirements, which would allow the project to sidestep dozens of environmental rules in California.

Here are five ways that a new border wall would wreak havoc on the environment.

The US-Mexico border is nearly 2,000 miles long and peppered with marshes, deserts, and grasslands. The construction of a continuous wall could therefore harm species who are, of course, not on the administration's immigration radar.

More than 1,500 species of flora and fauna, like the bighorn sheep shown above, make their homes along this biologically diverse strip of North America. Sixty-two of these species are considered vulnerable, endangered, or critically endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). And many of those species would face extirpation - meaning local extinction in the US - if they were unable to access habitats and resources on either side of the border, according to a study from Stanford University.

Of those species, 17% would be stuck living in an area of roughly 7,700 square miles or less - elevating their risk of extirpation according to IUCN guidelines. According to the study, which was published in the journal BioScience in July 2018, some of these at-risk species include the endangered jaguar and ocelot.

The two Stanford biologists behind the study, Paul Ehrlich and Rodolfo Dirzo, explained that physical barriers - whether they be rivers, mountains, or a human-made wall - can deter or prevent animals from finding mates, fresh water, and necessary food.

Dirzo told the Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment that ""cut off like this, the bighorn and other animals and plants will become zombie species - populations that are demographically and genetically doomed.""

Dirzo and Erhlich noted the border wall could also impede flying species that enjoy riding currents close to the ground. Examples include the ­endangered Quino checkerspot butterfly or the ferruginous pygmy owl.

Echoing those concerns, the National Audubon Society, the National Resources Defence Council, and more than 170 conservation groups penned a letter to Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen in November.

The letter elaborated on the impact of a wall on ""environmentally sensitive conservation areas"" like the Lower Rio Grande Valley area, which has a plethora of butterfly and bird fauna. Bruce Stein, chief scientist at the National Wildlife Federation, wrote, ""barriers like border walls can interfere with the ability of animals to meet their daily needs, make seasonal migrations or disperse to new areas.""

Quartz, which first reported on the letter to Nielsen, noted that an unfamiliar obstacle could even deter birds, despite the fact that they could theoretically fly to heights above it.

Dirzo also told the Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment that a barrier like a wall would limit how much a species could move ""to track habitats that shift due to a changing climate.""

Rising temperatures and extreme weather are already altering certain regions' ecology, leading animals to shift their behaviour in order to survive and find food. A wall could prevent creatures from successfully adapting. Stein also pointed this out in the letter to Neilson.

A wall that cuts animals' habitat into pieces would consequently force their populations into smaller subgroups that are effectively unable to interact and mate with one another.

That would make each remaining subgroup more vulnerable to diseases and natural disasters. Plus, less gene flow between individuals within a species means less genetic diversity, and a higher possibility of inbreeding. Overall, these consequences would increase a species' overall risk for extinction.

According to Vox, fewer than 200 total Mexican grey wolves remained in the wild in the US and Mexico in 2016. A report from the Center for Biological Diversity in July 2018 noted that the US population of Mexican grey wolves increased by only four individuals between 2014 and 2017. In the report, Bryan Bird, Defenders of Wildlife's southwest program director, said that the ""Mexican grey wolves are in a race with extinction, and the clock is ticking.""

A wall separating the some three dozen wolves in Mexico from their counterparts in the US could therefore be a deadly blow for the world's most endangered wolf.

Impacts on wildlife aside, the proposed border wall could also impact the quotidian movements of three major rivers and their tributaries.

The wall would need to bisect the Rio Grande, Colorado, and Tijuana Rivers. Bob Irvin, president of the environmental group American Rivers, told News Deeply that between 100 and 500 rivers and streams would be affected.

The wall would ""undoubtedly change the flow of those rivers and streams, and it would also impair the water quality in them,"" he said.

Irvin added that ""when you change the flow of a river, you're changing the natural cleansing mechanisms of that river. So you certainly could see a buildup of pollutants - both solid and chemical - as a result of that.""

If the border wall wound up acting as a 2,000-mile dam, debris could pile up any time there was a storm, impeding the flow of the river. Irvin told News Deeply that's already happening along some sections of wall that already exist in Arizona.

According to a report by the Sierra Club, such walls have contributed to severe flooding and flood damage before when constructed across natural drainage points.

During a seasonal rain storm, that wall acted as a dam, flooding the sister cities of Nogales and Sonara in 6 feet of water. The disaster caused $US8 million in property damage and two deaths. Six years later, a similar flood happened again in Nogales, when debris blocked a 60-foot section of the border.

There's little evidence that the designs for the proposed continuous border wall would account for mitigation of possible flood risks. Quartz even reported that 8 miles of the planned wall in Texas would be built on a floodplain.

In a letter to the leaders of US Customs and Border Protection (CBP), a group of environmental advocates including Friends of the Earth and the Sierra Club said they anticipated that the section of the wall planned for Hidalgo County, Texas might worsen flooding in adjacent parts of Mexico.

""We are extremely concerned that CBP does not appear to be conducting this project in compliance with NEPA [the National Environmental Policy Act] or other applicable federal laws,"" they wrote.",106
0,"It looks like there's no end in sight to the battle over the border, and now President Trump has another challenge on his hands.

As the new Democratic House of Representatives is sworn in Thursday, they're showing few signs of willingness to negotiate a deal.

After a meeting at the White House Wednesday, Democrats again refused to give Trump and the GOP the money for a wall at the US-Mexico border.

New Democratic House leader Nancy Pelosi says ""there's no amount of persuasion"" from the president that could get her to fund the wall.

Democrats have made an offer on the budget, but it doesn't include funding for a wall.

""We're asking the president to open up government,"" Pelosi said. ""We're giving him a Republican path to do that. Why would he not do it? Why would he not do it?""

The president hosted a bipartisan briefing on border security in the Situation Room Wednesday as the partial government shutdown drags on, now in its 13th day.

""Could be a long time and it could be quickly,"" said Trump. ""Could be a long time. It's too important a subject to walk away from.""

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) says the president couldn't give a good answer why the shutdown should continue.

""The only reason that they are shutting down the government is very simple,"" said Schumer. ""They want to try and leverage that shutdown into their proposals on border security.""

Earlier in the day, the president at his first cabinet meeting of the new year once again reiterated his case for the border wall. ""We're asking for $5.6 (billion). Somebody said $2.5. No, look, this is national security we're talking about,"" he said.

House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy said Democrats didn't even want to hear about how bad the situation at the border is.

He said the Democrats quickly interrupted Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen when she tried to explain it and didn't even listen to her.

McCarthy said the president asked lawmakers to discuss other ways to end the shutdown. ""Both sides can sit down, find a compromise that actually secures the border,"" McCarthy said.

Meanwhile, the two sides will meet again Friday and the showdown could last a good while yet, even as House Democrats are planning their own agenda of investigations into the president and other measures like taking on climate change and possible health care legislation.",107

After Democratic congressional leaders turned Mr Trump down at a meeting in the White House situation room, the Republican president threatened to take the controversial step of using emergency powers to build the wall without approval from Congress.

Mr Trump is withholding his support for a bill that would fully fund the government until he secures the money for the wall and as a result about 800,000 federal workers have been unpaid due to the closure of about a quarter of the federal government.

Administration officials, led by vice-president Mike Pence, and congressional staffers are to meet during the weekend to try to end the impasse over the 2-week-old shutdown.

Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said Democrats had told Mr Trump during the meeting to end the shutdown.

""He resisted,"" Schumer said. ""In fact, he said he'd keep the government closed for a very long period of time, months or even years.""

Trump confirmed that comment but painted a more positive picture of the meeting, the first since a new era of divided government began when Democrats took control of the House of Representatives on Thursday.

""We had a very, very productive meeting, and we've come a long way,"" Mr Trump said.

But raising the stakes in his tussle with the newly emboldened Democrats, Trump threatened extraordinary measures to build the wall, which he says is needed to stem the flow of illegal immigrants and drugs into the United States.

Asked by a reporter whether he had considered declaring a national emergency to build the wall, Trump said: ""Yes, I have . . . I may do it . . . But we can call a national emergency and build it very quickly.""

He said he could declare a national emergency ""because of the security of our country, absolutely"".

The US constitution assigns Congress the power over funding the federal government so Mr Trump likely would face legal challenges if he tried to bypass Congress on financing the wall. Building a wall - and having Mexico pay for it - was one of Trump's main promises when he ran for president in 2016.

Trump's wall project is estimated to cost about $23 billion (€20.1 billion).

Democrats have called the wall immoral, ineffective and medieval.

Nancy Pelosi, the newly elected Democratic speaker of the House, said Friday's meeting with Mr Trump was ""sometimes contentious"" but that they agreed to continue talking.

""But we recognize on the Democratic side that we really cannot resolve this until we open up government and we made that very clear to the president,"" she said.

Credit rating agency Moody's says the shutdown will cause minimal US economic and credit market disruption but there could be a more severe impact on financial markets and the broad economy if the closure is protracted.

A Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll last week showed that 50 per cent of the public blame Mr Trump for the shutdown and 7 per cent blame Republican lawmakers, against 32 per cent who blame Democrats.

In a December 11th meeting with Mrs Pelosi and Mr Schumer, Mr Trump said he would be ""proud"" to shut the government over the security issue and would not blame Democrats. He has since said they are responsible.

The partial shutdown is straining the country's immigration system, worsening backlogs in courts and complicating hiring for employers.

Talks yesterday to end the government shutdown apparently ended up being fruitless, and it appears that both sides are digging in:

President Trump and Democratic congressional leaders dug in Wednesday for a lengthy partial shutdown in a newly divided government after a White House meeting -- the first in 22 days -- could not break an impasse over Mr. Trump's demands for billions of dollars for a border wall.

During the contentious meeting in the Situation Room, Mr. Trump made his case for a wall on the southwestern border and rejected Democrats' proposals for reopening the government while the two sides ironed out their differences.

""I would look foolish if I did that,"" Mr. Trump responded after Senator Chuck Schumer of New York, the Democratic leader, posed the question to him directly, according to three officials familiar with the meeting who described it on the condition of anonymity. He said that the wall was why he was elected, one of the officials said.

Democrats were equally adamant, according to another official who was present for the discussion. Pressed by Vice President Mike Pence and Representative Kevin McCarthy of California, the incoming minority leader, they refused to budge from their offer to devote $1.3 billion to border security. The official also insisted on anonymity to describe the private conversation.

Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, the majority leader, said after the meeting that he had no intention of putting Democratic bills to reopen the government to a vote if Mr. Trump would not sign them.

""We're hopeful that, somehow, in the coming days and weeks, we'll be able to reach an agreement,"" Mr. McConnell told reporters at the Capitol, offering an ominous timeline.

The events underscored the personal and political crosscurrents standing in the way of any compromise between a president unwilling to lose face with his core supporters on his signature campaign promise and newly empowered Democrats -- poised to assume control of the House on Thursday -- who refuse to give ground on an issue that has come to symbolize Mr. Trump's immigration policies.

With the partial government funding lapse dragging into its 12th day and affecting 800,000 federal employees, the confrontation in the Situation Room only served to highlight the depth of the divide.

""Could be a long time, or it could be quickly,"" Mr. Trump said of resolving the shutdown. ""It's too important a subject to walk away from.""

Representative Nancy Pelosi of California, who is in line to be elected speaker on Thursday, said: ""We are asking the president to open up government. Why would he not do it?""

""He could not give a good answer,"" Mr. Schumer said.

Mr. Trump tried creative ways to persuade the Democrats that they should support his wall. At one point, he said Ms. Pelosi should back it because she was ""a good Catholic"" and Vatican City is surrounded by a wall, according to one of the officials familiar with the discussion.

In her first legislative act as speaker, Ms. Pelosi plans on Thursday to bring up two bills to reopen the government. One would fund the Department of Homeland Security through Feb. 8, providing a month to break the impasse over border security funding, and a second would provide money for the remaining shuttered agencies and departments through September. The homeland security measure would devote $1.3 billion to border security measures, such as enhanced surveillance and fortified fencing, but not the wall.

Mr. Trump's rejection of those measures left the prospects of a resolution at their dimmest since the shutdown began on Dec. 22. It also highlighted the difficulty of the current situation, in which Democrats, Republicans and even some White House staff members have found themselves trying to anticipate what Mr. Trump will accept.

The president asked the congressional leaders to return to the White House on Friday to continue the talks, after Democrats had completed their leadership elections, according to an official who attended the meeting. A second official who attended said Mr. Trump's team believed it would be easier for Ms. Pelosi to negotiate once she was officially installed as speaker. Both insisted on anonymity to describe the private gathering.

In a pair of evening tweets, Mr. Trump seemed to hold out hope of an agreement, writing: ""I remain ready and willing to work with Democrats to pass a bill that secures our borders, supports the agents and officers on the ground, and keeps America Safe. Let's get it done!""

Politico has more:

President Donald Trump and congressional leaders made no tangible progress toward ending a 12-day government shutdown at a meeting on Wednesday, and Senate GOP leaders said they would not even take up House Democrats' bills to reopen the government -- underscoring the slim odds of quickly resolving the impasse in the new Congress.

Minutes after the meeting began, the Trump administration's attempt to lecture Democrats on border security issues dissolved into a raucous finger-pointing match that made clear that a partial shutdown would drag into a third weekend.

The president's face-to-face meeting with Democratic leaders was the first since the shutdown started before Christmas and comes as a quarter of the government remains shuttered, affecting close to 800,000 federal workers. With no resolution reached, Trump invited the group to meet again Friday, a day after House Democrats' plan to push through their own shutdown-ending deal despite Senate GOP leaders' warnings that the funding bills won't even come up for a vote.

""The Senate will be glad to vote on a measure that the House passes that the president will sign. But we're not going to vote on anything else,"" Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said after returning from the White House briefing with the top congressional leaders of both parties.

McConnell added that he hopes a deal could be reached within ""days"" or even ""weeks"" -- an ominous sign of a protracted funding battle. He later came to the Senate floor to trash the House proposal as a ""waste"" of time for the Senate to take up and a ""total nonstarter.""

""We're not interested in having show votes here in the Senate,"" he said. ""It's exactly the kind of proposal you'd expect of the incoming House Democrats are choosing to stage a political sideshow rather than doing the hard work of helping govern the country.""

The meeting stretched for more than an hour, but the group of senior lawmakers and White House officials didn't seriously discuss a single new proposal to break the impasse, according to several attendees. Besides setting the date for a Friday meeting, there were no clear steps toward resuming negotiations that have been stalled since before Christmas.

At three different times, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer asked Trump why he won't support reopening the other areas of the government that don't have to do with the immigration dispute, according to a source familiar with the meeting. Trump replied: ""I would be foolish if I did that.""

None of this bodes well for a quick end to the shutdown even after the Democrats take control of Congress later today. In a logical universe, of course, the resolution would be easy to resolve. One option would be the proposal put forward before Christmas by Vice-President Pence and OMB Director and Acting Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney that would have pushed the funding debate into February and provided up to $2.5 billion in border security funding, although that funding would not directly apply to the border wall. Given the fact that this proposal came directly through Pence and Mulvaney, it was assumed, apparently incorrectly, that the President had at least tacitly agreed that the proposal could be put forward even if he didn't formally endorse it. Apparently, that wasn't the case. A second proposal was one that Democrats will apparently vote on later today that would fully fund those parts of the government that remain unfunded but leave open the budget for the Department of Homeland Security, which is where the border wall funding issue lies. This would allow the vast majority of the government to reopen and give legislators time to resolve the border security debate. As I said the other day it was unlikely that the President would agree to a deal like this because it would deny him a significant amount of leverage in the ongoing showdown. Therefore, it's not surprising that Trump has rejected that idea because it would make him look ""foolish."" A final option, of course, would be for Congress to simply pass the bill that passed the Senate prior to the shutdown, seemingly with the President's support. This proposal would kick the entire unfunded portion of the budget down the road to some time in February, This proposal, of course, did not pass the House and thus resulted in the shutdown that has been in effect since December 22nd.

Taking all of this into account, the prospects for a quick resolution to the shutdown looks grim indeed, at least in the short term. The President appears unlikely to move off his demand for $5 billion in border wall funding and Democrats are not going to be inclined to give in to the President this early in their tenure in the House. In the Senate, meanwhile, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is saying that he won't put any proposal on the floor unless it's certain that the President would sign it. As long as this is the case this shutdown will remain at an impasse and the odds that it will continue for another week or more, at which point it would become the longest government shutdown in history, are looking exceedingly ""good"" (or bad as the case may be. Perhaps that won't be a case after a week or so as the White House and the new Democratic majority in the House feel each other out in these early days of the year. Until then, though, and until both sides come up with a deal they can both accept, this is going to continue for the foreseeable future.",111

0,"WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump said Tuesday that he intends to keep the federal government closed until he secures the desired funding from Congress for his promised border wall, and he cast doubt about the performance of Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome H. Powell after a sharp downturn in U.S. stock markets.

In an Oval Office appearance on Christmas morning, Trump praised Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin despite the stock markets suffering their steepest Christmas Eve decline in decades but was more circumspect about his handpicked Fed chair.

""Well, we'll see,"" Trump said when a journalist asked whether he had confidence in Powell. ""They're raising interest rates too fast, that's my opinion. But I certainly have confidence. But I think it'll straighten. They're raising interest rates too fast because they think the economy is so good. But I think that they will get it pretty soon, I really do.""

As for whether he has confidence in Mnuchin, whose Sunday calls to reassure major bank executives rattled investors and may have exacerbated Monday's sell-off, Trump told reporters, ""Yes, I do. Very talented guy, very smart person.""

Trump made his comments during a Christmas photo op in the Oval Office, where he spoke by video teleconference with service members from all five branches of the armed forces who are stationed in Alaska, Bahrain, Guam and Qatar.

About 25 percent of the government is shut down for the fourth straight day with Congress at a stalemate over Trump's demand for $5 billion in wall construction money.

""I can't tell you when the government is going to reopen,"" he said. ""I can tell you it's not going to be open until we have a wall, a fence, whatever they'd like to call it. I'll call it whatever they want. But it's all the same thing. It's a barrier from people pouring into our country.""

The president defended his plan to construct a wall along the border with Mexico that he insisted only an Olympic athlete would be able to scale. ""If you don't have that, then we're just not opening,"" Trump said.

All told, about 800,000 of 2.1 million federal workers nationwide - or more than a third - are estimated to be affected in some way by the shutdown. Trump claimed that many of them support the shutdown.

""Many of those workers have said to me, communicated - stay out until you get the funding for the wall,"" Trump said. ""These federal workers want the wall.""

But his claim conflicts with the accounts of federal workers' union leaders.

""Federal employees should not have to pay the personal price for all of this dysfunction,"" said Tony Reardon, president of the National Treasury Employees Union, which represents 150,000 members at 33 federal agencies and departments. ""This shutdown is a travesty. Congress and the White House have not done their fundamental jobs of keeping the government open.""

In a survey of 1,500 union members, about 85 percent said they have limited holiday season spending or are planning to do so because of uncertainty about income, Reardon said on Christmas Eve. He said they include one who said ""I have recently lost my wife and now . . .. I have to put off buying her headstone. Breaks my heart.""

Another responded, ""I can't buy any Christmas presents and am considering returning those I already have. Mortgage companies and utility companies won't wait to get paid,"" according to Reardon.

The government shutdown comes near the end of what will probably be the worst year for the U.S. stock market since the financial crisis a decade ago. Many sectors are now technically in a ""bear market,"" down more than 20 percent.

Before the recent reversal in the stock market, which began during the fall, Trump had frequently boasted that stocks were soaring during his tenure, claiming credit for the upswing.

The downturn has caused great uncertainty in the White House as Trump has sought someone to blame, and he has lashed out publicly at Powell. On Saturday, several news outlets reported that Trump was looking for ways to potentially fire Powell. That spurred Mnuchin to release a statement on Trump's behalf that the president did not believe he had the ""right"" to fire Powell.

Many economists and analysts on Wall Street say that an attempt to fire the Fed chief would send markets in a tailspin amid uncertainty over the stability of the U.S. central bank, the most important institution in shaping U.S. and global markets.

Trump is angry that Powell is continuing the Fed's long-telegraphed plan to raise its benchmark interest rate and scale back other extraordinary measures intended to support the economy. The Fed's benchmark rate is now 2.25 to 2.5 percent, higher than the near-zero interest rate the Fed had pursued for years but still historically low.

Trump complains that his predecessor Barack Obama benefited from lower interest rates, spurring economic growth. Others point out that the Fed, which operates independently of the White House, had pursued a low-interest-rate policy because the economy was much weaker than it is today.

""They are raising interest rates too fast, that's my opinion,"" Trump said Tuesday. ""President Obama didn't do much of that . . . He had a very low interest rate.""

Powell was Mnuchin's recommendation when Trump was seeking a new Fed chair a year ago, and some close to Trump have questioned whether the president will begin to blame the treasury secretary, too, for the sell-off. But on Tuesday he praised Mnuchin, a longtime friend and finance chairman of his 2016 campaign.

Again on Tuesday, Trump tried to place blame for Washington's budget stalemate solely on Democrats, portraying their leaders as disingenuous and claiming that they support the notion of a physical barrier along the border and object to building the wall only because it is Trump's idea.

Trump likened the situation to his May 2017 firing of James Comey as FBI director, saying ""Democrats hated him"" until he was fired and then Comey was treated as a hero.

Even as he vowed to keep the government closed to secure wall funding, Trump claimed that much of his envisioned wall was already being built. He said he had awarded a contract ""at a great price"" for a 115-mile section of wall in Texas and plans to visit the site in January for ""a ground-breaking"" ceremony.

Administration officials have provided no details about this construction project or the terms of the contract.

Trump said he hopes to have all portions of the wall completed - either old fencing renovated or new construction - by Election Day 2020, an indication that he sees building the wall chiefly as a political issue tied to his reelection chances.

Trump said Tuesday that the wall as he envisions it would be a fortress that no normal human could breach.

""Now there may be the case of an Olympic champion who can get over the wall, but for the most part you are not able to do it,"" he said. ""Very high. It's gonna be 30 feet. Much of it is 30 feet high. Some if it's low. But in some areas we have it as high as 30 feet. That's like a three-story building.""

Trump said of the government shutdown, ""It's a disgrace what's happening in our country. But other than that, I wish everybody a very Merry Christmas.""",115
0,"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi accused President Donald Trump of staging the Situation Room meeting Wednesday so he could walk out, calling the move ""unpresidential.""

""Not only was the President unpresidential -- surprise, surprise -- yesterday in his behavior, I think the meeting was a setup, so he could walk out, but I'll say just that,"" Pelosi told reporters in her weekly briefing.

""I don't even know that the President wants the wall, I think he just wants to debate on the wall,"" she added.

Trump and Democrats remain stalemated over funding for Trump's southern border wall, as the government shutdown enters its 20th day. House Democrats, meanwhile, will continue to vote on spending bills next week to reopen shuttered parts of government -- but Trump has refused to sign them unless he his $5.7 billion wall request is fulfilled.

Asked by CNN's Manu Raju how the House would respond if Trump declared a national emergency, Pelosi said ""let's see what he does.""

""If and when the President does that, you'll find out how we would react,"" she said, predicting Trump will have problems on his own side of the aisle ""for exploiting this situation in a way that enhances his power.""

""I don't think he really wants a solution,"" she later added. ""I think he loves the distraction.""

Asked what she would say to families who've lost family members in crimes by undocumented immigrants or to the opioid crisis, Pelosi acknowledged the deaths were tragic, but she said ""the plural of 'anecdote' is not data"" and that children were also dying in US custody and families were being separated.

""One death is more than we should be able to bear, whether it's the corporal (referring to Cpl. Ronil Singh) or whether it's the children, but the fact is we have to have public policy that secures the border and what the President is proposing would not eliminate those possibilities.""

She said it's important to be ""concerned about every death that happens because ... we live in an imperfect world and that is very sad, but it is not a justification for having more children die in custody or be separated from their families.""

""I find that appalling,"" she added. ""They find it normal.""

Pelosi, who represents San Francisco, also blasted the President for tweeting Wednesday that he ordered FEMA to withhold funds to California in the aftermath of the wildfires unless the state ""get(s) their act together"" and conducts what he called ""proper Forest Management.""

Pelosi said Trump had ""no right to withhold those funds.""

""The votes he did get in California were in rural California,"" she said. ""If you think you're punishing our state, you're punishing your own voters.""",116
0,", to fund the Homeland Security Department at fiscal year 2018 levels through February 8, allowing more time to negotiate over border security. The use of a stopgap measure for the Homeland Security Department would separate border wall funding disputes from the remaining appropriations bills that have garnered bipartisan support. However, Senate Republican leadership is unlikely to bring the measures to a vote without President Trump's agreement.

National Active and Retired Federal Employees Assn. President Ken Thomas said in a statement:

""The partial government shutdown continues through its 14th day, disrupting the missions of the American government and threatening to strain the finances of hard-working federal employees, as next week's paychecks will be delayed if the shutdown continues. Adding insult to injury the President issued an executive order last week to freeze federal pay rates for calendar year 2019. This ill-advised combination of shutdown and pay freeze hurts employee morale, undermines the competitiveness of the civil service in attracting and retaining top talent, and imperils the financial security of federal public servants and their families.""

Without Senate action and presidential approval, the partial government shutdown will run into its third week. The shutdown continues to curtail operations and hundreds of thousands of federal employees continue to go without pay. Roughly 380,000 federal employees are furloughed without guaranteed back pay and approximately 420,000 are working without pay until funding is restored.

Meanwhile, President Donald Trump has sent a letter to Congress Thursday morning stressing border security. He attached a presentation that Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen was planning to deliver during a meeting with Congressional leadership in the White House Situation Room earlier this week. Some of those present did not want to hear the presentation at the time, and so the President decided to make it available to all Members of Congress.

Congratulations to Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and her entire team, on her election to be Speaker of the House. I look forward to working together on our shared priorities for the American People, including rebuilding our infrastructure, reforming unfair trade deals, and reducing the price of prescription drugs. Our recent bipartisan success on numerous legislative accomplishments such as Criminal Justice Reform, opioid legislation, and the Farm Bill, underscores the extraordinary achievements that are possible when we rise above party politics to advance the good of the Nation as a whole.

As we begin this new Congress, our first task should be to reopen the Government and to deliver on our highest duty as elected officials: the security of the Nation and its borders.

It is the sovereign right of every nation to establish an immigration program in its national interest -- lawfully admitting those who have followed the rules, while denying entry to those who break the rules or fail to meet the requirements established in law.

A nation that fails to control its borders cannot fulfill its most basic obligations to its citizens -- physical safety, economic security, essential public services, and the uniform protection of our laws.

I was grateful for the opportunity to meet with Congressional leadership at the White House this Wednesday to discuss the border security crisis, and the need for a government funding bill that secures the border and keeps Americans safe.

During the meeting, there was debate over the nature and extent of this crisis and its impact on Americans. It had been my hope that Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen would have the opportunity to deliver a presentation discussing the facts about the depth and severity of the humanitarian crisis and the security crisis that is now unfolding at the Southern Border.

However, some of those present did not want to hear the presentation at the time, and so I have instead decided to make the presentation available to all Members of Congress. I encourage you to review it carefully, to share it with your staff, and to discuss it with other lawmakers. In crafting a Homeland Security bill, it is essential that we make decisions based upon the facts on the ground -- not ideology and rhetoric -- and that we listen to the law enforcement personnel on the front lines. The Southern Border is a very dangerous place -- in fact, Border Patrol agents routinely encounter some of the most dangerous criminals, cartels, and traffickers anywhere in the world.

Effective border security must dramatically reduce the entry of illegal immigrants, criminals, and drugs; it must keep out terrorists, public safety threats, and those otherwise inadmissible under U.S. law; and it must ensure that those who do enter without legal permission can be promptly and safely returned home.

As the enclosed presentation makes clear, current funding levels, resources, and authorities are woefully inadequate to meet the scope of the problem. We are no longer in a status quo situation at the Southern Border but in a crisis situation. Status quo funding is not enough.

Illegal immigration is NOT progressive -- by every measure, it is unfair, unjust, uncompassionate, and cruel. Many people are killed. It hurts both those who make the journey and so many communities bearing the cost in lives, safety, and dollars.

Senator Chuck Schumer once said: ""Illegal immigration is wrong, plain and simple. Until the American people are convinced that we will stop future flows of illegal immigration, we will make no progress on dealing with the millions of illegal immigrants who are here now, and on rationalizing our system of legal immigration. That's plain and simple and unavoidable.""

Absolutely critical to border security and national security is a wall or a physical barrier that prevents entry in the first place. Members of both parties -- including then Senators Obama and Clinton, current Senator Schumer, and many other members of the House and Senate -- all voted for a hard, physical barrier. Walls work. That's why rich, powerful, and successful people build them around their homes. All Americans deserve the same protection. In Israel, it is 99 percent effective.

We must also close the legal gaps in America's defenses. Loopholes in federal law that prevent removals provide a magnet for illegal entry, and a lucrative business model for vicious coyotes, while overwhelming the U.S. immigration system. The worst loopholes incentivize the smuggling of minors. Under these legal loopholes, if an illegal minor, or those traveling with a minor, merely set foot on United States soil, they cannot be successfully returned home. This explains the profound increases in the arrival of minors travelling both alone and with adults on the dangerous journey to our border.

To protect these children from abuse, and stop this illegal flow, we must close these loopholes. This is an urgent humanitarian necessity. Children are terribly used by criminals and coyotes to gain access to our country -- they are the biggest victims of all.

The most pressing legal changes are as follows:

Americans have endured decades of broken promises on illegal immigration. Now, is the time for both parties to rise above the partisan discord, to set aside political convenience, and to put the national interest first. Now is the time -- this is the moment -- to finally secure the border and create the lawful and safe immigration system Americans, and those wanting to become Americans, deserve.",117
0,"A briefing at the White House on Wednesday didn't appear to yield any progress on ending the partial government shutdown.

It looks like lawmakers are back to the drawing board when it comes to making a deal on border security and ending a partial government shutdown.

After sitting down with bipartisan congressional leaders at the White House Wednesday, President Donald Trump invited the group to back to continue their discussion on Friday.

Negotiations to reopen part of the government have been frozen for several days, and border wall funding is the big sticking point.

Earlier this week, House Democrats unveiled a plan to end the shutdown -- but it doesn't include the $5 billion President Trump requested for a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border.

Lawmakers at Wednesday's briefing indicated there wasn't any real progress made.

Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said it could take weeks to reach an agreement, though House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy was more optimistic.

""Both sides can sit down, find a compromise that actually secures the border. We had everybody in the room say they want a secure border. So maybe we work a combination to make it solved,"" McCarthy said.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer floated the idea of reopening the government while the two sides continue to hash out border security.

""Open up the government, as we continue to debate what is the best way to secure our borders,"" he said.

But earlier today, Trump said he's willing to keep the partial shutdown going.

""As long as it takes. I mean, look, I'm prepared. I think the people of the country think I'm right,"" Trump said.

Democrats are expected to vote on that spending package after they assume control of the House on Thursday, even though the Republican-controlled Senate has said it won't rubber stamp anything the president doesn't approve of.",118
0,"In an exclusive interview on Fox News Channel on New Year's Eve, the president also weighed in on Democratic leaders' 'pure obstruction'

President Donald Trump quipped about Sen. Elizabeth Warren's (D-Mass.) stability -- and offered comments on weightier foreign and domestic matters -- during an exclusive interview with host Pete Hegseth on Fox News Channel's ""All-American New Year"" on Monday night, New Year's Eve.

When Hegseth asked him if he thought Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) believed she could win in a bid for president in 2020, the president joked, ""You'd have to ask her psychiatrist.""

Warren announced on Monday that she was filing paperwork to form an exploratory committee. She's the first Democratic to do so for the 2020 election.

Trump said he was happy about Warren's announcement, that he hopes she secures the Democratic nomination -- and that her running would be a ""wonderful thing"" for him.

""I'd love to run against her,"" said Trump, adding that he believes he is ""going to win big.""

Trump wielded some sharp criticism of Democratic leaders Sen. Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y.) and Rep. Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) during the interview, inviting them to work with him to resolve the impasse over funding for the border wall, as ""a lot of people are looking to get their paycheck.""

""They can come over right now, they could have come over any time. I spent Christmas in the White House. I spent New Year's Eve now in the White House and you know, I'm here. I'm ready to go.""

Trump was in Washington working, but Democrat leaders have not yet returned.

The new session of Congress begins Thursday, January 3.

Trump described the Democrat leaders' antics as ""pure obstruction,"" pointing specifically to their refusal to fund the wall -- which led to the current partial government shutdown -- and the painfully slow process of approving 360 of his nominees for various positions.

On whether he plans to stand firm on his request for $5 billion to build a barrier on the southern border, the president was resolute.

""We have to have border security and a wall is part of border security. You know, I hear so much about 'the wall is old-fashioned.' No, the wall is not old-fashioned, the wall is 100 percent foolproof ... I guess they'd say the wheel is old-fashioned, but it's been around for a long time. The wall is the only way to do it -- and technology. Nobody knows more about technology than me, but technology [is] just the bells and whistles on the wall.""

""If you don't have the wall, you're going to have people coming in,"" he added. ""And my border patrol people, they do a fantastic job. But you know, they need the backup of the wall and they're the ones that want it more than anybody, Pete.""

Shifting the focus from domestic to foreign matters, Trump told Hegseth that his discussion with Sen. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.) regarding plans to withdraw troops from Syria included reassurances on the manner of withdrawal.

""You know, we were supposed to be in Syria for three to four months and that was four or five years ago ... I campaigned on getting out of the endless wars,"" said Trump.

""We've really largely eradicated ISIS. Now that doesn't mean we don't totally finish the job, but that's going to be a very short period of time. We have to bring our troops back home. It's time.""

Among his predictions for 2019 were the creation of a ""great form of wealth"" for the country, including jobs, a strong military, and ""tremendous trade deals.""

On a lighter note, Trump identified the American people as 2018's biggest winners, noting specifically the tax cuts, jobs, and rebuilt military citizens have enjoyed under his administration.

Among his predictions for 2019 were the creation of a ""great form of wealth"" for the country, including jobs, a strong military, and ""tremendous trade deals.""

About his resolutions, Trump simply said, ""Just success and prosperity and health for our country. That's all I want.""

On Tuesday morning, as the New Year dawned, President Trump tweeted good wishes to all, including ""the haters and the fake news media.""

He included a prediction of a ""fantastic year"" for all in 2019, with the exception of those suffering from ""Trump Derangement Syndrome"" -- for whom he offered a word of advice: ""Just calm down and enjoy the ride -- great things are happening for this country.""",119
0,"WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump said Tuesday that he intends to keep the federal government closed until he secures the desired funding from Congress for his promised border wall, and he cast doubt about the performance of Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome H. Powell after a sharp downturn in U.S. stock markets.

In an Oval Office appearance on Christmas morning, Trump praised Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin despite the stock markets suffering their steepest Christmas Eve decline in decades but was more circumspect about his handpicked Fed chair.

""Well, we'll see,"" Trump said when a journalist asked whether he had confidence in Powell. ""They're raising interest rates too fast, that's my opinion. But I certainly have confidence. But I think it'll straighten. They're raising interest rates too fast because they think the economy is so good. But I think that they will get it pretty soon, I really do.""

As for whether he has confidence in Mnuchin, whose Sunday calls to reassure major bank executives rattled investors and may have exacerbated Monday's sell-off, Trump told reporters, ""Yes, I do. Very talented guy, very smart person.""

Trump made his comments during a Christmas photo op in the Oval Office, where he spoke by video teleconference with service members from all five branches of the armed forces who are stationed in Alaska, Bahrain, Guam and Qatar.

""I can't tell you when the government is going to reopen,"" he said. ""I can tell you it's not going to be open until we have a wall, a fence, whatever they'd like to call it. I'll call it whatever they want. But it's all the same thing. It's a barrier from people pouring into our country.""

The president defended his plan to construct a wall along the border with Mexico that he insisted only an Olympic athlete would be able to scale. ""If you don't have that, then we're just not opening,"" Trump said.

All told, about 800,000 of 2.1 million federal workers nationwide - or more than a third - are estimated to be affected in some way by the shutdown. Trump claimed that many of them support the shutdown.

""Many of those workers have said to me, communicated - stay out until you get the funding for the wall,"" Trump said. ""These federal workers want the wall.""

But his claim conflicts with the accounts of federal workers' union leaders.

""Federal employees should not have to pay the personal price for all of this dysfunction,"" said Tony Reardon, president of the National Treasury Employees Union, which represents 150,000 members at 33 federal agencies and departments. ""This shutdown is a travesty. Congress and the White House have not done their fundamental jobs of keeping the government open.""

In a survey of 1,500 union members, about 85 percent said they have limited holiday season spending or are planning to do so because of uncertainty about income, Reardon said on Christmas Eve. He said they include one who said ""I have recently lost my wife and now . . .. I have to put off buying her headstone. Breaks my heart.""

Another responded, ""I can't buy any Christmas presents and am considering returning those I already have. Mortgage companies and utility companies won't wait to get paid,"" according to Reardon.

The government shutdown comes near the end of what will probably be the worst year for the U.S. stock market since the financial crisis a decade ago. Many sectors are now technically in a ""bear market,"" down more than 20 percent.

Before the recent reversal in the stock market, which began during the fall, Trump had frequently boasted that stocks were soaring during his tenure, claiming credit for the upswing.

The downturn has caused great uncertainty in the White House as Trump has sought someone to blame, and he has lashed out publicly at Powell. On Saturday, several news outlets reported that Trump was looking for ways to potentially fire Powell. That spurred Mnuchin to release a statement on Trump's behalf that the president did not believe he had the ""right"" to fire Powell.

Many economists and analysts on Wall Street say that an attempt to fire the Fed chief would send markets in a tailspin amid uncertainty over the stability of the U.S. central bank, the most important institution in shaping U.S. and global markets.

Trump is angry that Powell is continuing the Fed's long-telegraphed plan to raise its benchmark interest rate and scale back other extraordinary measures intended to support the economy. The Fed's benchmark rate is now 2.25 to 2.5 percent, higher than the near-zero interest rate the Fed had pursued for years but still historically low.

Trump complains that his predecessor Barack Obama benefited from lower interest rates, spurring economic growth. Others point out that the Fed, which operates independently of the White House, had pursued a low-interest-rate policy because the economy was much weaker than it is today.

""They are raising interest rates too fast, that's my opinion,"" Trump said Tuesday. ""President Obama didn't do much of that . . . He had a very low interest rate.""

Powell was Mnuchin's recommendation when Trump was seeking a new Fed chair a year ago, and some close to Trump have questioned whether the president will begin to blame the treasury secretary, too, for the sell-off. But on Tuesday he praised Mnuchin, a longtime friend and finance chairman of his 2016 campaign.

Again on Tuesday, Trump tried to place blame for Washington's budget stalemate solely on Democrats, portraying their leaders as disingenuous and claiming that they support the notion of a physical barrier along the border and object to building the wall only because it is Trump's idea.

Trump likened the situation to his May 2017 firing of James Comey as FBI director, saying ""Democrats hated him"" until he was fired and then Comey was treated as a hero.

Even as he vowed to keep the government closed to secure wall funding, Trump claimed that much of his envisioned wall was already being built. He said he had awarded a contract ""at a great price"" for a 115-mile section of wall in Texas and plans to visit the site in January for ""a ground-breaking"" ceremony.

Administration officials have provided no details about this construction project or the terms of the contract.

Trump said he hopes to have all portions of the wall completed - either old fencing renovated or new construction - by Election Day 2020, an indication that he sees building the wall chiefly as a political issue tied to his reelection chances.

Trump said Tuesday that the wall as he envisions it would be a fortress that no normal human could breach.

""Now there may be the case of an Olympic champion who can get over the wall, but for the most part you are not able to do it,"" he said. ""Very high. It's gonna be 30 feet. Much of it is 30 feet high. Some if it's low. But in some areas we have it as high as 30 feet. That's like a three-story building.""

Trump said of the government shutdown, ""It's a disgrace what's happening in our country. But other than that, I wish everybody a very Merry Christmas.""",120
0,"WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump said Tuesday that he intends to keep the federal government closed until he secures the desired funding from Congress for his promised border wall.

""I can't tell you when the government's going to be open. I can tell you it's not going to be open until we have a wall or fence, whatever they'd like to call it,"" Trump said, referring to Democrats who oppose walling off the border.

""I'll call it whatever they want, but it's all the same thing,"" he told reporters. ""It's a barrier from people pouring into our country.""

Trump made the comments after participating in a holiday video conference with representatives from all five branches of the military. The representatives were stationed in Alaska, Bahrain, Guam and Qatar.

Trump argued that drug flows and human trafficking can only be stopped with a wall.

""The only way you're going to do it is to have a physical barrier, meaning a wall,"" he said. ""And if you don't have that, then we're just not opening"" the government.

Democrats say they prefer to spend money on fencing, technology and other means of controlling access to the border. Trump argued that Democrats oppose a wall only because he wants one, likening the situation to his May 2017 firing of James Comey as FBI director, saying ""Democrats hated him"" until he was fired.

Even as Trump vowed to secure wall funding, he said much of his envisioned wall was already being built. He tweeted Monday that he ""just gave out a 115 mile long contract for another large section of the Wall in Texas.""

""We gave it out at a great price,"" Trump said Tuesday, adding that he plans to visit the site in January for a groundbreaking ceremony. ""So we're going to have a great wall there, and we have other sections to give out.""

When asked who had received the contract, Trump replied: ""Different people, different people. Highly bid.""

Administration officials provided no details about the construction project or the terms of the contract.

Trump said Tuesday that the wall as he envisions it would be a fortress that no normal human could breach.

""Now there may be the case of an Olympic champion who can get over the wall, but for the most part you are not able to do it,"" he said. ""Very high. It's gonna be 30 feet. Much of it is 30 feet high. Some if it's low. But in some areas we have it as high as 30 feet. That's like a three-story building.""

As for the shutdown itself, Trump said: ""It's a disgrace what's happening in our country. But other than that, I wish everybody a very Merry Christmas.""

TRUMP ON POWELL

Trump on Tuesday also cast doubt about the performance of Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell after a sharp downturn in U.S. stock markets.

""Well, we'll see,"" Trump said when a journalist asked whether he had confidence in Powell. ""They're raising interest rates too fast, that's my opinion. But I certainly have confidence. But I think it'll straighten. They're raising interest rates too fast because they think the economy is so good. But I think that they will get it pretty soon, I really do.""

The Fed's benchmark rate is now 2.25 percent to 2.5 percent, higher than the near-zero interest rate the Fed had pursued for years, but still historically low.

Trump argued that his predecessor, President Barack Obama, benefited from lower interest rates, spurring economic growth.

""President Obama didn't do much of that,"" Trump said of raising rates. ""Much easier to run when you have no interest rate. He had a really low interest rate.""

Others point out that the Fed, which operates independently of the White House, had pursued a policy of low interest rates dating to the final months of the George W. Bush administration because the economy was much weaker than it is today.

Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, a longtime friend of Trump's who suggested Powell for the Fed's top job, last week released a statement on Trump's behalf saying that the president did not believe he had the ""right"" to fire Powell over disagreements on the management of the Fed.

Many economists and analysts on Wall Street say that an attempt to fire the Fed chief would send markets in a tailspin amid uncertainty over the stability of the U.S. central bank, the most important institution in shaping U.S. and global markets.

When asked Tuesday whether he has confidence in Mnuchin, whose Sunday calls to reassure major bank executives rattled some investors, Trump told reporters: ""Yes, I do. Very talented guy, very smart person.""

'A TRAVESTY'

Today is the fifth day of the partial government shutdown, though it is the first to affect many federal employees after the four-day holiday weekend. About 25 percent of the government has shut down.

All told, about 800,000 of 2.1 million federal workers nationwide -- or nearly a third -- are estimated to be affected in some way. Trump said Tuesday that many of them support the shutdown.

""Many of those workers have said to me, communicated -- stay out until you get the funding for the wall,"" Trump said. ""These federal workers want the wall.""

Trump didn't say how federal workers, excluding those he appointed or who work with him in the White House, had communicated with him about the shutdown.

Tony Reardon, president of the 150,000-member National Treasury Employees Union, disputed Trump's account. In a survey of 1,500 union members before Christmas, about 85 percent said they limited holiday season spending or planned to do so because of uncertainty about income, Reardon said.

""Federal employees should not have to pay the personal price for all of this dysfunction,"" Reardon said. ""This shutdown is a travesty. Congress and the White House have not done their fundamental jobs of keeping the government open.""

Many workers remained at their jobs, including volunteers at Peterson Air Force Base in Colorado, which uses pre-approved funding. The volunteers were working Christmas Eve to support the North American Aerospace Defense Command, which runs the NORAD Tracks Santa program. The program became a Christmas Eve tradition after a child called the forerunner to the agency in 1955 and asked to speak to Santa.

Trump and his wife, first lady Melania Trump, spent part of Monday night joining the volunteers, answering calls from children who wanted to know where Santa was on his gift-giving journey.

The president at one point asked a 7-year-old girl, ""Are you still a believer in Santa?"" Trump listened for a moment before adding, ""Because at 7, it's marginal, right?""

The girl -- Collman Lloyd of Lexington, S.C. -- said later that she had never heard the word ""marginal"" before and simply answered, ""Yes, sir."" Her family had made a video recording of the call because when Collman telephoned NORAD, a volunteer asked her if she would like to speak to the president.

The Trumps later attended religious services at Washington National Cathedral. The president and the first lady usually attend Christmas Eve services at the Episcopal church in Palm Beach where they were married in 2005.

Trump usually spends Christmas at his Florida estate.

""I thought it would be wrong for me to be with my family,"" he told reporters. ""My family is in Florida, Palm Beach, and I just didn't want to go down and be there when other people are hurting.""

Trump didn't say which of his family members were at the Mar-a-Lago estate.

On Tuesday, Trump wished U.S. troops stationed around the country and the globe a merry Christmas.

""I know it's a great sacrifice for you to be away from your families, but I want you to know that every American family is eternally grateful to you, and we're holding you close in our hearts, thoughts and prayers,"" Trump said. ""We love what you do and love your work. Amazing people.""

Children visit the National Christmas Tree on the Ellipse near the White House on Tuesday. Donations to the National Park Service have allowed the National Christmas Tree exhibit to stay open during the partial government shutdown.

A Section on 12/26/2018",121
0,"U.S. President Donald Trump's budget director and chief of staff yesterday said the partial U.S. government shutdown could continue to Jan. 3, when the new Congress convenes and Democrats take over the House of Representatives.

""It's very possible this shutdown will go beyond (December) the 28th and into the new Congress,"" Mick Mulvaney said on Fox News Sunday.

""I don't think things are going to move very quickly here for the next few days"" because of the Christmas holiday, added Mulvaney, who serves as director of the Office of Management and Budget and was named acting White House chief of staff 10 days ago.

The U.S. Senate adjourned on Saturday, unable to break an impasse over Trump's demand for more funds for a wall on the border with Mexico that Democrats are unwilling to accept.

Mulvaney said the White House made a ""counter-offer"" to Democrats on funding for border security that fell between the Democratic offer of $1.3 billion and Trump's demand for $5 billion.

As part of those talks on Saturday, Vice President Mike Pence offered to drop the demand for $5 billion for a border wall, substituting instead $2.1 billion, ABC News reported, citing unnamed sources.

A Democratic source familiar with the negotiations said real discussions have been happening between Democratic lawmakers and Republican Senator Richard Shelby, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, who has been talking to the White House. It was unclear what Democrats had offered.

Mulvaney sought to shift blame for the partial shutdown to Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic nominee for speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, saying she might hold up negotiations to ensure she secures the position.

""I think she's in that unfortunate position of being beholden to her left wing to where she cannot be seen as agreeing with the president on anything until after she is speaker,"" Mulvaney said. ""If that's the case, again, there's a chance we go into the next Congress.""

Pelosi spokesman Drew Hammill disputed that account, saying in a statement: ""As Mr. Mulvaney well knows, House Democrats are united in their opposition to the President's immoral, expensive and ineffective wall."" The White House should ""stop the posturing and start serious bipartisan talks,"" Hammill said.

Financing for about a quarter of federal government programs - including the departments of Homeland Security, Justice and Agriculture - expired at midnight on Friday. More than 400,000 ""essential"" employees in those agencies will work without pay until the dispute is resolved. Another 380,000 will be ""furloughed,"" meaning they are put on temporary leave.

Law enforcement efforts, border patrols, mail delivery and airport operations will keep running. Building a wall to try to prevent migrants from entering the United States illegally was a central plank of Trump's presidential campaign, but Democrats are vehemently opposed and have rejected his funding request.

Trump reiterated his push for border security on Sunday, saying on Twitter that ""the only way"" to stop drugs, gangs, and human trafficking at the border was with a wall or barrier. ""Drones and all of the rest are wonderful and lots of fun, but it is only a good old fashioned Wall that works!,"" the president said in the tweet.

Earlier in the week, leaders in both the Senate and House thought they had reached a deal that Trump would sign that contained less money for border security, only to watch the president, under pressure from conservatives, re-assert his demand for $5 billion at the last minute.

Senator David Perdue, a Republican from Georgia on the Senate Banking Committee, said on Fox News' ""Sunday Morning Futures"" that he thought a deal this week was possible.

""I spoke to the president last night, he wants that,"" Purdue said, adding: ""I'm hopeful that cooler heads will prevail and we'll get to some number between $1.6 (billion) and $5 billion on that.""",122
0,"As the shutdown of the federal government drags on with little prospects for resolution, the Central California Food Bank has begun preparations for a worst-case scenario: the loss of food stamp funding that would send tens of thousands of recipients rushing to its door for immediate help.

CEO Andy Souza said his staff started preparations this week for possible cuts in SNAP - Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program, known as CalFresh in California and more commonly referred to as food stamps.

The food bank serves more than 280,000 residents in Madera, Fresno, Kings, Tulare and Kern counties each month.

""If SNAP stops, people will come to us,"" Souza said. ""We have to brace ourselves and our partner agencies as to what that could look like and mean.""

According to CalFresh, about 544,000 people received SNAP benefits in this five-county area in February 2018.

Souza said a disruption in SNAP could send an influx of people to the food bank in a fashion similar to what would be seen during a natural disaster, in that possibly tens of thousands could need help in a matter of days. This differs from previous emergencies such as the Great Recession and California's recent drought, which each saw a gradual increase in food bank service requests.

Tuesday, the Trump administration said SNAP would get funding through February, at least.

The SNAP problems came to a head in Washington this week, after House Democrats sent a letter on Tuesday to Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue demanding an explanation as to how he would keep SNAP afloat during the shutdown. Current funding was due to dry up by the end of January.

On Tuesday night, the U.S. Department of Agriculture issued a statement saying it would use a stipulation in a recently expired congressional continuing resolution to fund SNAP benefits until the end of February. Children's nutritional programs within SNAP are funded through March.

The statement also criticized the ""inability of Congress to pass an appropriations bill that safely secures our borders.""

President Donald Trump's administration, which includes the USDA, and House Democratic leaders have been at an impasse for weeks over Trump's demand that any appropriations bill include funding for a U.S.-Mexico border wall. The two sides illustrated the stalemate through dueling TV addresses, also held on Tuesday night.

According to the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, SNAP provides an average of $125 per person and $245 per household to about 38 million people and 19 million U.S. households. Families with the greatest need typically receive the most benefits.

The House Committee on Appropriations estimated the Food and Nutrition Service, the USDA agency in charge of SNAP, would have to cut about 40 percent of SNAP benefits at the end of January should the shutdown continue.

It's this forecast that has spurred local organizations like the food bank into action.

Souza described an ""all-hands"" approach in which the food bank will seek aid from the community through donations, as well as its partner organizations in the charity, nonprofit and governmental agency realms.

The food bank also relies on a number of partnerships with local farmers, who themselves face a myriad of problems associated with the shutdown such as a lack of tariff relief and cuts to key USDA programs.

Despite a far-reaching and deserved reputation as the country's agricultural hub, the central San Joaquin Valley contains some of the nation's highest concentrations of food insecurity. More than one in four Tulare County residents receive CalFresh benefits, and Fresno is typically at or near the top in national food insecurity studies of metropolitan areas.

Souza said it was his understanding that all - not the 40 percent cited by the House Appropriations Committee - SNAP benefits would be cut once the funding dried out.

There's no specific plan in place yet, Souza said, as his staff is still gathering data on all of the possibilities. Anyone wishing to help may donate at the food bank's website, ccfoodbank.org, where a $1 donation can fund up to seven meals.",123
0,"WASHINGTON -- President Donald Trump told Democratic congressional leaders that the partial government shutdown may last for years, insisting Friday he won't budge on funding for a longer wall between the United States and Mexico.

At a news conference after the White House meeting, Trump raised the possibility that he'll unilaterally move forward with the project, invoking his emergency powers to bypass the opposition.

""We can do it. I haven't done it. I may do it. I may do it,"" he told reporters during a question-and-answer session. ""We can call a national emergency and build it very quickly. That's another way of doing it. But if we can do it through a negotiated process, we're giving that a shot.""

The president said he felt Friday's meeting was productive, but Democratic congressional leaders described it as contentious and accomplishing little.

Trump, at the news conference, insisted the United States is vulnerable to terrorists, criminals and gang members who are crossing from Mexico into the United States.

""The southern border is a dangerous, horrible disaster,"" Trump said.

""We're talking about national security. We're not playing games,"" he said.

A better wall, built of steel perhaps, would make America safer, he said.

It also would prevent deaths by lowering the number of people who make the dangerous trek north, he said.

""We want to save lives. We want children to be safe. ... We can't let them die on the way up,"" Trump said.

Women are also at risk, he said. ""If they know it's not going to take place because they can't get through because we have a great border wall or fence or barrier, they're not going to come up and you're not going to have the problem.""

Mexico will pay for the wall, at least indirectly, because the North American Free Trade Agreement has been redone, he said.

The new trade deal, which his administration helped craft, will be a boon for the U.S. economy, he added.

Stressing the need for legal immigration, Trump called for overhauling the nation's existing system.

""We need great people, but we want them to come in on a merit basis,"" he said. ""They can't come in the way they've been coming in for years.""

Trump's call for immigration changes echoed what he had said in 2017 after Arkansas' U.S. Sen. Tom Cotton introduced legislation to replace the existing system with a merit-based approach similar to those used in Australia and Canada. Cotton is a Republican from Dardanelle.

At the time, Trump called Cotton's proposal ""the most significant reform to our immigration system in half a century.""

Cotton plans to introduce similar legislation in the 116th Congress.

Trump said there was discussion during the meeting of marrying wall funding and protecting from deportation young people brought to the U.S. illegally as children who were previously covered by President Barack Obama's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which Trump has moved to rescind.

The New York Times reported that House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy sounded open to the idea as he left for the White House. ""We can find common ground,"" McCarthy said. ""DACA is a problem, border security is a problem and anything that can make sure that we can get everything together and move forward, I'm willing to discuss.""

A compromise linking the younger immigrants to the wall has been floated by Sens. Lindsey Graham, R-S.C., and Lamar Alexander, R-Tenn.

Trump also used the news conference to highlight the nation's strong economy.

Take-home pay is rising, he said. Job numbers are rising. Gas prices have fallen. Unemployment is low. So is inflation. The stock market, despite recent losses, is still up 30 percent since his election, Trump said.

The president also spoke optimistically about Friday's government shutdown meeting.

Flanked by Vice President Mike Pence, House Republican leaders and Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen, he described Friday's shutdown-related meeting as ""very, very productive,"" adding, ""I think we've come a long way.""

""We're all on the same path in terms of wanting to get government open,"" he said.

Pence said the dialogue had been ""candid and constructive.""

WEEKEND MEETING

Congressional leadership staff members and White House representatives will meet this morning in the Eisenhower Executive Office Building ""to work towards ... an agreement that secures the border and opens the government,"" a presidential spokesman said Friday evening.

Speaking to reporters after exiting the West Wing, Senate Minority Leader Charles Schumer, D-N.Y., said Democrats want to resume funding while the negotiations continue.

""We made a plea to the president once again. Don't hold millions of Americans, hundreds of thousands of workers hostage,"" Schumer said.

""We told the president we needed the government open. He resisted. In fact, he said he'd keep the government closed for a very long period of time. Months, or even years,"" Schumer said.

The Democratic leader indicated very little had been accomplished, but expressed a willingness to meet again.

""We'll continue discussing [this], of course, but it's very hard to see how progress will be made unless they open up the government.""

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., portrayed the meeting as ""lengthy and sometimes contentious.""

""We agreed that we will continue our conversations,"" she said.

Allowing the shutdown to continue would be counterproductive, she said.

""We recognize on the Democratic side that we really cannot resolve this until we open up government and we made that very clear to the president. Services are being withheld from the American people, paychecks are being withheld from people who serve the needs of the American people, and our border security will suffer if we do not resolve this issue,"" she said.

""We are committed to keeping our border safe. That has always been our principal to honor the oath of office that we take to protect and defend our country and our Constitution,"" she said. ""We can do that best when government is open. We've made that clear to the president.""

Meanwhile, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ky., has largely stayed on the sidelines, leaving it to Pelosi and Schumer to resolve the wall dispute with Trump.

McConnell and his top deputy, Senate Majority Whip John Thune, R-S.D., were not present when Trump and other Republican lawmakers appeared outside the White House after Friday's meeting. Aides to McConnell insisted they were not aware of the news conference, The Washington Post reported.

The shutdown, which enters its third week today, has left about 800,000 workers without pay, limited the functions of federal agencies and slowed the court system. There are also concerns that if the shutdown continues for several more weeks, it will harm the overall economy.

Most Republicans in Congress have backed the president, though there were signs of a fraying alliance as two vulnerable senators from Democratic-leaning states, Cory Gardner of Colorado and Susan Collins of Maine, expressed misgivings over their leaders' intransigence. Gardner called on his party to end the shutdown, even if it meant not funding the wall, and Collins said she would support measures to fund the government in already approved appropriations bills.

MORE TROOPS SOUGHT

Separately, the Department of Homeland Security has asked the military to provide more help securing the U.S.-Mexico border, two defense officials told The Associated Press on Friday.

The acting secretary of defense, Patrick Shanahan, has not decided how to respond to the Homeland Security request, but in the past the Pentagon has provided help when asked. At one point last fall there were nearly 5,900 active-duty troops along the border in Texas, Arizona and California to assist border patrol agents and to erect wire barriers. That number now is about 2,350.

The defense officials said the agency asked for certain military capabilities, not any number of troops. It will be up to Shanahan to decide whether more active-duty troops are dispatched. The officials spoke on condition of anonymity because the request for assistance has not yet been fully processed.

One of the officials said the Homeland Security Department wants the military to put up concertina wire as barriers along 160 miles of border. That would be in addition to 70 miles of concertina wire that combat engineers put up in the fall. If the new work is taken on by the military, it might require an extension of the current deployment beyond its scheduled Jan. 31 end. The official said the department did not specifically ask for an extension, but it has not been ruled out.

The troops have been erecting and reinforcing border barriers but are not performing law enforcement tasks or engaging with migrants. Some also have been providing transportation and logistical help as well as medical assistance to troops and to Customs and Border Protection personnel along the border.

Many in Congress, including leading Democrats, have criticized the troop deployments as a waste of money and a misuse of military resources.

A Section on 01/05/2019",124
0,"WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump said Tuesday that he intends to keep the federal government closed until he secures the desired funding from Congress for his promised border wall, and he cast doubt about the performance of Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome H. Powell after a sharp downturn in U.S. stock markets.

In an Oval Office appearance on Christmas morning, Trump praised Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin despite the stock markets suffering their steepest Christmas Eve decline in decades but was more circumspect about his handpicked Fed chair.

""Well, we'll see,"" Trump said when a journalist asked whether he had confidence in Powell. ""They're raising interest rates too fast, that's my opinion. But I certainly have confidence. But I think it'll straighten. They're raising interest rates too fast because they think the economy is so good. But I think that they will get it pretty soon, I really do.""

As for whether he has confidence in Mnuchin, whose Sunday calls to reassure major bank executives rattled investors and may have exacerbated Monday's sell-off, Trump told reporters, ""Yes, I do. Very talented guy, very smart person.""

Trump made his comments during a Christmas photo op in the Oval Office, where he spoke by video teleconference with service members from all five branches of the armed forces who are stationed in Alaska, Bahrain, Guam and Qatar.

""I can't tell you when the government is going to reopen,"" he said. ""I can tell you it's not going to be open until we have a wall, a fence, whatever they'd like to call it. I'll call it whatever they want. But it's all the same thing. It's a barrier from people pouring into our country.""

The president defended his plan to construct a wall along the border with Mexico that he insisted only an Olympic athlete would be able to scale. ""If you don't have that, then we're just not opening,"" Trump said.

All told, about 800,000 of 2.1 million federal workers nationwide - or more than a third - are estimated to be affected in some way by the shutdown. Trump claimed that many of them support the shutdown.

""Many of those workers have said to me, communicated - stay out until you get the funding for the wall,"" Trump said. ""These federal workers want the wall.""

But his claim conflicts with the accounts of federal workers' union leaders.

""Federal employees should not have to pay the personal price for all of this dysfunction,"" said Tony Reardon, president of the National Treasury Employees Union, which represents 150,000 members at 33 federal agencies and departments. ""This shutdown is a travesty. Congress and the White House have not done their fundamental jobs of keeping the government open.""

In a survey of 1,500 union members, about 85 percent said they have limited holiday season spending or are planning to do so because of uncertainty about income, Reardon said on Christmas Eve. He said they include one who said ""I have recently lost my wife and now . . .. I have to put off buying her headstone. Breaks my heart.""

Another responded, ""I can't buy any Christmas presents and am considering returning those I already have. Mortgage companies and utility companies won't wait to get paid,"" according to Reardon.

The government shutdown comes near the end of what will probably be the worst year for the U.S. stock market since the financial crisis a decade ago. Many sectors are now technically in a ""bear market,"" down more than 20 percent.

Before the recent reversal in the stock market, which began during the fall, Trump had frequently boasted that stocks were soaring during his tenure, claiming credit for the upswing.

The downturn has caused great uncertainty in the White House as Trump has sought someone to blame, and he has lashed out publicly at Powell. On Saturday, several news outlets reported that Trump was looking for ways to potentially fire Powell. That spurred Mnuchin to release a statement on Trump's behalf that the president did not believe he had the ""right"" to fire Powell.

Many economists and analysts on Wall Street say that an attempt to fire the Fed chief would send markets in a tailspin amid uncertainty over the stability of the U.S. central bank, the most important institution in shaping U.S. and global markets.

Trump is angry that Powell is continuing the Fed's long-telegraphed plan to raise its benchmark interest rate and scale back other extraordinary measures intended to support the economy. The Fed's benchmark rate is now 2.25 to 2.5 percent, higher than the near-zero interest rate the Fed had pursued for years but still historically low.

Trump complains that his predecessor Barack Obama benefited from lower interest rates, spurring economic growth. Others point out that the Fed, which operates independently of the White House, had pursued a low-interest-rate policy because the economy was much weaker than it is today.

""They are raising interest rates too fast, that's my opinion,"" Trump said Tuesday. ""President Obama didn't do much of that . . . He had a very low interest rate.""

Powell was Mnuchin's recommendation when Trump was seeking a new Fed chair a year ago, and some close to Trump have questioned whether the president will begin to blame the treasury secretary, too, for the sell-off. But on Tuesday he praised Mnuchin, a longtime friend and finance chairman of his 2016 campaign.

Again on Tuesday, Trump tried to place blame for Washington's budget stalemate solely on Democrats, portraying their leaders as disingenuous and claiming that they support the notion of a physical barrier along the border and object to building the wall only because it is Trump's idea.

Trump likened the situation to his May 2017 firing of James Comey as FBI director, saying ""Democrats hated him"" until he was fired and then Comey was treated as a hero.

Even as he vowed to keep the government closed to secure wall funding, Trump claimed that much of his envisioned wall was already being built. He said he had awarded a contract ""at a great price"" for a 115-mile section of wall in Texas and plans to visit the site in January for ""a ground-breaking"" ceremony.

Administration officials have provided no details about this construction project or the terms of the contract.

Trump said he hopes to have all portions of the wall completed - either old fencing renovated or new construction - by Election Day 2020, an indication that he sees building the wall chiefly as a political issue tied to his reelection chances.

Trump said Tuesday that the wall as he envisions it would be a fortress that no normal human could breach.

""Now there may be the case of an Olympic champion who can get over the wall, but for the most part you are not able to do it,"" he said. ""Very high. It's gonna be 30 feet. Much of it is 30 feet high. Some if it's low. But in some areas we have it as high as 30 feet. That's like a three-story building.""

Trump said of the government shutdown, ""It's a disgrace what's happening in our country. But other than that, I wish everybody a very Merry Christmas.""",125

US President Donald Trump says government shutdown will continue unless he secures the desired funding for building a border wall with Mexico.

Speaking after a Christmas Day video message on Tuesday, Trump insisted that the partial shutdown of the federal government would last until his demand for funds to build a wall on the US-Mexico border was met.

""I can't tell you when the government is going to be open,"" he said. ""I can tell you, it's not going to be open until we have a wall, a fence, whatever they'd like to call it. I'll call it whatever they want ... If you don't have that [wall], then we're just not opening.""

Trump expressed hope that the wall would be completed by the next presidential election in 2020, also announcing plans to go to the border in January to visit a new stretch of wall.

""It's my hope to have this done, completed -- all 500 to 550 miles -- to have it either renovated or brand new by election time, It's going to be built, hopefully rapidly,"" he said. ""I'm going there at the end of January for the start of construction. That's a big stretch.""

Trump also claimed, without providing evidence, that federal employees on furlough or working without pay understand his demand for a border wall and support him in his mission.

""I think they understand what's happening,"" he said. ""They want border security. The people of this country want border security.""

The remarks were made as the shutdown over budget spending is in its fourth day after Democratic lawmakers resisted Trump's demand for a five billion-dollar border wall funding. Nine of the 15 federal departments, including State, Homeland Security, Transportation, Agriculture and Justice are partially closed.

The shutdown has exacerbated the year-end chaos in Washington as well as the downfall of stock markets, amid the ouster of Defense Secretary James Mattis and troop withdrawals from Syria and Afghanistan and the Russia investigation.

A day earlier, top Democrats had blasted the US president for ""plunging the country into chaos"" after shutting down parts of the government during Christmas time.

""It's Christmas Eve and President Trump is plunging the country into chaos,"" the two top Democrats in Congress, the House speaker nominee, Nancy Pelosi, and Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, wrote in a joint statement on Monday.

""The stock market is tanking and the president is waging a personal war on the Federal Reserve - after he just fired the Secretary of Defense,"" they noted.

Schumer on Saturday said Trump ""must abandon the wall, plain and simple"" for the government to reopen.

Hundreds of thousands of federal employees are working unpaid or have gone on temporary leave during the partial shutdown. A deal to end the funding dispute appears to be a distant prospect as Congress adjourned on the weekend for Christmas.

Building the wall was one of Trump's most frequently repeated campaign promises, but Democrats are vehemently opposed to it.

The Republican president has vowed to crack down on immigration, in part by building a wall on the border with Mexico, but has failed to get his complete agenda through so far.",126
0,"As a partial government shutdown hit the two-week mark, President Donald Trump and congressional leaders were scheduled on Friday to discuss ways to break an impasse pitting his demand for building a border wall against Democrats' call for alternative security measures.

About 800,000 federal workers have been affected by the Dec. 22 closure of about one-quarter of the federal government as Trump withheld his support for new funding until he secures $5 billion to start building the wall along the U.S.-Mexico border that he promised during his campaign.

Such a wall, he has argued, is needed to stem the flow of illegal immigrants and drugs over the southwestern border. When he ran for president in 2016, he vowed Mexico would pay for the wall, which it has refused to do.

On Thursday, Trump tried to keep the pressure on Democrats, even as they gained significant new power with their takeover of the House of Representatives at the start of a new Congress.

""Build the Wall,"" the president demanded on Twitter. In remarks to reporters that same day, Trump said: ""You can call it a barrier. You can call it whatever you want. But essentially, we need protection in our country.""

As Trump dug in, so did opposition Democrats, leaving many to wonder just how much progress might be made during Friday's White House meeting scheduled for 11:30 a.m.

""We're not doing a wall,"" Democrat Nancy Pelosi said late on Thursday, several hours after she was sworn in as the new speaker of the House of Representatives.

""It has nothing to do with politics. It has to do with a wall [that] is an immorality between countries. It's an old way of thinking. It isn't cost effective,"" Pelosi added.

Late on Thursday, the House passed two Democratic bills to immediately reopen government agencies for varying lengths of time, despite a White House veto threat. Earlier in the day, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican, labeled the House effort ""political theater, not productive lawmaking,"" even though the Senate last month approved identical legislation.

Democratic Representative Lucille Roybal-Allard, speaking to reporters late on Thursday, argued that funding a border wall, which ultimately could cost more than $24 billion, would hamper other, more important national security protections.

She noted that more federal law enforcement agents were needed to intercept illegal opioids and other ""contraband"" moving through U.S. ports of entry. She added more money was needed for the Coast Guard to beef up the U.S. presence in the Arctic at a time when Russia and China increasingly were on the prowl for that region's natural resources.

Without a deal to end the partial government shutdown, the Department of Homeland Security will not be able to bring some furloughed workers back to their jobs, while others continue to be forced to work without paychecks for the time being.

An array of other federal agencies are similarly hobbled, including the Justice Department, Commerce Department and departments of Agriculture, Labor, Interior and Treasury.

Visitors to Smithsonian museums, among Washington's most popular tourist attractions, were being turned away during the shutdown, as were visitors to many of the nation's federal parks.",127
0,"The White House meeting between President Donald Trump and top Congressional leaders on resolving the ongoing partial government shutdown ended in a stalemate Wednesday, with Republicans and Democrats sticking to their respective positions over the presidential demand for a US-Mexico border wall.

The President is seeking USD 5.2 billion in funding for the wall which according to him is a must to prevent flow of illegal immigrants into the US.

The Democrats assert that such a move is a ""waste"" of taxpayers' money.

Following their inconclusive Situation Room meeting, Congressional leaders and Trump agreed to meet again on Friday.

Newly elected members of the Congress are scheduled to be sworn in Thursday; the first day of the 116 Congress. Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi is all set to be elected as the Speaker of the US House of Representatives.

""Important meeting today on Border Security with Republican and Democrat Leaders in Congress. Both parties must work together to pass a Funding Bill that protects this Nation and its people - this is the first and most important duty of government,"" Trump said in a tweet after the meeting.

""I remain ready and willing to work with Democrats to pass a bill that secures our borders, supports the agents and officers on the ground, and keeps America Safe. Let's get it done!"" said the US President.

Pelosi told reporters at the White House after the meeting that she plans to go ahead with the Democratic legislation on a spending bill without funding for a border wall. Beginning Thursday, Democrats would enjoy majority in the House of Representatives.

""We are asking the president to open up the government. We are giving him a Republican path to do that. Why would he not do it?"" Pelosi told reporters at the White House.

""Democrats have been committed to protecting our borders. It's the oath of office we take to protect and defend. It has been very important to us, and we have committed resources to it when we were in the majority, and will continue to do so,"" she said.

Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said the Democrats asked the President to support the bills that they support that will open up government.

""We asked him to give us one good reason -- I asked him directly. I said, Mr President, give me one good reason why you should continue your shutdown of these -- of the eight cabinet departments while we are debating our differences on Homeland Security? He could not give a good answer,"" he said.

""So, we would hope that they would reconsider and would support the very bills that passed the Senate, four of them 92 to 6, two of them unanimously, in the Appropriations Committee with Mitch McConnell's support,"" he said.

""The only reason that they are shutting down the government is very simple. They want to try and leverage that shutdown into their proposals on border security. We want strong border security. We believe ours our better. But to use the shutdown as hostage, which they had no argument against, is wrong,"" Schumer said.",128
0,"martince2/iStock(WASHINGTON) -- Amid a government shutdown and major winter storms hitting large swaths of the U.S., the number of TSA officers who didn't come to work on Sunday more than doubled compared to that number a year ago.

On Sunday, TSA spokesperson Michael Bilello said 7.7 percent of the agency's employees had an unscheduled absence today, compared with 5.6 percent on Saturday and 3.2 percent a year ago.

A stalemate between President Donald Trump and congressional Democrats over funding for Trump's campaign promise of a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border has created the longest federal government shutdown in history, and forced over 800,000 government employees to go without paychecks.

According to Bilello, 99.9 percent of airline passengers across the U.S. waited less than 30 minutes at their checkpoints.

Official wait time data for Sunday wasn't immediately available.

More than 51,000 airport security screeners are required to work through the government shutdown --despite the agency's inability to provide them their regular pay -- until it secures congressional funding from lawmakers in Washington.

In addition to missing a regular payday, thousands of TSA employees are dealing with winter weather stretching from the Midwest to the East Coast.

Parts of Missouri, Iowa and Illinois received more than a foot of snow by Sunday morning. With at least 10 inches of snow in St. Louis so far, this is the biggest snow storm the city has seen in 5 years.

Five inches of snow in New Jersey and ice-covered roads as far south as North Carolina made for dangerous driving conditions in other parts of the country.

In an apparent effort to raise the spirits of those tasked with keep the country's airports safe, TSA Administrator David Pekoske announced on Friday that his uniformed screening officers would soon receive a one-time bonus of $500 ""in recognition of their hard work during yet another busy holiday travel season, maintaining the highest of security standards during an extraordinary period.""

That extraordinary period has seen an increasing number of airport screeners calling out of work, even before the government shutdown postponed paychecks for the first time on Friday, sparking fears of long lines and staffing shortages as the shutdown continues.

The National Air Traffic Controllers Association is currently suing the Trump administration on behalf of the thousands of controllers that have not been paid during the record-breaking shutdown.

The suit, filed in federal court in Washington, D.C., claims the administration has violated the Fifth Amendment by depriving workers of wages without due process and violated fair labor regulations by not at least paying minimum wage to air traffic controllers and others who are required to work during the government shutdown. The suit also claims the FAA didn't promptly pay overtime to union members, an oversight the union said is also in violation of regulations.

While the shutdown drags on, maintenance, inspection, training and modernization programs have also been deferred.

""While we are doing the day-to-day tasks there's a lot of things that are falling through the cracks,"" Portland International Airport tower controller Richard Kennington told ABC News. ""There's a lot of insidious stuff that the flying public doesn't see that's not happening.""",129
0,"President Trump pledges to keep up fight for signature campaign promise

WASHINGTON - On their first day in the majority, House Democrats have passed a plan to reopen the government without funding US President Donald Trump's promised border wall.

The largely party-line votes on Thursday night came after Trump made a surprise appearance at the White House briefing room, pledging to keep up the fight for his signature campaign promise.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Trump and Senate Republicans should ""take yes for an answer"" and approve the border bill, which was virtually identical to a plan the Senate adopted on a voice vote last month.

""We're not doing a wall. Does anyone have any doubt that we're not doing a wall?"" Pelosi told reporters at a news conference on Thursday night.

Pelosi, who was elected speaker earlier on Thursday, also took a shot a Trump, calling his proposal ""a wall between reality and his constituents"".

She also invited Trump to deliver his annual update to Congress on Jan 29.

Trump strode into the White House briefing room on Thursday, the 13th day of the partial government shutdown, and declared that ""without a wall you cannot have border security"". He then left without taking questions from reporters.

The appearance came hours after the new Congress convened, with Democrats taking majority control of the House and returning Pelosi to the speakership after eight years of GOP control. The Democratic legislation to reopen the government without funding the wall is going nowhere in the Senate, where Republicans want Trump's endorsement before voting on a funding package.

About 800,000 federal workers have been affected by the Dec 22 closure of about one-quarter of the federal government as Trump withheld his support for new funding until he secures $5 billion to start building the wall along the US-Mexico border that he promised during his campaign.

Such a wall, he has argued, is needed to stem the flow of illegal immigrants and drugs over the southwestern border. When he ran for president in 2016, he vowed Mexico would pay for the wall, which it has refused to do.

Asked if she would give Trump $1 for a wall to reopen the government, Pelosi said: ""One dollar? Yeah, one dollar. The fact is a wall is an immorality. It's not who we are as a nation.""

Polls show a majority of US citizens oppose the border wall.

Late on Thursday, the House passed two Democratic bills to immediately reopen government agencies for varying lengths of time, despite a White House veto threat. Earlier in the day, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican, labeled the House effort ""political theater, not productive lawmaking"", even though the Senate last month approved identical legislation.

The Democratic package includes a bill to temporarily fund the Department of Homeland Security at current levels with $1.3 billion for border security, far less than Trump has said he wants through Feb 8 as bipartisan talks would continue. It was approved, 239-192.

Democrats also approved a separate measure to fund the departments of Agriculture, Interior, Housing and Urban Development and others closed by the partial shutdown, at levels Senate Republicans had largely agreed to last year. The bill, which would provide money through the end of the fiscal year Sept 30, was approved, 241-190, with several House Republicans joining Democrats.

The White House has rejected the Democratic package.

""Why not fully fund the Department of Homeland Security? Why doesn't the Pelosi bill do that?"" said White House Counselor Kellyanne Conway.

Vice-President Mike Pence, who was on the Hill on Thursday to swear in new senators, took a hard line, telling Fox News Channel's Tucker Carlson, ""Bottom line, if there's no wall, there's no deal.""

""It's very possible this shutdown will go beyond the 28th and into the new congress,"" Mick Mulvaney said on Fox News Sunday.

""I don't think things are going to move very quickly here for the next few days"" because of the Christmas holiday, added Mulvaney, who serves as director of the Office of Management and Budget and was named acting White House chief of staff 10 days ago.

The US Senate adjourned on Saturday unable to break an impasse over Trump's demand for more funds for a wall on the border with Mexico that Democrats are unwilling to accept.

Mulvaney said the White House made a ""counteroffer"" to Democrats on funding for border security that falls between the Democratic offer of $US1.3 billion ($A1.8 billion) and Trump's demand for $US5 billion.

As part of those talks on Saturday, Vice President Mike Pence offered to drop the demand for $US5 billion for a border wall, substituting instead $US2.1 billion, ABC News reported citing unnamed sources.

Mulvaney sought to shift blame for the partial shutdown to Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic nominee for speaker of the US House of Representatives, saying she might hold up negotiations to ensure she secures the position.

""I think she's in that unfortunate position of being beholden to her left wing to where she cannot be seen as agreeing with the president on anything until after she is Speaker,"" Mulvaney said.

""If that's the case, again, there's a chance we go into the next congress.""

Financing for about a quarter of federal government programs - including the departments of Homeland Security, Justice and Agriculture - expired at midnight on Friday and will not be renewed until a deal is done.

RELATED: US paper brutally mocks Trump over government shutdown

Building a wall to keep migrants from entering the US illegally was a central plank of Trump's presidential campaign, but Democrats are vehemently opposed and have rejected his funding request.

Trump reiterated his push for border security on Sunday, saying on Twitter that ""the only way"" to stop drugs, gangs, and human trafficking at the border was with a wall or barrier.

""Drones and all of the rest are wonderful and lots of fun, but it is only a good old fashioned Wall that works!,"" the president said in the tweet.

Earlier in the week, leaders in both the Senate and House of Representatives thought they had reached a deal that Trump would sign that contained less money for border security, only to watch the president, under pressure from conservatives, reassert his demand for $US5 billion at the last minute.

Senator David Perdue, a Republican from Georgia on the Senate Banking Committee, said on Fox News' Sunday Morning Futures that he thought a deal this week was possible.

""I can't tell you when the government is going to reopen,"" he said. ""I can tell you it's not going to be open until we have a wall, a fence, whatever they'd like to call it. I'll call it whatever they want. But it's all the same thing. It's a barrier from people pouring into our country.""

The president defended his plan to construct a wall along the border with Mexico that he insisted only an Olympic athlete would be able to scale. ""If you don't have that, then we're just not opening,"" Trump said.

All told, about 800,000 of 2.1 million federal workers nationwide - or more than a third - are estimated to be affected in some way by the shutdown. Trump claimed that many of them support the shutdown.

""Many of those workers have said to me, communicated - stay out until you get the funding for the wall,"" Trump said. ""These federal workers want the wall.""

But his claim conflicts with the accounts of federal workers' union leaders.

""Federal employees should not have to pay the personal price for all of this dysfunction,"" said Tony Reardon, president of the National Treasury Employees Union, which represents 150,000 members at 33 federal agencies and departments. ""This shutdown is a travesty. Congress and the White House have not done their fundamental jobs of keeping the government open.""

In a survey of 1,500 union members, about 85 percent said they have limited holiday season spending or are planning to do so because of uncertainty about income, Reardon said on Christmas Eve. He said they include one who said ""I have recently lost my wife and now . . .. I have to put off buying her headstone. Breaks my heart.""

Another responded, ""I can't buy any Christmas presents and am considering returning those I already have. Mortgage companies and utility companies won't wait to get paid,"" according to Reardon.

The government shutdown comes near the end of what will probably be the worst year for the U.S. stock market since the financial crisis a decade ago. Many sectors are now technically in a ""bear market,"" down more than 20 percent.

Before the recent reversal in the stock market, which began during the fall, Trump had frequently boasted that stocks were soaring during his tenure, claiming credit for the upswing.

The downturn has caused great uncertainty in the White House as Trump has sought someone to blame, and he has lashed out publicly at Powell. On Saturday, several news outlets reported that Trump was looking for ways to potentially fire Powell. That spurred Mnuchin to release a statement on Trump's behalf that the president did not believe he had the ""right"" to fire Powell.

Many economists and analysts on Wall Street say that an attempt to fire the Fed chief would send markets in a tailspin amid uncertainty over the stability of the U.S. central bank, the most important institution in shaping U.S. and global markets.

Trump is angry that Powell is continuing the Fed's long-telegraphed plan to raise its benchmark interest rate and scale back other extraordinary measures intended to support the economy. The Fed's benchmark rate is now 2.25 to 2.5 percent, higher than the near-zero interest rate the Fed had pursued for years but still historically low.

Trump complains that his predecessor Barack Obama benefited from lower interest rates, spurring economic growth. Others point out that the Fed, which operates independently of the White House, had pursued a low-interest-rate policy because the economy was much weaker than it is today.

""They are raising interest rates too fast, that's my opinion,"" Trump said Tuesday. ""President Obama didn't do much of that . . . He had a very low interest rate.""

Powell was Mnuchin's recommendation when Trump was seeking a new Fed chair a year ago, and some close to Trump have questioned whether the president will begin to blame the treasury secretary, too, for the sell-off. But on Tuesday he praised Mnuchin, a longtime friend and finance chairman of his 2016 campaign.

Again on Tuesday, Trump tried to place blame for Washington's budget stalemate solely on Democrats, portraying their leaders as disingenuous and claiming that they support the notion of a physical barrier along the border and object to building the wall only because it is Trump's idea.

Trump likened the situation to his May 2017 firing of James Comey as FBI director, saying ""Democrats hated him"" until he was fired and then Comey was treated as a hero.

Even as he vowed to keep the government closed to secure wall funding, Trump claimed that much of his envisioned wall was already being built. He said he had awarded a contract ""at a great price"" for a 115-mile section of wall in Texas and plans to visit the site in January for ""a ground-breaking"" ceremony.

Administration officials have provided no details about this construction project or the terms of the contract.

Trump said he hopes to have all portions of the wall completed - either old fencing renovated or new construction - by Election Day 2020, an indication that he sees building the wall chiefly as a political issue tied to his reelection chances.

Trump said Tuesday that the wall as he envisions it would be a fortress that no normal human could breach.

""Now there may be the case of an Olympic champion who can get over the wall, but for the most part you are not able to do it,"" he said. ""Very high. It's gonna be 30 feet. Much of it is 30 feet high. Some if it's low. But in some areas we have it as high as 30 feet. That's like a three-story building.""

Trump said of the government shutdown, ""It's a disgrace what's happening in our country. But other than that, I wish everybody a very Merry Christmas.""",132
0,"TEHRAN (Tasnim) - US President Donald Trump said on Thursday that he was willing to cooperate with the Democratic Party on a Funding Bill that would be beneficial for the country.

""Important meeting today on Border Security with Republican and Democrat Leaders in Congress.

I remain ready and willing to work with Democrats to pass a bill that secures our borders, supports the agents and officers on the ground, and keeps America Safe,"" Trump posted on Twitter, Sputnik reported.

On Wednesday, Trump held a meeting with Republican and Democratic leaders amid a partial shutdown of the federal government to discuss the security situation at the US-Mexican border. He reiterated that the shutdown could continue for long if it was necessary, repeating his call on the Democrats to support the construction of a wall on the border and putting blame for the shutdown on them.

The shutdown triggered by disputes over wall funding has been continuing since December 22, 2018. While Trump is demanding to allocate more than $5 billion for the construction of the wall, Democratic lawmakers along with some Republicans have refused to meet the demand, and many have noted that the president had previously promised that Mexico would pay for the wall.

The US president has already rejected a deal from the Democrats that included some $1.6 billion for border security.",133
0,"WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump said Tuesday that he intends to keep the federal government closed until he secures the desired funding from Congress for his promised border wall, and he cast doubt about the performance of Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome H. Powell after a sharp downturn in U.S. stock markets.

In an Oval Office appearance on Christmas morning, Trump praised Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin despite the stock markets suffering their steepest Christmas Eve decline in decades but was more circumspect about his handpicked Fed chair.

""Well, we'll see,"" Trump said when a journalist asked whether he had confidence in Powell. ""They're raising interest rates too fast, that's my opinion. But I certainly have confidence. But I think it'll straighten. They're raising interest rates too fast because they think the economy is so good. But I think that they will get it pretty soon, I really do.""

0,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - As a partial U.S. government shutdown hit the two-week mark, President Donald Trump and congressional leaders were scheduled on Friday to discuss ways to break an impasse pitting his demand for building a border wall against Democrats' call for alternative security measures.

About 800,000 federal workers have been affected by the Dec. 22 closure of about one-quarter of the federal government as Trump withheld his support for new funding until he secures $5 billion to start building the wall along the U.S.-Mexico border that he promised during his campaign.

Such a wall, he has argued, is needed to stem the flow of illegal immigrants and drugs over the southwestern border. When he ran for president in 2016, he vowed Mexico would pay for the wall, which it has refused to do.

On Thursday, Trump tried to keep the pressure on Democrats, even as they gained significant new power with their takeover of the House of Representatives at the start of a new Congress.

""Build the Wall,"" the Republican president demanded on Twitter. In remarks to reporters that same day, Trump said: ""You can call it a barrier. You can call it whatever you want. But essentially, we need protection in our country.""

As Trump dug in, so did opposition Democrats, leaving many to wonder just how much progress might be made during Friday's White House meeting scheduled for 11:30 a.m. (1630 GMT).

""We're not doing a wall,"" Democrat Nancy Pelosi said late on Thursday, several hours after she was sworn in as the new speaker of the House of Representatives.

""It has nothing to do with politics. It has to do with a wall is an immorality between countries. It's an old way of thinking. It isn't cost effective,"" Pelosi added.

Late on Thursday, the House passed two Democratic bills to immediately reopen government agencies for varying lengths of time, despite a White House veto threat. Earlier in the day, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican, labeled the House effort ""political theater, not productive lawmaking,"" even though the Senate last month approved identical legislation.

AGENCIES HOBBLED

Democratic Representative Lucille Roybal-Allard, speaking to reporters late on Thursday, argued that funding a border wall, which ultimately could cost more than $24 billion, would hamper other, more important national security protections.

She noted that more federal law enforcement agents were needed to intercept illegal opioids and other ""contraband"" moving through U.S. ports of entry. She added more money was needed for the Coast Guard to beef up the U.S. presence in the Arctic at a time when Russia and China increasingly were on the prowl for that region's natural resources.

Without a deal to end the partial government shutdown, the Department of Homeland Security will not be able to bring some furloughed workers back to their jobs while others continue to be forced to work without paychecks for the time being.

An array of other federal agencies are similarly hobbled, including the Justice Department, Commerce Department and departments of Agriculture, Labor, Interior and Treasury.

Visitors to Smithsonian museums, among Washington's most popular tourist attractions, were being turned away during the shutdown, as were visitors to many of the nation's federal parks.",135
0,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump's budget director and chief of staff on Sunday said the partial U.S. government shutdown could continue to January 3, when the new Congress convenes and Democrats take over the House of Representatives.

""It's very possible this shutdown will go beyond the 28th and into the new Congress,"" Mick Mulvaney said on Fox News Sunday.

""I don't think things are going to move very quickly here for the next few days"" because of the Christmas holiday, added Mulvaney, who serves as director of the Office of Management and Budget and was named acting White House chief of staff 10 days ago.

The U.S. Senate adjourned on Saturday unable to break an impasse over Trump's demand for more funds for a wall on the border with Mexico that Democrats are unwilling to accept.

Mulvaney said the White House made a ""counteroffer"" to Democrats on funding for border security that falls between the Democratic offer of $1.3 billion and Trump's demand for $5 billion.

As part of those talks on Saturday, Vice President Mike Pence offered to drop the demand for $5 billion for a border wall, substituting instead $2.1 billion, ABC News reported citing unnamed sources.

Mulvaney sought to shift blame for the partial shutdown to Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic nominee for speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, saying she might hold up negotiations to ensure she secures the position.

""I think she's in that unfortunate position of being beholden to her left wing to where she cannot be seen as agreeing with the president on anything until after she is speaker,"" Mulvaney said. ""If that's the case, again, there's a chance we go into the next Congress.""

Financing for about a quarter of federal government programs - including the departments of Homeland Security, Justice and Agriculture - expired at midnight on Friday and will not be renewed until a deal is done.

Federal parks were to close and more than 400,000 federal ""essential"" employees in those agencies will work without pay until the dispute is resolved. Another 380,000 will be ""furloughed"", meaning they are put on temporary leave.

Law enforcement efforts, border patrols, mail delivery and airport operations will keep running.

Building a wall to keep migrants from entering the United States illegally was a central plank of Trump's presidential campaign, but Democrats are vehemently opposed and have rejected his funding request.

Trump reiterated his push for border security on Sunday, saying on Twitter that ""the only way"" to stop drugs, gangs, and human trafficking at the border was with a wall or barrier.

""Drones and all of the rest are wonderful and lots of fun, but it is only a good old fashioned Wall that works!,"" the president said in the tweet.

Earlier in the week, leaders in both the Senate and House of Representatives thought they had reached a deal that Trump would sign that contained less money for border security, only to watch the president, under pressure from conservatives, re-assert his demand for $5 billion at the last minute.

Senator David Perdue, a Republican from Georgia on the Senate Banking Committee, said on Fox News' ""Sunday Morning Futures"" that he thought a deal this week was possible.

""I spoke to the President last night, he wants that,"" Purdue said, adding ""I'm hopeful that cooler heads will prevail and we'll get to some number between $1.6 (billion) and $5 billion on that.""",136

0,"House Speaker Nancy Pelosi accused President Donald Trump of staging the Situation Room meeting Wednesday so he could walk out, calling the move ""unpresidential.""

""Not only was the President unpresidential -- surprise, surprise -- yesterday in his behavior, I think the meeting was a setup, so he could walk out, but I'll say just that,"" Pelosi told reporters in her weekly briefing.

""I don't even know that the President wants the wall, I think he just wants to debate on the wall,"" she added.

Trump and Democrats remain stalemated over funding for Trump's southern border wall, as the government shutdown enters its 20th day. House Democrats, meanwhile, will continue to vote on spending bills next week to reopen shuttered parts of government -- but Trump has refused to sign them unless he his $5.7 billion wall request is fulfilled.

Asked by CNN's Manu Raju how the House would respond if Trump declared a national emergency, Pelosi said ""let's see what he does.""

""If and when the President does that, you'll find out how we would react,"" she said, predicting Trump will have problems on his own side of the aisle ""for exploiting this situation in a way that enhances his power.""

""I don't think he really wants a solution,"" she later added. ""I think he loves the distraction.""

Asked what she would say to families who've lost family members in crimes by undocumented immigrants or to the opioid crisis, Pelosi acknowledged the deaths were tragic, but she said ""the plural of 'anecdote' is not data"" and that children were also dying in US custody and families were being separated.

""One death is more than we should be able to bear, whether it's the corporal (referring to Cpl. Ronil Singh) or whether it's the children, but the fact is we have to have public policy that secures the border and what the President is proposing would not eliminate those possibilities.""

She said it's important to be ""concerned about every death that happens because ... we live in an imperfect world and that is very sad, but it is not a justification for having more children die in custody or be separated from their families.""

""I find that appalling,"" she added. ""They find it normal.""

Pelosi, who represents San Francisco, also blasted the President for tweeting Wednesday that he ordered FEMA to withhold funds to California in the aftermath of the wildfires unless the state ""get(s) their act together"" and conducts what he called ""proper Forest Management.""

Pelosi said Trump had ""no right to withhold those funds.""

""The votes he did get in California were in rural California,"" she said. ""If you think you're punishing our state, you're punishing your own voters.""",139
0,"US President Donald Trump's budget director and chief of staff says the partial US government shutdown could continue to January 3, when the new congress convenes and Democrats take over the House of Representatives.

""It's very possible this shutdown will go beyond the 28th and into the new congress,"" Mick Mulvaney said on Fox News Sunday.

""I don't think things are going to move very quickly here for the next few days"" because of the Christmas holiday, added Mulvaney, who serves as director of the Office of Management and Budget and was named acting White House chief of staff 10 days ago.

The US Senate adjourned on Saturday unable to break an impasse over Trump's demand for more funds for a wall on the border with Mexico that Democrats are unwilling to accept.

Mulvaney said the White House made a ""counteroffer"" to Democrats on funding for border security that falls between the Democratic offer of $US1.3 billion ($A1.8 billion) and Trump's demand for $US5 billion.

As part of those talks on Saturday, Vice President Mike Pence offered to drop the demand for $US5 billion for a border wall, substituting instead $US2.1 billion, ABC News reported citing unnamed sources.

Mulvaney sought to shift blame for the partial shutdown to Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic nominee for speaker of the US House of Representatives, saying she might hold up negotiations to ensure she secures the position.

""I think she's in that unfortunate position of being beholden to her left wing to where she cannot be seen as agreeing with the president on anything until after she is Speaker,"" Mulvaney said.

""If that's the case, again, there's a chance we go into the next congress.""

Financing for about a quarter of federal government programs - including the departments of Homeland Security, Justice and Agriculture - expired at midnight on Friday and will not be renewed until a deal is done.

RELATED: US paper brutally mocks Trump over government shutdown

Building a wall to keep migrants from entering the US illegally was a central plank of Trump's presidential campaign, but Democrats are vehemently opposed and have rejected his funding request.

Trump reiterated his push for border security on Sunday, saying on Twitter that ""the only way"" to stop drugs, gangs, and human trafficking at the border was with a wall or barrier.

""Drones and all of the rest are wonderful and lots of fun, but it is only a good old fashioned Wall that works!,"" the president said in the tweet.

Earlier in the week, leaders in both the Senate and House of Representatives thought they had reached a deal that Trump would sign that contained less money for border security, only to watch the president, under pressure from conservatives, reassert his demand for $US5 billion at the last minute.

Senator David Perdue, a Republican from Georgia on the Senate Banking Committee, said on Fox News' Sunday Morning Futures that he thought a deal this week was possible.

""I spoke to the president last night, he wants that,"" Purdue said, adding ""I'm hopeful that cooler heads will prevail and we'll get to some number between $1.6 (billion) and $5 billion on that.""",140
0,"WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump said Tuesday that he intends to keep the federal government closed until he secures the desired funding from Congress for his promised border wall, and he cast doubt about the performance of Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome H. Powell after a sharp downturn in U.S. stock markets.

In an Oval Office appearance on Christmas morning, Trump praised Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin despite the stock markets suffering their steepest Christmas Eve decline in decades but was more circumspect about his handpicked Fed chair.

""Well, we'll see,"" Trump said when a journalist asked whether he had confidence in Powell. ""They're raising interest rates too fast, that's my opinion. But I certainly have confidence. But I think it'll straighten. They're raising interest rates too fast because they think the economy is so good. But I think that they will get it pretty soon, I really do.""

As for whether he has confidence in Mnuchin, whose Sunday calls to reassure major bank executives rattled investors and may have exacerbated Monday's sell-off, Trump told reporters, ""Yes, I do. Very talented guy, very smart person.""

Trump made his comments during a Christmas photo op in the Oval Office, where he spoke by video teleconference with service members from all five branches of the armed forces who are stationed in Alaska, Bahrain, Guam and Qatar.

""I can't tell you when the government is going to reopen,"" he said. ""I can tell you it's not going to be open until we have a wall, a fence, whatever they'd like to call it. I'll call it whatever they want. But it's all the same thing. It's a barrier from people pouring into our country.""

The president defended his plan to construct a wall along the border with Mexico that he insisted only an Olympic athlete would be able to scale. ""If you don't have that, then we're just not opening,"" Trump said.

All told, about 800,000 of 2.1 million federal workers nationwide - or more than a third - are estimated to be affected in some way by the shutdown. Trump claimed that many of them support the shutdown.

""Many of those workers have said to me, communicated - stay out until you get the funding for the wall,"" Trump said. ""These federal workers want the wall.""

But his claim conflicts with the accounts of federal workers' union leaders.

""Federal employees should not have to pay the personal price for all of this dysfunction,"" said Tony Reardon, president of the National Treasury Employees Union, which represents 150,000 members at 33 federal agencies and departments. ""This shutdown is a travesty. Congress and the White House have not done their fundamental jobs of keeping the government open.""

In a survey of 1,500 union members, about 85 percent said they have limited holiday season spending or are planning to do so because of uncertainty about income, Reardon said on Christmas Eve. He said they include one who said ""I have recently lost my wife and now . . .. I have to put off buying her headstone. Breaks my heart.""

Another responded, ""I can't buy any Christmas presents and am considering returning those I already have. Mortgage companies and utility companies won't wait to get paid,"" according to Reardon.

The government shutdown comes near the end of what will probably be the worst year for the U.S. stock market since the financial crisis a decade ago. Many sectors are now technically in a ""bear market,"" down more than 20 percent.

Before the recent reversal in the stock market, which began during the fall, Trump had frequently boasted that stocks were soaring during his tenure, claiming credit for the upswing.

The downturn has caused great uncertainty in the White House as Trump has sought someone to blame, and he has lashed out publicly at Powell. On Saturday, several news outlets reported that Trump was looking for ways to potentially fire Powell. That spurred Mnuchin to release a statement on Trump's behalf that the president did not believe he had the ""right"" to fire Powell.

Many economists and analysts on Wall Street say that an attempt to fire the Fed chief would send markets in a tailspin amid uncertainty over the stability of the U.S. central bank, the most important institution in shaping U.S. and global markets.

Trump is angry that Powell is continuing the Fed's long-telegraphed plan to raise its benchmark interest rate and scale back other extraordinary measures intended to support the economy. The Fed's benchmark rate is now 2.25 to 2.5 percent, higher than the near-zero interest rate the Fed had pursued for years but still historically low.

Trump complains that his predecessor Barack Obama benefited from lower interest rates, spurring economic growth. Others point out that the Fed, which operates independently of the White House, had pursued a low-interest-rate policy because the economy was much weaker than it is today.

""They are raising interest rates too fast, that's my opinion,"" Trump said Tuesday. ""President Obama didn't do much of that . . . He had a very low interest rate.""

Powell was Mnuchin's recommendation when Trump was seeking a new Fed chair a year ago, and some close to Trump have questioned whether the president will begin to blame the treasury secretary, too, for the sell-off. But on Tuesday he praised Mnuchin, a longtime friend and finance chairman of his 2016 campaign.

Again on Tuesday, Trump tried to place blame for Washington's budget stalemate solely on Democrats, portraying their leaders as disingenuous and claiming that they support the notion of a physical barrier along the border and object to building the wall only because it is Trump's idea.

Trump likened the situation to his May 2017 firing of James Comey as FBI director, saying ""Democrats hated him"" until he was fired and then Comey was treated as a hero.

Even as he vowed to keep the government closed to secure wall funding, Trump claimed that much of his envisioned wall was already being built. He said he had awarded a contract ""at a great price"" for a 115-mile section of wall in Texas and plans to visit the site in January for ""a ground-breaking"" ceremony.

Administration officials have provided no details about this construction project or the terms of the contract.

Trump said he hopes to have all portions of the wall completed - either old fencing renovated or new construction - by Election Day 2020, an indication that he sees building the wall chiefly as a political issue tied to his reelection chances.

Trump said Tuesday that the wall as he envisions it would be a fortress that no normal human could breach.

""Now there may be the case of an Olympic champion who can get over the wall, but for the most part you are not able to do it,"" he said. ""Very high. It's gonna be 30 feet. Much of it is 30 feet high. Some if it's low. But in some areas we have it as high as 30 feet. That's like a three-story building.""

Building a wall to keep migrants from entering the US illegally was a central plank of Trump's presidential campaign, but Democrats are vehemently opposed and have rejected his funding request.

Trump reiterated his push for border security on Sunday, saying on Twitter that ""the only way"" to stop drugs, gangs, and human trafficking at the border was with a wall or barrier.

""Drones and all of the rest are wonderful and lots of fun, but it is only a good old fashioned Wall that works!,"" the president said in the tweet.

Earlier in the week, leaders in both the Senate and House of Representatives thought they had reached a deal that Trump would sign that contained less money for border security, only to watch the president, under pressure from conservatives, reassert his demand for $US5 billion at the last minute.

Senator David Perdue, a Republican from Georgia on the Senate Banking Committee, said on Fox News' Sunday Morning Futures that he thought a deal this week was possible.

As a partial U.S. government shutdown hit the two-week mark, President Donald Trump and congressional leaders prepared to meet on Friday over ways to break an impasse pitting his demand for building a border wall against Democrats' call for alternative security measures.

About 800,000 federal workers have been affected by the Dec. 22 closure of about one-quarter of the federal government as Trump withheld his support for new funding until he secures $5 billion to start building the wall along the U.S.-Mexico border that he promised during his campaign.

Such a wall, he has argued, is needed to stem the flow of illegal immigrants and drugs over the southwestern border. When he ran for president in 2016, he vowed Mexico would pay for the wall, which it has refused to do.

On Thursday, Trump tried to keep the pressure on Democrats, even as they gained significant new power with their takeover of the House of Representatives at the start of a new Congress.

""Build the Wall,"" the Republican president demanded on Twitter. In remarks to reporters that same day, Trump said: ""You can call it a barrier. You can call it whatever you want. But essentially, we need protection in our country.""

As Trump dug in, so did opposition Democrats, leaving many to wonder just how much progress might be made during Friday's White House meeting scheduled for 11:30 a.m. (1630 GMT).

""We're not doing a wall,"" Democrat Nancy Pelosi said late on Thursday, several hours after she was sworn in as the new speaker of the House of Representatives.

""It has nothing to do with politics. It has to do with a wall is an immorality between countries. It's an old way of thinking. It isn't cost effective,"" Pelosi added.

Late on Thursday, the House passed two Democratic bills to immediately reopen government agencies for varying lengths of time, despite a White House veto threat.

Earlier in the day, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican, labeled the House effort ""political theater, not productive lawmaking,"" that the president would not sign into law, although the Senate last month approved identical legislation.

But McConnell faces increasing pressure from within his caucus, especially from vulnerable Republicans up for re-election in 2020, as several conservative senators urged action to reopen the government, according to media reports.

""We should pass a continuing resolution to get the government back open. The Senate has done it last Congress, we should do it again today,"" U.S. Senator Cory Gardner told The Hill on Thursday. His colleague Susan Collins also called for the Senate to pass the funding bills, while several other Republicans also urged an end to the shutdown, the Hill and the New York Times reported.

Vice President Mike Pence, in a television interview Thursday night, also suggested that in exchange for the wall, the White House could work with Democrats on so-called Dreamer immigrants who were brought to the United States illegally as children -- an idea Trump had rejected on Wednesday.

""It's being talked about,"" Pence told Fox News.

Democrats back other border security measures aside from the wall, and their two-bill package passed Thursday includes $1.3 billion for border fencing and $300 million for other border security items such as technology and cameras.

Without a deal to end the partial government shutdown, the Department of Homeland Security will not be able to bring some furloughed workers back to their jobs while others continue to be forced to work without paychecks for the time being.

Other federal agencies were also hobbled, including the Justice Department, Commerce Department and departments of Agriculture, Labor, Interior and Treasury.

Additionally, the partial shutdown was straining the country's immigration system, worsening backlogs in courts and complicating hiring for employers.

0,"President Donald Trump said on Friday he could use emergency powers to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border without Congress' approval, threatening to bypass Democratic lawmakers emboldened by their recent takeover of the House of Representatives.

A showdown between Trump and Congressional Democrats over funding for his wall project has led to a two-week government shutdown. Trump says he will not support a bill to fully fund the government until he secures the money for the wall.

Asked whether he had considered declaring a national emergency to build the wall, Trump said: ""Yes, I have. ... We can do it. I haven't done it. I may do it ... But we can call a national emergency and build it very quickly.""

The comments come just a day after Democrats, led by Nancy Pelosi, took charge of the House, ushering in an era of divided government two years into Trump's term.

In sometimes combative talks on Friday, Trump, Pelosi and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer failed to strike a deal to end the partial shutdown as they fought over Trump's request for $5 billion to fund the wall.

The U.S. Constitution assigns Congress the power over funding the federal government, so Trump would likely face legal challenges if he tried to bypass Congress on financing the wall.

He dismissed those concerns in a news briefing at the White House.

""We can call a national emergency because of the security of our country, absolutely,"" he said. Asked if declaring a national emergency was a threat hanging over Democrats, Trump said, ""I'd never threaten anybody, but I am allowed to do that, yes.""",145

0,"NEW YORK - US President Donald Trump says government shutdown will continue unless he secures the desired funding for building a border wall with Mexico aimed at stopping illegal migration.

Speaking after a Christmas Day video message on Tuesday, Trump said that the federal government would remain partially closed until Congress meets his demand for more than $5 billion for the wall.

""I can't tell you when the government is going to be open,"" he said. ""I can tell you, it's not going to be open until we have a wall, a fence, whatever they'd like to call it. I'll call it whatever they want ... If you don't have that [wall], then we're just not opening.""

Trump expressed hope that the wall would be completed by the next presidential election in 2020, also announcing plans to go to the border in January to visit a new stretch of wall. ""It's my hope to have this done, completed - all 500 to 550 miles - to have it either renovated or brand new by election time, It's going to be built, hopefully rapidly,"" he said. ""I'm going there at the end of January for the start of construction. That's a big stretch.""

Trump also claimed, without providing evidence, that federal employees on furlough or working without pay understand his demand for a border wall and support him in his mission. ""I think they understand what's happening,"" he said. ""They want border security. The people of this country want border security.""

The remarks were made as the shutdown over budget spending is in its fourth day after Democratic lawmakers resisted Trump's demand for a five billion-dollar border wall funding. Nine of the 15 federal departments, including State, Homeland Security, Transportation, Agriculture and Justice are partially closed. The shutdown has exacerbated the year-end chaos in Washington as well as the downfall of stock markets, amid the ouster of Defence Secretary James Mattis and troop withdrawals from Syria and Afghanistan and the Russia investigation. A day earlier, top Democrats had criticized the president for plunging the country into chaos after shutting down parts of the government during Christmas time.

It's Christmas Eve and President Trump is plunging the country into chaos, the two top Democrats in Congress, the House speaker nominee, Nancy Pelosi, and Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, wrote in a joint statement on Monday. The stock market is tanking and the president is waging a personal war on the Federal Reserve - after he just fired the Secretary of Defense, they noted.

Schumer on Saturday said Trump must abandon the wall, plain and simple for the government to reopen.

Hundreds of thousands of federal employees are working unpaid or have gone on temporary leave during the partial shutdown. A deal to end the funding dispute appears to be a distant prospect as Congress adjourned on the weekend for Christmas.

Building the wall was one of Trump's most frequently repeated campaign promises, but Democrats are vehemently opposed to it.

The Republican president has vowed to crack down on immigration, in part by building a wall on the border with Mexico, but has failed to get his complete agenda through so far. Democrats and some Republicans have rejected Trump's demand for the US-Mexico border, following which on last week he refused to sign a wider spending bill, temporarily stripping funding from swaths of the government. ""I can't tell you when the government is going to reopen...(Not until) we have a wall, a fence, whatever they would like to call it. I'll call it whatever they want. But it's all the same thing. It's a barrier from people pouring into our country...a barrier from drugs,"" Trump told reporters in his Oval office.

""There is a problem in this world today called human trafficking...We are not going to let that take place. We are working so hard to catch these traffickers...We can't do it without a barrier...without a wall.

He reiterated that the shutdown could continue for long if it was necessary, repeating his call on the Democrats to support the construction of a wall on the border and putting blame for the shutdown on them.

The shutdown triggered by disputes over wall funding has been continuing since December 22, 2018. While Trump is demanding to allocate more than $5 billion for the construction of the wall, Democratic lawmakers along with some Republicans have refused to meet the demand, and many have noted that the president had previously promised that Mexico would pay for the wall.

The GoFundMe, ""We The People Will Fund The Wall,"" was started by veteran Brian Kolfage, 37. The triple-amputee was injured while serving in Iraq with the U.S. Air Force.

The fundraiser was inspired by a persistent dissatisfaction with the lack of action by politicians, Kolfage said.

""I was frustrated with our political leaders and what they're doing - their broken promises and dragging things on,"" said Kolfage on Sunday. ""I thought having the GoFundMe would allow people to come together on the internet to show support for what they wanted. Raising this kind of money shows how important this is and that people want to support it.""

Donations quickly poured in, toppling Kolfage's expectations by raising millions of dollars each day. The total surpassed $16 million from more than 271,000 people as of Monday.

""I knew it would be big, but never that fast,"" he said. ""It just ignited.""

The fundraiser has a $1 billion goal - the largest in GoFundMe's history. That would only cover one-fifth of the $5 billion price tag on President Donald Trump's proposed border wall.

Kolfage, who grew up in Texas, lost both legs and his dominant right hand in a mortar attack in Iraq in 2004.

He underwent 16 surgeries in six months. He was forced to learn to write with his left hand and struggled to adjust to his prosthetic legs.

He left Walter Reed National Military Medical Center on the East Coast in July 2005 and settled in Tucson just a few months later. He found a civilian job at Davis-Monthan Air Force Base.

After his injury, Kolfage began speaking publicly about his experience and even filmed a campaign ad for former Democratic Rep. Gabrielle Giffords shortly before she was shot in 2011.

She invited him to attend President Barack Obama's State of the Union address as her special guest in 2012. She even told Time magazine Kolfage was one of her inspirations while she recovered.

Kolfage lived in Tucson for 10 years. He enrolled at the University of Arizona on a scholarship from the Pat Tillman Foundation and graduated in 2014 from the architecture school.

He now lives in Florida with his wife and two children.

As a staunch Republican, Kolfage said on the GoFundMe page his support for the wall stemmed from the belief that ""too many Americans have been murdered by illegal aliens and too many illegals are taking advantage of the United States taxpayers with no means of ever contributing to our society.""

He said he wants to make it clear he isn't against immigration - as long as it's done legally. He points to the difficult process to obtain legal citizenship as just one of the problems with the current system.

""They came here the right way,"" he explained. ""They came through the front door. They did everything correctly and that's what America is all about.""

He said his time in Tucson gave him a better understanding of the value of legal immigration and programs such as the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals act (DACA), which allows children brought into the U.S. illegally to defer deportation while they become eligible for a work permit.

""That influenced me and my life,"" he said. ""People see the GoFundMe and they call me racist. It's not about the wall, but it's about the people on the outside and the inside.""

But Kolfage's intentions were questioned by a recent BuzzFeed News article alleging he used his position to push right-wing conspiracy theories and false stories on a number of conservative media sites.

Kolfage said in an email to The Arizona Republic on Sunday afternoon that the article was intentionally trying to smear his image. He said he plans to take legal action against BuzzFeed.

He said the claims were fabricated and provided multiple screenshots showing what he described as ""fake"" Facebook accounts posting under his name.

""I would NEVER say those things,"" he added.

Kolfage previously made waves on social media in 2015 when he wrote a blog post objecting to an American flag with rainbow colored-stripes displayed at a home on the Davis-Monthan Air Force Base.

He claimed the flag violated code dictating that the American flag should only be displayed in its original form, but the base ruled the flag was in compliance with federal law.

He later criticized the decision on a conservative news site.

The previous year, Kolfage filed a defamation lawsuit in Maricopa County Superior Court claiming social media attacks from his critics strayed into libelous territory. The Arizona Daily Star reported that one of the defendants said Kolfage posted his personal information online, resulting in threatening phone calls and messages.

Kolfage's suit was settled privately in 2015.

A budget passed by the U.S. House of Representatives on Thursday night includes $5 billion for Trump's border wall.

Kolfage said multiple House members told him the GoFundMe influenced the vote.

""It just shows you, regardless of what happens, it impacted and changed votes that day,"" Kolfage said. ""I think that's a success. We've done something that hasn't been done before with immense support from around the country.""

Trump posted on Twitter on Wednesday ""one way or another, we will win on the Wall!""

But negotiations in Congress later failed, ending in a partial government shutdown Friday.

There are questions about how - and if - the government could accept the donation.

The Department of Homeland Security couldn't accept the money without the approval of Congress due to ethical concerns, according to USA TODAY.

But Republican Rep. Warren Davidson, R-Ohio, has proposed a bill that would allow the secretary of the Treasury Department to accept public donations to fund the construction of the wall.

Kolfage said his team has been working with Vice President Mike Pence and his staff to ensure the donation would go to the right place. They're also working to create a contract with the government that would allow the funds only to be used for the wall.

""It's only for construction of the wall, not lining someone's pockets,"" he said. ""We don't want to get involved in politics.""

If that's not possible, or if the project secures enough funding without the fundraiser, Kolfage said he will have to decide whether to refund the money or follow some donors' suggestions to build an immigration center for those entering the country legally.

""Somewhere nicer for children and families,"" he said. ""A nice place that's more of a humane and welcome atmosphere. A place where children can play while they wait.""

There's no set end date for the online fundraiser. Kolfage said he plans to keep the page going as long as necessary.",153
0,"WASHINGTON: As a partial US government shutdown hit the two-week mark, President Donald Trump and congressional leaders prepared to meet on Friday to discuss breaking an impasse pitting his demand for building a border wall against Democrats' call for alternative security measures.

About 800,000 federal workers have been affected by the Dec.22 closure of about one-quarter of the federal government as Trump withheld his support for new funding until he secures $5 billion to start building the wall along the US-Mexico border that he promised during his campaign.

Such a wall, he has argued, is needed to stem the flow of illegal immigrants and drugs over the southwestern border. When he ran for president in 2016, he vowed Mexico would pay for the wall, which it has refused to do.

""The president isn't going to back off,"" White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders told reporters on Friday morning.

US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, who took control of the chamber on Thursday, sought to separate the issue of the wall and government funding, and called on Trump and his fellow Republicans in the Senate to reopen agencies as border talks continue.

""The wall and the government shutdown really have nothing to do with each other,"" Pelosi, who has rejected any funding for what she has called an ""immoral"" border wall, said at a Friday event hosted by MSNBC.

US House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer, the No.2 House Democrat, said Democratic congressional leaders hoped to resolve the shutdown at the meeting. ""I hope we will open up government,"" he told MSNBC in a separate interview.

Trump promoted the wall in tweets to keep the pressure on Democrats on Thursday even as they gained significant new power with their takeover of the House of Representatives at the start of a new Congress.

Late on Thursday, the House passed two Democratic bills to immediately reopen government agencies for varying lengths of time, despite a White House veto threat.

Earlier in the day, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican, rejected the House effort saying the president would not sign into law, although the Senate last month approved identical legislation.

McConnell faces increasing pressure from within his caucus, especially from vulnerable Republicans up for re-election in 2020, as several conservative senators urged action to reopen the government, according to media reports.

""We should pass a continuing resolution to get the government back open. The Senate has done it last Congress, we should do it again today,"" US Senator Cory Gardner told The Hill on Thursday.

His colleague Susan Collins also called for the Senate to pass the funding bills, while several other Republicans urged an end to the shutdown, the Hill and New York Times reported.

Pelosi on Friday urged McConnell to bring the measures up for a vote. ""The president can sign or not but he should never say, 'I'm not even going to put it on the president's desk,'"" she told MSNBC, noting Congress can pass bills without Trump's support.

Overnight, Democratic Rep-elect Ilhan Omar of Minnesota tweeted a picture with her family at the airport.

The House rules were being changed to allow Omar, who is Muslim, to wear a head scarf on the chamber floor. She wrote, ""23 years ago, from a refugee camp in Kenya, my father and I arrived at an airport in Washington DC. Today, we return to that same airport on the eve of my swearing in as the first Somali-American in Congress.""

Impeachment

Meanwhile, a Democratic congresswoman kicked off her term with an expletive-laced vow to impeach Trump, triggering Republican outrage and testing party discipline barely a day after Democrats regained the House.

As a clip of Michigan Democrat Rashida Tlaib's animated comments circulated widely on social media, Trump tartly dismissed the threat of impeachment in a tweet on Friday.

""How do you impeach a president who has won perhaps the greatest election of all time, done nothing wrong (no Collusion with Russia, it was the Dems that Colluded), had the most successful first two years of any president, and is the most popular Republican in party history 93%?"" Trump tweeted.",154

President Donald Trump will take the national stage tonight to make his case for the construction of a wall at the US-Mexico border. But experts say such an enormous construction project would have significant impacts on the environment around the nation's southern border.

His live address from the Oval Office comes 18 days into a partial government shutdown, which is the result of a disagreement over funding for Trump's desired border wall. The shutdown has impacted nearly 800,000 federal employees (and caused garbage to pile up in national parks), but Trump has indicated that he won't end the shutdown until he secures $5 billion in funding for the wall.

Trump most likely hopes that his national address and visit to the southwest will boost public support for a wall - despite the environmental impact.

What's more, the Department of Homeland Security has already indicated that it will leverage a law that enables the government to expedite border infrastructure by waiving certain legal requirements, which would allow the project to sidestep dozens of environmental rules in California.

The US-Mexico border is nearly 2,000 miles long and peppered with marshes, deserts, and grasslands. The construction of a continuous wall could therefore harm species who are, of course, not on the administration's immigration radar.

More than 1,500 species of flora and fauna, like the Peninsular bighorn sheep shown above, make their homes along this biologically diverse strip of North America. Sixty-two of these species are considered vulnerable, endangered, or critically endangered by the International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN). And many of those species would face extirpation - meaning local extinction in the US - if they were unable to access habitats and resources on either side of the border, according to a study from Stanford University.

Of those species, 17% would be stuck living in an area of roughly 7,700 square miles or less - elevating their risk of extirpation, according to IUCN guidelines. According to the study, which was published in the journal BioScience in July 2018, some of these at-risk species include the endangered jaguar and ocelot.

The two Stanford biologists behind the study, Paul Ehrlich and Rodolfo Dirzo, explained that physical barriers - whether they are rivers, mountains, or a human-made wall - can deter or prevent animals from finding mates, fresh water, and necessary food.

Dirzo told the Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment that ""cut off like this, the bighorn and other animals and plants will become zombie species - populations that are demographically and genetically doomed.""

Dirzo and Erhlich noted the border wall could also impede flying species that enjoy riding currents close to the ground. Examples include the ­endangered Quino checkerspot butterfly or the ferruginous pygmy owl.

Echoing those concerns, the National Audubon Society, the National Resources Defense Council, and more than 170 conservation groups penned a letter to Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen in November.

The letter elaborated on the impact of a wall on ""environmentally sensitive conservation areas"" like the Lower Rio Grande Valley area, which has a plethora of butterfly and bird fauna. Bruce Stein, chief scientist at the National Wildlife Federation, wrote, ""barriers like border walls can interfere with the ability of animals to meet their daily needs, make seasonal migrations or disperse to new areas.""

Quartz, which first reported on the letter to Nielsen, noted that an unfamiliar obstacle could even deter birds, despite the fact that they could theoretically fly to heights above it.

Dirzo also told the Stanford Woods Institute for the Environment that a barrier like a wall would limit how much a species could move ""to track habitats that shift due to a changing climate.""

Rising temperatures and extreme weather are already altering certain regions' ecology, leading animals to shift their behavior in order to survive and find food. A wall could prevent creatures from successfully adapting. Stein also pointed this out in the letter to Neilson.

A wall that cuts animals' habitat into pieces would consequently force their populations into smaller subgroups that are effectively unable to interact and mate with one another.

That would make each remaining subgroup more vulnerable to diseases and natural disasters. Plus, less gene flow between individuals within a species means less genetic diversity, and a higher possibility of inbreeding. Overall, these consequences would increase a species' overall risk for extinction.

According to Vox, fewer than 200 total Mexican gray wolves remained in the wild in the US and Mexico in 2016. A report from the Center for Biological Diversity in July 2018 noted that the US population of Mexican gray wolves increased by only four individuals between 2014 and 2017. In the report, Bryan Bird, Defenders of Wildlife's southwest program director, said that the ""Mexican gray wolves are in a race with extinction, and the clock is ticking.""

A wall separating the some three dozen wolves in Mexico from their counterparts in the US could therefore be a deadly blow for the world's most endangered wolf.

Impacts on wildlife aside, the proposed border wall could also impact the quotidian movements of three major rivers and their tributaries.

The wall would need to bisect the Rio Grande, Colorado, and Tijuana Rivers. Bob Irvin, president of the environmental group American Rivers, told News Deeply that between 100 and 500 rivers and streams would be affected.

The wall would ""undoubtedly change the flow of those rivers and streams, and it would also impair the water quality in them,"" he said.

Irvin added that ""when you change the flow of a river, you're changing the natural cleansing mechanisms of that river. So you certainly could see a buildup of pollutants - both solid and chemical - as a result of that.""

If the border wall wound up acting as a 2,000-mile dam, debris could pile up any time there was a storm, impeding the flow of the river. Irvin told News Deeply that's already happening along some sections of wall that already exist in Arizona.

According to a report by the Sierra Club, such walls have contributed to severe flooding and flood damage before when constructed across natural drainage points.

During a seasonal rain storm, that wall acted as a dam, flooding the sister cities of Nogales and Sonara in 6 feet of water. The disaster caused $8 million in property damage and two deaths. Six years later, a similar flood happened again in Nogales, when debris blocked a 60-foot section of the border.

There's little evidence that the designs for the proposed continuous border wall would account for mitigation of possible flood risks. Quartz even reported that 8 miles of the planned wall in Texas would be built on a floodplain.

In a letter to the leaders of US Customs and Border Protection (CBP), a group of environmental advocates including Friends of the Earth and the Sierra Club said they anticipated that the section of the wall planned for Hidalgo County, Texas might worsen flooding in adjacent parts of Mexico.

""We are extremely concerned that CBP does not appear to be conducting this project in compliance with NEPA [the National Environmental Policy Act] or other applicable federal laws,"" they wrote.",156

The federal government will remain partially shuttered as the new 116th Congress begins work Thursday - but history will be made as many of the new members are sworn in.

Following the midterm elections, Democrats regained control of the U.S. House - setting up Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi to take back the speaker's gavel. Pelosi was the first woman ever to serve as House speaker when she was first tapped for the job in 2007.

Here's a look at five things to watch as Congress comes back to work.

California Rep. Nancy Pelosi is expected to get her old job as House speaker back as the new Congress convenes Thursday. Pelosi made history as the first woman elected speaker of the House in 2007 - and she will be the first lawmaker to regain the gavel in more than a half-century.

Pelosi, 78, faced early opposition from some in her own party who called for a fresh generation of guidance. But one-by-one, Pelosi managed to win over several skeptics through promising lead positions on their legislative priorities or special panels. She also struck a deal with Democrats by vowing to serve no more than four years in the leadership position.

TRUMP VERSUS DEMOCRATS: A LOOK AT WHICH LAWMAKERS ARE SET TO BATTLE THE PRESIDENT IN 2019

In accepting the gavel, Pelosi will give a nod to the new era of divided government with a pledge to ""reach across the aisle in this chamber and across the divisions in this great nation,"" according to excerpts of her prepared remarks.

As the new Congress convenes, the partial government shutdown continues in its 13th day - with no end in sight in the showdown between Trump and lawmakers over funding for a border wall.

The Democrat-controlled House plans to vote on a pair of bills to reopen the government, which includes a plan to fund the Department of Homeland Security at current levels through Feb. 8, with $1.3 billion allotted for border security. Other departments affected by the partial shutdown would be funded for the remainder of the fiscal year until the end of September.

LINDSEY GRAHAM: TRUMP CAVING ON BORDER SECURITY 'PROBABLY THE END OF HIS PRESIDENCY'

But neither the White House nor the Republican-controlled Senate is likely to budge and support a bill that doesn't allocate for the $5 billion for a border wall that Trump demanded.

""Both parties must work together to pass a Funding Bill that protects this Nation and its people - this is the first and most important duty of government,"" Trump tweeted Wednesday night. ""I remain ready and willing to work with Democrats to pass a bill that secures our borders, supports the agents and officers on the ground, and keeps America Safe.""

The new Congress will make history for seating a record number of women and becoming the most racially and ethnically diverse. Additionally, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a New York Democrat, is the youngest woman elected to Congress at 29 years old.

Michigan's Rashida Tlaib and Minnesota's Ilhan Omar will become the first Muslim women to serve in Congress. Tlaib will take her oath on a 1734 English translation Quran that belonged to former President Thomas Jefferson.

WOMEN POISED TO MAKE HISTORY WITH 2018 MIDTERM ELECTIONS

And Sharice Davids of Kansas along with Deb Haaland of New Mexico will be the first Native American women to serve in Congress. Davids, an activist and lawyer, will also set a record as the first LGBT Native American elected to the House.

In all, 127 women -- 106 Democrats 21 Republicans -- will serve in the 116th Congress, holding nearly 24 percent of all seats, according to the Center for Women and Politics at Rutgers University.

Two self-described Democratic Socialists will officially join Congress Thursday (Tlaib and Ocasio-Cortez) as big-government policies - such as the Green New Deal and Medicare for all - are on the agenda for some party members.

It's unclear when and if any of these programs will make it to the floor, let alone pass the House. But their growing support marks an astonishing rise for socialist-leaning policies in just a few years and reflects a shift in the party itself.

While echoing the language of President Franklin Delano Roosevelt's New Deal, the Green New Deal aims to combat both climate change and income inequality. It's pushed by progressive lawmakers including Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt.

A draft proposal, which calls for a select committee to be formed to create an official plan, calls for eliminating greenhouse gas emissions from manufacturing and agriculture while ""dramatically"" expanding energy sources to meet 100 percent of power demand through renewable sources as well. It also demands a job guarantee program offering a ""living wage job to every person who wants one.""

Single-payer proposals, like Medicare for all, would rely on the government to control the health care system. It's been championed by more progressive Democrats, and more than half of House Democrats in the new Congress have supported plans to open Medicare to any American, regardless of age, according to The New York Times.

Rep. Brad Sherman, D-Calif., plans to hit the ground running as Democrats take control of the House Thursday - by introducing articles of impeachment against Trump, according to the Los Angeles Times.

He is accusing the president of obstructing justice by firing former FBI Director James Comey, the newspaper reported.

""Every day, Donald Trump shows that leaving the White House would be good for our country,"" Sherman, 64, said.

INSIDE NANCY PELOSI'S BATTLE FOR HOUSE SPEAKER

This isn't the first time Sherman has introduced articles of impeachment against Trump. But when he did so in 2017, Republicans controlled the House.

Pelosi isn't ruling out impeachment proceedings entirely. Ahead of the new Congress convening, she told NBC News she wants to ""see what comes"" from special counsel Robert Mueller's probe of Trump's presidential campaign and Russia.

""We shouldn't be impeaching for a political reason, and we shouldn't avoid impeachment for a political reason,"" she said.

0,"WASHINGTON - The two top congressional Democrats emerged from a White House meeting on Friday offering no sign of progress toward a deal with President Donald Trump to fully re-open the government, with one claiming Trump threatened to keep it shut for ""months or even years"" as he held out for funding for a border wall.

With the partial shutdown now two weeks old, the two sides held a sometimes contentious meeting in the White House about the shutdown, said House of Representatives Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat.

About 800,000 federal workers have been unpaid due to the closure of about a quarter of the federal government as Trump withholds his support for a bill which would fund the government until he secures the money for the wall that he promised during his election campaign.

""We just completed a lengthy and sometimes contentious conversation with the president,"" Pelosi told reporters. ""We agreed that we would continue our conversations. But we recognize on the Democratic side that we really cannot resolve this until we open up government and we made that very clear to the president.""

It was the first meeting between Trump and Democratic leaders since the party took over the House this week after gains in last November's midterm elections.

About 800,000 federal workers have been affected by the Dec. 22 closure of about one-quarter of the federal government as Trump withheld his support for new funding until he secures $5 billion to start building the wall along the U.S.-Mexico border that he promised during his campaign.

0,"martince2/iStock(WASHINGTON) -- Amid a government shutdown and major winter storms hitting large swaths of the U.S., the number of TSA officers who didn't come to work on Sunday more than doubled compared to that number a year ago.

On Sunday, TSA spokesperson Michael Bilello said 7.7 percent of the agency's employees had an unscheduled absence today, compared with 5.6 percent on Saturday and 3.2 percent a year ago.

A stalemate between President Donald Trump and congressional Democrats over funding for Trump's campaign promise of a wall along the U.S.-Mexico border has created the longest federal government shutdown in history, and forced over 800,000 government employees to go without paychecks.

According to Bilello, 99.9 percent of airline passengers across the U.S. waited less than 30 minutes at their checkpoints.

Official wait time data for Sunday wasn't immediately available.

More than 51,000 airport security screeners are required to work through the government shutdown -despite the agency's inability to provide them their regular pay -- until it secures congressional funding from lawmakers in Washington.

In addition to missing a regular payday, thousands of TSA employees are dealing with winter weather stretching from the Midwest to the East Coast.

Parts of Missouri, Iowa and Illinois received more than a foot of snow by Sunday morning. With at least 10 inches of snow in St. Louis so far, this is the biggest snow storm the city has seen in 5 years.

Five inches of snow in New Jersey and ice-covered roads as far south as North Carolina made for dangerous driving conditions in other parts of the country.

In an apparent effort to raise the spirits of those tasked with keep the country's airports safe, TSA Administrator David Pekoske announced on Friday that his uniformed screening officers would soon receive a one-time bonus of $500 ""in recognition of their hard work during yet another busy holiday travel season, maintaining the highest of security standards during an extraordinary period.""

That extraordinary period has seen an increasing number of airport screeners calling out of work, even before the government shutdown postponed paychecks for the first time on Friday, sparking fears of long lines and staffing shortages as the shutdown continues.

The National Air Traffic Controllers Association is currently suing the Trump administration on behalf of the thousands of controllers that have not been paid during the record-breaking shutdown.

The suit, filed in federal court in Washington, D.C., claims the administration has violated the Fifth Amendment by depriving workers of wages without due process and violated fair labor regulations by not at least paying minimum wage to air traffic controllers and others who are required to work during the government shutdown. The suit also claims the FAA didn't promptly pay overtime to union members, an oversight the union said is also in violation of regulations.

While the shutdown drags on, maintenance, inspection, training and modernization programs have also been deferred.

""While we are doing the day-to-day tasks there's a lot of things that are falling through the cracks,"" Portland International Airport tower controller Richard Kennington told ABC News. ""There's a lot of insidious stuff that the flying public doesn't see that's not happening.""",164
0,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump's budget director and chief of staff on Sunday said the partial U.S. government shutdown could continue to January 3, when the new Congress convenes and Democrats take over the House of Representatives.

""It's very possible this shutdown will go beyond the 28th and into the new Congress,"" Mick Mulvaney said on Fox News Sunday.

""I don't think things are going to move very quickly here for the next few days"" because of the Christmas holiday, added Mulvaney, who serves as director of the Office of Management and Budget and was named acting White House chief of staff 10 days ago.

The U.S. Senate adjourned on Saturday unable to break an impasse over Trump's demand for more funds for a wall on the border with Mexico that Democrats are unwilling to accept.

Mulvaney said the White House made a ""counteroffer"" to Democrats on funding for border security that falls between the Democratic offer of $1.3 billion and Trump's demand for $5 billion.

As part of those talks on Saturday, Vice President Mike Pence offered to drop the demand for $5 billion for a border wall, substituting instead $2.1 billion, ABC News reported citing unnamed sources.

Mulvaney sought to shift blame for the partial shutdown to Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic nominee for speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, saying she might hold up negotiations to ensure she secures the position.

""I think she's in that unfortunate position of being beholden to her left wing to where she cannot be seen as agreeing with the president on anything until after she is speaker,"" Mulvaney said. ""If that's the case, again, there's a chance we go into the next Congress.""

Financing for about a quarter of federal government programs - including the departments of Homeland Security, Justice and Agriculture - expired at midnight on Friday and will not be renewed until a deal is done.

Federal parks were to close and more than 400,000 federal ""essential"" employees in those agencies will work without pay until the dispute is resolved. Another 380,000 will be ""furloughed"", meaning they are put on temporary leave.

Law enforcement efforts, border patrols, mail delivery and airport operations will keep running.

Building a wall to keep migrants from entering the United States illegally was a central plank of Trump's presidential campaign, but Democrats are vehemently opposed and have rejected his funding request.

Trump reiterated his push for border security on Sunday, saying on Twitter that ""the only way"" to stop drugs, gangs, and human trafficking at the border was with a wall or barrier.

""Drones and all of the rest are wonderful and lots of fun, but it is only a good old fashioned Wall that works!,"" the president said in the tweet.

Earlier in the week, leaders in both the Senate and House of Representatives thought they had reached a deal that Trump would sign that contained less money for border security, only to watch the president, under pressure from conservatives, re-assert his demand for $5 billion at the last minute.

Senator David Perdue, a Republican from Georgia on the Senate Banking Committee, said on Fox News' ""Sunday Morning Futures"" that he thought a deal this week was possible.

""I spoke to the President last night, he wants that,"" Purdue said, adding ""I'm hopeful that cooler heads will prevail and we'll get to some number between $1.6 (billion) and $5 billion on that.""",165
0,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump and congressional leaders were entrenched ahead of a meeting on Friday to try to end a partial U.S. government shutdown over his demand for $5 billion to build a wall on the border with Mexico.

About 800,000 federal workers have been unpaid due to the 2-week-old closure of about a quarter of the federal government as Trump withholds his support for new funding until he secures the money for the wall that he promised to construct during his election campaign.

The wall, Trump has argued, is needed to stem the flow of illegal immigrants and drugs over the border. When he ran for president in 2016, Trump vowed Mexico would pay for the wall, which it has refused to do.

It remained unclear how much progress might be made during Friday's meeting, which was scheduled for 11:30 a.m. EST (1630 GMT) in the White House Situation Room.

It will be the first showdown between Trump and Democrats since they took over the U.S. House of Representatives on Thursday after victories in last November's elections.

""The president isn't going to back off,"" White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders told reporters on Friday morning.

House Speaker Nancy Pelosi sought to separate the issue of the wall and government funding, and called on Trump and his fellow Republicans in the Senate to reopen agencies as border talks continue.

""The wall and the government shutdown really have nothing to do with each other,"" Pelosi, who has rejected any funding for what she has called an ""immoral"" border wall, said at an event hosted by MSNBC.

Steny Hoyer, the No. 2 House Democrat, said Democratic congressional leaders hoped to resolve the shutdown at the meeting. ""I hope we will open up government,"" he told MSNBC in a separate interview.

About 800,000 federal employees have either been furloughed or are working without pay because of the shutdown.

It is showing signs of straining the country's immigration system and has been blamed for worsening backlogs in courts and complicating hiring for employers.

Trump continued to promote the wall in tweets to keep the pressure on Democrats on Thursday even as they gained significant power with their takeover of the House at the start of a new Congress.

PRESSURE ON MCCONNELL

Late on Thursday, the House passed two Democratic bills to immediately reopen government agencies for varying lengths of time, despite a White House veto threat.

Earlier in the day, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican, rejected the House effort saying the president would not sign into law, although the Senate last month approved identical legislation.

But McConnell faces increasing pressure from within his caucus, especially from vulnerable Republicans up for re-election in 2020.

""We should pass a continuing resolution to get the government back open. The Senate has done it last Congress, we should do it again today,"" U.S. Senator Cory Gardner told The Hill on Thursday.

His colleague Susan Collins also called for the Senate to pass the funding bills, while several other Republicans urged an end to the shutdown, the Hill and New York Times reported.

Pelosi on Friday urged McConnell to bring the measures up for a vote. ""The president can sign or not but he should never say, 'I'm not even going to put it on the president's desk,'"" she told MSNBC, noting Congress can pass bills without Trump's support.

Legislation can become law with a veto-proof majority of lawmakers' support or if the president does not sign it or veto it within 10 days.

Vice President Mike Pence, in a television interview Thursday night, suggested that in exchange for the wall, the White House could work with Democrats on so-called Dreamer immigrants who were brought to the United States illegally as children - an idea Trump had rejected on Wednesday.

""It's being talked about,"" Pence told Fox News.

Democrats back other border security measures aside from the wall, and their two-bill package passed Thursday includes $1.3 billion for border fencing and $300 million for other border security items such as technology and cameras.

In a Dec. 11 meeting with Pelosi and Democratic Senate Leader Chuck Schumer, Trump said he would be ""proud"" to shut the government over the security issue and would not blame Democrats. He has since said they are responsible.",166
0,"WASHINGTON - The U.S. Coast Guard saw a nearly fivefold increase in the number of migrants it intercepted off the coast of southern California in 2018, underscoring the challenge that will remain in stopping illegal migration even if President Donald Trump secures funding for his southern border wall.

The numbers, released to The Washington Post in recent days, show the service intercepted 1,022 migrants at sea there in the fiscal year ending Sept. 30. That was up from 213 in 2017 and 142 in 2016.

Nationwide, the number of migrant intercepts at sea dropped from 2,512 in 2017 to 1,668 in 2018, indicating a shift in which more migrants are now intercepted off the West Coast. The majority of migrants taken into custody there come from Central and South America, while migrants caught along the East Coast are more likely to come from Haiti or other islands in the Caribbean Sea.

A Coast Guard spokesman, Chief Warrant Officer 4 Barry Lane, said that the migrants intercepted at sea in 2018 come from numerous countries in the Western Hemisphere, including Mexico, Ecuador, Bolivia, Colombia and Guatemala. Others came from farther away nations that include China, Sri Lanka, India and Jordan, he said.

For years, the Coast Guard intercepted more migrants off the coast of Florida than anywhere else. Those numbers plummeted in 2017, after the Obama administration normalized diplomatic relations with Cuba and ended the so-called wet-foot, dry-foot policy that allowed most Cubans who made the 90-mile trip by sea to pursue legal residency.

The service also intercepted 209,000 kilograms of cocaine at sea in 2018, falling just behind its record grab of 223,843 kilograms in 2017. The majority of those drugs are interdicted by a handful of Coast Guard cutters in the eastern Pacific Ocean, as they meet ships heading from Central and South America.

Intercepts at sea represent a fraction of a much larger trend. Customs and Border Protection reported 415,517 total apprehensions at the southern border in fiscal 2017, and 521,090 more in fiscal in 2018. More than 60,000 migrants were arrested in each of the last three months attempting to enter the country illegally.

But the statistics will still serve as new fodder for advocates of the Coast Guard, whose service members are among the federal employees working without pay amid a partial government shutdown caused by a political dispute over President Trump's proposed southern border wall. Service members are due a pay check on Tuesday, and unlikely to get their money. The shutdown was 24 days old - and the longest in U.S. history - as of Monday.

Although the service is considered a part of the U.S. military, it has no funding because it is part of the Department of Homeland Security. Most other branches of service are part of the Defense Department, which has funding approved.

The shutdown also has threatened the pensions of Coast Guard veterans. Adm. Charles Ray, the service's No. 2 officer, said in an email to retirees on Saturday that there is the ""distinct possibility"" that retiree pay and money for the Survivor's Benefit Plan, an insurance policy for the surviving spouses of Coast Guard veterans, may be delayed if the shutdown continues into late January.

""Please be assured that we are continuing to work closely with the Department of Homeland Security, the Administration, and Congress to reduce the impacts of this funding lapse on our Coast Guard workforce - past and present - and I will keep you informed as additional information becomes available,"" Ray wrote.

The shutdown has put other strains on the service, as Trump seeks funding for the wall. The president has promised to fund new polar icebreaker ships for the Coast Guard, but funding for them is no longer a certainty. A Senate appropriations bill passed last year included $750 million for the first ship, but the House version did not include the money. It is not clear whether the money will be included if a spending bill makes it to the White House.

The Coast Guard commandant, Adm. Karl Schultz, has posted a series of social-media messages in recent days as he seeks to reassure the force.

""While our Coast Guard workforce is deployed, there are loved ones at home reviewing family finances, researching how to get support, and weighing childcare options - they are holding down the fort,"" he wrote Sunday on Facebook. ""Please know that we are doing everything we can to support and advocate for you while your loved one stands the watch. You have not, and will not, be forgotten.""",167

But the White House has rejected that package, and Trump said ahead of the session with the congressional leaders that the partial shutdown will last ""as long as it takes"" to get the funding he wants.

""We spend in Afghanistan more in one month than what we're talking about for the wall,"" Trump added. ""The $5.6 billion is such a small number, literally, it's one month in Afghanistan, and we're talking about national security. This isn't just a border, this is national security.""

AGENCIES HOBBLED

Democratic Representative Lucille Roybal-Allard, speaking to reporters late on Thursday, argued that funding a border wall, which ultimately could cost more than $24 billion, would hamper other, more important national security protections.

She noted that more federal law enforcement agents were needed to intercept illegal opioids and other ""contraband"" moving through U.S. ports of entry. She added more money was needed for the Coast Guard to beef up the U.S. presence in the Arctic at a time when Russia and China increasingly were on the prowl for that region's natural resources.

Without a deal to end the partial government shutdown, the Department of Homeland Security will not be able to bring some furloughed workers back to their jobs while others continue to be forced to work without paychecks for the time being.

An array of other federal agencies are similarly hobbled, including the Justice Department, Commerce Department and departments of Agriculture, Labor, Interior and Treasury.

Visitors to Smithsonian museums, among Washington's most popular tourist attractions, were being turned away during the shutdown, as were visitors to many of the nation's federal parks.

A showdown between Trump and Congressional Democrats over funding for his wall project has led to a two-week government shutdown. Trump says he will not support a bill to fully fund the government until he secures the money for the wall.

Asked whether he had considered declaring a national emergency to build the wall, Trump said: ""Yes, I have. ... We can do it. I haven't done it. I may do it ... But we can call a national emergency and build it very quickly.""

The comments come just a day after Democrats, led by Nancy Pelosi, took charge of the House, ushering in an era of divided government two years into Trump's term.

In sometimes combative talks on Friday, Trump, Pelosi and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer failed to strike a deal to end the partial shutdown as they fought over Trump's request for $5 billion to fund the wall.

The US Constitution assigns Congress the power over funding the federal government, so Trump would likely face legal challenges if he tried to bypass Congress on financing the wall.

He dismissed those concerns in a news briefing at the White House.

""We can call a national emergency because of the security of our country, absolutely,"" he said. Asked if declaring a national emergency was a threat hanging over Democrats, Trump said, ""I'd never threatened anybody, but I am allowed to do that, yes.""

Federal agencies such as the Justice Department, Commerce Department and departments of Agriculture, Labor, Interior and Treasury have been hit by the shutdown.

The President is seeking USD 5.2 billion in funding for the wall which according to him is a must to prevent flow of illegal immigrants into the US.

The Democrats assert that such a move is a ""waste"" of taxpayers' money.

Following their inconclusive Situation Room meeting, Congressional leaders and Trump agreed to meet again on Friday.

Newly elected members of the Congress are scheduled to be sworn in Thursday; the first day of the 116th Congress. Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi is all set to be elected as the Speaker of the US House of Representatives.

Pelosi told reporters at the White House after the meeting that she plans to go ahead with the Democratic legislation on a spending bill without funding for a border wall. Beginning Thursday, Democrats would enjoy majority in the House of Representatives.

""We are asking the president to open up the government. We are giving him a Republican path to do that. Why would he not do it?"" Pelosi told reporters at the White House.

""Democrats have been committed to protecting our borders. It's the oath of office we take to protect and defend. It has been very important to us, and we have committed resources to it when we were in the majority, and will continue to do so,"" she said.

""The only reason that they are shutting down the government is very simple. They want to try and leverage that shutdown into their proposals on border security. We want strong border security. We believe ours our better. But to use the shutdown as hostage, which they had no argument against, is wrong,"" Schumer said.

WASHINGTON - President Donald Trump threatened to keep the US government partially shut for months or years on Friday after he and Democratic leaders failed to resolve their dispute over Trump's request for US$5.6 billion to build a wall on the Mexican border.

After Democratic congressional leaders refused Trump's requests at a meeting in the White House Situation Room, the Republican president threatened to take the controversial step of declaring a national emergency and building the wall without congressional approval.

Trump is withholding his support for a bill that would fully fund the government until he secures money for the wall. As a result, around 800,000 public workers have been unpaid, with about a quarter of the federal government closed for two weeks.

Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said Democrats had told Trump during the meeting to end the shutdown. ""He resisted,"" Schumer said. ""In fact, he said he'd keep the government closed for a very long period of time, months or even years.""

Trump confirmed that comment but painted a more positive picture of the meeting, the first since a new era of divided government began when Democrats took control of the House of Representatives on Thursday.

""We had a very, very productive meeting, and we've come a long way,"" Trump said.

According to a source familiar with the White House discussion, Trump opened the meeting with a speech that lasted at least 15 minutes in which he insisted on the need for billions of dollars to fund a border wall.

The source also said Trump brought up recent impeachment threats during those remarks, arguing that he had notched a strong performance as president and should not be a target for impeachment.

The president later told reporters that Nancy Pelosi, the new Democratic speaker of the House of Representatives, said Democrats were not looking to impeach him.

NATIONAL EMERGENCY?

Raising the stakes in his tussle with the newly emboldened Democrats, Trump threatened extraordinary measures to build the wall, which he says is needed to stem the flow of illegal immigrants and drugs into the United States.

A reporter asked Trump whether he had considered declaring a national emergency to build the wall.

""Yes, I have. And I can do it if I want,"" Trump said. ""We can call a national emergency because of the security of our country ... I may do it. But we can call a national emergency and build it very quickly. And it's another way of doing it. But if we can do it through a negotiated process, we're giving that a shot.""

Emergency powers have been invoked by previous US presidents during times of war.

Democrats have called the border wall immoral, ineffective and medieval

Senator Jack Reed, the senior Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, criticized the comments, saying in a statement, ""Declaring a trumped up national emergency in order to skirt congressional approval is wrong.""

The US Constitution assigns Congress the power to fund the federal government, so Trump likely would face legal challenges if he tried to bypass Congress on financing the wall. Building a wall - and having Mexico pay for it - was one of Trump's main promises when he ran for president in 2016.

Trump's wall project is estimated to cost about US$23 billion.

0,"WASHINGTON, Jan 4 -- As a partial US government shutdown hit the two-week mark, President Donald Trump and congressional leaders prepared to meet today over ways to break an impasse pitting his demand for building a border wall against Democrats' call for alternative security measures.

About 800,000 federal workers have been affected by the December 22 closure of about one-quarter of the federal government as Trump withheld his support for new funding until he secures US$5 billion (RM20.6 billion) to start building the wall along the US-Mexico border that he promised during his campaign.

Such a wall, he has argued, is needed to stem the flow of illegal immigrants and drugs over the southwestern border. When he ran for president in 2016, he vowed Mexico would pay for the wall, which it has refused to do.

Yesterday, Trump tried to keep the pressure on Democrats, even as they gained significant new power with their takeover of the House of Representatives at the start of a new Congress.

""Build the Wall,"" the Republican president demanded on Twitter. In remarks to reporters that same day, Trump said: ""You can call it a barrier. You can call it whatever you want. But essentially, we need protection in our country.""

As Trump dug in, so did opposition Democrats, leaving many to wonder just how much progress might be made during today's White House meeting scheduled for 11.30am (1630 GMT).

""We're not doing a wall,"" Democrat Nancy Pelosi said late yesterday, several hours after she was sworn in as the new speaker of the House of Representatives.

""It has nothing to do with politics. It has to do with a wall is an immorality between countries. It's an old way of thinking. It isn't cost effective,"" Pelosi added.

Late yesterday, the House passed two Democratic bills to immediately reopen government agencies for varying lengths of time, despite a White House veto threat.

Earlier in the day, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican, labelled the House effort ""political theatre, not productive lawmaking,"" that the president would not sign into law, although the Senate last month approved identical legislation.

But McConnell faces increasing pressure from within his caucus, especially from vulnerable Republicans up for re-election in 2020, as several conservative senators urged action to reopen the government, according to media reports.

""We should pass a continuing resolution to get the government back open. The Senate has done it last Congress, we should do it again today,"" US Senator Cory Gardner told The Hill yesterday. His colleague Susan Collins also called for the Senate to pass the funding bills, while several other Republicans also urged an end to the shutdown, the Hill and the New York Times reported.

Vice-president Mike Pence, in a television interview yesterday night, also suggested that in exchange for the wall, the White House could work with Democrats on so-called Dreamer immigrants who were brought to the United States illegally as children -- an idea Trump had rejected on Wednesday.

""It's being talked about,"" Pence told Fox News.

Democrats back other border security measures aside from the wall, and their two-bill package passed yesterday includes US$1.3 billion for border fencing and US$300 million for other border security items such as technology and cameras.

Without a deal to end the partial government shutdown, the Department of Homeland Security will not be able to bring some furloughed workers back to their jobs while others continue to be forced to work without paychecks for the time being.

Other federal agencies were also hobbled, including the Justice Department, Commerce Department and departments of Agriculture, Labour, Interior and Treasury.

Additionally, the partial shutdown was straining the country's immigration system, worsening backlogs in courts and complicating hiring for employers.

0,"The government shutdown is about distracting the population from Trump's failures, it also about ultimately furthering Bannon's agenda to bring the US government crashing down.

In worrying about what it will take to end the latest showdown over funding the U.S. Government, many Democrats and Republicans are missing the point. Since Donald Trump's core supporters hate non-white immigrants and they see the federal government as the enemy, they win whether he gets the money for his border wall or the government remains partially shut down.

Trump's candidacy and presidency have tapped into a spiralling insurgency within the right wing of American politics, in which shutting down the government is an end in itself. As this movement has begun trending globally, it's worth considering just how far it will reach.

At this moment, in addition to the shutdown of significant daily functions of government, the United States has no permanent White House chief of staff, defence secretary, or attorney general. And it has announced a significant withdrawal of forces from Syria and Afghanistan, absent any coordination with international partners, rivals, or local leadership on the ground.

There is no single explanation for President Trump's pronouncements and policies as President, just as there is no single reason he got elected.

Nor is there only one factor behind the United Kingdom's Brexit or Marine Le Pen's strong showing in last year's French elections -- and the latest eruption of ""yellow vest"" protests.

One growing aphorism of history is that we should believe politicians when they advertise their goals, especially when they are dystopian. As we prepare to conclude the first two years of Donald Trump's administration, it's worth revisiting what his former chief strategist Steve Bannon told a Daily Beast reporter back in 2013:

""Lenin wanted to destroy the state, and that's my goal too. I want to bring everything crashing down, and destroy all of today's establishment.""

Republicans have long appealed to business interests by calling for ""small government"". Although the business community may not welcome the more destructive impulses of Bannon's agenda, they saw Trump as a way to get the historically ""pro-business"" Republican Party back into the White House. Like many enablers of previous revolutions (e.g., Russia, Iran), they still hope they can distract or restrain the true believers.

The second holiday season in a row with a government shutdown over immigration issues. And each time, it has been President Trump who forced the shutdown. Business has not been pleased with this turmoil or with the President's attacks on the Federal Reserve, or his new trade war with China, and so on. But the 2018 tax cut netted them and their companies hundreds of billions in extra cash and stock buybacks.

Since leaving his White House perch, Bannon has been touring the European Union (EU) to rally support for the local nationalisms and phobias of every destination -- from London to Paris to Rome, to Budapest and Prague -- with an eye to the 2019 European Parliament elections.

Russian President Vladimir Putin has also been helping out right-wing anti-EU politicians, mostly behind the scenes, in France, the Netherlands, and most successfully in the EU-busting United Kingdom.

Since a defiant Russia cannot leverage the current system to its abiding benefit, Putin has good reason to weaken or even derail the EU, NATO, and the good faith and credit of the post-World War II global order.

Back in the United States, Bannon did not somehow force his ideology on Mr. Trump. He found a ready and receptive audience.

Trump was proud to impose a shutdown of ""non-essential"" government agencies -- with or without his border wall -- because he knows his base supports both. What could be more fundamental than a great wall to defending the nativist conception of national interests? And what could be more appealing to a base that sees federal employees as the enemy than defunding and dismantling the government?

Despite his intentionally reckless approach to government and global stability, Trump could not have been President, along with control over both chambers of Congress these past two years, without major support from the normally cautious business community.

In the 1987 film ""Wall Street"", fictional corporate raider Gordon Gekko publicly proclaims, ""Greed is good!"".

In the 1980s, aggravating the Vietnam and Watergate upheavals, U.S. President Ronald Reagan challenged Americans to vote on the basis of their own economic interests -- effectively reversing John F. Kennedy's ""ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your county.""

As faith in the social contract has continued to erode, the moneyed classes have enjoyed the fruits of widening income and wealth gaps. Even as national debt grows, the top 10 percent are realising ever higher profits and tax cuts.

For those still extolling the ""Wall Street"" ethos, government shutdowns are a dress rehearsal for deregulation, reduced social services, and lax oversight. In recent years, the budget for the Internal Revenue Service -- which collects federal taxes -- has been cut significantly. This means less government spending, and less enforcement, which is welcome news for those looking to weaken the government for ideological or financial gain.

Where the government does spend, billions of dollars are being farmed out to private prisons for criminals and immigration detainees, private health care for military veterans, and private contractors for securing Afghanistan and other hotspots. This both enriches well-connected insiders like Elliott Broidy -- who has gained notoriety as a target in the ongoing Mueller investigation -- and it weakens the oversight and effectiveness of the federal system.

For Americans and others who think disrupting the system is good, it is worth considering just how much depends on that system. Beyond the money, it's what keeps countries from invading their neighbours. It keeps criminal enterprises from taking over the functions of government. It protects the free exercise of religion. It facilitates international tracking and interdiction of illegal drugs and terrorist financing. It secures international shipping lanes and multilateral trade. And it shores up national currencies when politicians and corporate leaders make the wrong bets.

At any rate, it would be a grave error to see Trump as gambling with the government to achieve his policy goals. It's not a gamble if he's equally happy to lose.",180
0,"US President Donald Trump says government shutdown will continue unless he secures the desired funding for building a border wall with Mexico.

Speaking after a Christmas Day video message on Tuesday, Trump insisted that the partial shutdown of the federal government would last until his demand for funds to build a wall on the US-Mexico border was met.

""I can't tell you when the government is going to be open,"" he said. ""I can tell you, it's not going to be open until we have a wall, a fence, whatever they'd like to call it. I'll call it whatever they want ... If you don't have that [wall], then we're just not opening.""

Trump expressed hope that the wall would be completed by the next presidential election in 2020, also announcing plans to go to the border in January to visit a new stretch of wall.

""It's my hope to have this done, completed -- all 500 to 550 miles -- to have it either renovated or brand new by election time, It's going to be built, hopefully rapidly,"" he said. ""I'm going there at the end of January for the start of construction. That's a big stretch.""

Trump also claimed, without providing evidence, that federal employees on furlough or working without pay understand his demand for a border wall and support him in his mission.

""I think they understand what's happening,"" he said. ""They want border security. The people of this country want border security.""

The remarks were made as the shutdown over budget spending is in its fourth day after Democratic lawmakers resisted Trump's demand for a five billion-dollar border wall funding. Nine of the 15 federal departments, including State, Homeland Security, Transportation, Agriculture and Justice are partially closed.

The shutdown has exacerbated the year-end chaos in Washington as well as the downfall of stock markets, amid the ouster of Defense Secretary James Mattis and troop withdrawals from Syria and Afghanistan and the Russia investigation.

A day earlier, top Democrats had blasted the US president for ""plunging the country into chaos"" after shutting down parts of the government during Christmas time.

""It's Christmas Eve and President Trump is plunging the country into chaos,"" the two top Democrats in Congress, the House speaker nominee, Nancy Pelosi, and Senate minority leader, Chuck Schumer, wrote in a joint statement on Monday.

""The stock market is tanking and the president is waging a personal war on the Federal Reserve - after he just fired the Secretary of Defense,"" they noted.

Schumer on Saturday said Trump ""must abandon the wall, plain and simple"" for the government to reopen.

Hundreds of thousands of federal employees are working unpaid or have gone on temporary leave during the partial shutdown. A deal to end the funding dispute appears to be a distant prospect as Congress adjourned on the weekend for Christmas.

Building the wall was one of Trump's most frequently repeated campaign promises, but Democrats are vehemently opposed to it.

The Republican president has vowed to crack down on immigration, in part by building a wall on the border with Mexico, but has failed to get his complete agenda through so far.

0,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump said on Friday he could use emergency powers to build a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border without Congress' approval, threatening to bypass Democratic lawmakers emboldened by their recent takeover of the House of Representatives.

A showdown between Trump and Congressional Democrats over funding for his wall project has led to a two-week government shutdown. Trump says he will not support a bill to fully fund the government until he secures the money for the wall.

Asked whether he had considered declaring a national emergency to build the wall, Trump said: ""Yes, I have. ... We can do it. I haven't done it. I may do it ... But we can call a national emergency and build it very quickly.""

The comments come just a day after Democrats, led by Nancy Pelosi, took charge of the House, ushering in an era of divided government two years into Trump's term.

In sometimes combative talks on Friday, Trump, Pelosi and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer failed to strike a deal to end the partial shutdown as they fought over Trump's request for $5 billion to fund the wall.

The U.S. Constitution assigns Congress the power over funding the federal government, so Trump would likely face legal challenges if he tried to bypass Congress on financing the wall.

He dismissed those concerns in a news briefing at the White House.

0,"WASHINGTON, Jan 5 -- President Donald Trump and senior Democrats failed to strike a deal in talks yesterday to end a partial shutdown of the US government as they again fought over Trump's request for over US$5 billion (RM20.6 billion) to fund his signature wall on the Mexican border.

After Democratic congressional leaders turned Trump down at a meeting in the White House Situation Room, the Republican president threatened to take the controversial step of using emergency powers to build the wall without approval from Congress.

Trump is withholding his support for a bill that would fully fund the government until he secures the money for the wall. As a result around 800,000 public workers have been unpaid, with about a quarter of the federal government closed for two weeks.

Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer said Democrats had told Trump during the meeting to end the shutdown. ""He resisted,"" Schumer said. ""In fact, he said he'd keep the government closed for a very long period of time, months or even years.""

Trump confirmed that comment but painted a more positive picture of the meeting, the first since a new era of divided government began when Democrats took control of the House of Representatives on Thursday.

""We had a very, very productive meeting, and we've come a long way,"" Trump said.

According to a source familiar with the White House discussion, Trump opened the meeting with a speech that lasted at least 15 minutes in which he insisted on the need for US$5.6 billion for a border wall.

The source also said Trump brought up recent impeachment threats during those remarks, arguing that he had notched a strong performance as president and should not be a target for impeachment.

National emergency?

Raising the stakes in his tussle with the newly emboldened Democrats, Trump threatened extraordinary measures to build the wall, which he says is needed to stem the flow of illegal immigrants and drugs into the United States.

Asked by a reporter whether he had considered declaring a national emergency to build the wall, Trump said: ""Yes, I have ... I may do it ... we can call a national emergency and build it very quickly.""

He said he could declare a national emergency ""because of the security of our country, absolutely.""

Senator Jack Reed, the senior Democrat on the Senate Armed Services Committee, criticised the comments, saying in a statement, ""Declaring a trumped up national emergency in order to skirt congressional approval is wrong.""

The US Constitution assigns Congress the power over funding the federal government so Trump likely would face legal challenges if he tried to bypass Congress on financing the wall. Building a wall -- and having Mexico pay for it -- was one of Trump's main promises when he ran for president in 2016.

Trump's wall project is estimated to cost about US$23 billion.

Democrats have called the wall immoral, ineffective and medieval.

Nancy Pelosi, the newly elected Democratic speaker of the House, said yesterday's meeting with Trump was ""sometimes contentious"" but that they agreed to continue talking.

""But we recognise on the Democratic side that we really cannot resolve this until we open up government and we made that very clear to the president,"" she said.

Credit rating agency Moody's says the shutdown will cause minimal US economic and credit market disruption but there could be a more severe impact on financial markets and the broad economy if the closure is protracted.

A Reuters/Ipsos opinion poll last week showed that 50 per cent of the public blame Trump for the shutdown and 7 per cent blame Republican lawmakers, while 32 per cent blame Democrats.

In a December 11 meeting with Pelosi and Schumer, Trump said he would be ""proud"" to shut the government over the security issue and would not blame Democrats. He has since said they are responsible.

Administration officials and congressional staffers are set to meet today to try to end the impasse, the White House said.

House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy told reporters that Trump had named Vice President Mike Pence, senior aide Jared Kushner and Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen to work over the weekend.

The partial shutdown is straining the country's immigration system, worsening backlogs in courts and complicating hiring for employers.

Federal agencies such as the Justice Department, Commerce Department and departments of Agriculture, Labour, Interior and Treasury have been hit by the shutdown.

A showdown between Trump and Congressional Democrats over funding for his wall project has led to a two-week government shutdown. Trump says he will not support a bill to fully fund the government until he secures the money for the wall.

Asked whether he had considered declaring a national emergency to build the wall, Trump said: ""Yes, I have. ... We can do it. I haven't done it. I may do it ... But we can call a national emergency and build it very quickly.""

The comments come just a day after Democrats, led by Nancy Pelosi, took charge of the House, ushering in an era of divided government two years into Trump's term.

In sometimes combative talks on Friday, Trump, Pelosi and Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer failed to strike a deal to end the partial shutdown as they fought over Trump's request for $5 billion to fund the wall.

0,"WASHINGTON (Reuters) - As a partial U.S. government shutdown hit the two-week mark, President Donald Trump and congressional leaders were scheduled on Friday to discuss ways to break an impasse pitting his demand for building a border wall against Democrats' call for alternative security measures.

About 800,000 federal workers have been affected by the Dec. 22 closure of about one-quarter of the federal government as Trump withheld his support for new funding until he secures $5 billion to start building the wall along the U.S.-Mexico border that he promised during his campaign.

Such a wall, he has argued, is needed to stem the flow of illegal immigrants and drugs over the southwestern border. When he ran for president in 2016, he vowed Mexico would pay for the wall, which it has refused to do.

On Thursday, Trump tried to keep the pressure on Democrats, even as they gained significant new power with their takeover of the House of Representatives at the start of a new Congress.

""Build the Wall,"" the Republican president demanded on Twitter. In remarks to reporters that same day, Trump said: ""You can call it a barrier. You can call it whatever you want. But essentially, we need protection in our country.""

As Trump dug in, so did opposition Democrats, leaving many to wonder just how much progress might be made during Friday's White House meeting scheduled for 11:30 a.m. (1630 GMT).

""We're not doing a wall,"" Democrat Nancy Pelosi said late on Thursday, several hours after she was sworn in as the new speaker of the House of Representatives.

""It has nothing to do with politics. It has to do with a wall is an immorality between countries. It's an old way of thinking. It isn't cost effective,"" Pelosi added.

Late on Thursday, the House passed two Democratic bills to immediately reopen government agencies for varying lengths of time, despite a White House veto threat. Earlier in the day, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican, labeled the House effort ""political theater, not productive lawmaking,"" even though the Senate last month approved identical legislation.

AGENCIES HOBBLED

Democratic Representative Lucille Roybal-Allard, speaking to reporters late on Thursday, argued that funding a border wall, which ultimately could cost more than $24 billion, would hamper other, more important national security protections.

She noted that more federal law enforcement agents were needed to intercept illegal opioids and other ""contraband"" moving through U.S. ports of entry. She added more money was needed for the Coast Guard to beef up the U.S. presence in the Arctic at a time when Russia and China increasingly were on the prowl for that region's natural resources.

Without a deal to end the partial government shutdown, the Department of Homeland Security will not be able to bring some furloughed workers back to their jobs while others continue to be forced to work without paychecks for the time being.

An array of other federal agencies are similarly hobbled, including the Justice Department, Commerce Department and departments of Agriculture, Labor, Interior and Treasury.

0,"The United States President Donald Trump's budget director and chief of staff on Sunday said the partial US government shutdown could continue to January 3, when the new Congress convenes and Democrats take over the House of Representatives.

""It's very possible this shutdown will go beyond (December) the 28th and into the new Congress,"" Mick Mulvaney said on Fox News Sunday.

""I don't think things are going to move very quickly here for the next few days"" because of the Christmas holiday, added Mulvaney, who serves as director of the Office of Management and Budget and was named acting White House chief of staff 10 days ago.

The U.S. Senate adjourned on Saturday, unable to break an impasse over Trump's demand for more funds for a wall on the border with Mexico that Democrats are unwilling to accept.

Mulvaney said the White House made a ""counter-offer"" to Democrats on funding for border security that fell between the Democratic offer of $1.3 billion and Trump's demand for $5 billion.

As part of those talks on Saturday, Vice President Mike Pence offered to drop the demand for $5 billion for a border wall, substituting instead $2.1 billion, ABC News reported, citing unnamed sources.

A Democratic source familiar with the negotiations said real discussions have been happening between Democratic lawmakers and Republican Senator Richard Shelby, the chairman of the Appropriations Committee, who has been talking to the White House. It was unclear what Democrats had offered.

Mulvaney sought to shift blame for the partial shutdown to Nancy Pelosi, the Democratic nominee for speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives, saying she might hold up negotiations to ensure she secures the position.

""I think she's in that unfortunate position of being beholden to her left wing to where she cannot be seen as agreeing with the president on anything until after she is speaker,"" Mulvaney said. ""If that's the case, again, there's a chance we go into the next Congress.""

Pelosi spokesman Drew Hammill disputed that account, saying in a statement: ""As Mr. Mulvaney well knows, House Democrats are united in their opposition to the President's immoral, expensive and ineffective wall.""

The White House should ""stop the posturing and start serious bipartisan talks,"" Hammill said.

Financing for about a quarter of federal government programs - including the departments of Homeland Security, Justice and Agriculture - expired at midnight on Friday. More than 400,000 ""essential"" employees in those agencies will work without pay until the dispute is resolved. Another 380,000 will be ""furloughed,"" meaning they are put on temporary leave.

Law enforcement efforts, border patrols, mail delivery and airport operations will keep running.

Building a wall to try to prevent migrants from entering the United States illegally was a central plank of Trump's presidential campaign, but Democrats are vehemently opposed and have rejected his funding request.

Trump reiterated his push for border security on Sunday, saying on Twitter that ""the only way"" to stop drugs, gangs, and human trafficking at the border was with a wall or barrier.

""Drones and all of the rest are wonderful and lots of fun, but it is only a good old fashioned Wall that works!,"" the president said in the tweet.

Senator David Perdue, a Republican from Georgia on the Senate Banking Committee, said on Fox News' ""Sunday Morning Futures"" that he thought a deal this week was possible.

""I spoke to the president last night, he wants that,"" Purdue said, adding: ""I'm hopeful that cooler heads will prevail and we'll get to some number between $1.6 (billion) and $5 billion on that.""",191
